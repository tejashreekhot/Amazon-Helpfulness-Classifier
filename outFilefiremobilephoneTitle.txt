I wanted to love you
Would not buy again...
Ok first try but there are better options out there, feels overpriced.
Ongoing Review of Amazon Fire Phone.  Good for Prime user!  May need bit more better price to convince non Prime user to buy
Extremely Sad and Dissatisfied
TERRIBLE!
Too many Cons to out weigh the Pros, unless you really need a new phone and shop on Amazon daily.
WARNING! Preloaded app My AT&T; is shockingly invasive!
Initially I hated it and was going to return it BUT.....
Fire Phone Review, One Month After Purchase
Two week review UPDATED AFTER 2 MONTHS
Not Ready for Prime Time
Will wait to see if thext one is better.
Think Different!
Really wanted to like this phone, NEW PRICE IS A STEAL!

Decided to return it!
Great Phone, IMO Better than iPhone!
This Phone Has Grown On Me  :-)
A review from a Fire phone owner who already has Prime (Honesty without gushing, I promise)
What a crappy phone!
DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO BUY THIS PHONE.
Fire Phone Is a Smart phone Nightmare.......Money Sucking pit
Really Tested my patience
I love Amazon products
If you use a kindle fire get a fire phone!
Long-time Amazon Fan -- but Disappointed
I love this phone
Love the Fire Phone!!!
The Fire Phone is Really HOT (and I Don't Mean in a Good Way)
Very disappointed.
Amazon Fire Phone - 5 stars!
To all the hypocritical and (apparently sockpuppet) environmentalists...
Great phone!
Gave up the iPhone and now I'm on Fire, baby!
At $450 ($350 w/ prime) this is an excellent value
Needs improvement - updated review
Outside Dynamic Perspective it's Just an Average Smartphone
Good phone, good price, dumb reviews.
Recommend you give it a chance. It's a great device!
I was happy with this phone even at the old price
Great phone I am not sure what everyone else's problem is
Ex iPhone and Galaxy user. So Happy I purchased this phone!
What a bunch of wackaloos
Amazon redeemed themselves to me today!
Good visual display, needs more apps
Five stars are for what it can be, not what it is.
The best FREE phone ever.  Great for power business use.
Great Phone!
It's a good phone!
Happy with my purchase
You Will Love It!
Fast, works with Ford SYNC, loads of features, smooth transfer from old Galaxy, loving it! UPDATE Sept
Great, especially for the Kindle Fire user.
Perfect phone for those who are Amazon-centric
Has potential but needs some tweeks.
Judge for yourself.
Fantastic Device, if you do your research!
Fire Phone is Awesome!
Don't buy it!
feel good, not cheap
I am very happy with my Amazon Fire phone
Great 5 Star Phone! Take The Poor Reviews With A Grain Of Salt!
Steer clear - doesn't live up to hype unless you simply want to spend more money with Amazon
Very pleased
A nice phone for normal people
Pleasantly surprised!
former iPhone user, satisfied with the Fire phone
Confession of an ex-iphone user

Although I put only four stars, it's closer to five: like 4.62.
