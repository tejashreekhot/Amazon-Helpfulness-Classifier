Sebastian Rudd, easy to like and easy to hate...
Really Flat and Contrived
Lincoln Lawyer Clone
A solid Grisham novel and quick read

Cool Character I'd Like to See Again
Being Legally Principled Leads Sebastian Rudd into a Fugitive Existence

More cynical about the Judicial System than I would like but a good read in the end.
John Grisham?
Not his normal brilliance
A Brilliant Social Commentary
Great legal adventure!
Not his best novel, but interesting
Interesting commentary about the seedier side of justice

A huge change for Grisham
Bordering on don't bother
Good but not as great as other Grisham novels
Far From His Best Legal Book
