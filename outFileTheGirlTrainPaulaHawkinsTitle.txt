Best Hitchcock style mystery of voyeuristic observation since Rear Window.
ALCOHOLIC AMNESIA
The Gillian Flynn comparisons are utterly accurate.
It gets thin and annoying by the end
Character development with the insight and understanding of human nature you find in fantasy books for 12 years olds.
Don't Go There!
This is a Must Read.
No Reading Pleasure
Your money and your time
Hitchcock? I think not
Waste of time
A NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW MADE ME DO IT
Poorly written, simple predictable plot
The girl on th e train.
If you couldn't stand Gone Girl, don't read this either
Not "likeable"?!
Terrible
Such a disappointment.
Her self-destructive behavior becomes repetitious and boring. The ending is predictable and unoriginal
the worst kind of female
Uniquely Structured Suspense Novel
TURN OF THE CORKSCREW
Doesn't live up to the hype
Really?
"I wait for the memory to come..."
Take a different  train!
Craving A Good Thriller? Look Elsewhere!

Ultimately Disappointing
This train got derailed!
THOUGH I RARELY BAIL OUT EARLY ON A BOOK, THIS ONE GAVE ME NO CHOICE. A DUD.
Waste of money and waste of time
Psychological?  Thriller?  Bestseller?  Seriously?
