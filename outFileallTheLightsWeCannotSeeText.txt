It has been a while since I have found a book that I wanted to read slowly so that I could soak in every detail in hopes that the last page seems to never come.<br/><br/>When reading the synopsis of this novel, I never imagined that I would feel so connected to a book where one of the main characters is blind and the other a brilliant young German orphan who was chosen to attend a brutal military academy under Hitler's power using his innate engineering skills.<br/><br/>This novel was so much more than the above states.  The idiosyncrasies of each individual character are so well defined and expressed in such ways that come across the page almost lyrically.  I was invited into the pages and could not only imagine the atmosphere, but all of my senses were collectively enticed from the very first page until the last.<br/><br/>I was so amazed with the way that the author was able to heighten all my senses in a way that I felt like I knew what it was like to be blind.  In most well-written books you get of a sense of what the characters look like and follow them throughout the book almost as if you are on a voyage, but with this novel, I could imagine what it was like to be in Marie-Laure's shoes.  The descriptives were so beautifully intricate that I could imagine the atmosphere through touch and sound.  It was amazing, really.<br/><br/>There were so many different aspects of the book that are lived out in separate moments and in different countries that find a way to unite in the end.  What impressed me most was that I could have never predicted the outcome.  It was as though all cliches were off the table and real life was set in motion.  Life outside of books can be very messy and the author stayed true to life but in a magical and symbolic way.<br/><br/>I have said in other reviews that just when I think that I have read my last book centered around the Second World War, another seems to pop up.  I should emphasize that this book created an image of war in a way that I have never imagined before.  I truly got a sense of what it must have been like for children who lived a happy life and then suddenly were on curfew and barely had food to eat.  It also showed the side of young children who are basically brainwashed by Nazi leaders and made into animals who seem to make choices that they normally wouldn't in order to survive.  And by survive, I mean dodging severe abuse by their own colleagues.<br/><br/>This book may haunt me for some time.  I can't express enough how beautifully written the pages are.  I highly recommend this read as it is my favorite so far for 2014.
ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is one of the best books you’ll read this year. On one hand, the title implies the lessons learned by a young German orphan boy about radio waves. On the other hand, as the author describes it, “It’s also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within World War II.” Add in a newly blinded French girl who is forced to leave her familiar surroundings, and you’ll soon find yourself in literary heaven.<br/><br/>The layered meanings run deep in this book. No wonder nearly every advanced review uses the word “intricate” to describe this masterpiece. The German boy and his sister discover an old radio, where they hear science lessons from afar. There are lessons about the brain, sitting inside the darkness of our skull, interpreting light; there are lessons about coal having been plants living millions of years ago, absorbing light, now buried in darkness; lessons about light waves that we cannot see—all applicable as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>Readers will appreciate the short, almost lyrical chapters of alternating characters. The author helps by italicizing earlier mentioned quotes and then leaving almost every chapter closing with a message to ponder. Take for example: “a real diamond is never perfect”, “open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever”, and “the entropy of a closed system never decreases”. All of this is explained in a natural way, but never given out in an assuming manner. The story flows and draws your heart into its deep meaning.<br/><br/>Having personal connections to both veterans of World War II and members of the blind community, I can attest to the authenticity of this story’s writing. Author Anthony Doerr brings out lovely characters, along with their own fascinations: seashell collecting, bird watching, locksmithing, electronics, and geology. The history surrounding these personal stories is real and deep. You will fall in love.<br/><br/>The author also includes connections to the song Clair de Lune, the book 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, and a fictional story about a priceless diamond called the Sea of Flames, whose owner “so long as he keeps it, the keeper of the stone will live forever.”<br/><br/>I cannot proclaim loud enough how much this book means to me; I have been left awe-inspired. So, thank you to Scribner for making this book available for me to review. It has been an honor.
Set in World War II France and Germany, All the Light We Cannot See is my favorite kind of novel: long, rich, populated by a range of imperfect characters, some who try to transcend that imperfection, others who cannot see it.<br/><br/>The cast of characters includes Marie-Laure, blind since age six, with a quick mind and a great deal of self-confidence; her father, locksmith for the Museum of Natural History in Paris; Marie-Laure’s great-uncle, an agoraphobic haunted by ghosts since he returned from World War I; the great-uncle’s elderly housekeeper, who finds the courage to join the French resistance; Werner, a German orphan who is a prodigy in the creation and repair of radios; Werner’s sister Jutta, left behind when Werner is accepted into a science academy for Hitler Youth that offers more political indoctrination than science; and a whole host of others.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr brings this wide assembly of individuals to life, moving among them, slowly drawing them nearer one another, fleshing each of them out so that even those we might expect to be stereotypes are much more multifaceted.<br/><br/>And among these multifaceted characters lies a multifaceted stone: a diamond with a legendary history. In less able hands, the diamond would have dominated this story, which would have degenerated into a variation on Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it’s the characters who are the heart of All the Light We Cannot See. There are a few we hate, but for the most part, we can’t help but see the better parts of them. The question is whether they will discover these better selves in time to make a difference of some sort in a world quite literally in flames.<br/><br/>I’m hesitant to provide more summary. Reading this book, meeting the people in it, sharing their journeys, is an engrossing experience that shouldn’t be undercut by foreknowledge. All the Light We Cannot See contains a great deal of action, but that action is more than balanced by the development of characters we witness over the decade or so that this novel encompasses. This is novel of people more than it is a novel of events.<br/><br/>I received and electronic ARC of this book to review and find myself longing for its release date so I can get a paper copy, one that will feel as solid in my hands as Doerr’s narrative. We’re less than halfway through the year, but it wouldn’t surprise me at all if in December I remember All the Light We Cannot See as my favorite read of the year.
It is hard to write a negative review about such an ambitious and heartfelt book, but this one just didn't come together for me. The potentially fascinating characters -- an orphaned teenage German boy and a blind teenage French girl, whose lives in the years before and during the German occupation of France overlap and intersect -- never felt fully realized. In a sense I felt that the author let our familiarity with events of World War II allow him to take shortcuts in developing the characters and their motivations; common historical knowledge and broad characterizations took the place of deep development of internal motivations and choices behind their actions.<br/><br/>Another problem for me was the author's decision to break up such a long novel into so many very short chapters, and to make so many jumps forward and backward in time. I couldn't see the advantage to this. For me it created a barrier to surrendering myself to the story and getting lost in the world of the characters. Instead I found myself constantly aware of the fact that I was being told a story rather than flowing with it -- which became particularly frustrating in a book of this length.<br/><br/>There are beautiful aspects to this story and I don't regret having read it all the way through. But it will not stick with me as an unforgettable take on that incomprehensible chapter of history. For that, I recommend Ursula Hegi's "Stones From The River," a book I read years ago and still think about.
Storylines dismissed as shopworn have a funny way of becoming fresh and thrilling in the hands of a literary master. And what historical event has been used as the backdrop for more works of literature in the past 70 years than World War II? The possibility that citizens of Allied nations could have fallen in love with, or seen the innate goodness in, subjects of the Third Reich is not new. Books such as SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER have chronicled the experiences of children whose innocence allowed them to see qualities that others could not. You’d think that, by now, every story imaginable about the rise of National Socialism had been told already.<br/><br/>Which is what makes ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE, Anthony Doerr’s new novel, such a revelation. Doerr is known mainly for his short stories, most notably 2010’s MEMORY WALL. In his latest book, he shows greater comfort with the demands of novel writing than he has heretofore demonstrated. And he has found an original way of telling a story we’ve heard countless times before.<br/><br/>The novel, most of which takes place between 1934 and 1944, is the story of two children, one French and one German. The first, Marie-Laure LeBlanc, lives in Paris with her father, the master locksmith of the city’s Muséum National d’Historie Naturelle. When she is six, Marie-Laure goes on a tour with other children and, at the end, asks the guide about the one part of the museum he didn’t show them: the contents behind a locked iron door. He tells them the legend of the jewel kept within, a 133-carat stone known as the Sea of Flames. The stone has a curse: The owner lives forever, but bad luck befalls everyone else. One month later, an illness robs Marie-Laure of her sight.<br/><br/>Her father cares for her and builds a wooden model of their neighborhood so that she can study it and learn to navigate the streets on her own. He buys books written in Braille, one of which, 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, becomes one of her favorites. In 1940, Marie-Laure and her father escape Paris for the walled city of Saint-Malo to live with her great-uncle Etienne, a hermit who is emotionally scarred from World War I. Marie-Laure is unaware that her father has brought with them a stone that may or may not be the Sea of Flames. Three fakes have been made, and no one knows which is which.<br/><br/>In Germany, Werner Pfennig is growing up in a mining-town orphanage with his younger sister, Jutta. As Werner grows up, he shows an aptitude for building and repairing radios. Among the broadcasts he and Jutta enjoy listening to on a set he repairs are lectures by a French science professor.<br/><br/>One day, teenage Werner is summoned to the quarters of Herr Siedler, a German officer, to fix the officer’s radio. Siedler is grateful to the boy and arranges for him to attend the prestigious National Political Institutes of Education in Essen --- a training ground for Hitler Youth. Werner’s science skills so impress his teachers that he is recruited to help the Wehrmacht track down sites of illegal transmissions. At first, he is enthusiastic about the assignment, but the sight of a murdered child at a location he helps uncover reveals to him the horror of the German campaign. His belief in the Nazi cause is all but gone when, two months after the Normandy invasion, his unit is told to locate and destroy the source of transmissions coming from Saint-Malo, the “final German strongpoint on the Breton coast.”<br/><br/>ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE consists of short chapters, most of them fewer than five pages, the collective impact of which is devastating as Marie-Laure’s and Werner’s stories converge. The book’s title gives you a sense of Doerr’s style: formal and elegant, direct yet poetic. He writes gorgeous sentences: “A foot of steel looks as if it has been transformed into warm butter and gouged by the fingers of a child,” “From outside comes a light tinkling, fragments of glass, perhaps, falling into the streets. It sounds both beautiful and strange, as though gemstones were raining from the sky.” But the greatest achievement of this book is that, unlike many similar works, Doerr emphasizes his protagonists’ capacity for kindness. Of all the brightnesses we can’t or don’t allow ourselves to see, the capacity for goodness in the face of evil is the brightest of all.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Michael Magras.
I have some book prejudices. I generally dislike books:<br/><br/>-- That are over 400 pages<br/>-- That employ split or jumping chronologies<br/>-- About war (or, frankly, that could be classified as historical fiction, generally)<br/>-- With overly flowery writing<br/><br/>Bearing this in mind, there are some books that I know I should probably avoid, because, based on these prejudices, they’re set up for failure. All the Light We Cannot See is one of those books that covers a bunch of my book-prejudice bases:<br/><br/>-- It’s a whopping 530 pages long (No lie: holding it up made my forearms tired).<br/>-- Every few chapters, the year changes, skipping back and forth in time. The book’s timeline ranges from 1934 to 2014 but is focused mainly between1940 and 1944.<br/>-- In case that timeline didn’t raise any red flags, let’s be clear: this is largely set during World War II (in Germany and France).<br/>-- The book is peppered with sentences like this one: “The faintly metallic smell of the falling snow surrounds her,” and author Doerr admitted in an interview on Powell’s Books Blog, “I know this is going to be more lyrical than maybe 70 percent of American readers want to see . . .” At times, it comes off as super cheesy and too in-your-face symbolic or wannabe meaningful (like the chapter that closes: “Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.”).<br/><br/>I should have HATED this book. I never should have read it. I should have ignored the ratings and the reviews and the hype and gone about my business. There are billions of books I could have read instead.<br/><br/>But the early praise for this one was serious. Indie Bound named it the #1 pick on its Indie Next List for May. Amazon called it one of the Best Books of the Month for May (and the early customer reviews were some of the most glowing I have ever seen). The New York Times described it as “hauntingly beautiful” and “elegantly circuitous.” The Washington Post’s review begins: “I’m not sure I will read a better novel this year than Anthony Doerr’s ‘All the Light We Cannot See.’”<br/><br/>And, I’ll admit it: I’m a sucker for hype. If something gets ridiculously rave reviews, I have to find out if it deserves them . . . even if the book seems like it’s one that I’m destined to hate.<br/><br/>So, I read it. Yes, the writing is a overly flowery/lyrical at times. And it could have been a bit subtler (the light theme didn’t need to be hammered so much). And too much time was spent on and detail provided for certain plot points, while others were rushed through or glossed over (details would be spoilery, so I will leave it at that). But, overall, this book is a success. Here are some of the things it has going for it:<br/><br/>-- The cast of characters is diverse, interesting, flawed, and likeable. Although this is a book set during the War, it is a character-driven tale about good versus evil (or light versus dark, if you prefer). At the forefront are two teenagers, Marie-Laure and Werner. Marie-Laure lives in Paris with her locksmith father. She goes blind from a degenerative disease at an early age. Her non-visual grasp on the world is beautifully and richly realized. She is clever and sensitive and highly perceptive. When Paris is attacked, she and her father escape to Saint-Malo to stay with Marie-Laure’s agoraphobic great-uncle and his feisty, old housekeeper. Werner is an orphan who lives in a children’s home in Zollverein. He is curious, brilliant, and adept at building and fixing radios. When word of his skills spreads, he is recruited to the National Political Institute of Education at Schulpforta. There, he helps develop a triangulating device.  He then joins a team that uses this device to locate and abolish enemy radio transmitters (both the instruments and their operators).<br/>-- The longest chapter in the book is maybe six pages. Most are two. Despite the fact that the book is ridiculously long, it reads like a much shorter book (there’s a lot of white space among those 530 pages). As a result, the lyrical writing comes off as poignant and poetic, rather than slow and overly descriptive.<br/>-- The plot is complex and intricate. Woven into the story are numerous odd and interesting elements, including: a huge diamond called the Sea of Flames that carries with it a curse, Marie-Laure’s father’s incredibly detailed models of their neighborhoods in Paris and Saint-Malo, an old dog kennel that abuts the ocean and is home to dozens of snails and shellfish, old science lessons recorded in French and broadcast for hundreds of miles, and loaves of bread carrying secret messages. Throughout the first several hundred pages, you are aware that Marie-Laure’s and Werner’s paths are destined to cross, and the build-up to that moment is suspenseful and exciting. There are moments of tenderness, moments of violence, moments of sadness, moments of humor, moments of courage, and moments of redemption (it’s a long book, after all).<br/><br/>My earlier list of book prejudices was not exhaustive.  I have many others.  For instance, I love:<br/><br/>-- Well-written books<br/>-- Books driven by unique, interesting, likeable characters<br/>-- Characters you can root for<br/>-- Books with unanticipated (but not gimmicky/twisty) climaxes<br/><br/>So, maybe it’s not such a surprise that I enjoyed this book.<br/><br/>This book will win awards. And it will be made into a movie. Mark my words.
So why bother adding a review to the thousands already posted for a book that has received hype, buckets of praise, and an award?  Just another grain of sand among the literary dunes…<br/><br/>I’m happy I was nearly three-fourths finished with this book before the announcement appeared that it had won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  As a rule I am quite wary of Books that Win Prestigious Awards, since said awards are handed out by August Doyens of Literature who are all too often entranced by pages of obscure words, tortured, convoluted plots and characters, and decidedly odd literary conventions at the expense of solid, well-written, straightforward storytelling populated by reasonably normal folks readers can actually like.  And there were all those positive four- and five-star reviews from readers—more than 8,000 of them!—who obviously don’t share either my hesitancy or my cynicism.  Nevertheless, if this book had already won the Pulitzer, I wouldn’t have read it.  But it hadn’t, and I read it.<br/><br/>Folks, this book has quite a bit going for it.  The story, the bare bones of it, recounting the separate, disparate, and then briefly entwined lives of a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy before and during World War Two, is both fascinating and well-realized.  The characters, Marie-Laure LeBlanc and Werner Pfennig, have their moments throughout the novel, and each of them in turn is often endearing, frustrating, and incomprehensible.  There are also a few secondary characters—Etienne LeBlanc, Madame Manec, Frederick and Volkheimer, even the slithery and noxious von Rumpfel—who who manage to hold their own, even in the somewhat attenuated roles they were given.  The descriptions of Paris and the Breton town of Saint-Malo are spot on, with nary a false note.  The description of the lesser-known mining city of Zollverein is uniformly grim, grey, and depressing, only a level or two above the appalling conditions of Werner’s school, or his life in the Werhmacht.  The writing overall has a wealth of moments of lyrical beauty, even when it describes horrendous conditions, and it provides some sentences and phrases worthy of highlighting when speaking about either Marie-Laure or Werner, or the snails and mollusks that come to mean so much to Marie-Laure in the absence of her father.  I can certainly see how the exquisite use of language captivated the Pulitzer folks.<br/><br/>But language alone cannot keep a novel afloat through the shoals and reefs and high rollers threatening to ink it.  Language, no matter how luminous, cannot rescue a plot that has gaps in it, holes that are never filled, and that often makes little distinction between scenes that actually contribute, and those that are little more than window dressing.  Language presented in a sinuous and elegant stream cannot smooth out an awkward construct that gives us chapters of two to three pages each that switch between Marie-Laure and Werner, between the protagonists and the occasional secondary character, all with enough rapidity to give the reader whiplash, the same as if one were watching a particularly invigorating volley at Wimbledon.  It is entirely possible that the plethora of amazingly brief chapters is a logical result of the author’s previous work, which was predominantly short stories.  So here we have short chapters.  Not such a good idea, in this instance.<br/><br/>And it’s this point of view switch across several different time periods that is the novel’s biggest—and perhaps only—flaw, in my opinion.  I can’t identify with a character when I see her in snippets, a bit here, another bit much later, when other characters separate these snippets and I lose my connectivity with the original character.  It serves no purpose, I think, to begin at the end, as it were, then regress to the beginning, maintain that narrative flow in short, frustrating bursts of information, fast-forward to the end, and turn back to the middle.  It makes little difference that the sections are clearly dated—the fact remains that this time travel, as it were, seriously distracted my relationship with Marie-Laure and Werner, and pulled me right out of the novel every time it happened, required some effort to get back into the story.  There may have been some wonderfully creative reason for this arcane literary device, but I am afraid my more proletarian reading tastes didn’t think much of it.  Obviously the more urbane literati awarding the Pulitzer disagreed with me, and that is to be expected.<br/><br/>Some reviewers apparently disliked the ending, but I admit that is one aspect with which I had no issues.  To me it seemed not only appropriate but also fitting, low-key, almost unemotional and inevitable.  The tying up of the various strands were not dramatic, either, but logical, expected, and, I think, quite satisfying.<br/><br/>With so many positive reviews, and a prestigious award, I probably should have reconsidered my opinion.  But my opinion, after all, is worth no more—and no less—than any other reader’s view of this novel.  What I see here is a missed opportunity to have created something wonderful, without doubt, without a dissenting view, had the book been a little more chronological, perhaps, allowing me to spend more time with characters that were unique and worthwhile by anyone’s standards.<br/><br/>Should you read it?  Of course, without a doubt, because it is definitely worth a read, and my reservations may well not be yours.  It’s a page-turner, that’s for sure, even if for no other reason than to see how it ends.
I realize that I am in the minority here, but here goes:<br/><br/>The good: Doerr is a great writer.  He has the ability to draw any reader into complete suspense.  He uses hundreds of colorful metaphores--and has a way (as most good authors do) to describe feelings so vividly that you feel you are experiencing them yourself.  There is great character developement in two beautiful characters: Werner and Marie Laure--characters that you empathize, share sorrow with, and root for the entire book.  I even liked the short chapters as it kept me reading.<br/><br/>The bad:  The two main characters are together for less then 10 pages.  The ending had no resolution--and left me thinking:"so.........--what was the point?"  I read all of this for literally no closure.  Also the story was altogether too dark and left without any real redemption or hope for the reader.  Hence the two stars.
This is one of those properly fabulous books which gently, carefully wraps skeins of gossamer around the reader, taking its time, settling into character, relationship and location, until it steals upon you, that for all the quietness and subtlety of the scene setting, you are wrapped up, little fly, in Doerr's spider's web of a novel, which traps you more deeply, line by line<br/><br/>Paris, 1934 and later St. Malo, before and during the war. Marie-Laure is a young girl, whose father works as a locksmith in the Museum. She is precocious, intelligent, sensitive, with a thirst for knowledge. Loved and loveable. And she is blind.<br/><br/>1934, an orphanage in Zollverein, a coal mining complex near Essen. Werner Pfennig, a scant year older than Marie Laure is another young child with huge potential. He is fascinated by how things work, and has a gift for making, repairing, deconstructing in order to improve. He too is precocious, intelligent, sensitive, with a thirst for knowledge, Loved and loveable.<br/><br/>What divides these children is formative influence, although both are lucky enough to have their humanity and potential fostered enough at an early age to mean that the boy who will be swallowed by the propaganda machine of Fascism and the Fascists, will not quite have that early potentiality for the curious, connecting, mutuality that life also is, crushed.<br/><br/>Though the State worked its hardest to crush out individuality and curiosity for `the other' out of their young men and women, some kernel of something else may remain unscathed, like a dormant seed.<br/><br/>The book's structure jumps between various times, back and forth, and between short chapters which alternate between Marie-Laure's world, and Werner's. Doerr takes us to the edge of certain events, then back tracks, to show a part of the journey that led there, jumps forward again, then back, but always switching between the two worlds of Marie-Laure and Werner, in the ten years between 1934 and a particular event in St. Malo. The reader is absolutely aware the two will meet, and is absolutely aware that there is a very human integrity in both children - and moreover, Doerr is careful to show that despite the most vicious and brutal efforts of any ideology which seeks to educate out the humane response, this survives, more or less strongly, in some individuals.<br/><br/>What I particularly loved (amongst many things) in this book, was the undercurrent of connection to the natural world - Marie-Laure has a fascination with molluscs, and how shells are slowly formed, how life slowly built up. Werner has a friend who shimmers with a love of birds - these connections to `other' are both real and metaphor. Music, reading, an appreciation for the beautiful which has no connection to its material value - but is some evidence of `soulfulness', is shown.<br/><br/>Venality, brutality, bleak violence, the other side are of course also revealed.<br/><br/>Holding this complex, thought inspiring book together is not just fabulous, layered, surprising authentic characterisation, but a plotline which provides a drive, cohesion and both a `real' and a metaphorical meaning of its own.<br/><br/>Within the Paris museum which Marie-Laure's father works at, is a fabulous, hugely valuable jewel. And like many fabulous, valuable jewels  it comes with its own story, and  has accreted fables to itself,  over the generations. People invest things with meaning, magic and metaphor. Are these real, or not?<br/><br/>As the German army move closer to Paris, the museum curator takes steps to break up and hide some of France's artistic and crafted treasures.<br/><br/>The army of occupation is also on a quest of plunder, to search for and steal the treasures of conquered nations.<br/><br/>There is a game of hide and seek, and this is played out in several ways<br/><br/>This book is definitely a page-turner - but it is one which urges the reader to take time with the turning, because so much is going on, unfolding, evolving, revealing.<br/><br/>Doerr writes beautifully, but not ostentatiously so. He has also kept his story simple and clear. Yes, of course, like any story there will be `coincidences' but life is full of these. And most of the `coincidences', other than the ones of sheer happenstance, why this person might be in this place and not another, are authentically driven by who characters are.<br/><br/>There is that lovely sense of a writer, sure, who knows what he is doing, but one who has surrendered to the complexity of the arising characters. This is not a writer who picks up a character and plonks him or her like a cog in a machine, so that the reader spots manipulation.<br/><br/>"From the molten basements of the world, two hundred miles down, it comes. One crystal in a seam of others. Pure carbon, each atom linked to four equidistant neighbors, perfectly knit, octahedral, unsurpassed in hardness. Already it is old : unfathomably so. Incalculable eons tumble past. The earth shifts, shrugs, stretches. One year, one day, one hour, a great magma gathers a seam of crystals and drives it towards the surface, mile after burning mile; it cools inside a huge, smoking xenolith of kimberlite, and there it waits."<br/><br/>Doerr's beautiful description of the forces which produce diamonds, also spoke to be both of the evolution of life itself,  human endeavour and development and of creative impulse.<br/><br/>The writer too, may be percolating a story, hidden in the darkness, for a lifetime. It too with one year, one day, one hour get driven towards the surface, a burning mile. And cool, and wait, and allow process to arise, work to be done, the jewel to be cut, crafted, polished, revealed - and released to the reader, to give it the fables and the stories they will.<br/><br/>I loved this, profoundly.<br/><br/>Doerr was named as one of Granta's Best Young American novelists. Well deserved.<br/><br/>And, for once the dust jacket comparisons to a couple of other books, if you loved, you will love, type of thing, (Atonement, Birdsong) I think are compliments to those earlier books, that they share a space with this fine one.<br/><br/>I received this from Amazon Vine UK as a copy for review. Lucky me. One to keep and re-read, for sure.
The way this book started out, and right up until almost the end, I'd have given it five stars. It is so beautifully written and the storylines so riveting and compelling, but then it just all fell apart, or, rather, just never all came together. I'd read somewhere (before finishing the book) that the writer spent 10 years writing it. And what it seemed to me is that, at some point, he got tired of writing it and put it away for a while. Then he remembered it and decided to finish it, but not with the same relish as he'd started it. It seemed that the ending was just something he added so he could get the book finished and published. Obviously, I could be very wrong about that. I mean, maybe he wrote the ending first. Who knows. All I do know is that, once he made the final disposition of one of the main characters (which, in my opinion, was done so offhandedly and nonchalantly and incompletely as to be disrespectful to the character and his place in the story), it was all crap from there. I finished this book weeks ago and the ending still bothers me. HA!
I started reading this on my Kindle and found myself wishing I had purchased the hardcover so I could thumb back and forth to reread certain passages.  The story touched me at a very deep and spiritual place.  I plan to read it again.  So much to absorb and think about.
I was looking forward to this book after reading the reviews.  However, I couldn't wait to finish it. The storyline could have been developed and written in about half the pages.<br/>I wanted more of Marie and Werner and so much less of the wordy descriptions of what was going on around them.<br/>There were so many wonderful characters that we never really got to know.<br/>I also found the timing very confusing with the chapters bouncing back and forth.<br/>A huge disappointment to a book I could not wait to read.
I really enjoyed the author's writing, his use of words , his descriptions and the beautiful story he created  were such a joy .<br/> I did not want to put the book down.<br/>I am not a fan of skipping from one time period to another, but I bared with it because of his writing skills and the riveting story he unfolded.<br/>however with that said, I was very displeased with the way the book ended. It was a bit confusing and lacked the drama and intensity that was there throughout the book.  I find that this happens with a lot of authors with their endings. They try to wrap it all up . Maybe it's because in real life there is no ending, I don't know.<br/>I think the book is well worth reading . It is so well written . I was just disappointed with the ending.
This may be the best novel I have ever read (and being a binge-reader, I've read many hundreds).  As others have noted, All The Light We Cannot See speaks to the senses in a way that creates a living world for the reader.  And though at times that world can be unbearable, it can also be sublime.  We come to love the unlikely protagonists for the beauty of their souls and for their flaws.  I was left with feelings of deep sadness for the misery and constant loss that define our human condition, joy for the transforming power of love, and a comforting sense of being a part of the vastness and depth of human experience.  The final chapter contains a beautifully understated message of hope for all of us who often feel that we are wandering in the dark.
I think that this book is one of the best of the century. The author (Mr. Doerr) describes Marie-Laurie (a blind French girl) as a true blind girl. In other words, he shows you what the world feels like from a blind French girl's perspective. Then there'so Werner. You'do expect him to be another "Nazi German boy" with one goal: to rule the world and live as the top class amongst Hitler. Mr. Doerr tells the reader how in Germany, 1937-1945, there was a lot of propaganda about how all the Americans and British would stop at nothing to destroy the "Aryan" race. How during that time, how everyone wanted to survive. Mr. Doerr describes war as it truly is: bombs flying over innocent civilians' heads, guns firing off in the distance, children crying... I don't want to give away to much of the book. I would highly recommend this book.
Maybe I'm old and jaded, but it was hard for me to work out what people loved about this book.  This wasn't a bad book - some of the language is quite lovely.  And so many people love it, it's had so many awards, it's clear I'm in the minority.  But for me, it wasn't a great book. The characters and plot felt a trifle "young adult", and there's no real moral tension in the story.  The denouement feels somewhat flat.<br/><br/>It's certainly an easy read - I demolished in a single plane flight from New York to Sydney.  But it didn't linger in my mind when I was done.
This is not that WW II book where all the Germans are monsters or menacing racists and the Allies are unassailable saviors. In fact, much of this novel takes place in Saint-Malo in Brittany, a walled city that was nearly wiped out by American bombs in 1945. War has its own logic and agenda, and casts a long shadow over people just trying to survive and protect the ones they love. War has no furlough for the civilians.<br/><br/>"Now it seems there are only shadows and silence. Silence is the fruit of the occupation; it hangs in branches, seeps from gutters...So many windows are dark. It's as if the city has become a library of books in an unknown language, the houses great shelves of illegible volumes, the lamps all extinguished."<br/><br/>Doerr's elegant, intricate and intimate portrait is like a poetry painting of two central characters whose lives inevitably intersect. Werner Pfennig is an orphan in Germany living in near-poverty with his sister, Jutta, at a Children's Home outside Essen. He is expected to enter the coalmines at 15, in support of the unification and Nationalist cause of the Reich. But, he has a brilliant technical aptitude with radios and transmitters, which may be a way out of the infantry.<br/><br/>"Radio: it ties a million ears to a single mouth. Out of loudspeakers,...the staccato voice of the Reich grows like some imperturbable tree; its subjects lean toward its branches as if toward the lips of God."<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a blind girl in Paris, daughter of the locksmith of the Natural History Museum. She has learned to feel her way around her neighborhood, because her father brought her on walks where she learned to count steps and storm drains, and built an elaborate scale model of the city for her, carved from wood. Moreover, there's a diamond locked in the museum with a mythical history, a curse.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure: "I hear that the diamond is like a piece of light from the original world. Before it fell. A piece of light rained to earth from God."<br/><br/>The novel is divided into sections Zero through Twelve. Within each section are a multitude of very short titled chapters. Some chapters are less than half a page long, some a few pages in length. Each section covers a date--such as 1934, or May, 1944, or August, 1944, and so forth. Much of it takes place in the few months before and after D-Day (June 1944). During that time, Marie-Laure and her father leave Paris for Saint-Malo to escape the invasion. Her Uncle Etienne lives there, and is a victim of PTSD (although the term wasn't used then) from the First World War. Etienne's brother used to be a pirate radio broadcaster a decade ago, and Werner and Jutta picked up on the signal when Werner, at age 9, constructed a raw radio transmitter from old parts. Etienne's brother would broadcast fascinating facts regarding the natural sciences.<br/><br/>The story alternates, for the most part, between Werner and Marie-Laure. There's a subtle sense of excitement and tension, as I knew that eventually their lives would cross. Doerr's prose is poised and musical, metaphorically masterful, and I just wanted to weep at the delicacy of the author's humanity. As the book description says, this novel is mainly about people trying to be good to one another. And the author--he is so good to his readers.
This is one of the best fictional books about World War II that I have read in a while. It was captivating. The book is well written, and I really enjoyed the setup, the story following two children, Marie Laure and Werner, who grow up during the years leading up to the war—one in France and one in Germany—and who meet in Saint-Malo in 1944. The chapters alternate between these two people and their past and present.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, I knew that Marie Laure’s and Werner’s path would converge in Saint-Malo, and I raced through the pages to find out how it would happen and what would happen next. Yet at the same time, the prose was so beautiful that I wanted to take my time to savor it. I found the parts that described how Marie Laure perceived the world around her particularly poignant. Being blind, she has to rely on order to find her way, especially when she is outside. At the same time, there’s the chaos of war all around her. It was touching to read how she found solace amid so much fear.<br/><br/>I love it when I read a book and then know exactly who I will give it to as a gift. It doesn’t happen very often, but it did with this book!
After reading, over and over again, that this was the best book of 2014, I couldn't wait to start this book. But as I continued to read, I couldn't wait to finish. The premise of the book is intriguing, but the the stories of the two characters take much to long to converge (page 410 out of 511). I grew bored waiting or this to happen and when it does, the characters spend a few pages together and then the author fast forwards 30 years to neatly wrap everything up in less than 100 pages. Way too long of a build up for an anti climatic, rushed ending. The story would've benefited from more balance in the before (the characters met) and after. Sometimes I wonder if reviewers simply lack the courage to go against the "popular opinion" because this book was definitely not the best book that I read, published in 2014, or any other year for that matter.
5 stars are woefully inadequate... this is a modern masterpiece.<br/>All the Light We Cannot See is the best book I've read in years. The writing is brilliant; the characters were so fully drawn that I felt a personal connection. The European settings were real enough to imagine myself there, and the language... that's the part that gave me chills. My prediction is that All the Light We Cannot See will quickly become the book that the booksellers handsell, that readers cannot stop talking about, and that book groups put at the top of their to-read lists. Strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to light up their lives with an amazing story. I hope this is Doerr's year for a major literary prize; nobody is more deserving.
This story was well written in the description of each characters feeling and emotion in the story. Many books are predictable. I was surprised several times with the path this story took. I like books that take me to another time, and this one did that beautifully.
Not sure what I'm missing after reading others' review of this book. I am 33% into the book and so far there is nothing that makes me want to read on (other than the fact of wasting money). I'm going to push on to 40-50% hoping something happens of interest.<br/>(And I love WWII stories).
I am having trouble understanding why this book is so highly lauded. After I turned the last page of the novel, I was distinctly underwhelmed. I recall thinking: "Is that all there is"? Although things happened in this book, in the end, nothing really "happened". I have read other novels in the WW2-era that had much more story, more plot. I was not looking for "all action, all the time" but here, we jump from snippets of chapters, but without much purpose. The author could have easily chopped off a few chapters and I don't think anything would have been lost, story-wise.<br/>I am glad though, that we had an epilogue of sorts and see what has happened to Marie-Laure, Jutta, Frederick etc. as that is something I really like reading in novels not set in the present time.<br/>I think too, that my disappointment with this novel stems from the fact that it IS so highly praised. Perhaps I was expecting too much from this critical darling. I would not advocate people to forego this novel, but I will caution that readers should temper their expectations.
I have read a number of historical novels set during World War II recently and, frankly, they all started to seem a bit conventional--until I read this one.  I'm not sure how to describe this book--the best I can say is that it was almost meditative in its prose and shattering in its plot.<br/><br/>There are two parallel stories here: on of Werner, the young German with "the knack" for radios who finds himself in the German military and Marie-Laure, the young French girl who fled Paris with her father and found herself in Saint-Malo in the house of her eccentric great-uncle and his housekeeper.  Doerr does a nice job of keeping the two stories running simultaneously and maintaining the reader's interest in both throughout the book.<br/><br/>War is not pretty, but there is something beautiful about Doerr's writing, even when he is describing atrocities.  I've noticed that novels set in war tend to cross the line into sensationalism, but Doerr deftly stays away from that.<br/><br/>I will admit that there were parts of this book that I found a bit slow, but all in all it was a beautiful read that I would recommend to anyone with an interest in historical or literary fiction.  And I would really love to visit Saint-Malo!
It took me three times of checking it out from the library to force myself to finish this loosely constructed "novel." It felt more like vignettes that didn't even connect until the book was nearly over. The writing is beautiful and the characters interesting, but the format didn't work for me at all.
Up to about 3/4 of the way through this book I would have given it 5 stars, and I still commend it for an intriguing story line and vivid characters (if some received more attention than others).  However, I almost felt like the last part of the book was written by a different person who was not privy to the vision of the original author.  Since I must assume that is not the case, I am forced to conclude that the author was unable to cope with completing what he started, or was being deliberately harsh toward the readers in his handling of the plot lines and individual character's fates.  I was in no way expecting a simplistic happy ending or that everyone would survive unscathed, but honestly the ending was practically a cry for Prozac.
"All the Light We Cannot See" is one of the best books I have read so far this year.<br/><br/>The use of the present tense gives a sense of immediacy and lends to the suspense as the lives of three people converge in a pivotal moment in the walled village of Saint-Malo, France, during World War II. The two main characters are Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and Werner, a young German soldier facing moral choices as he tracks the enemy’s radio communications. They are both courageous, sensitive, and intellectually curious.<br/><br/>There is also a relentless Nazi sergeant-major searching for a rare (and possibly cursed) diamond that was entrusted by a museum to Marie-Laure’s father when he fled Paris with her to the seaside village. Their parallel stories are told in alternating flashbacks beginning in 1940 and leading up to a fateful week in August, 1944. Doerr captures the essence of the human experience of wartime, from the the deprived conditions of occupied France to the strict military school for Hitler Youth.<br/><br/>Although some readers may think it overlong at 544 pages, I enjoyed every page. The novel was a joy to read because of its phrasing, prose, and details. I think it at also succeeds because of its moving characters whose innate goodness and concern for each other rise above the depravity of war. There is a satisfying afterward that explains what happens to some of the characters who survive the war.<br/><br/>I predict that it will be a critically acclaimed bestseller.
After reading the many glowing reviews - here and other places - I took the plunge and bought this book.<br/><br/>In some ways it is a lovely story. The plot follows two main protagonists in parallel story lines - the girl in France, the young boy in Germany - beginning in the early years of WW2 and continuing until after the war.  The two characters are well developed, the story is interesting - but not exceedingly so. Since the novel is so well reviewed I felt that it must be building towards a wonderful climax, and I was willing to be patient with it being excessively long and drawn out. I had high hopes! However, after reading a very long story, the ending and wrap up - for almost every single character - was very disappointing. It ended up being a let-down, and I am sorry I invested the time I did in reading this book.
Wow, I did not like this book.  I was so disappointed but I kept reading, despite the length, hoping it would live up to its hype.  It was boring, disjointed, not particularly well-written and way, way, way too long.  The mini chapters didn't help.  I didn't appreciate that style, it did not keep me interested, it kept me confused.  I did enjoy the beginning, the relationship between father and daughter, but after the father was written out of the story, the book went down hill.  I was very disappointed by the 4 1/2* rating.  I trusted that this book would be worth the purchase.  I gave it two stars only because the beginning had promise and hooked me in, but that's truly a gift from me.  I would not recommend this read.
Well, after reading so many positive reviews, I feel like I must be some kind of moron because this book just didn't do it for me at all. I felt like the story didn't really flow with any sense of urgency to read the next page. It felt like reading a cookbook. I didn't feel that invested in the characters, which was probably a good thing since the plot sputtered out and died. My favorite character disappeared. Then, even though a scene is set up perfectly for Marie to share the stories of his heroics to his sister, nothing is said. And another huge piece of the plot just disappears like the author somehow forgot...The scenes were so sporadically described, I felt like a blind person stumbling down a street with no sense of what else is happening around me. In one section, I realized after reading a couple pages, that I was reading about a gang rape. It was described so dispassionately that I had to read it again to verify. Just did not have what I look for in a story.
I didn't buy this book right away. It had rave reviews but but I was hesitant. Now that I have it I realize my instinct was correct. I have been reading it for quite a while and it has just never drawn me back to it. In fact I am loathe to pick it up. I am a voracious reader and will read just about anything. I rarely give up on a book but here I am on page 151 and I just can't see the point of continuing. The chapters are two pages long each and they switch between the two main characters. I just looked ahead and the whole book is set up like this. Maybe this is good writing and a good story but the lack of flow just kills my interest. I see over 7000 reviews averaging over 4 stars and I think I must be missing something. But really this just drags for me. There are better war time stories.
I have only read half of this book but I hasten to post this review because so many people have embraced it with raves. Doerr is a real master of beautiful prose but many of his details are off. When I notice details that I know don't work from personal experience, I feel I cannot trust an author on details that I don't know. For instance, in France, in 1940, peaches preserved at home would have been kept in glass jars, not cans. There was no air-conditioning in Paris in 1969, so I doubt it existed in St. Malo in 1940. The manuscript is studded with mistakes like this that somehow slipped past the editor. My angst increased when Doerr has his heroine and her father walk to Gare Saint-Lazare in May 1940. We are talking several arrondissements away, across the Seine, through a maze of streets that are not easy to navigate even today. After waiting hours for a train that doesn’t come, the pair sets off at dawn, on foot, destination Evreux. They finally sleep in a hayfield outside Versailles. Forget about crossing the Seine – the main bridge was being rebuilt in 1940 – and climbing the hill of St. Cloud. I want to believe. I really do. But this simply is not plausible. Doerr’s claim that bombs were falling behind them, presumably on Paris, made me start hyperventilating. The French government fled to Bordeaux on June 13, 1940. Paris was not bombed, ever. So, that is my first issue: erroneous details. My second is the storyline which keeps jumping around. I felt confused by this technique and would have preferred to read in sequence. I found myself losing interest in the second thread, the one about the boy in Germany, and only reading every other chapter, about the blind girl. Then we have the introduction of a fabulous diamond that is smuggled out of Jardin des Plantes, and for me the story exited historical fiction and entered fantasy.
This book is being celebrated far more than it deserves, in my opinion. Many reviewers object to the choppiness of moving back and forth between characters. I did not mind that, though I know it can be disconcerting to some. I found that the German boy's character development was portrayed beautifully. However, I was very disappointed in the character development in the blind French girl. As she approaches adolescence, we only hear what happens to her, not within her. I'm afraid that, at least in this novel, the author displays a lack of insight into the mind of the female gender.
I am quite an avid reader of WWII historical fiction books, so when I saw all of the rave reviews about this one, I was eager to read it. This book was different from most--the book alternated between the lives of a blind French girl and a mechanical genius German boy whose stories begin to cross in German-occupied France.<br/><br/>While the writing was beautiful and the characters intriguing, I never really got attached to this book. Perhaps it was all of the skipping around in the book. The very, very short chapters alternated between the stories so that I never really got into either one, making this just an okay read for me.
Yes a 2!  I know, I know, many of you rated this book very high.  I just plain didn't like it.  The writing was fabulous but the story was not.  The writing was so good, I felt as though I had been dragged through WWII, however, there was no connection to the characters, not a glimmer of hope and certainly no reasoning for the chapters going forward and backward in time.  Truly, I just feel thankful to have finished.
I’m not sure I can do justice to this book by trying to write a review, but here goes.<br/><br/>This story is breathtakingly beautiful.  There are so many different layers and Mr. Doerr did an outstanding job of pulling it all together.  The most minute detail is of significance.  Told in very short chapters that alternate between Marie-Laure and Werner, we watch these two grow from young children to mid-teens. The story begins in the early stages of Nazi Germany’s rise to power and their occupation of France.  The loss of childhood innocence, the love of family, the horrors of war, the determination of humanity are all intricately woven throughout this novel.<br/><br/>The way Mr. Doerr writes is magical.  This is easily the best book I have read all year.<br/><br/>My thanks to Scribner, via Edelweiss, for allowing me to read this in exchange for an unbiased review.
Doerr has written a gripping and readable novel about WWII. Book clubs will pore over its details as many glasses of wine are enjoyed. But despite its obvious appeal, its deficiencies outweigh its merits. There are numerous technical flaws in Doerr's understanding of Germany and France during the war (names, campaigns, events). Ultimately it's a superficial book pretending to a depth it doesn't have. The episodic structure, switching back and forth between the blind girl and the young electronics wizard, wears thin. The intersection of their lives is entirely predictable and no amount of wistfulness overcomes the novel's sentimentality.
Since its publication, Anthony Doerr’s All The Light We Cannot See has, for the most part, received adulation and praise from readers and critics.  The novel has been described as textured, intricate, mythic and haunting with Amanda Vaill of the Washington Post describing the book as “enthrallingly told, beautifully written and so emotionally plangent that some passages bring tears.”  This adoration has further been reinforced with the novel’s appearance on the shortlist for the National Book Award.<br/><br/>While I agree that the writing is gorgeous, and appreciate the book’s almost fairytale quality, unlike most of the critics I never completely engaged with the novel.  Or more accurately, I was engaged with the first half of the book but gradually found my interest waning.<br/><br/>Before I can explain why, I need to provide some context.  All The Light We Cannot See is set during World War 2 and alternates between Marie Laure, a blind girl who escapes Paris with her father during the Nazi invasion and Werner Jutta, a German orphan whose expertise with all things electronic catches the eye of a member of the Nazi party.  The book skips around in time, starting in 1944 just as Saint Malo is about to bombed by allied forces and then drifting back to the mid 30s and the childhood of Marie and Werner.<br/><br/>Also introduced in these early sections is the Sea of Flame, a precious diamond worth “five Eiffel Towers” that may also be cursed.  As the Germans advance on Paris, the Museum holding the Sea of Flame manufactures three facsimiles of the precious jewel.  These copies and the real diamond are then sent from Paris.  One of the couriers is Marie’s father and it comes as no surprise to the reader which version of the diamond he is protecting.  The subsequent search for the Sea of Flame by Nazi treasure hunter Von Rumpel, tasked to collect and value the jewels of Europe, drives the plot of the novel.  But really, at its heart, The Light We Cannot See is a story about abbreviated childhoods and how love and beauty and a sense of wonder can shine a light on the darkest moments.<br/><br/>And for the first half of the novel, the character work and the plot is matched perfectly with the lyrical writing. This is especially the case as Marie and Werner discover the world around them. For Marie it’s coming to terms with her blindness:<br/><br/>"Her hands move ceaselessly, gathering, probing, testing. The breast feathers of a stuffed and mounted chickadee are impossibly soft, its beak as sharp as a needle. The pollen at the tips of tulip anthers is not so much powder as it is tiny balls of oil. To really touch something, she is learning—the bark of a sycamore tree in the gardens; a pinned stag beetle in the Department of Etymology; the exquisitely polished interior of a scallop shell in Dr. Geffard’s workshop—is to love it."<br/><br/>For Werner it’s falling in love with science and radio:<br/><br/>"The Frenchman’s voice is velvet. His accent is very different from Frau Elena’s, and yet his voice is so ardent, so hypnotizing, that Werner finds he can understand every word. The Frenchman talks about optical illusions, electromagnetism; there’s a pause and a peal of static, as though a record is being flipped, and then he enthuses about coal. [...]  Time slows.  The attic disappears.  Jutta disappears.  Has anyone ever spoken so intimately about the very things Werner is most curious about?"<br/><br/>However, as the novel progressed my cynicism and prejudice started to kick in.  This can partly be attributed to Von Rumpel’s search for the Sea of Flames.  With Marie’s father imprisoned by the Nazi’s she’s becomes the caretaker of the diamond.  Because we know she has the real McCoy it’s inevitable that Von Rumpel and her path will cross.  By the time Von Rumpel arrives in Saint Malo in 1944, the place is about to be bombed and he has gone from a suave Christoph Waltz-type to an over the top villain who believes the diamond can cure his cancer.  It all gets a bit predictable and by the numbers as crazy Von Rumpel hunts for Marie in her Great Uncle’s large house.  And with Werner somewhere in the background, it ends exactly as expected.<br/><br/>But predictability aside, my biggest problem with the novel can be leveled at Werner’s story.  After he catches the eye of the Nazi party member, Werner is sent to the National Political Institutes of Education, a boarding school where young boys are taught to be good Nazis.  He befriends a boy named Frederick whose slight frame and odd love of birds makes him an outlier among the other boys.  (It’s implied that Frederick only got in the school because his father is high up in the Nazi party).  Werner tries to protect Frederick, but the inevitable happens and Frederick is bashed senseless and forced to return home with a brain injury.  Soon after Werner – who is still only 16 – is sent to the front lines so he can use his expertise in radio to triangulate the broadcasts of partisans.<br/><br/>At no point throughout the events described does Werner grow beyond that boy fascinated with radio and science.  Oh he has doubts and concerns, the treatment of Frederick bothers him, but it doesn’t seem to change him.  He neither rebels against the system or becomes a fully fledged Nazi.  He just is.  A young man who understands radio and broadcast wavelengths.<br/><br/>I wanted Werner to get dirt under his fingernails.  I wanted him to either run off and be a partisan or swallow Nazi propaganda whole.  But it’s clear that this is not the story Doerr is interested in telling.  In an excellent interview with Jill Owen’s from Powell’s Books, Doerr states,<br/><br/>"I wanted the reader to get to the point where he or she is actually cheering for Werner’s first find in Russia when they track down that resistance transmission and Volkheimer goes ahead and kills those people. I wanted that to be a very morally complicated moment for the reader when they’re saying, I want Werner to succeed here, but I understand what that success entails, which is murder."<br/><br/>The fact that Doerr expects us to be cheering for Werner leads me to believe that for him Werner never grows up, he’s always the boy who discovers radio for the first time who we cheer as proud parents when he achieves something special.<br/><br/>But my prejudice tells me that Werner, for all his good intentions and the fact that he had very little choice in the matter, is still a Nazi who aided and abetted in the killing of partisans and civilians.  And so for me the situation is not morally complicated.  I stopped feeling any sympathy for Werner once he became a Nazi.<br/><br/>I’m not arguing that Werner should be transformed into a foaming at the mouth villain who constantly goes on about racial purity.  We have Von Rumpel for that.  I’m arguing that given what he sees and what he does, we need to do more than cheer for Werner as his character progresses through the novel.  If anything we should feel a sense of tragedy that an innocent life has been twisted toward such evil.  But for the meeting between Marie and Werner to have any impact we still have to love them equally, we still have to be cheering them on.  And so Werner is stuck in amber, a boy who just wanted to understand science and play with radio.  A boy who seems magically protected from the vileness of Nazi propaganda.<br/><br/>Yes, I grant that I seem to be asking for a different book than what was intended.  And it’s hard to blame the author for following his vision and not mine.  And yet I can’t get that sour taste out of my mouth, the feeling that for all its gorgeous prose and thematic richness, All The Light We Cannot See is a contrived novel where at least one of the characters has been stuck on pause to provide for a particular effect.
I decided to read this book because it received so many stars and rave reviews from all the people who posted reviews. I thought the writing and descriptions were beautiful. But I found the book very slow moving. It was also very confusing because the author kept jumping back and forth in time in telling the story. Sometimes Anthony Doerr would alert the reader to the year he was now referring to in telling the story. Other times he jumped back in time by years and did not alert the reader. I thought that continually going back and forth in time was disorienting and detracted from the story. Sometimes it took me a few pages to figure out where in time he was now in telling the story. I wouldn't rave about this book. It was just OK.
Mr. Doerr, much lauded for this work, is clearly a brilliant writer who crafts an exquisite plot, finely detailed characters, and vivid atmosphere that engaged my mind and sense of wonder on many levels. But I felt saddened when, in the last 50 pages, as the tears welled up behind my eyes, the writing didn’t carry me into the emotional realms I’d been waiting for for more than 500 pages. Perhaps it’s because I was reading this book as I wandered the real Normandy Beaches and deeply affecting grave sites where the actual conflict took place, and as I explored the stubborn little walled city of St. Malo that provides the denouement locale for this work. Mr. Doerr brilliantly details the mental carnage of this World War II tale of valiant children on either side of the horrific conflict. But when at last we reach the moment when insight might have seared my reader’s heart like a branding iron and given me hope for facing my own demons, my tears stalled and my mind wandered. I longed for a final 50 pages where we learn the insights of a puzzled heart unlocked through anguish, pain, and finally empathy--the insights that forged a human connection against all odds. I would recommend reading this book certainly. I just wished for illumination as in the movie “The Natural,” where the tragically-thwarted main character, broken but not defeated, his mission clear and synthesized, hits a home run through the lights, not just for himself, but for us all.
a good start to a interesting story in the beginning, but it was  over long and  in the development of the plot. A dreary  unpleasant focus took  over the  story,with emphasis on the callus harshness of the times with little "light " shed  on anything.  Tragic  bad luck  happened to the young man in the story and I was too exhausted to enjoy the survival of the  blind  girl.<br/>Strong descriptive writing but negative  in the  primary message.
The descriptions are poetic at times but after the thousandth list -- there was the table, the clock on the mantel, the cat skittering by, the light from the window -- I ask, what's it all for? Halfway through and what's happened? Tedious as a catalogue but without the point. Add to this the narrative chopped into 6 parts: time, place and character multiplied by two and shuffled. It's a needless bit of choreography which doesn't in the end do anything to make up for the fact that this is -- dare I say it? -- a boring book. Imagine, a book about WWII, bombs falling all around  ... and it's still boring. Because having a war for a backdrop doesn't make the action of the characters interesting.
This is quite a lengthy book but the quality of the writing is so fine that the pages skip easily by.  This is aided by the average lengths of the chapters none of which are longer than four pages.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a young German boy and a young French girl of comparable ages and their lives leading up to and during WWII.  The boy, Werner Pfennig, lives with his little sister, Jutta, in an orphanage, in Zollverein, for the children of those killed in mining accidents.  He is a precocious technophile and a wiz at repairing broken radios.  When the story opens, in 1934, he is seven and Jutta is five; two little typical Aryan progeny, both of whom have hair as white as snow.  Werner is destined for the mines, at 14 but is ‘saved’ when one day he is called upon to repair the radio of a local Nazi party official who, as a reward, recommends him to a ‘Napola’ (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalten or National Institute of Education); one of about 30 such instititutions created to indoctrinate young minds to become the administrators of the envisaged global Nazi empire.  In reality they brutalized and brainwashed their young charges to the extent that they willingly threw themselves under the wheels of the allied juggernaught during the last months of the war and were slaughtered in their thousands.<br/><br/>The girl, Marie-Laure, lives with her father who is a locksmith and works for the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle that is home to a unique 37 carat sea diamond, the Sea of Flame, much coveted by the marauding Nazis.  At age eight she goes blind and her father, a skilful artisan, constructs for her each year on her birthday, an intricate puzzle box inside of which, should she succeed in solving its particular problem, is a special treat.  He also constructs a scale model of the surrounding area in which they live so that she is able to go out and find her way around.  When the invasion reaches Paris they escape to a relative’s house in St. Malo, on the coast of Brittany.  Marie-Laure is an avid reader and soon learns braille, which enables her to travel to and see places in her imagination: Jules Verne and Charles Darwin’s Voyage of the Beagle acting as a ‘kind of magic carpet’.<br/><br/>The protagonist’s stories are told in alternating chapters and the reader knows that, at some point, they are going to mesh.  In some ways this is a magical book but it does have some drawbacks: for one, the narrative shuttles backwards and forwards in time quite a lot and it’s not really obvious what the author is attempting to achieve by this.  Just as you are beginning to learn something about one of the characters suddenly you are whisked off to another time and/or place completely, which is somewhat disconcerting.  Also, having said, earlier, that the writing is fine some Americanisms creep in, examples of which are ‘sidewalk’, pre-packaged sandwiches (really?) etc. which again, is quite jarring.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, any deficiencies are more than made up for by the story itself which, despite the brutality of monstrous evil, is one of love, hope and self-sacrifice.
A marvelously written descriptive book for the first half. Expanded my senses. If you read this far, close the book and throw it away. You know how some authors make stacks of 3X5 cards to keep track of each character, then sort them by time? This author appears to have done this, then randomly without reason jumps forward or backward in time. Okay I can live with that, though he makes no sense of it here.<br/>Halfway through the book, when we care about the resolution of each character, his dog eats the stack of 3x5s which have the endings. He drops each character carelessly, lazily, with little to no explanation off the edge of the novel.<br/>This is the most unsatisfying, lazy book I have read in years. If it had started poorly, I wouldn't have bothered past the first chapter. As it is, I felt betrayed.
I love war novels, and though I'll say this is one of the best WWII novels I've read, it's also unlike any other war novel.  This is not just a novel of battles and military strategy and carnage.  This novel is fundamentally about the light of human wonder, which shines brightly even in the darkest days of war.  At times brutal, at times sweet, there is always beauty found in this amazing book.
Anthony Doerr's latest work is one that I feel should be read by anyone who is interested in the second world war, and those fond of literature in general. Doerr has crafted a beautiful world surrounding his blind protagonist and the equal and opposite German officer. There is more than enough detail in the description of the environment and in the character's feelings. At its heart this is a story about the goodness of humankind, and at the same time an effigy to the evil.
This is a beautifully written book, and I loved the first 85% of it. However, there is one thing about the plot that I hated. I literally went from loving this book to hating it. WARNING: If you are sure you want to read this book and you don't like spoilers, then don't read any further!<br/><br/>The author killed off one of the two major characters in a totally pointless, stupid manner. I would have been pissed off by this no matter how the character died, but the way in which the author killed the character off made it even worse than it might have been. It ruined the story. In addition, I thought the story could have been partly redeemed if the surviving major character had told the dead character's sister about what happened the one day the two main characters met--but no, the author couldn't even give us (or the sister) that satisfaction! I read to the end to see if the author would do something to make the story more palatable at the end, but no, nothing. So, even though I loved the first 85% of this very long book, I will probably never read another book by this author. The end was that bad.<br/><br/>I virtually never take the time to review books, but since I wish I had been warned about this fatal flaw in the story--so that I wouldn't have spent so much of my valuable vacation time reading this book--I feel compelled to give this warning to other readers who don't like books with horrible endings.
to waste time with one like this. I put it down after reading 3/4 of it, I just didnt care about the characters and found the plot slooow and many elements hard to believe. All the people in my book club loved  it....shrug...but I thought it was tedious and the "descriptive writing" precious and cloying.
This book transcends the genre of "war books" and sets a high bar indeed for future efforts.  Unlike many such books that cut wars down to manageable size by focusing on particular places or events, "All the Light" jumps back and forth between times, locations and characters fluidly and seamlessly.  This in itself is quite an achievement; then the characters themselves are remarkably well delineated, thoroughly fleshed out and humanized, and the writing sparkles on every page, drawing the reader straight into the heart ot the story.<br/><br/>Doerr possesses a remarkable insight into human nature, particularly as revealed starkly in the harsh light of a terrible conflict.  Even the less-likable members of his cast are no cardboard cutouts, and the principal protagonists are unforgettably well-drawn and come alive in the pages of this memorable work.<br/><br/>Despite the complexities of plot and characterization, this book is far from a difficult read.  "Enjoyable" is an unusual adjective for a book that deals with a topic of this kind, but it applies here in the sense of literary and philosophic enjoyment.  And, yes, even spiritual enjoyment -- for the best aspects of humanity ultimately triumph in ways which are objectively small and yet transcendent.<br/><br/>Doerr weaves scientific and technologic strands into the plot with as deft a hand as that which enlivens his characters.  As a mineral collector, I appreciated the details of mineralogy and gemology.  As one with an interest in electronics, I was intrigued by his mention of Uncle Etienne's "stereo" radio receiver setup -- intrigued enough to investigate online whether such a thing existed in the 1940s (which I doubted), and frankly not the least bit offput to discover that it almost certainly didn't.  Slip-ups of this kind most often lead me to search for more; they're usually there, and the review "loses stars".  In this case, trust me, anything of this sort is merely what Uncle Etienne would dismiss as "une bagatelle".  Just don't even bother, don't waste a bit of energy trying to pick any kind of hole in this remarkable oeuvre.  Pay much closer attention to the layers of meaning, both scientific and spiritual, that underlie its title.<br/><br/>The insightful reader will be able to foresee how some of the plot twists will likely be worked out, but this diminishes the reading enjoyment not a whit; the book's conclusion is both somewhat unanticipated and wholly satisfying.  Doerr even leaves a small opening for a sequel, though I have no idea if one is under consideration and it's certainly hard to imagine how it could top this masterful volume.<br/><br/>My meager review will surely get lost amongst the myriad of others.  But by no means should you allow this masterpiece to get lost in the sea of far-inferior modern literature.  May you find it as memorable as I did.
This is an incredibly poignant story. I chose "Thoughtful" for the mood because the only mood that does not occur is light-hearted. Maybe there are one or two light-hearted moments. Much of the story occurs during World War II. There are definitely events that are deeply disturbing and reflect dark aspects of life and humanity yet there is a sense of hope.  Surprisingly, to me, Anthony Doerr made a great choice to have the story move back and forth in time, often having the time period differ from chapter to chapter - and they are not long chapters. After feeling very slightly lost at the first change in time period, I found that the move back in time then forward in time made the story richer. Foreshadowing that occurs in the past relates to stories that the reader has read already. Knowledge of a more recent time enriches the experience of reading about events occurring earlier in the characters' lives and vice versa.<br/>There are two main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, and many secondary characters whose absence would be unforgivable. I think Marie-Laure is arguably the most central character. She is blind. As is true with most of the characters, her life is painted in her own words. I could almost feel what it would be like to be blind while being fully aware that only a blind person knows how it feels to be blind. I found her courage and perseverance incredible.<br/>I hope that you too are enriched by reading All the Light We Cannot See.
This book offers a stunning mix of two points of view--a blind French girl in Sant Malo, a town about to be bombed by the Allies (and her history), and Werner, a boy brought up under Hitler's Germany (his past and his part in the battle for Sant Malo)--and lets us see how the war frays and penetrates the souls of these two people.  It is beyond beautifully written (and I am the author of 50 children's book, so am somewhat familiar with writing style...) and the words are so glorious that they make me want to lift into the air.
Agree with all others who gave this one star. Started out wonderfully well.....faded in the middle with mindless babble....hated the ending and even went back to see if I'd missed something in the last few chapters that would explain it. Nope. Very disappointing.
I resisted reading All The Light We Cannot See when it was published in May, thinking the world did not really need another novel about the Second World War.  Well, I was wrong.<br/><br/>It is quite a vocabulary challenge to find the adjectives to describe this marvelous book without falling into cliché.  Anthony Doerr’s wordsmithery is superb, his storyline development masterful, and the characters described so vividly that it is absolutely inconceivable that a reader could resist engaging in their lives.  The main protagonists are a German orphan boy and a blind young French girl.  I assure you there is no schmaltz in this story, which was what I feared when I read some of the blurbs.  This is not a book to be read quickly, but one the reader will want to savor, soaking in all the luscious details of the plot evolution.<br/><br/>Werner Pfennig and his younger sister Jutta live in a Children’s House with about a dozen other children of various ages in a small German mining town of Zollverein.  Frau Elena is their loving caregiver who also teaches them French.  It is 1934 and curious, clever Werner peppers Frau Elena with questions, and with his sister Jutta scours the junk piles in search of “stuff” from which he makes things.  One day he finds an old radio and figures out to repair it, which opens a new world to the Children’s House.  For one hour an evening, they listen together to music and programs on the radio, after which Werner takes it back up to his sleeping area.  When unable to sleep one night, Werner finds a broadcast by a French man teaching science to children and playing classical music.  Werner and Jutta listen faithfully for weeks until no longer able to receive his signal.  This “French professor” and his broadcasts will turn out to be a link to a young blind Parisian girl living about 300 miles from Zollverein.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure LeBlanc lives in Paris with her father Daniel, the chief locksmith at the National Museum of Natural History, just a few blocks from their apartment.  Marie-Laure’s blindness was caused by congenital cataracts  and by age six, her sight is gone. Daniel built his daughter a replica of their Parisian neighborhood, whittling every building in exact miniature and making sure she memorizes it.  He also takes her out for walks and makes her find the way to different destinations and back home, always a step or two behind, always close, always coaching her to use logic and reason.  While Daniel is working, “Laurette” spends her time at the museum learning about locks while shadowing him and occasionally learning about shells, mollusks, whelks and other topics from the museum’s expert, Dr. Geffard with whom she spends occasional afternoons.<br/><br/>All the characters in this book had to accept and learn to live with harsh realities.  Werner and Jutta’s father died in a mining accident and with their mother already gone, the Children’s House was their only option.  Werner would be sent down to the mines when he reached his 15th birthday, as were all the boys.  His engineering skills earned him a different fate.  Still, the lack of autonomy, opportunity and individual choice  in society at that time is sobering to see in print.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to read a book about the Second World War that writes Germans as real people, not stereotypes goose stepping their way through life.  The trek that Daniel and Laurette make when they have to leave Paris to join his uncle in the seaside town of Saint Malo is horrific, exhilarating and inspiring.  The starkness of daily life during wartime for the civilians, soldiers and French resistance are depicted in heart-wrenching detail.  Doerr wraps up the stories of the main characters at the end of the book, taking us to the year 2014.<br/><br/>I have read some great books over the past year, some superb for their genre, but I believe All The Light We Cannot See is a modern classic, even though it was only published 4 months ago.
ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is many different books, depending upon the lens the reader brings to it. Although labelled literary fiction, on one level it is suspense. An invaluable blue diamond with a red core, the size of a robin's egg and pear shaped, has been removed from a museum in Paris when the Nazis invaded. Several exceptional copies have been produced, and the copies as well as the original are scattered throughout France as a means of keeping the true diamond out of the hands of the plunderers. Throughout the book, a German mineralogist, Van Rumpel, searches for the diamond, which may or may not have a curse upon it that keeps its owner alive while bringing disaster to all of his or her loved ones. At the same time, a young German radioman, Werner, develops the technology to triangulate radio signals and uses that technology to find partisans broadcasting information harmful to the Germans. A young blind French girl, Marie Laure, sits at the nexus of both searches. The diamond and the radio signals bring Van Rumpel and Werner to Saint Malo, whence Marie Laure has fled from Paris, just as the island comes under attack.<br/><br/>The book is also a treatise on the ways in which war affects the innocent, dealing with how difficult it is to be good during bad times. Both Werner and Marie Laure ask the question of who the "good guys" are. Marie Laure is literally blind to the circumstances, while Werner is encouraged to avoid the personal toll of his work as he tells himself, "It is only mathematics." As the book opens, we experience the childhoods of both, with Marie Laure hidden away from outside reality in Paris' Museum of Natural History where her father holds all the keys and Werner hidden away in his mind and the possibilities presented by radio waves and mathematics. In ways unbeknownst to them, they are connected even in childhood, but it is not until the end of the book that they actually meet. Knowing the two from childhood, and staying with them in alternating chapters as they grow up during the war, provides a keyhole into the personal damage WWII inflicted.<br/><br/>Werner and Marie Laure are the focus of the book, but all of the supporting characters are also well-wrought. Whether it's Werner's sister, who shares his love of the radio and sees the direction of the war well before he does, or Marie Laure's great-uncle, Etienne, who is late to join the resistance after having experienced the horrors of WWI, or any of the other amazing people populating the book, Doerr brings them to life. Reading the book is like taking a journey back to the early 1940s and meeting in person the individuals caught up in the war.<br/><br/>The writing falls away, on one level, as the individuals, their experiences, and the suspense take center stage. On another level, however, the writing is to be savored. The light we cannot see, as in the title, permeates the book. It seems that each page has a reference to light and its beauty. For Marie Laure, her non-seeing experience of the world is accompanied by vivid color. And for Werner, an understanding of radio waves and light as parts of the electromagnetic spectrum brings him to think of all light as invisible. What is seen and what is not seen is intensely important in this book. Just as light is complex, so is ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE. The book ends in keeping with that complexity; those looking for a resolution well packaged and tied up with a bow will not find this book to their taste.<br/><br/>This review first appeared at www.reviewingtheevidence.com.
This is one of those books where you really have to pay attention to each chapter. The chapters are short but there is an incredible amount of detail. Basically you read one chapter about Werner, a German boy who is extremely talented  in the engineering field especially when it comes to fixing radios and the next chapter will be about Marie- Laure, a blind girl who lives with her father and their story of how they flee when Nazis invade. This pattern will force you to remember what you last read about a particular character. There were times where I read about Werner, then Marie, then back to Werner and actually had to go back to the last chapter to remember. After a while I go the hang of it. I will say this....there is an "aha" moment. That moment when you hold your breath unsure of when you will release it and eventually it comes and your happy, then sad, then crying but still happy. This is a wonderful read and I can truly understand why it took the author 10 years to write this book.
I'm tired of these WWII-centric books with blind girls and book thieves.  They seem like YA books.
This may very well be the best book I have ever read. I do not say those words lightly.<br/><br/>I actually just wrote a long review expressing my love for this book and its characters especially (Marie-Laure! Werner! Frederick! Etienne!), but it was deleted before I had the chance to post it :(<br/><br/>Let me just say that this book was incredible. The characters were curious, realistically flawed, endlessly interesting. Strong.<br/><br/>The chapter lengths were perfect. 1-3 pages, typically. They made the book flow smoothly, made it easier to fly through. The length of the chapters certainly did not detract from their depth.<br/><br/>Each page captured my attention. Every sentence had a purpose. I loved that.<br/><br/>It transported me to another time and place. It brought wartime Germany and Paris and Saint-Malo to life. I felt like I was there beside Marie-Laure as her fingers raced across the pages of her beloved braille books and organized her seashells on the windowsill.<br/><br/>I carried this book with me everywhere until I reached the last sentence. I forgot to eat dinner until late into the night. Setting it down was torture. I had to keep reading, needed to know what would happen to Marie-Laure, to her papa, to the Sea of Flames and the snails.<br/><br/>This book caused me to smile to myself more than once and made my heart soar several times, but it did not shy away from the realities of life - of war.<br/><br/>I cannot stress enough how much I recommend this book, absolutely, to everyone. Please read this. It is mesmerizing. It is honest. I learned so much. I felt so much. I do not remember the last time I cared so deeply about the characters of a book I was reading. All the Lights We Cannot See and everything the book entails will be on my mind for a long, long time. I already feel the urge to re-read it and I finished less than an hour ago.<br/><br/>I think I have a new favorite book.
Like almost everyone else, I was stunned by the beauty and power of "All the Light We Cannot See." It can be classified many ways - as historical fiction, as a character study, as a mystery/suspense thriller, as a coming of age story, as an anti-war statement, as a memory play, as a purely literary exercise. The amazing thing is that it succeeds on all these levels. It feels like an instant classic. It's a book that I know I will read again, for greater insight into the characters and details of the plot but also to savor the beautiful language and images that author Anthony Doerr creates.<br/><br/>I will mention just two of the dozens of things that impressed me. Many of the wartime events of the novel are described through the non-visual senses of a blind girl, Marie-Laure. The effect for the reader is to "see" in a new way such iconic WWII scenes as the chaotic flight from Paris or the hero/ine struggling through rubble-strewn streets. More important for the story is how Marie-Laure "reads" people, through their movements, sounds, smells. Marie-Laure's life intersects dramatically with that of Werner, a young German boy who gets sucked into the Nazi machine.<br/><br/>The characters and ideas in this book rest on a solid frame of multiple, gripping plot strands. Events and characters ultimately converge at Marie-Laure's home in German-held St. Malo, which is being decimated by Allied bombing in the days before liberation in August 1944. Stories don't get more exciting than this. The compassion and empathy for people that fuels the entire book comes to rest in a coda that shows how the survivors or family members cope in the post-war years. I was exhausted and shed some tears in the end. "All the Light We Cannot See" is haunting but also noble and uplifting. No review can capture its complexity and beauty. I highly recommend this awesome book to others.
Such is the title of perhaps the most important and telling short chapter of Doerr's fine new novel All the Light We Cannot See. The chapter title is a neat literary crystallization, much like the compression of carbon into diamond, and reflects the scope of the entire book which attempts, quite admirably, to capture some of the humanity (and inhumanity) of the Second World War. It is an important chapter that reads sometimes dense and terrible, sometimes beautiful, a chapter much like the flame at the center of a singular diamond carefully hidden throughout the story.<br/><br/>I am reminded by Doerr of Ondaatje. Not an imitation, certainly, just reminded; The Cat's Table, In the Skin of Lion. And I think of John Fowles and Eco. Doerr has neatly inserted himself into a set of lasting novelists who use natural wonder, scientific candor, and narrative deftness to a remarkable and intriguing extent.<br/><br/>The structure of the novel is intricately crafted with short chapters, sometimes only a single page of bright intensity. There is intricacy; like a puzzle, a lock, like our human lifetime. Each short chapter in the lives of these young characters would be multiple years for us today, or even ages, such is the gravity of those fearsome days.<br/><br/>There is a fairy tale quality here as well, European, exotic, but frightening at times. These are idyllic settings, but with clouds visible on the horizon. Or is that smoke? Page after page we learn what we must, often what we'd rather not. There are wonderful scenes of incredible now-ness; the fear, the hope, the unknown, then on to more flashbacks to set the scene ever more intricately, making the now ever more...Now. It is a story told in sips, something like the breaths we take while listening for sounds in the dark.<br/><br/>You can read this book for pure narrative joy, and you can read it symbolically as well. Like McCarthy's books there are candle flames imbued with dense gravity, and in the end even a symbolic owl. One can read even the title of the novel at many levels. Radios are critical to the story, a young girl is blind. You will find hidden light at the center of a peerless diamond, hidden light at the center of human hearts.<br/><br/>Across countless chapters there are echoes, connections, memories. There is the connectedness of us to the natural world and it to us. Music brings a rescue, but like Frankenstein so does it bring a monster. The strength of family bears hope, but also grief on both sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>That late chapter is the climax of the novel and the point where we know the Maginot Line has been crossed. It is where the novelist has held up a finely ground mirror to all of us to reflect our world and ask, "See what we have wrought?".<br/><br/>I hope Mr. Doer's next novel does not take another ten years to craft, but should it, I shall be first in line.
This is absolutely stunning. At first I did not buy it as I thought it will be a droning, boring book, full of poetic prose and nothing much else. (Suite Française comes to mind.)<br/><br/>But I was wrong. After much reading reviews on Amazon and researching, I finally made up my mind to buy this in Shakespeare & Co.<br/><br/>Oh! It is fantastic. The prose is as beautiful as it could be, however it does not impede the plot of the story. Despite the large number of characters, Doerr still manages to paint a clear picture, unlike Suite Française. The whole alternating time periods only added to the intensity and suspense of this stunning page-turner.<br/><br/>The characters are beautifully portrayed, although I still have little idea how Marie-Laure looks like. The descriptions of Werner during his stay at the academy is my favourite part. The novel is so very vivid I can see the rushing waves of Saint Malo, the grudging sound of the Opel, the static of the radios—this book is sublime.<br/><br/>I have to praise Anthony Doerr for this magnificent piece of literary fiction. He deserves the Pulitzer Prize.<br/><br/>P.S. The design is also very beautiful, especially the cover. However, the drop cap with spidery serifs are quite irksome to me at first.
Beautifully written, well-realized characters, completely absorbing. he avoids the easy, obvious plot developments for a more nuanced story of two young people from opposite sides experiencing World War II.
[*A few spoilers ahead though I don't mention any names*]<br/><br/>Ok, so first the good: The prose, despite being in present tense was very well written. I was initially bumped but after a while it began to read like pretty poetry. Unfortunately, that's basically all this book ended up being to me, pretty words and details with little coherent plot or meaning.<br/><br/>The whole first 3/4 of the book is set-up, slow and detailed (at times excruciatingly. Don't be fooled by the short chapters) which is fine. I get that certain elements have to be established, and I'll make it through those boring parts because there will be some kind of pay-off at the end, right?...Not in this book apparently.  MAJOR characters just disappear and in such a way that's so vague that you're expecting them to come back, and when you finally find out what happened to them it's second-hand chapters later and its just kind of like "Oh, well guess that person's gone/dead now...." When the two main characters finally meet, its for such a short time and it was just a big let down.  And I still have no idea what happened to that damn diamond. I can appreciate an ending that's open to interpretation but this plot element just seemed to have been glossed over or forgotten.<br/><br/>In the beginning there's so much detail about minutiae then later in the book MAJOR events are just skimmed over in way a that you're not entirely sure what happened, like the blink-and-you-missed-it gang rape of some minor characters. I don't need that in detail, but I had to go back and re-read the passage to be sure that's even what actually happened because it was so vaguely written.<br/><br/>And Anthony Doerr, can I please trade a few pages of snail and ocean descriptions for pages with a little more info on what happened to a character I've spent the last hundred pages getting invested in?<br/><br/>I also have an issue with the book jumping ahead and back in time inexplicably. If this increases the suspense of the novel, go for it. By all means. But in this book it completely kills the suspense of upcoming scenes, so what was the point?<br/><br/>In a well-written novel all these disparate characters and elements should weave together to create a great story and come together with an "Ah" moment at the end, and that just didn't happen here.<br/><br/>I guess I'm too uncultured to appreciate this book, but it left me incredibly unsatisfied.
.... now that we can read this breath-taking stunner of a novel. Anthony's Doerr has simply crafted a masterpiece of a novel. Let me explain why.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a blind French girl with a wise father who works as a locksmith for a Parisian museum. Werner is a runt of a boy with a gift for the magic of radios. World War II rages around them, as these two souls navigate the political and social worlds that threaten them on a daily basis. Together, they form the compelling core of the novel that is both brilliantly written and a true page turner.<br/><br/>All the Light is a book that marvels in its brevity and clarity. Doerr has crafted chapters, some that are merely a page or two long, which inspires the read to read quickly. But his prose, so perfectly crafted, begs for the read to slow down, to absorb it and revel in the language. So many times I had to catch myself and tell myself to slow down. I wanted the story to spin quickly, to find out about both characters, and sometimes, missing some words and missing the beauty of his writing.<br/><br/>Another revelatory feature is the structure of the writing, the time jumping grouping of chapters that at first was a bit frustrating, but soon I adjusted to it. Doerr does this intentionally to draw you into the story more completely, while doling out the information on an as needed basis as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>I want to comment more on the specifics of the story, but won't, for fear of spoiling something important to this wonderful puzzle of a novel. Rest assured, like Captain Nemo prowling the depths of the ocean, you will discover much secret treasures in this story, if you on'y give yourself a chance. When I finished the last page, I knew I had read something special. You will too.
All The Light We Cannot See tells the parallel stories of a young German boy, Werner, and blind French girl, Marie-Laure, following them as they grow into teenagers in their respective countries confronted by World War II.  How their lives eventually meet and intertwine in a seafront village near the Normandy beaches as D-Day approaches is equally sad and hopeful.  Anthony Doerr has developed story of intricate movements and motives that at the same time is peopled by compellingly simple, brave characters.  It's a book that stayed with me long after I finished reading it.
This is a great novel.  Read this and the Goldfinch and you will have had an outstanding year of fiction.
Marie Laure, a 16 year old blind French girl lives with her reclusive great-uncle after fleeing France four years earlier to escape Nazis. 18 year old orphan, Werner, is fascinated with engineering and radios but that intelligence earns him a spot in Hitler's academy for youth. Doerr seemlessly narrates their parallel lives and slowly weaves their fates in this beautiful story about goodness, hope and resilience. -Marisa Robinson, Bloggers Recommend
Even though this setting is rather bleak,  & in a period of history that's hard to comprehend, this is a sweet tale of how goodness will prevail.  The two main characters are trapped by forces around them, yet they strive to rise above all & hang onto the light, love & sense of wonder they had as children.<br/>  I really wanted a happier ending for them, but know life's not like that sometimes, & appreciated the honesty.  It's a sweet read.
I feel it is dangerous to recommend books to friends because what may appeal to me may not appeal to them.  I have been unabashedly recommending this book to not only friends but also my young adult children since I finished reading it.  This is the best contemporary fiction I have read in years.  I read The Goldfinch by Donna Tart in January.  Despite its high acclaim I found it depressing and its rampant drug use was consistently disturbing.  The storyline and characters in "All the Light" were well developed. Often I would re-read sentences or whole paragraphs just to savor the choice of words and careful construction the author took in this work.  When I realized that I as entering the last 25% of the book, I found myself slowing down reading just to make sure I did not miss a word or phrase that might be crucial to the story's resolution.<br/>I know I will re-read this book again.  There are few works of contemporary fiction I can say this about.  I wait anxiously for Anthony Doerr's next book.
A book! Finally!  I feel like it's been decades since I fell into the rabbit hole heart of a novel like this.  What an extraordinary experience.<br/>It spoke to me one day in a Barnes and Noble one and I have no idea why.  I was just drawn to it, like love at first sight.  Like we were meant to be.  And man were my instincts right.  I'm a writer, a professional one (you grew up on my TV shows) and all I can say is this book was a privilege to read.  There were moments that I literally clutched my heart and gasped at the language.  The lush sentences.  The poetry of things that normally would have been dull and mundane in the hands of anyone else.<br/><br/>I found myself listening to soft, long distance classical music while I read and didn't realize that I was becoming as plugged in as the characters were to both themselves and to each other. In this book thoughts and feelings are transmitted directly to us like radio waves while actual radio waves connect faraway people to each other as if inspired by the destiny to come.  I have read a few negative reviews and all I can say is some people simply do not know how to receive this kind of invisible and visible bounty.  Every reading session was yet another gift to be opened and treasured.<br/><br/>It's been SO long since I have read a book.  I'm the opposite of the characters here.  I'm totally PLUGGED in but like most everyone else I'm connected to myself via the choking and limiting narcissism of devices.  I happen to love OTR and to this day find myself drawn into the magic that was once upon a time joke and story telling.  Life used to be as warm as those humming softly lit radio tubes.  It was no illusion that kind of connectivity.  Radio healed a nation during times of war and despair by broadcasting optimism and hope.  It fired imaginations.  You were forced to actively dream in the moment, guided by electrical impulses amplified.  The radio was our national heart and it kept all of ours beating as one.<br/><br/>This is a deeply personal book, but not in the conventional sense.  It is personal in that it feels like a form of prayer from beginning to end.  In fact I have not finished it yet---I have less than 100 pages to go and I'm already feeling the pangs of withdrawal.  I have no idea how I'm going to say goodbye to the lush life of this book.  Its tenderness.  Its thoughtfulness.  Its poetry.<br/><br/>It's been decades since I embraced a quiet, powerful novel like this.  I've been too busy surfing my way through device nonsense with it's endless distractions.<br/><br/>This book is pure oxygen.  It made me feel quiet.  I communed with it.  It made me reflective, moved and more often than not, astonished.<br/><br/>Forget all those self help guru books that you are listening to on audible.com.  You want to understand the human condition?  Walk towards the light  of this book---that we cannot see because it does not matter whether it can be seen or not.  What matters is how the light affects us.  How it changes things.  How it cavorts with shadows and stays alive beneath the endless blankets of darkness.<br/><br/>This book is a living, breathing thing that makes you feel deeply appreciative of all the little things that make us human...and connected.<br/><br/>A million stars is what it deserves.

If I could give “All The Light We Cannot See” more than five stars, I would. I read this amazing book on Kindle and listened to it on Audible, as well. BTW the narrator on Audible, Zach Appelman, is really excellent. His ability to pronounce the French and German names, his articulation and his pregnant pauses really added to the reading of this book.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr’s book is simply stunning. Dazzling is a good word for it.  I have reviewed many other books and have sometimes said this or that writer writes fluidly and well. I have given five stars to quite a few writers. “All The Light We Cannot See” is a higher level of excellence that not many authors achieve. No wonder Anthony Doerr won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction with this book!<br/><br/>The chapters are short and beautifully written. I could say “beautifully and elegantly painted”; they remind me of a painting. This book is poetic, creative, imaginative and historically enlightening as well. Science and technology, it’s fascination and the power to help or harm, is explored along with the characters’ thoughts and feelings; we learn about their courage or lack of and why they make their individual decisions during the rise of Hitler and on into World War II.  The descriptions are incredibly sensitive and vivid. Objects are palpable; I could see and feel them. The book pulled me in so much that I was part of each scene. The poignant images remained with me and made the characters come alive.<br/><br/>The author skillfully writes using a juxtaposition of events in the life of a blind French girl, Marie-Laure LeBlanc, and that of a German boy, Werner Pfennig. Towards the end of the book their lives meet.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure, the blind French girl, lives with her father in Paris. She became blind at 6 years old due to congenital cataracts. She has developed her other senses, namely, hearing, touch and smell to compensate for her loss of sight. In her imagination, she can see colors when she uses her other senses to explore her world. Her father carves wooden replicas of all the buildings in Paris for her to learn to find her way home by herself. He is a very devoted and loving father and teaches her independence but promises her he will always be there for her and will never leave her. He is the master locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. Marie-Laure, who is a curious and bright child, goes with him to work and studies paleontology, archeology, geology and other branches of science with Dr. Gefford, while her father works.<br/><br/>The boy, Werner, lives in an orphanage, “Children’s House” in Zollverein, Germany.  The children in the orphanage are very close to starving. A good deal of the population is very poor and not getting enough to eat. When Hitler comes to power, the economy improves dramatically. People are getting more food (meat even) and new appliances. The German population is inundated with radio propaganda. Only state supported German radio channels are allowed. The German population is brainwashed. The people think Hitler is helping them climb out of poverty, build a better society and take pride in their Country again.<br/><br/>Yet the future looks bleak to Werner. Nazi officials tell the boys in the orphanage that they will all have to work in the coalmines when they turn 15 years of age. Werner’s father had died in the coal mines, and Werner is not happy with the prospect of being underground in the dark pit of the mines. After finding a broken radio in the city trash, Werner gets it working. His fascination with radios and his skill in fixing them gives him a chance to escape the coal mines and go to paramilitary school. He has a chance to pursue his interest in radio technology and contribute to the new Germany. He visualizes a glorious future.<br/><br/> In the attic at the orphanage, Werner and his sister Jutta had listened to foreign radio stations that were illegal under Nazi rule. A French radio station with science lectures fascinated them. How magical it was to hear a voice from afar, transmitted through the air! Jutta liked a program on magnets. Werner liked the program on light. “What do we call visible light? We call it color. But the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other, so really children, mathematically, all of light is invisible.” The radio was a symbol of freedom for them both, the freedom to learn and dream.<br/><br/>Before he leaves for school, however, Werner smashes the radio. He does not want anything to interfere with his chance for what he thinks will be a better life. Listening to foreign radio stations is illegal and dangerous. Jutta, a free spirit with a strong moral compass, feels betrayed. She thinks her brother is turning into a cold, brutal Nazi like Hans and Herribert, two older boys in the orphanage who have joined the brown-shirted Hitler Youth. She insists that the broadcasts from the foreign radio stations say the Germans are committing atrocities, just the opposite of what they hear on the state-owned German stations.<br/><br/>Werner gets caught up with his study of radios and blocks out the brutality around him at school. Despite his lack of courage to go against the dictates of his German superiors, the reader can see his conflict and the goodness in him that he wants to embrace. His friend, Frederick, a bird-lover and dreamer, is called the “weakest” by the field commander but shows his courage by refusing to participate in the brutal death of a prisoner. Frederick pays for it by being beaten so badly that he becomes no more than a living vegetable.<br/><br/>With the invasion of Paris in 1940, Marie-Laure and her father escape to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast and find refuge with Marie-Laure’s great uncle, Etienne. Again her father observes and measures the buildings of this new city and carves a wooden replica of all 865 buildings. Unfortunately, his efforts cause suspicion, and he is arrested on his way back to Paris on an errand for the Museum of Natural History. He is convicted of “theft and conspiracy” and sent to a prison in Germany. Feeling abandoned but gathering her inner strength, Marie-Laure continues to live with her great uncle, Etienne, and his housekeeper Madame Manec. Madame Manec starts working for the French Resistance and Marie-Laure takes over some of her activities when the housekeeper becomes ill.  Upon Madame Manec’s death from pneumonia, Etienne gets his courage up and joins the French Resistance.<br/><br/>Werner finds himself caught up in the brutality with no way to escape. His skill in detecting enemy radio transmissions results in many deaths, some of them innocent civilians. He is haunted by the deaths, especially that of one little girl in Vienna who reminded him of his sister, Jutta. Werner is sent to Saint-Malo to find the source of the radio transmissions of the French Resistance. He finds Marie-Laure’s broadcasts, but does not expose her. He recognizes the radio programs that had inspired him so much as a child. When he hears her voice saying that someone is in her house and is going to kill her, he vows to save her if he can reach her in time. Werner finds her and saves her life. The Americans are bombing the town, but during a lull, he helps her escape Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>Intertwined with the lives of our two main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, fairytale and reality collide. The legend of the “Sea of Flames”, a 133 carat diamond said to be the intended gift of the Goddess of the Earth to the God of the Sea, parallels the calamities the characters experience in their lives.  It was said that the person who had the diamond would live forever, but those he loved around him would die. If the stone were returned to the sea, the curse would be lifted.<br/><br/> Especially during the bombing of Saint-Malo, Marie-Laure and Werner both draw parallels to their own predicaments and Jules Verne’s “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea”. Trapped in the basement of the Hotel of Bees in Saint-Malo, Werner listens to Marie-Laure’s broadcasts of the science programs and music that had been recorded by her deceased grandfather. He thinks of Captain Nemo being trapped under the sea in the Nautilus. Werner and his fellow German soldier, Volkheimer, have run out of food and water and have very little air. “Who could possibly calculate the minimum time required for us to get out? Might we not be asphyxiated before the Nautilus could surface?” Are more monsters awaiting them when they do surface?<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is trapped in her uncle Etienne’s secret attic room where he had broadcast codes for the French Resistance. Down below is an intruder, the Nazi Sergeant Major von Rumpel. He is there to find the “Sea of Flames” diamond, which her father hid in the wooden house replica of her great uncle’s house. Instead of giving it to the Reich for Hitler’s dream museum in Linz, Austria, he wants to have the enchanted diamond to cure his cancerous tumor. He is dying, and he believes the diamond will save his life. Marie-Laure has not had food for two days and has had no water for one and a half days. She starts to think maybe this Nazi will spare her life if she gives him the diamond. Maybe the curse would end and her father would come back. Not trusting her safety, however, she has a knife handy. She thinks of Captain Nemo when he said to Ned Land, the Canadian harpooner, “But let me tell you that if we’re caught, I’m going to defend myself, even if I die doing it”.<br/><br/>There are many levels to this book and much to think about. The reader can get many insights into the human condition and why someone like Hitler could take over Germany and spread his sickness into so many other countries. The book is well researched and taught me a good deal about how it was to grow up in Germany when Hitler came to power. Additionally, I could understand more concretely how it was for the French when France was invaded by Hitler's armies. Good historical fiction brings all these events to life.  Anthony Doerr brings a powerful humanism to the events in World War II.  He made the characters come alive for me. This is a book to ponder, reread and treasure. The author brings an incredible immediacy to his writing that will draw you in and stay with you, perhaps, forever.
This book was beautifully written, and while I enjoyed it overall, there were a few things about it that I thought fell flat. First, the pros: Doerr's use of language and descriptions were fantastic. I really felt as if I knew what Saint-Malo looked like, as well as the other locales within the book. The pacing of the book was also well done, for a book that is over 500 pages, it never felt long. This is mostly due to the short chapters which were usually on average only two or three pages. Anytime a chapter was over 4 or 5 pages it felt out of place. The characters were memorable, especially Marie-Laure and Werner, and the supporting cast were also very well developed, each member of the cast had a purpose to go along with their personalities.<br/><br/>Now, the cons: I didn't think the timeline of switching back and forth was necessary. The story progressed in a linear fashion for most of the book, but focused on the 1944 bombing of Saint-Malo, and kept going back to this randomly throughout. Whenever these sections came about, they distracted me, took me out of the story, and seemed to serve little purpose. Although this storyline is critical in the end and overall plot of the book, I felt all of these scenes could have just come at the end in the linear fashion they belonged and not have made much difference.<br/><br/>(And now some SPOILERS so stop reading if you don't want to know.) Another thing that I found frustrating was the fact that Marie-Laure and Werner do not even meet/find out about one another until over 400 pages of the book has passed. The synopsis talks about how these two lives interconnect, and I felt like there was very little payoff to that sentiment. I would have enjoyed it if they shared more time together, and would have met much earlier in the book. The fact that Werner died right after he and Marie-Laure separate upset me, and did not seem to flow along the rest of the book. I suppose the author just wanted to show how these two random lives came together because of the war, and then were ripped apart again, so for that I can appreciate it, but as a reader I would have been happier if they would have reconnected later on in the future, no matter how much time had gone by. The final pages that take place in 1974 were nice, but the final chapter in 2014 seemed rather pointless. Although the passage about souls floating in the air above us, just like how technology is invisibly transferred through the air was probably the most powerful part of the book, and where the title comes from in part.<br/><br/>I know I have some things to complain about with this, but it's just because I thought it could have been even better (from my reader's perspective.) Nevertheless, it was a good read, and I will recommend it to others, if merely for the scope of the entire piece, if nothing else.
Congratulations Mr. Doerr for you have written, by far, the most captivating and neo-classical novel that I have read in the past decades.  The numerous layers of your storytelling allows readers of varying abilities to gain as much as they can comprehend and savor it nonetheless.  While most will stop at the fact that the title of the book is a parallel reflection on our blind heroine, there is more, much more to be gained through a concerted effort on the part of, you, the reader in this book of prose poetry.<br/><br/>Let us start with the storyline and title itself.  Yes, the heroine, Marie-Laure, is blind and physically cannot visualize anything of the outside world.  But, that being said, she has a deeper understanding of the reality that surrounds her than most could ever comprehend.  The hero of the story, Werner, while having sight cannot see nor visualize that which is most important to him;  the radio waves that surround him and everything else.<br/><br/>Another layer of this story is actually the subplot itself;  the quest and importance of the the fire diamond.  It is quite evident that the German officer believes in the superstition of eternal life that surrounds it but there are other characters who are caught up in its false importance.  The museum itself endangers the lives of four people in order to protect its actual location and the father of Marie-Laure actually endangers his life to its fullest extent by making a feign attempt to travel back to Paris during the German siege.<br/><br/>The people that surround Marie-Laure and Werner expose another level.  No, they cannot fully comprehend why these two persons are different from the norm nor why they have an aura of wisdom and emanate like ‘old souls’ but they do comprehend that a difference exists.  Werner’s giant of a guardian returns his back pack to his sister, Jutta, many decades after the close of WWII,  because he realizes that Werner’s possessions belong to his family and not to a simple soldier.  Jutta, as a child, was fully aware of the multidimensional reality as shown by her insistence that Werner not join the Hitler Youth propaganda machine but through the years and horrendous physical neglect and abuse choose to shut this part  of her awareness down and, therefore, make attempts at living a ‘normal life’.  The return of the back pack, in the end, jostles her memories as she is left sitting through the night staring and thinking into ‘empty’ space.<br/><br/>The war itself, while showing man’s inhumanity to man, brings the foolishness of our asinine definition of  ‘what is ‘life’ into clear focus.  We strive, we argue, we fight and then we kill one another over things that universally are nonsensical;  Who controls a territory?  Who has possession of certain art work?  Why are other races less than the one we have chosen to be superior?<br/><br/>Lastly, and most importantly, the full meaning of the title of “All the Light We Cannot See” is revealed as Marie-Laure sits with her grandchild at book’s end and reflects on her life that passed by so quickly.  As she reflects on the electromagnetic waves that surround and encircle us each day she parallels the electronic devise that her grandchild plays with to the radio waves that enthralled Werner and others many decades ago and then realizes that............”...is it so hard to believe that souls might also travel those paths? That her father and Etienne and Madame Manec and the German boy named Warner Pfenning might harry the sky in flocks, like egrets, like terns, like starlings? That great shuttles of souls might fly about, faded but audible if you listen closely enough?”  Thus the full definition of the title and, thus, we realize ‘that which we cannot see’.  In conclusion, instead of pursuing diamonds, money and treasures, instead of listening to nationalized propaganda, instead of going to war and destroying other people’s lives or instead of any of the mundane, mindless and meaningless things we choose to pursue, why don’t we pursue ‘that which we cannot see’, to listen to “that which is faded but audible”.  Eternity holds the ultimate meaning of life within itself, whereas the few decades we strut and fret upon this Earth does not..........
If you’ve read my book reviews before, you know I rarely give perfect grades. Even if I love a novel, I usually feel uncertain about some part of the story. Then I read Anthony Doerr’s All The Light We Cannot See. Wow. Even days after I finished reading, that’s the best word I can use to describe it: an awestruck, soul-stirred “Wow.” I’ll do my best to summarize my observations and feelings as concisely as I can – because not only did I love this book from the first page to the last, but I also couldn’t find anything I’d do differently.<br/><br/>All The Light We Cannot See illustrates the lives of the blind French girl Marie-Laure and the German orphan Werner as they grow up on different sides of the trenches of World War II. Each scene switches between Marie-Laure’s and Werner’s point of view, with a couple other stragetic perspectives that raise the stakes for both protagonists. In addition, each part (or large chunks of scenes) switches between the present (Germany’s bombing of Saint-Malo in August 1944) and specified years in Marie-Laure’s and Werner’s childhoods. All of the flashbacks are crucial in allowing the readers to bond with the characters, and important in showing how the story culminates during those fateful days in Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>Speaking of character-reader relationships in All The Light We Cannot See: I can’t think of a single character I didn’t bond with. I adore Marie-Laure for her bravery, curiosity, and astuteness, and Werner for his impassioned intelligence and his desire to hang onto his goodness despite the terrible cause he’s part of. Then there’s peculiar Uncle Etienne, whose fierce love and engineering know-how protect Marie-Laure; Madame Manec, whose canned peaches are to die for and small-scale rebellion against the Nazis makes you cheer; Volkheimer, the gentle war “giant” in constant awe of Werner’s engineering genius; Frederick, a budding expert on birds and a tragic example of what happens when a Hitler Youth swims against the tide; and Werner’s little sister Jutta, who’s bright like her brother and perhaps more aware of the dangers he’ll face in the war. I could go on, but the point is that all of Doerr’s characters seem so real, it’s impossible to not fall in love with them.<br/><br/>Now, Doerr’s writing style. If an ocean somewhere ebbed and flowed with his descriptions and sentences, I’d wade in it all day. That’s how evocative and powerful Doerr’s writing is – and he doesn’t write in that manner for beauty’s sake. His word choices, vivid verbs, and inventive metaphors fit every scene where they appear and dig right into the heart of each character. They set your heart a-pounding during the raid on Saint-Malo. They steal your breath when Marie-Laure explores beaches and grottos and when Werner listens to French science lesson broadcasts on his radio. They swell in your throat as both children learn of the horrors of their world, both everyday and due to the war. Somewhere around Page 50, I started keeping a journal of the words and phrases that leapt out at me. I couldn’t tell you the last time a novel inspired me to do that – which speaks volumes about Doerr’s technique.<br/><br/>Lastly, I’m floored by the amount of research Doerr must have done for All The Light We Cannot See. Not just about WWII-era France and Germany, but about seemingly small details such as mollusks, radios, blindness, birds, gemstones. These details add richness and vibrancy to the story, draw you closer to the characters, and ensnare your heart so it’s fully invested in the outcome. This book had me in a constant state of admiration and wonder; I couldn’t help but marvel at the time and painstaking effort Doerr must have spent on completing his manuscript and ensuring the accuracy of even the tiniest facts.<br/><br/>I may read mostly fantasy, but when I read any book I always look for a compelling story, believable characters, and a fluid writing style. Anthony Doerr’s All The Light We Cannot See is a stunning example of all three elements. It’s so well written, and so urgent and successful in convincing you to read another scene, then another, and another, until you lose all track of time. It’s also a prime example of the power of words on a reader. It makes you laugh, cry, hold your breath, bite your fingernails. Most of all, it shows us the impact of life-changing choices that must be made in seconds, and the uncanny ability some people have to see the light – be it compassion, beauty, or potential – in darkened hours and places when others cannot.
The countless stories emanating from the global experience of the Second World War have filled many a book and movie screen, and for those both fascinated and horrified by the time and its tragedies, every new tale brings a unique slant to even the most familiar of scenarios. All The Light We Cannot See does so with a detailed and powerful narrative of two young lives on opposite sides of the political spectrum caught in the maelstrom of a war that ultimately brings them together, if only for a moment.<br/><br/>We meet the brilliant Werner, a German boy whose savant-like grasp of technology brings him quickly to the attention of his superiors, assuring him of a somewhat dreaded advancement in the war effort; we additionally meet Marie-Laure, a blind French girl whose father works at the Paris Museum and who becomes the keeper of a mysterious and fabled diamond coveted by the conquering Reich. As their two disparate stories develop, starting from the initial warmth and innocence of their childhoods to the harsh reality of a time that changes quickly as the war ratchets up, the rich details and finely-tuned exploration of the events, locations, and people of the era make for a read that twists and turns between horrifying and touching. When both children end up in the ancient French coastal town of Saint-Malo -- one hiding from the war, the other propelling it forward, the inevitable collision of their fates brings the story to its compelling conclusion, one that will likely stay with the reader long after they close the book.<br/><br/>All stories of war and its ripple effects are built on the legacy of tragedy and sorrow, but to view the particular carnage of World War II from the perspective of children is all the more heartbreaking. The tenderness of family, the hope of love, the small pleasures of play, companionship, a favorite dessert, a beloved tradition; even just growing up, are all shattered in the relentless and unforgiving march set into motion by adults over whom children are powerless. That both Werner and Marie-Laure endure as ably, and as long, as they individually manage is a testament to their will and endurance, but, sadly, there are no illusions in this tale.<br/><br/>Doerr has written an astonishingly beautiful and compelling narrative. My only complaint came at the end, when I felt the story had reached its natural conclusion and yet the author chose to go on and on, wrapping up each character we'd met along the way, chapter after chapter of what felt like gratuitous and unnecessary knot-tying, even to the point of taking the lifeline of one of the two main characters well past the arc of the story. To put it bluntly, the book felt like it had about ten different endings, all of which had the effect of diminishing the power of its intuitive and natural end. A small complaint, particularly given the heft of the piece, but nonetheless something that felt oddly in need of a good editor.  But still...<br/><br/>A deeply affecting read, gorgeously executed... another powerful contribution to this complex and painfully unforgettable time in our history.
All the Light We Cannot See gives the reader a close-up view of World War II from the perspective of a French girl and a German boy.  Twelve-year-old Marie-Laure is blind.  She lives with her father in Paris, and, although her world is small - her neighborhood, the Museum of Natural History where he works, and her apartment - she has the entire world because of reading and her love of nature.  Werner is an orphan, living with his sister Jutta in the Children's House in a German mining town.  He is fascinated by machinery, circuits, and mathematics.<br/><br/>The lives of these two characters are intertwined through accident and fate throughout the novel, although these connections only become clear as the story unfolds.  The suffering, deprivation, danger, and loss of the war are always present, becoming a character on their own at some points.<br/><br/>The story is suspenseful and engrossing, but what makes this book so special is the lyrical prose.  Marie-Laure imagines the world around her with such detail that the reader can see it as if he or she were there standing beside her.  Even the minor characters are so skillfully developed that they become living, breathing beings inside the covers of the book.  This is the sort of story that remains with the reader long after the book is finished.  Characters and scenes are so distinct and beautifully created that they stay in the mind.<br/><br/>This would be a wonderful novel for high school study.  Charcaters are not black and white.  There is a complexity to this novel that would lead to lively discussions.  It brings to life the impact of World War II on common people, giving students the opportunity to view the events of the era from a new perspective.  I highly, highly recommend this novel.
When Anthony Doerr wrote Memory Walls – a daringly original collection of short stories – three years ago, he had this to say about his work:  “This is not my Big Novel; it’s just a novella. and I’m going to take whatever risks I want to with it.”<br/><br/>All The Light We Cannot See is Mr. Doerr’s Big Novel – in many ways.  It’s lengthy, for one thing – more than 530 pages. It’s packed with strong themes, original characters and  non-stop action. And it has “best seller” stamped all over it.<br/><br/>The action takes place mostly in the 1940s, set during World War II, and like his short story collection, it delves deep into the light that lies deep in our minds, beneath the visible world.  The short, alternating chapters focus on two key characters:  the blind daughter of the master locksmith of Paris’s National Museum of Natural History (Marie-Laure) and the precocious German orphan boy, Werner, who is a whiz with radio transmissions.  There is a symmetry-of-sorts here:  Marie-Laure dwells in the realm of darkness, Werner is immersed in a world of sound.<br/><br/>As Germany invades France, the interweaving of these two stories becomes irresistible.  Certainly I turned pages well into the night and who wouldn’t?  The backdrop of a world war, two very likeable characters, the exploration of what the war does to dreamers and how to be true to oneself during a time of insanity – how could I NOT become engrossed?  Add to this a first-rate mystery -- the Sea of Flames diamond, which comes with a double-edge sword:  the keeper of the stone will live forever, yet misfortunes would unendingly fall upon those he loved.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr is an exceptional prose stylist and his sentences never fail to excite. From start to finish, he is in total command of his narrative. My problem – and I concede that this is very personal – is that there may not have been as much creative risk.<br/><br/>I knew which characters I was supposed to like and which I wasn’t. That is not to say the characters are one-dimensional; Mr. Doerr is too good for that.  It’s simply that none of them particularly surprised me in their actions. (The sinister seeker of the Sea of Flames diamond – Von Rumpel – is perhaps, the only exception;  he DID appear a little too stereotypical.) The entire Sea of Flames sub-story – again, for me – trivialized the more important themes of encapsulated by this line:  “How does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?”<br/><br/>I can easily see All The Light We Cannot See adapted into a movie.  I can definitely see it sitting atop the best-seller list.  It’s a fine book.  Whether it’s the best that Anthony Doerr can do is yet to be seen.
A beautiful story told beautifully. Doerr's writing is rich and every sentence is simply beautiful. Two main stories (and other smaller stories) collide to tell an incredible tale that will reel you in and hold you until the end.<br/>Marie is a young girl living with her father, who is the master locksmith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. She goes blind at the age of 6 and learns to navigate the city by using a model her father builds for her. When the Nazi’s invade, her father flees to his great uncles house is the walled city of Saint Malo on the northern coast of France. But the locksmith holds a secret. Before fleeing Paris, he was asked to carry a decoy of an ancient diamond that may have mystical powers with him, so the Nazis would have a hard time finding the real thing. But is it only a decoy?....<br/>Werner is an orphan in Germany who finds a broken radio and fixes it up with his sister, Jutta. They both become enchanted by educational broadcasts they hear about science. Soon, Werner becomes a master at repairing radios and electrical equipment, earning him a spot at a prestigious Nazi academy and eventually to the front lines of the war in Russia.<br/>This is not a love story, so if that is what you are looking for, this is not for you. But if you are looking for an amazing tale, with beautiful imagery, characters you fall in love with, and a plot that just wont let you put it down, All the Light We Cannot See is perfect for you. One of the best books of the year, and sure to be a classic.
What you start out believing is that this book is a love story. It is far more and different than that.  What you don't know is the depth of the writing and interesting subject matter. I have recommended it to a lot of people. Any age reader would love it.
Anthony Doerr's prose whispers of that which aches and yearns at our soul-centers, and then alternately howls in shame-faced outrage when inner, preternatural demons overpower our humanity. His literary canvas is breathtakingly, heartbreakingly sublime!
What a beautiful book!  Doerr creates unforgettable characters with his marvelous prose and descriptive powers.  Doerr follows the two main characters--young teens growing up in Europe during the terrible times of Hitler.  The boy, Werner, experiences the brutality of schooling at an elite school for Hitler Youth where students are graded on the blueness of their eyes among other things.  He is mechanically gifted and despite his physical shortcomings is protected by his gifts with radios which prove useful to the Third Reich.  The girl, Marie Laure, is a blind French girl being raised by her father in Paris.  They are experiencing the terrors of being displaced by the war and the invading German army.  You cannot help but care for both of these children and how they try to cope.  the book jumps back and forth in both time and place which I found a little confusing, but I was so caught up in the story that it was only a minor annoyance.  The Sea of Flames, a legendary gemstone in the care of Marie's father, is sought by the Germans and brings much grief to Marie's family in keeping with its supposed curse.  Doerr resists any urge to give this book a Hollywood treatment and goes instead with the terrible realities of war torn Europe.  I absolutely loved this well written book.
Sorry, I don't understand why everyone is raving about this book.  I started it, stopped it and read something else - at least three times.  Finally decided I needed to get on with it and finish the book.  The first three quarters of the book dragged, however, the last quarter was interesting and kept my interest. I suppose the ending was worth slogging through the rest of the novel. Interestingly, I have three friends who are also avid readers - they felt the same about this book.
This may be my favourite book of the year so far, it is elegantly written , I read the entire book in two days, I literally couldn't put it down. Mr Doerr's prose is lyrical and the descriptions of people caught up in a war that they don't want to fight are so compelling, on both sides of the conflict , that you root for all of them. I found myself weeping for the last 40 pages or so as the war comes to its end and some characters lives are also ended. A gorgeous and melancholy masterpiece.
I'm usually one who buys my books off of amazon but this on I picked up on a whim after hearing such rave reviews. Reading the synopsis in the store I thought this might be a rather interesting story taking place during World War II. I just love stories set during the World War II era. Unfortunately I was wrong with this choice. This is by far my least favorite read of 2014.<br/><br/>The story, although written well by the author is just too slow moving and quite boring in my opinion. Well the middle of the story did pick up but by the end it went downhill from there. I honestly felt that I was forcing myself to finish this novel for the simple fact that I didn't want to feel like I wasted my money. Sadly, I did.<br/><br/>As for the characters, Marie ( the blind-girl) was the only one that I truly enjoyed. Her story was well developed. She felt almost real. Werner on the other hand just seem like a name the author printed on paper. He was two dimensional with no personality that I could see. Many of the minor character were stereotypical and boring and not that interesting. I didn't care for any of them.<br/><br/>Secondly, this story could have been 200 hundred pages shorter. Minor character stories didn't need to be resolved at the end of the book. I think the author was just writing just to write.<br/><br/>So for those who like slow moving, well written World War II novels with two dimensional characters then this is the book for you. But I suggest you buy used or rent from the library. Not really worth the money in my opinion
The writing style started out as vibrant, surprising and lush. But by the time I got through the first three quarters of the story I was word-weary. The last quarter of the story was such a downer, I skimmed the final pages, not caring what happened to those who survived. My favorite characters did not survive. Ultimately I feel my time could have been better spent reading something less depressing.
I am a book lover, I have a book going at all times. This book is not my normal fare, but I thought I would give it a try considering the very high reviews plus I figure I should broaden my horizons.<br/>It started out interestingly enough but went nowhere and all over the place at the same time, forward and backwards in time (which I find annoying)<br/>I hung in there trying to finish it hoping for a payoff at the end, but it was not to be, hated the ending.<br/>Such a blase description of a young lady getting gang raped at the end, what's the deal with that?<br/>Don't waste your time with this, unless you are an artsy type who will read it and love it for some abstract-beyond-my-understanding reason.
The book is beautifully written but drags a little too much for my reading style.  I am glad I stuck it out to the end since the stories of the two principle characters came together towards the end which made it so much more meaningful.  A lovely book. One error in the book.  He refers to the use of a ballpoint pen, which did not exist during WWII.
The structure of the novel is that the main events take place in August 1944 in France, and the background of major events begins in 1934. The author alternates between the two characters and the two countries, Germany and France.<br/><br/>In 1934, Marie-Laure, six-year-old girl, lives with her father in Paris. He works as a locksmith and in a museum in Paris. By the beginning of the novel the girl has completely lost her eyesight and now relies entirely on sound, smell and touch. Growing up at the museum, Marie-Laure knows almost all exhibits, guide’s stories, as well as the legend associated with the most valuable item in the museum - hidden in the vault the diamond size of an egg with, which, according to legend, has a curse. The father of the little girl masters castles and houses in miniature. On these models the girl learns to distinguish objects by touch, and later to walk unaided. Using a cane, Marie-Laure can safely move into a familiar space. The girl does not go to school (at that time, apparently, there was no school for children with disabilities), but her father every year gives her books for the blind. Marie-Laure learns to read and absorb with gusto "Around the World in 80 Days", " 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea", and later a volume of Darwin.<br/><br/>In 1934 the second book hero Werner Pfennig was seven. He and his sister Jutta are orphans living in the child's home in the small German town. Werner since childhood manifested a talent for fixing mechanical objects, especially radios. Being eight-years-old he could with his eyes closed assemble and disassemble the radio. Gradually, word of his talent spread around, and the neighbors began to bring their receivers to Werner for repaire. With his sister in the evenings he listened to a French wave, where a man read fairy tales. Thanks to their teacher Frau Elena, the brother and sister learned French and could listen to the radio.<br/><br/>All the boys from the orphanage are expected to become miners, once they reach 15. But Werner shows his talent, receives a letter of recommendation from the local man, passes the entrance exams to elite school, where young talented men are trained for the Third Reich. Werner successfully passes the exams and goes to an elite school, promising to write to his sister. Jutta is worried about her brother, realizing the danger of the Nazis that came to power. But Werner does not care about the war, he just wants to go to university in Berlin and study Physics.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr has written what seems to be quite realistic book, but it reads as something fantastic, something out of Jules Verne, whose books coincidentally the heroine of the novel reads. The story itself is full of adventures, mysterious artifacts, references to fairy tales, incredible coincidences and bright and pure love. War according to Doerr has nothing to do with the reality of war, this is romantic world, fantasy of sorts. But if the writer is a romantic, it does not make him worse than others. The war has given a premise to thousands of stories, and romantic ones have the same right to exist as a purely realistic.<br/><br/>Two heroes of Doerr’s book are on opposite sides, one potentially on the side of evil, the other on the side of good. It is hard, however, not to sympathize them both, if the author is equally fond of his characters. Werner is not guilty, that he was born in Germany and grew up without parents. It's not his fault that he was born with the talent and wanted to develop his talent. He just wanted to go to university, wanted to do things he loveв to do, wanted his sister to be proud of him. He was not a soldier (Marie-Laure later remember that Werner’s hands were even smaller than her hands), he was a young talented boy. “What the war did to dreamers” – Jutta’s words in the finale of the novel, meaming war killed people like him, are in many ways a reflection of the whole work.<br/><br/>Doerr runs slightly ahead with the chapters of August 1944, but the intrigue definitely is saved until the very end. The finale can break any heart made of stone, and even epilogue’s chapters does not seem superfluous.<br/><br/>This charming story is lightly smeared by stylistic flaws. Doerr uses abrupt, short sentences, especially in the beginning of the book, which are contrary to the atmosphere of the novel. These sentences express banalities devoid of individuality and often present only stylistic beauty. Once the author extends a sentence, the novel begins to move faster. Doerr has a vivid style and the use of obvious epithets only hurts the style.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is an undoubted success, and only the blind won’t see the author’s talent.
The Reader reads this exhausting recitation of parallel present tense phrase triads on the stairs, in the bed, in the kitchen sink; she reads in the springy moss-green iron garden chair, on the creaky wicker porch swing, and under the ten thousand russet leaves of the swamp oak tree.  She reads it in a box.  She reads it in her socks.  She reads it with a fox.  She reads the lyrically metered metaphor-laden opening chapters one, two, three times, until the relentless pattern of  triple lists, triple phrases, triple objects batters her brain, frustrates her patience, overwhelms her sensibilities.  As if tens of millions of gasoline scented, treacle-soaked, rose-colored adjectives have exploded, splintered, flamed through the sea of air swarming with waves of sound, light, amber grain.  Bread box, waste basket, orangutan. Animal, vegetable, minaret.<br/><br/>Sentence fragments. Terseness.  Knocks? slaps? bumps? The blue-bruised Reader is jarred and jostled like a sweetly innocent unsighted girl smacking abruptly into the invisible.  Wall. Chair leg. Table corner.<br/><br/>Fits. Starts. Words. Pauses.  All morning the Reader forges haltingly onward like a brave and achingly pure-hearted sightless French child touching One. New. Word. At. A. Time.  Each an island. Isolated.  Each with its own uniquely crenelated shoreline.  Strung out in a marching archipelago. Like a  hanging row of keys.  Or a line of shells.<br/><br/>Carefully and deliberately, like the violet sea snail, the Reader builds her raft. It is raft of Awareness that will bear her afloat over the white-tipped sea of this novel's overblown metaphors, murky syntax, and deadly-earnest inhabitants.
Wanted this book to end after 300 pages!  It just goes on and on and on.  Waiting for the lives of Werner and Marie laure to converge - and they did.......for a day.  Awful ending, boring book, senseless plot re to the dangerous jewel.  Cannot understand its best of 2014 rating.  Would never recommend.
This is a spectacularly written book.  However, I felt the story should have ended fifty pages earlier, at the union/separation of the two main characters. The long, drawn-out tying-up-loose-ends felt dry and too defined to an otherwise juicy story.
The book is exquisitely written with poignant detail and heartbreaking moments. The problem lies with the narrator of the audiobook. It is monotonous, there is a complete disregard for French and German  accents, pronunciations, place names, and,frankly, it sounds as if the narrator is reading an English class assignment which he himself finds very tedious. My recommendation:  Buy the book & skip this audio version.
The point of view character is a very young blind girl. That alone was unique and fascinating to read about, and also lent a new poignant angle to a (necessarily) much-written-about era. The story flowed well and is memorable and touching.
This is the first book I bought with kindle because of the high rating.  The book is very slow and not much happened until I hit the 75% of the book.  I finished it only because I don't want to waste the 6 bucks I paid for it.
Story of Marie and Werner, little lost souls during WWII, who never come together until the end of the book.  I read this based on all the glowing reviews it got, but what a slog it was for me.  Kind of like my reaction to The Goldfinch -- could have told the story in half the pages.  His imagery is often beautiful, but I can't abide those two and three word sentences.
It's unbelievable! Such amazing reviews, but this has to be the MOST BORING book I've ever read! I plodded through just to find out the ending. I wish there were a way to get a refund.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!
What a disappointment. So much lacking in the closure of these characters.  The author could have really expanded on the outcomes. I don't want to ever be a book spoiler but, this one could have been great. There could have been so much more depth, they were all lack luster. The characters never opened up or asked questions of each other to tie up emotional loose ends. I just wanted to finish it and be done. As usual we made exceptional women, brats. The men were angry and weak. So much good content to work with but, the authors depth and creativity was lacking.
First half was beautifully written and had the potential to weave all the characters together in a meaningful way.  Instead, it felt like the ending was just thrown together and summarized with no real thought.  Very disappointing.
I thoroughly enjoyed All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. The story was historically well-researched, involving, sensitive and thoughtfully portrayed and paced well. The characters were intriguing and sympathetic. This story gave a remarkable insight into how WWII affected people, especially children, on both sides. The Nazi's brainwashing methods exercised on their own children, are as horrifying as the effects of their occupation on children in occupied countries, in this case, France. The most horrifying aspect of this exposure, is that these are the effects on children the Nazis were not trying to harm - German and French children. Doerr doesn't even go into what happened to Jewish, Polish, or Russian children.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Doerr needed a good editor to work on his ending, which loses the thread and theme of his story and peters out into a pointless series of post scripts along the lines of "this is what they were like at 50 and this is what they were like at 80."<br/><br/>Well worth the read, though - great characters, gripping action, and a brilliant insight into a segment of Europe rarely considered in most books on WWII.
Tragically beautiful!! I really loved this book, from the first couple pages. The author takes us back in time to WWII with beautiful prose and colorful characters. This was our first pick for my book club and we really enjoyed it. The book takes a unique position on the war, one we really haven't seen before and that kept me turning the pages. When we think of WWII, we tend to paint the German's as the bad guys and everyone else as the hero's, but through Anthony Doerr's novel you see a different side to the war and humanity. I found myself rooting for Werner and Marie, I wanted both of them to make it out alive even though they're on opposite sides of the war.<br/><br/>One of the last lines in the book really hit home for me. How everyday someone who lived through the war dies and we lose their stories forever. When I closed the book, it really made me think about life and how we don't appreciate the little thing. How we get upset when we don't have cell service or if we're in a cafe and there's no wifi. In a world so connected, we've forgotten how to connect to the world around us and learn the untold stories in someone's heart.
This novel has a grand concept and promises much. And it won an Pulitzer Prize, which is quite a recommendation. But, like many people, I found it hard to finish.<br/><br/>The story centers around Marie-Laure, a young French girl during World War II who becomes blind. Her father's remarkable way of dealing with this affliction is to make a scale model of Paris and have Marie-Laure use her fingertips to memorize the shapes of the streets and buildings. Lest you question the logic of this, there is a scene where Marie-Laure's father has her find her way home by comparing the steps and walls of one alleyway to the model, although I found it a bit of a stretch.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Germany, we have the story of another child in a terrible situation--Werner, who turns out to be an electronics genius. Without ever having had seen a crystal radio set, he finds one in a trash heap, takes it back to the orphanage and repairs the coil of wire and the orphans and nuns can listen to music and more importantly, the news of the war. Werner's astonishing skill--again, something that stretches the credulity, brings him to the attention of the military. They put him in a brutal school for Nazi elite.<br/><br/>Naturally, he and Marie-Laure, who now has relocated to St. Malo on the coast, will meet. And there is also a gigantic blue diamond with a curse, perhaps hidden in a puzzle box build by Marie-Laure's father.<br/><br/>The problem I had with this book wasn't the plot--or the even-handed way the Nazi portion of the story is dealt with, because from Werner's side, the Germans are not the enemy. The problem I had was the ponderous, almost amateurish style. The children talk like contemporary children, in idioms you'd expect in 2014, not in 1941. The level of sadistic violence is almost lovingly detailed.<br/><br/>I tried re-reading it using Audible (a decent narration) but in the end, I returned. I just hated it. It seemed in the end not well written, a huge subject with great plot twists that was inexpertly written and perhaps gotten away from the author.
I found this book to be depressing and hard to read.  It jumped around way too much from one decade to another.  Just because the subject matter is WWII and the terrible way the Germans treated other people and their own recruits, that does not automatically make it a "best seller".
I struggled with this book and made it 49% through.  Decided to forgo the remainder since reading this book felt like torture.  I was not able to connect with any of the characters as they seemed incredibly stupid and irritating.  The Sea of Flames plot was ridiculous.
I've read several books with plots set in World War II, but this one is the one that haunts me the most.<br/><br/>"All The Light We Cannot See" is reminiscent of "The Book Thief" in the way it focuses on two children who grow up during the prelude to World War II, but it has an original, distinctive style of its own and is just as well-written in its own way. Also like that book, it portrays how ordinary people were affected and shaped by the war, and the sufferings they went through (yes, even the German people. Many German people did not agree with the Nazi regime, but it was almost impossible to openly stand up to it).<br/><br/>This novel, however, has some interesting twists - the two young people who are its main characters are on opposing sides. One is a blind girl who ends up working for the French resistance, one is a young Nazi-trained soldier with a genius for electronics but also with a conscience that makes him more and more aware of the atrocities of the war he is fighting. There is even a hint of fantasy in the existence of a mysterious diamond with supposedly magical powers. The story is told in short, alternating point-of-view chapters, and switches back and forth in time (which some readers may find confusing or distracting, but which I thought added to the suspense) until their stories finally converge during the siege of Saint-Malo in Brittany.<br/><br/>Best of all is the author's lyrical, precisely detailed writing; his masterly crafting of his characters; and the sense of hope he ultimately leaves us with as he shows how people can retain their humanity even in the depths of war.
This is a magnificent book!  The author is truly a poet, a historian, a scientist & a dreamer.  Although it deals with the brutality & devastation of war, we see it through the eyes of Werner, the boy with white hair & big ears with a gift for electronics who became a radio conscript for the Reich. We read of the courage of old women in St. Malo, the ancient walled citadel off the coast of France, who devise their own ring to report German positions to the Allies through loaves of bread!  And we read also of the silent rushing of flocks of birds over frozen fields at night, of thousands of snails clinging to dark grottos as the tides flow in & out. Of a young blind girl who finds the courage to navigate the ruined city by counting landmark.  The long dead velvet voice whispering out over Europe about the moon, about how a tiny piece of coal is born over countless ages, telling the children to dream, to see until their eyes are closed forever. There is so much in this book.  Anthony Doerr is a dreamer.
Once I got into the two characters and their interwoven points of view, I lost myself in this WW2 literary thriller. The story eventually brings together a German boy locked into the world of military bullying with a blind girl, whose father hides a precious, cursed stone from the Nazis.<br/><br/>Yes, it won the Pulitzer prize, and I can see why - big, ambitious, ten years in the writing and different. I loved the central image of the voice reaching out on war-time radio. I was completely immersed in the experiences of the main characters,<br/><br/>However, I was disappointed with the way the story lost itself, especially in the ending. Having written my review, I looked at what others thought and I agree with the best and the worst! Perhaps that's what ambition means? It reaches so high, it falls short. Some parts clunked - a small example is that no blind person I've known could dance gracefully. Overall though, this was a read that stayed in my mind, long after finishing the book.
I finished All the Light We Cannot See last night and I’m stunned. I don’t think I’ll be able to read another book for a while because it has spoiled me, or perhaps I don’t want to spoil the experience.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is now my very favorite book of all time.<br/><br/>It is a 530 page novel about two children growing up in France and Germany during World War II.<br/><br/>The girl, Marie-Laure, lives in Paris and then takes refuge in Saint-Malo, the last Nazi stronghold in the war, with her father. He is the lock keeper for the National Museum and is gifted at keeping intricate secrets and at constructing miniature villages for Marie-Laure, who is blind.<br/><br/>The boy, Werner, lives with his sister in an orphanage in a coal-mining town, and is chosen to attend an elite engineering school for the Nazis. He is a whiz at math and science and constructs radios and other technical equipment from leftover wires and scraps found near his orphanage.<br/><br/>The structure of the novel alternates from the story of Marie-Laure to Werner, and in its short chapters, weaves their stories together until they collide in a glorious and unexpected way.<br/><br/>This is a novel which has, through two ordinary characters and a war, pricked the surface of life and changed the way I see it now. Isn’t that what the very best of stories does?<br/><br/>I loved the story, the characters, the settings and themes, the language and writing, the resonance.  It is a beautiful book, and yet now that I’ve finished, I feel the need to start it again…
For me this is a quiet book.  Sad, horrible and beautiful.  I thought the characters were well developed and they felt real to me. It's been awhile since I really enjoyed reading a book as much as I did this one.<br/><br/>Some reviewers didn't like the ending, but I thought the author brought wonderful closure to all the characters who had a relationship to Werner.  When I finished it I just sat for awhile sorry that it ended.<br/><br/>If you want a page turner with fast action, this is not the book for you.<br/>If you don't like flipping back and forth between time lines, this is not the book for you.<br/>If you don't like very short chapters, this is not the book for you.<br/>(I liked that the chapters are very short. I never had to stop reading mid chapter which I hate to do.)<br/><br/>The first half of the book was, I admit, slow.  But it kept me engaged enough that I continued and at about 60% I didn't want to stop reading.<br/>It's a beautiful book.
I truly do love history novels of literary significance. However, this book is so boring and so slow, reading it for our book club was like pulling teeth. I had high hopes for this book based on customer reviews, but really, it's dull. Almost nothing interesting happens in the entire book, and the characters lives and internal dialogues are not vivid enough to make up for the slow and lackluster plot. In the end, Doerr fails to provide any new insights or creative voices to an already over-produced time period. I feel like I have forgotten most of the book before it is even finish b/c it's not really worth the effort to remember it.
CRAP
I wonder how this book got the Pulitzer and where all the glowing reviews come from.  It was so repetitious (about his homesickness, about the little house and how it popped open, about radios!!!!)  And what was it with that diamond?  It needed serious editing,  There were factual errors that almost made me put it down right away, but it was for a book group, so I "soldiered" on.  It could have been reduced easily by one third.  And what a waste of paper.  This makes me really wonder about the reviews, the promotion by the publisher, and the serious lack of editing.  I also didn't think the writing was beautiful.  I get tired of short phrases substituting as sentences over and over.  Check your facts, and take the time to write a complete sentence.  And some of the dialogue was so wrong for the time period that I felt insulted.
I just finished reading this book for the second time, hoping to discover what everyone else is raving about. The first time I read it after a customer at our library used book sale said it was the best book she had ever read. I tried to get into it, but ended up skimming a lot. The short chapters with short sentences/not sentences, and the switching between characters and time periods (which usually does not bother me) did not work for me for this book. I never connected with any of the characters - which is a problem in a character-driven book I can live with it in a plot-driven book.<br/><br/>So why did I read it again? Because it was the selection for my book club; and I thought perhaps if I went into it without the great expectations I would find out what I missed the first time. Wrong. I am normally a very fast reader, going through two or three books a week (and sometimes more). It took me almost three weeks to get through this book. This time I didn't skim. I would fall asleep after reading 10 pages or so. Two members of my book club have already raved about how wonderful this book was, so I know I will be a minority voice when we have our discussion. I suppose some of the writing is beautiful, but I found much of it tedious.
I am an avid reader and typically not easily impressed. This book was amazing. The author wove the story so uniquely and the characters are so vivid and not stereotypical. The WWII context tells you that it is going to be heart wrenching, but there is also so much hope and love. It reminds me of the way I felt about Book Thief after reading it. I read this on vacation and the day I finished it, I could not pick up another book. My husband asked me why I wasn't reading, and I told him that this book was so good that I have to give it the proper respect it deserves. He thought I was crazy but my daughter totally gets it. I picked up two books since then and can't really get into them. I am going to reread this one. Seriously amazing. I am buying copies for friends for Christmas.
When I started reading this book, I thought I would struggle with french & german words and their meanings, places, and history but after getting through the early chapters, it became clear this was a very well-written book about two very special people in blind french girl Marie-Laure and german boy Werner.  The way author Anthony Doerr alternated each chapter to  cover Marie-Laure's life and Werner's life you were never bored.  After the first 10 chapters or so, it was a tough book to put down.  The ending was not what I expected but that's what make good books great.  This book will challenge your mind from the story/plot side as well as the artistic value by the author.  After two weeks finished, I still think of the book and it's characters almost daily.
My boyfriend and I listened to the audible version of this book.<br/>We loved it! My boyfriend is blind, so we listen to a lot of audiobooks and we wanted to find a different genre than what we were used to (crime/thriller). So I found this one and decided to give it a try.<br/>We fell in love with the characters in the first hour and we couldn't stop listening. We finished the 16 hours in three days.<br/>Towards the end, it does become a bit slow but it still keeps you listening.<br/><br/>A beautiful story, I don't want to say more and risk spoiling anything!<br/>I love the writing, it's full of interesting details and you feel like you're right in the scene! it's almost like you can hear the bombs and feel the cold in your bones.
This is the story of a blind Parisian girl, Marie-Laure, and an orphaned German boy, Werner. It is set during World War 2, my favorite period of history, in Germany and France. Marie-Laure and Werner's stories are told in a parallel narrative, and their lives are intertwined in ways they do not know. They only meet briefly at the end of Germany's occupation of France, Saint-Malo specifically, but their meeting was long destined by fate.<br/>This is a beautifully written novel about family, friendship, love, being true to one's self and doing the right thing, especially during times of war. The characters are so finely wrought that they are certain to remain with you long after you finish reading. It is a truly amazing novel.
The book details a film-worthy story about two young people caught by circumstance of birth on opposite sides of World War II.  Doerr's method is artfully crafted to give readers the experience of story.  Using brief chapters, jumbled timeframes, and snippet descriptions, we feel the chaos, uncertainty, joy and pain of the times. With few words, one poignantly knows fear, impermanence, aloneness, hunger, inner truth and lying. Ultimately, we have a clearer perspective on the value of being still and knowing that we take our places in the never ending procession of life and death as both person and spirit.  We feel the  power of being present, both giving and receiving what is today with gratitude, not borrowing for tomorrow.
This was the book of the year for me!  The prose is so beautiful: the descriptions of scenery, objects and people are full without being tedious and the emotion sometimes brought tears to my eyes.  The last part of the book reads like as a suspense novel.  The ending was a bit of a surprise but it was very appropriate.  I actually had to read the last 25 pages over again to make sure I hadn't missed something because I was reading so fast.<br/><br/>I liked the way the novel was divided in to short chapters.  It was easy to put down and pick up again as I was very busy while reading it.<br/>I would recommend this to all adults who love beautifully written historical fiction during the WWII era.
Too verbose and detailed.  Lost interest because there was too much description.  Do not recommend this book to anyone unless they can concentrate completely and skip over much of the detail
I think this book was amazing.  It gave a voice to the young men that were recruited into Hitler's army.  I have never really thought about the young men that went blindly into an army thinking they were going to help their country and were blinded to the atrocities going on around them.  Then add a story line of a young French girl who too blindly went through the horrors of war in her life.  I liked the fact that there was no happy ending between the two main characters.  How just a chance meeting changed the courses of their lives, even if just for a moment.  Well written, interesting and thought provoking.  A wonderful, sensitively done book.
This is such a stunning, gorgeously written and totally original novel. I knew Mr. Doerr's work before (he mentioned struggling with this in his book Four Seasons in Rome which is also gorgeous) but I never could have expected such a wonder. Not at all easy at times: the brutalities of World War II and of man against man are made painfully vivid by his evocative writing of two young people (a blind French girl who loves mollusks and a brilliant German adolescent boy who builds radios and decodes the enemies' messages for the Nazis to avoid being sent to the coal mines and who is slowly devoured by the muddy darkness of the war).
I thought this book would be a no brainer.  10,000+ reviews on Amazon with an overall 4.5 star rating.  Unfortunately it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>My main complaints:<br/>(1) author was overly wordy - this book could have been half the length it is<br/>(2) slow moving story.  the book is divided into multiple quick chapters that alternate between characters, but it still drags<br/>(3) terribly disappointing ending.  I won't spoil it for you, but I felt let down when I reached the end.<br/><br/>I seem to only review books on Amazon that I either loved or hated.  Unfortunately, this one seems to fall in the latter
Love this book, in fact I am re-reading because I read it so fast the first time that I wanted to go back and make sure I didn't miss a word.  Really brought World War II history back to me.  I was born in 1938, the year the book story was started, and it was a very up close look into the Germans and French lives during the war.  I know it is a novel, but beautifully and historically relevant.  Just a wonderful read; have not read the author's other novels, but certainly will.  Of course, will have to finish my second reading first!!!  Mr. Doerr lives in Boise, as do I, and hopefully will meet him someday.
Preposterous tale involving a magic stone, unbelievable coincidences.  Some people love the writing,but I found it sentimental, and I disliked his constant shifting of time and place.
We LOVE audio books. They keep us entertained and alert during trips. This story and narrator absolutely put us to sleep in 45 minutes. I had to turn it off. The narrator had a monotone voice. The story got nowhere in 45 minutes. It was 45 minutes of extended descriptions of the same scenes. Augh!
I am instantly attracted to novels written from the point of view of children who grow into thoughtful young people. Anthony Doerr does this uncommonly well. His insightful presentation of the prelude to World War II, elements of the war itself, and war's end on the western front--all as experienced by a brilliant German boy who becomes an operative of the Nazi forces and a blind French girl who flees the advancing conqueror--is riveting. As war's end approaches and the young girl is left to fend for herself it's impossible to put the book down. This novel is a real page-turner.
I just finished this yesterday and cannot recommend this highly enough. It's an absolutely beautifully written book. Though the plot does hold the attention, this is very much a character driven book. Any attempt to summarize the characters on my part will not do them justice. All I will say is that this book truly made me think about what I would do in the same situations Werner and Marie Laure faced— be complacent and safe-ish or risk my life and the life of my family to do what I felt was right. I probably will not stop thinking about this book for weeks. Highly recommended!
Wow!  I was alive and a young girl during WWII, and have been teaching U.S. and World History for the last 54 years, and this<br/>held so true to events, places, and possible people.  It was so well written, that I often went back to enjoy the wording.  [I also<br/>teach writing at a high school and college and graduate level.]  He wove the two protagonists stories together so beautifully, and<br/>[sadly for me] the ending was true to the story and really couldn't have been any other way.  Rats!  Didn't exactly read like feel-good fiction<br/>it read - REAL -
I loved reading this cleverly written and deeply introspective WWII novel. Anthony Doerr brings together two bone-different young lives, a blind French girl and a Germen orphan boy, both unselfishly examining their own thoughts and feelings. He writes explicitly about Marie-Laure's (lifelong) fascination and knowledge of mollusks and Werner's brilliant understanding (and success) as he studies electro-mechanical waves at a German military academy. All historically accurate from the WWII perspective, totally implausible, but compelling and thrilling to the end.
I bought this book because of all the great reviews it got and because it was considered literary. The book is a flavor of the week and will not be remembered. In striving for the lyrical it becomes sentimental. It was a contender for the National Book Award and rightly lost out to Phil Klay's Redeployment. I say go read that book for a work of excellence in fiction from 2014.
Good story line, and I am usually very hesitant to read "war-time genre" novels. (These type of books are too depressing for me.) But the author did a very good job drawing you into the 2 main characters stories/lives. I was just disappointed in the actual amount of time that the 2 character's paths actually crossed in the book. It was such a big buildup to their meeting, and had such potential to be great. I feel like it could've been a 5 star book if there was more time spent between these characters bonding/trying to survive together.
Mr. Doerr not only makes us see the world of his characters, but he makes us hear, taste, smell and touch that world.  It is the finest piece of descriptive writing I have ever read.  The characters and settings are so imbedded in your mind that they will creep into your mind days and weeks after turning that last page. For readers of WWII historical genre it will take you on a long  and sad journey of the savagery and deprivaton of this era. But in the end you will be rewarded with having travelled it with a blind girl who somehow surivives.
This was one of the best books I've read recently -- a beautifully told story of the randomness of life. Here you meet two young people whose paths cross briefly in ways that forever change them. The elegant narrative is haunting, the short chapters make it difficult to put the book down, and the tension of wartime adds to the drama. I was reminded a bit of The Book Thief in the way that Werner and his sister Jutta are pawns of the German Reich. What might their lives have become if not for the war? Definitely recommend.
After reading the Amazon Reviews, noting the WWII setting, and especially after spending $14.00, I really wanted to like this book. But ALWCS was a "slog" for me to get through.  Chapters bouncing back and forth between characters and time made the reading disjointed and frustrating. Main characters were only mildly engaging . If this hadn't been a selection for my book club, I wouldn't have persevered.  Many interesting ideas, descriptions and concepts, but for me it didn't have the cohesiveness it deserved.
Reveals the human heart so beautifully, its occasional joys, its wonder, its many sorrows. Finely wrought, an act of grace.
I love historical fiction, especially about World War II.  This book ranks among the best I've ever read. The story is compelling and the writing is lovely. I felt as though I really knew the characters. I've been telling all my friends to read it. I was haunted for days after I finished it (in the wee hours of the morning because I couldn't put it down).  I bought it because Kate Morton suggested it on her Facebook page. Since she is one of my favorite authors, I knew I would like it. I highly recommend this book.
Yet another novel about WWII, but so very well-written, it's worth one's time.  Set alternately in France and Germany, it follows the lives of two main characters from childhood and portrays how their circumstances, innate natures and the war shape and affect their abilities to cope with, and rise above, the horrors of that time.  Written without drum rolling drama, the author takes the reader by the hand and guides her along the storied path, unhurriedly but so compellingly, that I didn't want to put it down.
I won't summarize this story as others have. I’m just here to say that I have thoroughly enjoyable. This is a wonderful novel.<br/><br/>It is a beautifully written tale, which has left me feeling sad that it is over<br/><br/>I think a couple of the characters in particular will live on in my mind forever.<br/><br/>I loved how the different threads of the story came together. I also really appreciated how the story was told in short episodes<br/><br/>Really, I can't do this book justice with my praise.
Too many needless characters & too many changes in alternating persons.  Hard to follow story. No emotion in characters.
This wonderfully crafted story recalls for us the terrible immediacy of World War II in France and in Germany and gives us young people who are caught up in events beyond their imagining. As the title suggests, there is light above the darkness that surrounds the characters who are not super heroes but realized human beings.<br/><br/>I could hardly put down the book; I was thoroughly caught up in it to the extent  that when I finished reading, the characters and the events lingered with me for days.
This marvelous book focuses on a German boy & a French child whose lives are forever altered by living during wartime in Europe. It's an emotional as well as physical journey for the characters & leaves the reader emotionally spent. The author writes so descriptively & truly paints a vivid picture of the characters' lives leading up to & enduring the war & it's aftermath.<br/>I highly recommend this book for adults as well as mature teens. It deserves the rave reviews it's received.
I cannot remember reading a book where I became the characters, experiencing their joy, their fears, their courage and resilience amidst the horrors of war. At times, I was so close to the them that I needed to put the book down!  I needed courage to resume reading.  It was an excellent read, highly recommended to those who want to risk stepping outside of themselves for a while, to experience the bravery of others.
a wonderful book. I have been recommending it to all my friends. The author takes you through this difficult time in history and you feel for the two young heroes.  The  description of the surroundings through the blind eyes of the little girl is very captivating<br/>and on the other side the way the young man ends up surviving the craziness ; the secondary characters are also quite interesting<br/>a great read
Very inspired historical fiction. It shows both sides with humanity; I think with truth as well. The method of going back and forth in time and place with the characters added interest. His style made it reasonably easy for you to know where and when you were most of the time. The longer I read the harder it was to put it down. A really good read. BUT I am glad I did not live in those places at this time.
I guess I'm just not cool enough to enjoy this book as much as others seem to have. I waded through it on the recommendation by a friend. I thought I would appreciate the history and love the story, but I just...didn't. It was a great story, but I just didn't feel like I wanted to stick with it at all. I did finish it and didn't particularly care for the ending either. I wish I could've liked it more.
I am an English teacher and former book editor so I scrutinize everything I read. Doerr's use of non-sight imagery is brilliant.The is one of my all-time favorite books. It's not often one connects with a book so deeply. Amazing. I'm without words to adequately express how wonderful he writes this story. Rich. Vivid. A must read. I give this book as a gift to all of my book-loving friends and family.
One of the most affecting novels I've read in some time--an intriguing central premise, layers of imagery and motifs, and characters who won't leave you long after the book is finished.<br/><br/>Because ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE employs multiple viewpoints and very short chapters, the initial effect is choppy.  I have friends who couldn't get into it.  Their loss.  Persevere, you won't regret it.
I had a difficult time getting through this book. Although it was well written, it took the author too many chapters to get the point across. It was written through the eyes of two young people; one German boy and one blind French girl. I love historical fiction but this book just dragged on and on. I am happy that I completed reading this book only to find out what happened to the characters.
I really tried hard to love this book. There were many, many beautifully written and remarkable parts but I sometimes could not pick it up. The reviews were great so I was a little disappointed. I felt like it was very slow moving from the beginning. The story itself was good but I don't feel like a few things were wrapped up for me. In the end, I was a bit bummed about how things turn out.
I enjoyed the book very much. I went back after finishing to savor the experience and re-read many of the last chapters. We are reading the book, my choice, for our book club.  My grandfather came from Germany and I have traveled to France so could relate to some of the cultures. Anthony Doerr pulls you in so you feel like you know the characters. I will read his other books.
This book is transcendent.  I would usually be annoyed by  the author's choice of traveling back and forth in both time and space, but the writing was so beautiful, and the characters so real, I was able to overlook this literary device. All the Light We Cannot See is hands down one of the best books I have read in years.  It is a gift to those of us who love to read.
This is a beautiful story about children growing up during WWII in France and Germany, about radio and sea snails, about blindness of many kinds, and about the memories that keep us company as we go through our lives. A love story to science, wonder, and hope in the face of unrelenting evil, this is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Highly recommended.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which was the dual stories of a young, blind woman and a young man in pre-WWII Germany. The lives of both of these young people are filled with personal and emotional challenges that culminated in a their very brief meeting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading novels that have well-developed characters.
.  An endearing portrait of children, their strengths and determination during WWII portrayed by a French blind girl and a German boy who is manipulated by the Third Reich.  The decency and insight shown by people in the times of horror and terror.  Made one feel involved in the towns and cities during the war and the fear was palpable.  Very well written.
I could not put this book down and dreaded the day I would finish it. So beautifully written, I would read passages over and over again to be sure they were engrained in my mind's eye. Anthony Doerr captures the pain, the exquisite emotions, the inexplicable overlapping of evil and beauty during this dark time in history. This book touched me deeply.
I loved the wide variety of characters and finding out about their passions, both obvious and hidden.<br/>I liked that just like life not all my questions were answered, but I was brought to a place of<br/>solitude and acceptance.  This is a novel that I will come back to time and again and remember<br/>to persevere.
I absolutely LOVED this book. The authors use of very descriptive prose drew beautiful images in my mind, without seeming forced. A remarkable look into the lives of two young children, on opposing sides, during World War II. When I began reading, I looked up the town of Saint Malo, France (where much if the story takes place). Seeing a modern day satellite image and the layout of the town created a wonderful framework with which to draw the scenes in my mind. Highly recommended read! JMc
Doerr, returns to the world of a blind person enamored with shells, as in his book, The Shell Collectors. This time, he writes about a young girl, Marie-Laure, with early onset blindness living in Paris during the German occupation with her devoted father. Verner is a young boy living with his little sister in an orphanage in Germany close to the mines that claimed their father’s life. At the young age of 12, he is taken away from the orphanage and his sister and is enrolled in a cadet training school run by sadistic Nazis. He has been singled out because of his genius with radio equipment so critical to the German war effort and he soon finds himself on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Amidst the horrors of WWII, Doerr manages to find tenderness and beauty. His short chapters volley back and forth between the lives of these two stoic and determined young people and the challenges they confront as Marie-Laure becomes separated from her father and Verner begins to question the morality and heartless actions of the commanders controlling his life.  Doerr carefully documents the threads of their lives and manages to neatly tie them together by the end of the book.<br/><br/> His writing is poetic, fresh and filled with metaphors and symbolism. His details are such that I could feel the hunger, cold, fear and isolation experienced by Marie-Laure and Verner and smell the smoke and corpses left in the battlefields and bombed cities. I gained appreciation and awe of sightless people who manage to live independently and much respect for the suffering of civilian victims of WWII.  I was not ready to leave these characters when the book ended but look forward to Doerr’s next book.<br/><br/>Diane Schetky, Tosham, ME
What a beautiful, satisfying, thought-provoking read!<br/>Imagine the world as a sightless person. Now, make the reader "feel" and completely comprehend that world as a blind person.<br/>It seems a nearly impossible task, and yet Anthony Doerr  manages this feat with precise, evocative  language.<br/>Mr. Doerr depicts that sightless person as a young teenage girl trying not only to survive, but to bring hope to her countrymen, fighting in St Malo, France,  during the German invasion of WWII.<br/>Her experiences during that unbelievably tense, frightening time demonstrate courage and determination well beyond expectation. An amazing beautiful story of bravery, loss, redemption and timeless love, where every single word is necessary.<br/>What a fantastic book!
I loved this book and have been recommending it far and wide. Just yesterday I posted a recommendation on Facebook; and even though I read it on my Kindle, I ordered a hardcover edition of it when I finished it because some books are so good, you just want to have them as actual books.<br/>I found the writing to be beautiful, close to poetic. The characters were well drawn, the story compelling. Aren't those the qualities we are all looking for in a good book?<br/>I read a lot of literary fiction and take great pleasure in many books but don't often find myself gushing with praise. I am gushing with praise for this book.
An interesting and imaginative book about a boy, an orphan, growing up in Germany in the '20-'30-'40s. How he is pulled into the excitement of a recovering Germany and the build up of Nazism, how it affected him in what he chose to do, and how he became aware of his moral conflicts.  At the same time the author tells us the story of a blind, young French girl who is being raised by her father, a locksmith at a famous Paris museum; he is also a wood carver, and makes intricate models of the houses, buildings, and towns for his daughter who uses her fingers to memorizes the layout of each one.  When Paris is being occupied by the Nazis, they have to be evacuated to the coast and go to live with a great uncle who is reclusive since WWI. The girl learns amazing ways of coping and becomes very attuned to the feeling of things that she can no longer see.
A wonderfully woven story of a time that was just unbelievable.  Even though there were parts hard to take the style kept you moving ahead and all the parts of the story come together beautifully. These were very sad times and no one escaped being touched by this evil.<br/>IN THE GARDEN OF BEASTS is another good book (non-fiction) about the beginnings of this tragic time.
I simply didn't want it to end.<br/>It is and yet it is not about WW2. Highly recommended.<br/>Will be seeking more from this author.
Truly enjoyed this novel. We should never forget the horrors of war and the aftermath of decisions people make. Though at times too detailed, the story was fascinating. The different perspectives of war and the lessons taught were eye-opening. The writing was lyrical, and the ending satisfying. Enjoy!
The story brought you into the years just prior and throughout WWII, from the perspective of a young blind French girl and a an orphan German boy.  You hear and feel the madness and the hate, the government systematically teaching hatred  of Jews and of anyone  not matching some type of Germanic ideal, blond, strong fearsome and obedient and able to regard some people as if they were viruses that must be eradicated for the world to be pure.  A slight but very white blond German boy, with a genius for electronics, especially radios, is selected for an elite military academy. Despite his slight stature, he is protected because of his skill but observes and, when he must, participates in bullying and harassment and even murder. Throughout this, he desperately tries to maintain some sense of humanity. He ends up  working on finding spies and others making  unauthorized radio transmissions.  The young girl's father works for a museum and she develops excellent skills at identifying objects via touch and also a very fine memory. The museum assigns her father and three others the task of getting a prized jewel to safety before the German invasion.  This jewel  has a legend, that who possesses it cannot be killed, but the price is that all he loves, suffer much disaster.  While this belief is not held by museum staff, three copies of the gem are made by a most skillful  artisan and a copy is retained and two copies and the original are entrusted to 3 employees (without anyone knowing who has the real gem) and they are tasked with getting it to safety.  The story is rich like a an intricate, tightly woven tapestry, with incredible details.  In reading the book, I felt like I was there, it evoked a time and place, how accurately I do not know, but it felt real.  This is not a quick read, it goes back and forth and time, so there are places to pause, but when reading be able to concentrate to enter into the book, there much that is uplifting and beautiful even if the times were not.
This historical novel is a complex intertwining of several stories beginning with pre-WWII Europe. The reader knows that somehow there will be a resolution involving the blind French girl, the radio-- genius orphan, and the horrors of war.  Although there are the occasional foreshadowing passages, the final chapters bring the reader up to date on several characters in a mostly satisfying way with a few plot areas unresolved. Of course much of war leaves unanswered questions in its aftermath. A patient reader will be rewarded.
This book has a captivating story, with great character development and a writing style that lets you feel like you are there.  I loved this book!  It is well-deserving of the accolades it is receiving.
Wonderfully written novel, unable to put it down.  Well researched, emotionally and intellectually satisfying for the reader.  One of my all time favorites.
This is a wonderful book.  I do not feel it is too long.  I, like others, did not rush through it, but read it slowly in order to enjoy the writing.  I liked the short chapters, some only one, two, three pages which go from one main character to the other.  The book goes back and forth in time which doesn't bother me.<br/><br/>The book begins in 1944 in the walled French city of Saint-Malo on the Brittany Coast.  A pretty, sixteen year old blind girl, Marie-Laure is alone in the tall narrow house belonging to her great-uncle who owns the house.  Her Uncle Etienne, a recluse who never leaves his home, is gone.  Marie-Laure is alone.  The city is being bombed.  Allies have arrived.  Germans are occupying Saint-Malo.  Allies are determined to conquer.<br/><br/>Readers are introduced to the two young protagonists.  Marie-Laure, six, is on a children's tour through the National Museum of Natural History where her father is master of thousands of locks in this museum.  The children are told of a beautiful and rare diamand that is kept behind thirteen locked doors.  This stone is never taken out, never shown.  The tour guide tells the children that this beautiful stone is bad luck.  The owner never dies, his loved ones run into misfortunes.  Werner Pfenning, seven, is an orphan, his younger sister Jutta is five.  These children's father, a miner, is buried deep in the earth.  However, the lady who runs the orphanage loves children, is kind to them.  Jutta is down to earth, intelligent, mature beyond her years.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure goes blind, her loving father carves little houses, streets, buildings so she can find her way around the neighborhood.  He tries hard to teach his daughter to live her life as a strong, independent person even though she is blind.  He creates puzzle boxes to help his only child use her hands and mind to solve problems of life.<br/><br/>Werner is highly intelligent as are all three children.  He finds an old, thrown away radio which he repairs.  He and Jutta listen to the radio, hear music, share radio news and performances with all the orphanage kids.  Because of his high intelligence and his way of fixing radios, Warner is accepted into a school for Hitler Youth instead of having to become a miner .  Jutta is against this.  You will become like them.  But to this school goes Werner; he finds out what his sister said is true.  His best friend is Frederick, a bird lover.  Frederick is not well thought of by schoolmates.  Then Werner goes to war, travels much through war torn Europe.  Marie-Laure and her father have to flee occupied Paris to go to his boyhood home in Saint-Malo and stay with Great Uncle Etienne who is very eccentric.<br/><br/>Readers meet many interesting characters.  There is gigantic Frank Volkheimer, rough, tough, mean, a Nazi, but in a way a good man.  There are several women who send messages, underground groups who send messages baked in bread to give to Etienne to send out by radio.  Marie-Laure picks up this bread at the bakery.  Her father is gone, nobody knows where, lost in the crazy, mixed up world of war.  There is Sergeant Major Reinhold von Rumpel, he has cancer, and wants to find the beautiful stone so he can live forever.  He cares nothing about his loved ones.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure, because of the time she has lived near the ocean, falls in love with Oceanography, studies of snails, mollusks, other water creatures.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful read, interesting, intelligently written.  The writers knows much about many studies and writes well about people, nature, stones, history plus much more.  This books teaches and entertains.  I can't say enough about the book.<br/>'
One of the best books I've read - ever. Doerr should get a Nobel Prize for this beautifully crafted piece of art!
Beautiful. A story told before in a completely new light. What an excellent way for me to have spent my summer vacation, storming through this novel. Awesome. Truly.
yes, one more book about World War 2, but the atmosphere was magnetic and the characters fascinating. Absorbing reading. it's a keeper.
The tension builds and builds to the point you can hardly put the book down because you're wondering what could happen next.
This is the best book I have read in a long time. A mesmerising story spanning wartime France and Germany during WW2 and  an array of characters, seemingly moving through and surviving the war in their own unique ways, but ultimately overlapping and coming together later in the book. The writing is emotive, imaginative and evocative. An excellent standard of literary competence and a highly recommended read.
I spent time in France and Germany in the Sixties, when the war was only recently over. I think Doerr has captured the feeling of the prewar times, the war and aftermath in a way that seems emotionally true.
The best novel of WW 2 that I have read since that war ended, beautifully written and masterfully laden with suspense and hope - even when hope seems gone.
One of the best I've read in a long time.  Beautifully written, fascinating story, well developed characters....good enough for a second read.
This book is so beautifully written.  Anthony Doerr writes a  touching and poignant story that grabs the reader from the very first page.
This book has quickly become one of my favorites - one of those books I will be reading multiple times again in the future.All the Light We Cannot See is at once tragic and hopeful. Both the story and the characters are haunting. This is certainly a piece that will stick with you. I look forward to reading more of Doerr's work soon.
As complete a story as one could ever ask for.  One of those great books you cannot put down. Truly a masterpiece.
I really enjoyed this book and read it in a couple days. The historical background and realistic beautiful sensitive charactors were captivating. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys stories about the personal experiences of the people who lived the horrors of WWII
I saw the description of this book and found it intriguing. It did not disappoint. I could not put the book down. I was mesmerized by the intersecting stories and the characters in this unique story that takes place during WW2 and after. I felt like the author gave such a vivid picture of what it must have been like to live in Europe around WW2. I found myself wandering around my own neighborhood wondering how I would have felt and how I would have navigated bombed places that I knew and loved. And, then imagine having to do that as a blind teenager! The portrayal of the Hitler Youth is also quite well presented and how the young people dealt with it (or didn't) also interested me. How and who do you trust and how do you maintain your sense of self, especially when you are a child and don't quite know who you are? Yes, it's fiction, but I felt like I learned something from these compelling people and their story. If I had to mention one issue with the book, it was that it jumps between characters and time quite a lot, and at times I had to go back to reorient myself. Still, I highly recommend this book.
I think this was the best book I have read this year! I did not want it to end. I am interested in World War II era stories of survival and determination. Excellent !
A tender and cruel story at the same time. Absolutely enthralling. The author certainly must have done a great deal of research as all the elements in the book are described in great detail transmitting vivid images to the reader.
Is it even possible to write about WW 2 from a new perspective? Yes! Each of the characters has a physical or emotional issue that they are struggling to work with in order to survive the war. A young blind girl and a brilliant orphan boy find inner resources that help them survive but the personal price is high. Throughout the book there is a story about a museum object that is surrounded by ancient tales and adds suspense and drama as many of the characters come into contact with the object. I cared deeply about these people and was sad to reach the end, always the sign of a great read. I would definitely recommend this book to book clubs and avid readers.
This novel is extremely well-written, imaginative, informative, and at times fascinating.  It offers a different take on the experiences of two major characters during WWII and is set mostly in France.  An engaging plot plus interesting characters, all flawed in different ways, make for a very good read.
This is a beautifully descriptive book, unsentimental yet moving in it's telling. Two young lives profoundly affected by the onslaught of World War 2.  Characters are so real you can close your eyes and see them. The physical situations of distruction and mayhem are easy to imagine, almost hear them.  When te blind girls walks and counts her steps, you are there.
What a beautiful story of insight when blind to the physical world! It is a reminder of the capability of the human body to overcome the seemingly impossible.
I accidentally picked a book about France and WWII as we were leaving to visit there for two weeks.  then I realized our tour included St.Malo, the setting for All the Light.  We walked the streets of St. Malo and saw the beach.  Reading this book was fascinating to me.  The story is well done, the characters are amazing. Highly recommend this one.
Great book, with a richly woven, powerful story.  I finished the book several days ago and I'm still thinking about the characters.  That's a sure sign of a great book.
This is a beautifully written book with an ingenious plot and memorable characters.  The characters are very human and well developed.  The plot progresses at just the right rate to keep you reading and wondering what will be next. The ending is not at all what I expected but I loved it.
It's one of those books you start talking about very shortly after starting to read it.  Beautifully written, well developed - I will read this author again and, very possibly this book.
I am not always an enthusiastic reader of war stories, but this was definitely the exception.  I was completely involved with Marie and Werner and their growth into such amazing young adults despite their circumstances. Certainly the horrors and cruelty of war were ever present, the development of the main characters won over all.  I could hardly put it down.
This is not an easy read for a day at the beach.  Doerr commands full attention of the reader.  Hard to put down, but also necessary to set aside at times when the story becomes too intense.  On the eve of World War II, a young inquisitive German boy discovers he has a talent for building and fixing radios.  Unfortunately, German officials also discover his genius and send him away to a special school where he becomes an expert at locating transmissions from resistance fighters.  He soon finds himself in the German army where the brutality of the school he left behind pales in comparison to the battle he must now fight.  But another story is developing simultaneously, that of a blind young French girl who must deal with vicious Germans, one in particular who is hot on the trail of a precious gem which has been secreted by her father from the museum where he worked pre-war.  We are forced to sympathize with both the youthful German soldier in the advancing, merciless army, and the little girl who is a victim of German occupation in France.  We are plunged into the horrors of this war from both sides.  And we must also understand that Doerr carries the reader back and forth, not only between the stories of the two main characters, but also from future to present and back again.  The convergence of the two stories near the end is both satisfying and sad.  The depth of this richly researched novel will cause this book to live in memory long after the last page is consumed.  Best book I have read since the last Agent Pendergast novel.
ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME ! BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. RELATIVELY SHORT PARAGRAPHS. HAD TROUBLE PUTTING THIS BOOK DOWN !
Never read anything by Antony Doerr before this, but his writing kept me interested and I could hardly put the book down.<br/>Anthony never "looked down" on his readers. I was, as a reader,treated to reading as an adult. The second WW was clear and written in a light that  was most interesting<br/>A great read!.
A different look at events leading up to and through World War II from the perspective of a blind french girl and a German boy.  One of the best books I've read this year.
I keep thinking about this book, the insights of the heroine at the conclusion.  How young people were drown together  before World War II by radio transmissions off the Brittany coast,  If you ever marvel at the expansiveness of the universe when you look up in the sky and contemplate the infinite life beneath the ocean all in the setting of the devastation of war, this is the book for you.
Best book I've read in a long time. Poignant, insightful, stirring, honest. A master writer at the top of his craft.
a story about people during WWll. I was sorry when the story ended. The characters were very real and the telling of their lives left me wanting more. Have you ever read a book that each chapter is about a different sub set of character story lines and you find you are more interested in some and want to skim the others?. This story..each chapter..each subset grabs your attention. It is a book that is best read slowly. I read a lot and this book is on my favorite list.
This book told me a lot about the survival of people during the 2nd world war. Also shows how one can be coerced into behavior they wouldn't ordinarily participate in.
This story is told about a time in our history we would rather forget, but cannot, however, choosing to write about the two young main characters - one blind and one blind to the truth - was unique in their stories.  The way these two briefly overlap in physical space was realistic and poignant at the same time.  I will most likely re-read it and take my time savoring each paragraph.
An original and captivating story full of suspense and intrigue. I have recommended this book to all my reading friends as one of the best new books this year.
All the Light We Cannot See was very poetically expressed writing about the horror of WWII in Europe. The story mainly took place in France, but also had segments rooted in Germany and Facism. The author accurately describes the horror and fortitude of European citizens who found themselves in the clutch of conflict.
Beautifully written and engaging story. This book is in my top ten recommendations of all times.  I've already bought copies for my mom, sister and aunt.
All the Light We Cannot See is the best novel I have read, or expect to read, this year. Anthony Doerr creates a masterful puzzle with the way he interweaves Marie-Laure and Werner's lives. He builds suspense with every chapter, while also carefully illuminating the path which somehow, against all odds, lead these two characters together. The beauty in this work truly shows when these contrasting characters try to trust and accept each other despite the chasm life has built between them.<br/><br/>To view full review visit: [...]
I found. This book fascinating. From cover to cover .<br/> loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a captivating read
A WW II story about a blind French girl and a young German boy caught up in the war.  She and her father hide out with a precious diamond the Nazis are after.  He, an orphan, is chosen to attend a Nazi school and then sent to the town where she is hiding.  How they meet and how he saves her are bring the story full circle.  A beautiful story in spite of the cruelty that also occurs.
One of the best books I have ever read. I was taken on a wonderful journey that at times I found holding my breath, sitting still with the world around me faded away, and crying so hard I could not see the letters on the page. Mr. Doerr is a magnificent storyteller and I found myself in the story watching it unfold before me.
Best I have read all year.  All the elements of a beautiful story of light. And darkness.  This should be a movie.
I have read a number of novels in the last few years set during WW2 but for me, this was by far the best. The two main characters were unique in their strengths, fears, and experiences.  I enjoyed the structure of their parallel and occasionally intersecting story lines.  The author's research into background and side information was impressive and unusual.  I learned a lot, not the least of which was the ambiguity of morals in such a horrible period.  A very satisfying read.
I read it in other writers' recommendations and high praise. A rarity for me. I am so glad I followed my heart.
I would recommend this book to just about everyone.  It hit so closely on both the humanity and inhumanity that can be met in our life!  An interesting & sometimes very touching story but also heart breaking in many ways! A view into the world war 2 nightmare in both France & Germany and it's effect on their people.
I loved this book. The author interweaves the stories of the two children and back and forth in time until the story reaches the present. Don't let the number of pages deter you from reading this.
This seems to be my week of reading novels about war. This tale is special in several ways-trust, unique talents, pointless conflict, many layers of story. A beautiful and touching tale.
For a long time, I thought Werner was the only protagonist even though the title implies radio itself is somehow the protagonist.  It is common knowledge how WWII ground up a lot of people and spit them out but this book gives us a glimpse of how it affected an orphan who was a child prodigy who in normal times would might have become a renowned scientist. In fact, I think Werner would rather have followed his father into the mines than follow the path the Reich set before him.<br/><br/>I couldn't put this book down! There was suspense throughout about what would happen to Werner, what would happen to the Sea of Flames and what would happen to Jutta, to Marie, to Marie's uncle and to Marie's father.  I'm glad I read this book and will find the time to pick it up again one day.  I grew up blocks away from an "amateur DJ" who ran a radio station out of his garage.  It was below the limit so the FCC never came along to shut him down and for several years he sat out there spinning vinyl records and "broadcasting" to listeners within a few city blocks.  I had more or less forgotten about him until I read this book and not only is the book plausible, I've met somebody that did the very thing Marie's uncle did in this book.
After seeing all the rave reviews for the book before I read it, I hoped it would live up to the hype.  It did.  Mr. Doerr's lovely way with words and his obvious compassion and love for his main protagonists shines through and I was sad to finish this book.  It broke my heart but gave me hope all at the same time and I look forward to his next work already.
I was taken by this novel by the end of the first paragraph.  I wasn't sure how the alternating chapters woudl eventually link, but they did so in a satisfying manner.
I really enjoyed this book.  It certainly gave some insight into the mind set of French and German people during WWII.  I liked the development of the characters and how their mind sets developed and grew.  It took me a few chapters to "get into" the story and understand the jumping between characters and understand the timeline of the flashbacks; but once I got it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I, being a romantic, was hoping for a different ending; but war doesn't allow that does it...
Couldn't put it down. Loved the two main character point of views.  A different perspective on WWII. You will not be disappointed!
This has become my new favorite book.  I have read many books in my 60 years of reading. It is also the story of my German parents.
This book is almost a miracle; so beautifully written about the fears, the disillusionment, the cruelty, and the carnage of the early 1940's in war torn Europe.  Two teenagers are at the heart of the book, a blind French girl, and a prodigy of a German boy whose interest in science and especially radios, wins him a place at an elite military school, and a special assignment in the German Army.  And they meet only briefly, near the end of the book.<br/>The cruelty encountered in the boy's life, and the vulnerability of the girl's, pierce the reader's heart, even while you are stunned by the beauty of the language.  Very heartily recommended.
Re: "All the Light We cannot see" :  I cannot express in enough words the wonderful experience of spending a week in the thrall of this extraordinary book. The story is thrilling and passionate; it evokes the period between 1934 and !950 with the world in turmoil as viewed through the lens of both Germany and France.  The main characters, a blind young French girl and a German boy  swept up in the rise of the Nazi regime is told  beautifully and  seamlessly through alternating chapters. I have studied and I am very familiar with the period but no history in my reading conveys as well the human experience of living through these times. This is my "book of the year" -- to be read and re-read over the years. It is quite simply, an unforgettable masterpiece.
I enjoyed this book more than any I've read in a long time. It is thoughtful and well written and gives the reader a strong platform to become familiar with the characters. It is an interesting perspective for a well covered topic.
This was a great story...one of the best I've read (and I read 2-3 books a week). Great historical fiction of the 1934-45 period in Germany and France that does NOT, like many books, focus on the Holocaust (important as that is). The main charactors were well developed, believable, and likeable. While I first thought the priceless gem might have been "excess baggage" in the story, I now see that the main charactors saw little value to it compared to freedom, family, talents, and the simple things one may take for granted...like sight. I also loved the format of short, alternating, chapters. I also appreciated the non-Hollywood ending concerning a main charactor. The only negative is that I'm now set up for future reading "falling short".
Stayed up way too late reading this book, ending up zombie-like the next day.  The characters, the language, the subject, all compelling.  One disappointment:  [QUASI SPOILER ALERT!!!!]  One of my fave characters died, and it broke my heart.  I was so attached to this person, and had seen him/her grow so much as the plot unfolded.  Because it was midnight when I got to this point in the book, I had to get myself between two doors and some thick walls so I could blubber openly without waking the rest of my family.  There's much darkness in this novel (as there was in WWII, as there always is), but, somehow, there's this inkling of hope,a joy in the wonder of life,  that permeates even the most heartwrenching of situations.
This novel is destined to become a classic.  A haunting, moving, beautifully written story about world war II.  It follows the path of two separate main characters.  A blind french girl and a young german orphan boy.  The novel is a delicate intertwining of their lives. Well researched.  I could not put it down.
I am really a fan of World War II novels and this one is one of the best.  I admired the main characters although for Werner it took some continued reading to come to that conclusion.  Very suspenseful.  Short chapters make it a very quick read.  it is too serious for a beach read though.
I finished this book a few days ago and I still find myself thinking about it. It was beautifully written. Every word had a purpose in describing the world, the action, or the thoughts of the characters. I loved the characters and found their journeys interesting. It felt a little slow in the middle, but once at the end you realize why the author took his time leading up to the climax. I was also glad that the story felt finished/complete at the end. I hate when authors wrap things up too quickly.<br/>This is definitely my favorite book of the year so far!
This was my first Doerr novel to read. Beautifully written this author develops and weaves the characters together intertwining their lives, even, if only for a brief bittersweet moment. I would recommend this to most any type of reader, and can see this being made into a movie.
I had read some partially negative reviews about this book, but after reading it, I think the reviewers were expecting it to say more than the author intended.  I loved the characters.  I enjoyed the historical WWII aspects. The imagery was beautiful.
The author put in a lot of time and effort and made a book composed of how many perfect sentences. So if you like perfect sentences this book is for you. The story itself, the actual characters and events depicted, could have been told with style in just a small fraction of all those sentences. If story is what you like most of all, then all the light you cannot see, bloated with details of tiny importance, will try your patience. It did mine.
What a wonderful book!  I just finished it and I am so sad.  This is a book that you will find hard to put down, but hate that you have come to the end when you finish.  I loved the short chapters.  It was very inspiring story, with sadness along the way.  Don't let the length deter you, it won't take you long to finish.
This is more than a novel.  It is an experience.<br/>First of all a good plot does not break through without good writing, and the writing here is excellent.  When there is that convergence of excellent writing and a great story the act of reading becomes effortless.  It is a gift to be treasured.  Don't miss this book.
Riveting story of two children growing up too quickly during WWII. I didn't want the book to end, Doerr took me into another world where hope and violence co-mingled in the very real world of a recent generation of strong souls. Recommended to readers who enjoy history, character development and excellent writing.
One of the best books I've read in the last five years.  Extraordinary use of language in portraying the live of a French girl and German boy during the second world war.  This is a book that you will find yourself thinking about long after you have finished reading it.  I can not recommend it highly enough.
This is a superb account of two children caught in the events of WWII. Doerr weaves the stories of a young, blind French girl and an orphaned German boy into puzzle that leaves the reader breathless until the pieces come together...and don't. Superb writing that never patronizes the reader and serves to bring great clarity and focus to a gripping story. I honestly could not put the book down for any length of time.
I loved this story so much.  There were pieces that i just reread for the beauty of the words and the magical story being told during a very un-magical period of history.  This novel is a tribute to the power of the human spirit and our will to survive during tragedy without losing our faith in humanity.
This is the first book I've read by Anthony Doerr and I did not enjoy the structure of his telling this story.  The time/date sequencing drove me crazy and my book club agreed.  We tried to figure out the purpose of skipping around in time periods, forward in the beginning, then going back again we understood but then forward, back, &,jumping around got very confusing.  I did enjoy his characters and learning more about WWII( kind of- not a history buff).  We had a great discussion on a variety of topics, including the title of this book and its meaning..
Of the thousands of books written about war, loss, and scarring memories, none achieves the tender, profound human-ness of this book.  Stunning.  Soul-shaking.  Its tenderness heightens the devastation and loss of war, and flattens the reader with its emotional power.  A must-read, and a can't-forget.
A heartwarming story of two young people coping with the hardships of warn-torn europe who struggle to survive in their own environments, but whose lives ultimately merge as a consequence of war.  One of the best novels I've ever read about the effects of war on the noncombatants, and the very young.
I thought the writing and the use of the language was poetic. It was beautiful. I loved the way the story wove in and out throughout the characters and the years. What I was disappointed with was the ending. It left me saddened that the characters were left not fully developed in their final scenes.
Well written. Suspenseful. The main character is well-drawn and three dimensional. This blind girl copes with her surroundings and incidents in her life because of her father's attitude and his ability to help make her independent as possible. I would recommend this book for a book club discussion.
This book is now one of my favorites. Loved the characters, the plot and the prose.  The courage of a blind girl and the love of her father.  A mystery of a hidden gem in a carved house given to the girl. Also the story of a young orphaned boy who eventually is inducted into the Nazi youth. Their lives intertwine in a very unique way.  Exciting and an excellent book!!
My motivation to read the book was my fascination with literature that creates a strong sense of place, and this novel did not disappoint. Whether a small, walled city in Brittany; Paris counting down the days to the arrival of the German Army; Berlin both in its grandeur and in tatters; or the elite German school that trained German boys to become death-hardened soldiers, Anthony Doerr’s meticulous literature gives his readers a strong boost into the world they are reading about.<br/><br/>This novel took Doerr ten years to write, and it shows. Doerr’s artistry can be appreciated by anyone who cares about literature, as opposed to ‘pulp.’ His short, to-the-point chapters feature crisp sentences that burst with impact. I sometimes wished he had avoided an obscure fifty-dollar word when a buck-fifty selection would carry the reader along more smoothly, but no diamond is perfect.  Overall, this book is a gem. Having read much World War II history, it was not a stretch for me to imagine it all really happened.<br/><br/>The story, which features the life stories of nerdy German enlisted man Werner Pfennig and blind French waif Marie-Laure LeBlanc, is the unravelling of a mystery that, in itself, summarizes a lot of the history of mankind in the 20th Century.  It was the most brutal century in the history of mankind in terms of sheer war and killing, and Doerr helps us to see the worst of it through the eyes of two people who are caught up in it despite their aversion to it. When the life-long connection between this pair is realized you may find yourself cheering for them to rise together, Phoenix-like, out of the ashes that surround them.<br/><br/>Doerr paints the many supporting characters deeply, but briefly. Backstories are many, but are well-woven into the narrative and do not distract from the story’s flow.  You will know these people well within a short time of being introduced to them. From Werner’s snow-haired little sister to Marie-Laure’s stoic dad; to the huge German NCO Volkheimer, whose soft spot for little Werner permits the crucial scenes of the book to unfold, Doerr builds into each character a piece of Europe’s experience of this most barbaric of wars, including impacts still felt decades later.<br/><br/>This book could well become required reading in high school and college literature programs.  Doerr has provided us with a view of the Second World War that is memorable for its prose, and admirable for its richness of meaning.
A gemstone has come from Japan to be displayed in The Museum of Natural History in Paris. It is named the Sea of Flames. Rumor has it that whoever possesses it, cannot die yet those around them, will die within a month. The stone brings sorrow to anyone who carries it. Now the museum is trying to decide whether to display it or not.<br/><br/>It is 1934 and Marie-Laure LeBlanc is four years old. She first hears this story from a guard at the museum where her father works. He is the locksmith of the museum and holds every key and knows where each key goes. One month after hearing this story, Marie-Laure is blind. They say it is due to congenital cataracts.<br/><br/>Werner Pfennig, seven, and his sister Jutta, six, are being raised at Children's House, an orphanage in Zollverein, Germany, It is three hundred miles northeast of Paris. Their mother died in childbirth and their father died in the coal mines. Werner is a very inquisitive boy. When he turns eight, he finds a wire-wrapped cylinder in the refuse. Three frayed electrical leads sprout from the top and one has a small earphone dangling from the end. He realizes it is a radio. He takes it back to his room in the attic and fixes it. He hooks it up to discover a station with music. He then hears a man speaking in French, talking about science and how light affects different things. "How does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?". This begins Werner's love of radios. He will become the one requested to fix everyone"s radio in the town, eventually keeping him out of the mines and into the Hitler Youth Camp.There he will learn how to not only fix radios, but listen and track other radio transmitters.<br/><br/>A few years later, when the war heads towards Paris, the museum packs and sends away its prize possessions. Marie-Laure and her father leave town to stay at a friend's relative only to find they have abandoned their home. They then decide to go to Saint-Milo to the home of his Uncle Etienne. His uncle lives in the family home where he grew up with Marie-Laure's grandfather. They were brothers. Marie-Laure's father builds her a mini city of the little wooden house to teach Marie-Laure how to get around the city by herself. He takes her out into the street with her cane to teach her by counting, smells, and sounds from the street to get her bearings and memorize where she is. Along with the construction of the city, her father also builds her little boxes that will contain gifts when it is her birthday. The box is a puzzle, which she has to learn how to open in order to get to her gift.<br/><br/>As both children grow older, they are about four years apart, their lives are each affected by the war in their own countries. There will come a day when they lives will converge.<br/><br/>The story begins on August 7, 1944. The chapters take turn with Marie-Laure's life and Werner's. It then goes back to 1934, and proceeds from there and at times jumps back to 1944. It can be confusing at times if you are not noting the time period at the beginning of each new section.<br/><br/>There are many stories woven throughout the book about the war. The use of radios, other than by the German Army, was forbidden. But those who had them, used them to send coded messages to others to pass around. The plight of the German and French citizens were dangerous for both. Then there is the story of the Sea of Flames and how that fit in throughout the entire story. There are different characters in each story line, Werner and Marie-Laure's, that have an affect on each.<br/><br/>The book is beautifully written. The theme of light is carried through the story in various ways. All the Light We Cannot See won the 2015Pulitzer Prize
This book won the Pulitzer Prize and is a well-deserved winner. It is a story of courage and love set in the tragedies of the mid 20th century. The story is told through two growing children whose lives will collide but instead of focusing on the bleakness of life at that time the author draws us into the ways in which crises can bring out the best in people.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure, one of those children, lives with her father in Paris. He works at the nearby museum and is raising her alone. When she goes blind at the age of six, he lovingly builds her a model of their neighbourhood which she can learn with her fingertips to gain the courage to go out. At the same time, Werner, a German orphan lives with his sister in an orphanage overseen by a loving nun who recognises his extraordinary intelligence and mechanical gifts. These skills find him a place in a brutal school for talented Hitler Youth where he learns much about his own strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>When the war arrives, Marie-Laure and her father, who is tasked with carrying an very valuable jewel from the museum, flee to Saint-Malo. There in the care of her psychologically-damaged great-uncle and his laconic housekeeper, Marie-Laure learns to trust others and to heal her uncle while her father creates yet another village model to provide his daughter with independence. This it does as she becomes  caught up in resistance movements. Werner, at the same time, has been forced to use his radio skills to track down resistance groups and gradually realises that he has been trapped in the greed of his senior officer. An experience from his past, which links him with Marie-Laure, redeems him.<br/><br/>Doerr writes with great beauty, a sense of detail so developed that I could see and breathe every aspect of the story. His use of metaphor is astounding at times and so lovely that I had to replay page after page just to read them again. It is a deeply moving book which I will return to, and so beautiful that I instantly downloaded Doerr's short stories. You will not regret reading this book, I promise you.
This is a compelling story set deep in WWII.  Much of it is gray and grim. It is about the advance of armies, the destruction of cities, the enterprise of the resistance, the realignments of families, and the total loss of “the way life should be.”  But All the Light We Cannot See does not specifically focus on the “big” issues.  Instead there are two main story lines with one focusing on Werner, a young orphaned German boy who is eventually swept into an elite Nazi military training academy, and the other focusing on Marie-Laure, a young blind girl who is forced to flee from her comfortable, predictable, and established life to walk across the country to St. Malo where she and her father move into the home of an uncle who was severely impacted by the first World War.<br/><br/>Werner and Marie-Laure are unknown to each other yet oddly linked to each other through radio transmissions. Werner displays remarkable talents with radio receivers at a very young age and these talents lead him into the ranks of the Nazi war effort.  Marie-Laure begins as a runner for the French Resistance but she eventually broadcasts strategic information over a hidden radio transmitter.  One would correctly predict that their paths cross as the storyline continues; they do, but the outcome is not a clean and tidy conclusion to the story.<br/><br/>There are a few other lesser storylines.  Unfortunately the storyline that follows a German Nazi officer depicts him as a stereotyped buffoon-like character which almost distracts from the book rather than adding to it.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr gives us a beautifully written story.  His descriptions transport the reader to the scene. His craftsmanship with the English language is masterful. The vocabulary is descriptive and fresh.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See lends itself to myriads of discussions topics and would be an excellent launching point for book club discussions.
Even though historical fiction is not my first choice, with so many book club recommendations I had to see what the hype was about.<br/>Set just before and during WW2, the story revolves around two central characters, each with their own heart-breaking and endearing story that ties itself into the overall picture. Marie -Laure is a young lady who lost her sight as a child, and lives with her father, a custodian of a museum. To try and give her more freedom in the outside world, he recreates their neighbourhood in miniature so that she can learn and memorise it all with her fingers. Werner is a young orphan who is technically gifted, and is drafted into the German army to track down the French Resistance, leaving behind a younger sister.  As the years go by and the many facets of war, whether victor or victim, are endured, their stories intertwine for a fleeting moment.  A part of each of their lives is shared, and with this,understanding, hope and forgiveness.<br/>The book has me torn-did I enjoy it or not? I still don't know. And I guess since the author has now made me think and question, he has achieved something. As I paged through the beginning, I was put off by the amount of chapters-this generally means that they are short and the story then tends to jump around a lot. It did indeed turn out to be the case-there is a lot of character and time movement between chapters, which can sometimes be confusing, especially since the text is written in present tense. It took me ages to get into the rhythm of the book as the writing style was very slow for me. While there were excessive descriptive texts of scenery which added a great deal to the overall story, the verbosity made my mind tend to wander off. Not as much was spent on developing enough of the main characters. I felt that so much time was used on the build up, that much of the imagery was not necessary. In saying that however, the pace of the story served a great purpose in portraying the bleakness and the futility of war and its consequences. The sideline story of the diamond put a different spin on things-it taps into what people believed was important enough at the time to hide, or seek. What resonated long after I finished the book, was the portrayal of a life I could never understand. How family can be taken away and imprisoned on the whim of another, how young children can be so indoctrinated that human dignity is ignored and what so many cherish as fundamental individual rights can be denied.<br/>The meeting between the central characters seemed contrived-it felt like a chance in a million where every tiny conceivable problem that could have happened did not. But I guess who can say for certain in a situation like that? The majority of the secondary characters were well written-they had their places in the story and added to the progression where necessary.<br/>I felt that the ending was rushed-that the story was completed to try and tie up loose ends-by doing this many questions were actually left unanswered.  So again I find myself ambivalent as to whether or not I enjoyed the book. All I can say is try it and see whether or not the small details play in your mind long after it is over, as they have in mine.
I want to like this book.  Pulitzer Prize, 500+pages.  Obvious skill demonstrated. An appreciation for science and the love of knowledge.  And, I do like it when it is about the fascination of birds, electronics, science knowledge and the doings in museums.  Every time the author writes about detail, he has me.<br/><br/>Since the novel is about WWII with its tens of millions deaths, it is about graphic violence.  Since the author is prize winning and engages in *lyrical* writing (his words), the writing is *great*.<br/><br/>The young German boy is appealing, if totally unbelievable, as is the blind girl.  All the characters are unbelievable, but that is ok, if the book is looked at from a fable stance.<br/><br/>What alienates me as a reader of some 80 years is the use of one page chapters.  I understand that this is homage to the TV and electronic age where attention spans dislike sustained reading.  My grandson's YA novels have employed this device for years.  Also, the jumping back and forth in time, another visual entertainment gimmick, is in full display..<br/><br/>However, I realize that best selling novels must acknowledge the times and writing must accommodate itself to the fashion of the period. A reader who longs for the 19th century must turn there.<br/><br/>The book is highly successful in setting atmosphere  and creates a sense of peace and contentment even as horror unfolds.  Although none of the characters are believable, they are all memorable.  This sense of peace and going about daily business is disconcerting  as we see all the characters are pawns in the horror as war intrudes itself  into lives that don't pay attention to what politicians are doing. Everyone appears powerless.<br/><br/>All the beauty and all that knowledge and ability destroyed by desires for legacies. Mr. Doerr is very successful in conveying the danger of not opening our eyes before we close them.  This is a book for today.
‘Leaflets,’ the opening chapter of All the Light We Cannot See is two paragraphs long:<br/><br/>“At dusk they pour from the sky. They blow across the ramparts, turn cartwheels over rooftops, flutter into the ravines between houses. Entire streets swirl with them, flashing white against the cobblestones. Urgent message to the inhabitants of this town, they say. Depart immediately to open country.<br/><br/>The tide climbs. The moon hangs small and yellow and gibbous. On the rooftops of beachfront hotels to the east and in the gardens behind them, a half-dozen American artillery units drop incendiary rounds into the mouths of mortars.”<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr’s melodious descriptions, juxtaposed with raw detail, give perspective to World War II and the natural world in which war is waged. The story takes place in Germany and France and it delves into the lives of characters who are actively and unwittingly caught in the conflict. The novel begins shortly before Germany invades Paris, then winds its way through the occupation and the war’s aftermath, but the action is not always presented in chronological order. This play with time in no way diminishes the story; rather it is a tribute to Doerr’s skillful writing.<br/><br/>Among the cast of characters are some of Hitler’s henchmen seen at their day-to-day tasks. Extermination of the Jews is rarely brought front and center; instead Doerr shows the Nazi’s unleashing their horrors on unlikely victims, often “perfect” Germans; Aryans, who, despite their best intentions, can’t or don’t always match up to Nazi ideals.<br/><br/>The book’s two young protagonists are Marie Laure LeBlanc, a blind Parisian girl and Werner Pfennig, an orphaned eleven year-old German prodigy. Werner’s ingenuity with radios and electricity helps him avoid work in the coal mines, but earns him a spot in a Hitler Youth School. It is mostly through these youngster’s that Doerr works wonders with his “light” motif. Using Marie’s blindness, her intelligence and love of nature and Werner’s skill with electrical circuitry, he presents the metaphorical and physical possibilities of ocean life and sound, and especially light, in ways that a person cannot see, or perhaps chooses not to see.<br/><br/>Eventually Marie and Werner cross paths in scenes filled with all the beauty and heartbreak that is so skillfully rendered throughout this stunning novel.
This was an amazing journey through the eyes and hearts of children of World War II as I could have never imagined. I was introduced to Anthony Doerr and his novel All the Light We Cannot See through the Dallas Museum of Art's Literature and Letters series (next up on my list is The Book of Aron by Jim Shepard). The lecture was an absolute delight, and Doerr outlined his inspiration for the novel and within a mere 30 minutes remind me of all the wonders this world contains.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See follows the stories of Werner and Marie-Laure, children on opposite sides of WWII, and how their lives eventually intersect in the occupied city of St. Malo off the coast of France. "Like a ping pong match," each chapter (often no longer than 3-8 paragraphs) flips back and forth to each child's story: Werner, a bright, curious, young German boy growing up in an orphanage with his little sister Jutta, and Marie-Laure, a blind, young French girl, living in the heart of Paris as her father's shadow, who happens to be the head key master of the Museum of Natural History. With the occupation of France, Marie and her father flee Paris with a museum treasure that creates a third story for the reader to devour (those familiar with the tales of The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History and The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer will feel similar heart strings ache). Reader be forewarned: time is fluid and like a picture book. You will traverse the four years of WWII, linger in hours and seconds of bombardment of St. Malo, and to my personal delight, you will also dwell in the "simultaneity of moments" in which you realize not everything is about you, and not every story has a happy ending, all the while knowing there is so much in this world we cannot see.<br/><br/>Doerr's novel is not any sort of "typical" WWII novel I have ever read because it makes so few omniscient references to the war as a whole; the kind a younger generation may easily label the events of the 1940's. The characters can only live each breath as it comes, and hope each imagined danger is just that - imagined. The Nazi machine and the Third Reich were not created overnight, and the "beginning" of the war did not occur as a singular event for many German youth, and neither did its end (for either France or Germany). I don't like to give away spoilers in my reviews, and although we already know how WWII ends, the stories of Werner and Marie-Laure, and the others around them (Etienne, Jutta, Madame Manec, Volkheimer, and sweet Frederick, von Rumpel, and even Jules Verne feels like a close friend through Marie-Laure's finger tips) are for future Doerr readers to discover.<br/><br/>While the most poignant lines to my soul were: "Your problem, Werner, is that you still believe you own your life." I will never read the phrase "listen, children" in earnest again, without feeling a certain ache in my heart.<br/><br/>Happy Reading!
This intricate, multi-layered story is well deserving of the Pulitzer Prize. You will want to take this book slowly, living in it, thinking it, wearing its clothes, turning it over in your hand like a perfectly tuned antique pocket watch. Somehow author Anthony Doerr surpasses mere description of characters and puts us in their minds. We become Marie-Laure, a 14 year old blind French girl who is displaced from Paris during WWII and who flees to the coastal town of Saint-Malo where her father builds for her a perfect scale model of the town so that she can learn the streets by touch. We become Werner, a sensitive German orphan from a dingy mining town who builds radios from junkyard parts and who is made to attend a sadistic Hitler Youth camp. We don’t just see them through simple descriptions. Marie-Laure is blind, and we experience the world through her ears and fingertips. Werner is a master of electronics, and we become his thoughts. We build his radios. We experience the broadcasts he hears as they wing their way through the night and across continents. Through Marie-Laure and Werner somehow we see the light that we cannot see – the untold stories and inner lives of people both connected by the war and inextricably linked by forces they don’t yet realize.<br/><br/>The story jumps around in a non- linear style with short chapters, keeping us on the edge of our seat. This technique gives us a sense of the disorientation that Marie-Laure must encounter at times with her blindness, as well as the disorientation of others including Werner who are swept up and displaced by war.<br/><br/>Horror and beauty are balanced perfectly here. In one amazing scene when Saint-Malo is being shelled and fires rage through the city walls, it is breathtakingly beautiful how Marie-Laure keeps the radio transmitter going, reading (in Braille) her favorite book “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea” to an unseen and largely unknowing world ravaged by destruction all around.<br/><br/>There is a subplot about a missing diamond that probably would have become the main focus with a sensationalistic chase narrative in many best sellers today (I’m thinking Dan Brown here, among many others). Author Anthony Doerr does not make this mistake. He instead chooses the more difficult road and keeps the main focus on the characters, the human, and that is what really propels this book into the stratosphere. This is one of the very best books I have read in the past several years. Very highly recommended.
I majored in European history and none of the hundreds of books I read then, or since then, have matched this depiction of life during WWII.  History aside, "All the Light We Cannot See" tells a touching story using beautiful prose  to describe captivating characters.  The tale builds to a fateful encounter between two orphan children.  Since the young girl is blind, her version depends on memory, imagination and a patchwork of senses. As a radio operator, many of the boy’s experiences rely on hearing.  The characters are not handicapped by the constraints on perception, quite the opposite, they are enriched, just as the literary device expands the reader's comprehension.  A precious diamond central to the plot refracts white light into the component colors that make up a rainbow just as the story avoids head on exposition.  The  sensational takes a back seat to the prism that reveals nuance and gradually builds mundane details into revelations.  Its a novel and effective approach in the era of show all/tell all reality TV that allows readers to step back in time and innocence.  Nothing shocks a modern desensitized audience.  To remind recent generations that unspeakable horrors are horrible, the author has to disarm the shock absorbers and unzip the Kevlar vests.  Though the characters live through events beyond imagination, there is no need to preach the story speaks for itself. But why shine a light on the grotesque evils and terrible tragedies of WWII?  Does revisiting this dark moment in history satisfy morbid curiosity, stir sympathy for victims, pay a debt to the memory of heroes or entertain with adventure?  In a sense the book exploits terrors to dramatize faith in the human spirit and hope for the future but the account of survival in the face of death and destruction serves the higher purpose of remembering.  I had a parent live thru occupation but never spoke about the war, as in many families, the survivor only shared silence.  Now that most of the generation who can remember have taken their secrets to their graves, the truths recede into a foggy past.  Though the author is incredibly skillful, most readers can never fully appreciate war; but "All the Light"  helps us see and reminds us that we ignore history at our own risk.
“All the Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr, is an historical fiction novel that takes place in France and Germany during World War Two. Two of our protagonists are just children when the war breaks out, one (a German) quickly becomes part of Hitler’s Youth and the second (a blind girl) takes shelter with relatives in France. Both are brought together by their emotional connection to music and radios, and are inadvertently affected by the ongoing hunt for the infamous diamond that hides somewhere in the war torn streets of France. Similar to “The Book Thief”, we see how different life was in Nazi Germany and other European countries during the time of war. In this book however, instead of the hunt for books and reading materials, the hunt for radios spreads throughout Europe, and both of the protagonists are affected by this in different ways.<br/>As the title suggests, a lot of connections to light are made in the novel, and also the presence of radios and their wavelengths play a strong role in the lives of both Werner and Marie.<br/>Doerr’s novel is well written, and I really enjoyed the way the story is told (in small segments instead of chapters) that allow both of our protagonists to tell their tales. Although the majority of this book takes place throughout the 1940s, I did not feel that the author needed to jump back and forth between the years as he did. The novel would’ve been easier to follow had it been told chronologically, instead of in Doerr’s disjointed manner. I did appreciate the bravery and strength that Doerr gave to his female characters. Jutta was a no-nonsense, independent young girl and Marie, even with her disability, was extremely resourceful and intelligent. I enjoyed the way this book built up to its climax, and then drew to a satiating conclusion. I felt content after reading this book as all the characters had reached their endings in a way that made sense, with no questions left unanswered.<br/>Doerr states that this novel took ten years to come to life and I am grateful for every one of those years as it helped to form a strong, powerful novel that stands in a class all its own.
Right away we meet “The Girl”- 16 year old Marie-Laure LeBlanc who grew up in Paris and lost her sight at the age of 6.  She is the only daughter of a widowed father, Daniel LeBlanc who works at the Museum of Natural History as the locksmith prior to the German occupation of Paris.  And we meet “The Boy”- 18 year old German Private Werner Pfennig who grew up in Zollverein, a coal mining town 300 miles northeast of Paris.  We are alongside adolescent Werner and his younger sister, Jutta, when they find a crude radio which he begins to dissemble and assemble because “nothing he’s encountered before has made so much sense”.  The Reich learns of his aptitude with electronics and invites him, at 14, to attend Jungmanner, a military training camp for the best and brightest where he is instructed to “. . . eat country and breathe nation.”  He is described as “this snowy haired dreamer plucked out of the soot”.<br/><br/>The author uses alternating chapters to reveal the back story of each character and to bring each character eventually to the walled city of Saint-Malo.  In one story, the Germans occupy Paris so Marie-Laure journeys with her father as a last resort, to stay with her great uncle Etienne in a house, Number 4 rue Vauborel, which is also richly detailed.  In our parallel story, the boy, Werner is currently stationed at the Hotel of Bees, Saint-Malo, as an electronics expert monitoring the airwaves listening for planes.<br/><br/>Present day in this novel is two months after D-Day with half of western France free from German occupation.  Saint-Malo however is the last citadel for the Germans and residents fear there may be a thousand or more Germans ready to die for their cause.  Four years of occupation and now, a real sense of urgency.  The author describes leaflets dropped by planes to warn residents to find shelter or leave before an impending airstrike.  Marie-Laure's father is being held somewhere though and she decides to wait for his return.  The bombers plan to cross the channel at midnight.  Those chapters describing the present, ratchet the growing concern of the citizens of Saint-Malo as the reader meets many of the neighbors and townspeople who become real citizens of action.  We learn of past broadcasts from the radio tower with its ingenious cabling as we listen in on present day broadcasts- the reading of Jules Verne's “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea”.<br/><br/>Werner waits in the basement of Hotel Bees monitoring the radio.  Marie-Laure waits for her father’s return in her third floor bedroom with two tin buckets filled to the brim with water and the bathtub  on the floor below filled as well (in recent months there have been instances of water shortages).<br/><br/>There is also a rare, 133 carat blue, priceless diamond, “The Sea of Flames” and a perfectly scaled model of each structure and street on Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>The NY Times review had this to say about Werner.  “As the words of his teachers fight the power of his memories, an inner voice tells him, 'Open your eyes and see what you can see with them before they close forever.”  This resonates so strongly with the reader because in our parallel story, Marie-Laure navigates by touch and then by memory.<br/><br/>Throughout the story powerful images resonate- night-time readings over the radio, John James Audubon sketches, canned peaches, barnacles, a boiling frog.  How does it happen that Werner “when he opens his hand, there is a little iron key in his palm.”?<br/><br/>So, who should read this book?<br/>This book is perfect for readers who love Geography.  The place itself is fascinating; the reader can see in pictures of the walled city of Saint-Malo a natural isolation brought on by the tides.  This was “the brightest jewel of the emerald coast of Brittany, France” prior to the German occupation and it's easy to see why they continue to hold on to it.<br/><br/>This book is perfect for readers who love Historical fiction.  The pivotal event of the story is well documented.  The book provides an insider perspective to the events of the day, eyes on the ground so to speak through the observations and movements of Werner combined with those of the Whelk and the Blade.  The book has been criticized for glossing over the hardships of war.  I’m not sure I agree; the wartime hardships here are intimate, personal.<br/><br/>This book is perfect for readers who love familiar literature drawing parallels or individual observations about “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea” and the fate of Captain Nemo.<br/><br/>This book is also for readers who like to read aloud; some of the chapters are short like diary entries and the novel is presented in an extremely readable format.<br/><br/>What does the title mean?<br/>The first thing that comes to my mind when I think “All the Light We Cannot See” is Marie-Laure’s inherent hope and optimism.  She waits for her father, she ventures out, she takes action, she lives her life in spite of her handicap.  She encourages this feeling in those close to her.  For me, this light expands beyond Marie-Laure to include the good in her uncle, neighbors, friends, Werner, Jutta.  We read of small and large acts of courage, of defiance, of hope.<br/><br/>The light in the title is also a topic Werner hears discussed on a late 1930s radio broadcast about the brain’s power to create light in darkness (coal mines, blackouts, blindness).  The phrase “open your eyes and see” pops up in several different places in the novel.  Conversely the author writes, “to shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness”.<br/><br/>And if “light” is truth, there are many examples where we are confronted by lies- the letter from Marie-Laure’s father, the letter from Werner to Jutta, and where characters decide to hide the real truth or not to interpret it correctly.<br/><br/>Notable Quotes:<br/>“Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever” (pages 48-49).<br/>“There are, he assures her, no such thing as curses.  There is luck, maybe, bad or good.  A slight inclination of each day towards success or failure.  But no curses.”<br/>“Is it right to do something only because everyone else is doing it?”, Jutta.<br/>“There must be order. . . The entropy of a closed system never decreases.  Every process must by law decay.” (page 240).<br/>“Don’t you want to be alive before you die?”, Madame Manac (page 270).<br/>“Offering a loom on which to spin his dreams.” (page 389).<br/>“I wake up and live my life”, Marie-Laure (page 468).
At the risk of overstating things, All the Light We Cannot See is far and away the most sumptuous, beautiful, and heartfelt book I've read in a great while. This is a book to get swept away in.<br/><br/>Werner Pfennig is a boy growing up in a foster home in a German mining village leading up to World War II with no options. Brilliant and full of yearning, he seems bound for a life in the mines where his father was killed. Until, that is, his unique skills with radios capture the attention of Nazi recruiters, who bring him into the Hitler Youth program to begin putting his skills to use.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a French girl who goes blind as a child. Her father works as a locksmith in a Parisian history museum and teaches her to be independent--using elaborate models of the city to teach her how to get around, and teaching her braille so she can get lost in worlds of fantasy like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. When Nazis invade France, Marie-Laure's father is sent on a mission to protect a precious gem in the museum's collection--a gem that has a powerful curse on it, according to legend.<br/><br/>Naturally, the book is sending Werner and Marie-Laure on a collision course. Most authors would try to pretend that this is a secret, but Anthony Doerr plays with the structure of his novel by opening with scenes of Marie-Laure and Werner trapped in a city on the coast of France as bombs are dropped, flashing back and forth between past and present to show both how they ended up in this situation and what happens when they arrive there. It really pays off, especially since he makes you care for his characters so deeply that you can't help but feel suspense regarding where they'll end up by the time you get to the last page. There's suspense--and not because Doerr is employing narrative tricks, but because you genuinely care about what happens.<br/><br/>With Werner, Doerr gets at a subtle, unique frame of mind about war. Nazis are usually used as stock villains in books and movies, and while they are villains here, we feel for Werner because he is trapped. As a poor boy, he doesn't have any options. He has no control over his own position in life. War wasn't something he chose, it was something thrust upon him. He had dreams bigger than the mines, and war was his only option to even attempt to go after them.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure's subplot adds a dash of magic, but without laying it on thick. The Sea of Flames, the cursed gem that falls into her possession, is the most literal example of this. But even here, Doerr is really just playing with the possibility of magic more than implying that it exists--and that is where All the Light We Cannot See really catches fire. There is an allure to magic and fantasy. You might even throw hope in the same category as magic and fantasy during times as dire as the one in which Werner and Marie-Laure live. In those situations, hope is an audacious but essential thing.<br/><br/>I read this book very slowly because in a weird way I wanted to spend more time with Doerr's characters. That is probably the greatest compliment I can offer.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>For more, please visit my blog at www.SupposedlyFun.com
Two children, one a blind daughter of a museum locksmith, the other an orphan boy transfixed by radio and conscripted into the service of Nazi Germany, stumble through the concluding days of World War II. What unites them is an overwhelming sense of decency, of pressing on in the name of loyalty, love and wonder despite all that works against these life-affirming forces.<br/><br/>It is impossible to read this book without falling in love with the children, and hoping somehow that they will find one another and live happily ever after. (Perhaps they do, but I am not going to spoil the plot for you.)<br/><br/>The father of the blind girl builds models of the areas in which they live, a sort of geographic Braille his daughter can study, the better to learn to navigate the world around her. She learns to travel on her own, tapping with her cane, and counting sewer grates to keep her bearings. I would have liked to learn more about how she experienced the world. At just the moment I thought I would come to experience the world as she does, though, Doerr's narrator describes the setting in terms that only a sighted person would use. Doerr could have written an entire book about her, but that would have been a different book.<br/><br/>Both children endure shattering losses. Indeed, futility closes in on them, driving them to the very depths of exhaustion and the seeming edge of hopelessness. Futility hovers always. "Why bother to make music when the silence and wind are so much larger? Why light lamps when the darkness will inevitably snuff them?" We are each of us the sum of our hopes; life is a gift we receive unbidden -- the wise among us cherish it. These children are wise.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful read. I'll be looking to see what Doerr does next. Reading a book like this reawakens your own sense of loss and longing in a world of hard places and hard times. It takes courage to live. These children are role models.
I enjoyed this book immensely. A number of themes are set in an enthralling narrative. The novel contains elements of war fiction, love story and fairy tale. It echoes a number of other novels and styles - post-modern is, I believe, the fancy term.<br/><br/>The drama takes place during World War Two. The key characters are children. The leads are Marie-Laure, a French girl, and Werner, a young German. They both engage with the world through what they cannot see of it, though for different reasons.  Werner, brought up in an orphanage, is captivated by radio and radio waves, Marie-Laure has lost her sight - she has to rely on sound and touch to negotiate life. This is one of the many meanings of the title.<br/><br/>Marie lives a happy childhood with her loving father, a locksmith in a Paris Museum. He is punctilious in his care for her, teaching her to be independent and self-reliant.  These chapters reminded me of <br/>. The fall of France sends them fleeing to Brittany, to St Malo.<br/><br/>The war transforms Werner's life too. He leaves the orphanage, goes to a very brutal military school and looks to a future as a skilled radio operator. His unit  crosses war zones east and west, and he arrives in St Malo.<br/><br/>This is where the book actually begins - the two, still unknown to each other, are trapped in the blitz that destroyed the town in August 1944 [shades of <br/>.<br/><br/>The novel then travels back in time and charts their respective journeys towards each other. Can we hope for a young love against all the odds?<br/>Well that's one part of the plot.<br/><br/>The central idea of the book is that they are children though forced into adult roles- as darkness and fire descend, Marie clutches her braille copy of Jules Verne, Werner comforts himself with memories of his house mother.  The war years are the years of their adolescence . But in these times it is not just about growing up, but surviving. Other young characters are introduced - Jutta, Werner's little sister, the sensitive Frederick , a fellow student at military school along with the giant Volkheimer . Especially in the character of Volkheimer I was reminded incredibly of <br/>. Only now the enchanted kingdom is the blood soaked lands of Nazi occupation.<br/><br/>A key part of the story is a mysterious diamond, beautiful but cursed. It is being sought by a classically evil "baddie". SS Sergeant - Major Rumpel believes it is in the possession of Marie. He has tracked the jewel to St Malo, so he is in town too. Even in the firestorm he is determined to win it, hidden in her enchanted castle. Symbolism goes off the scale here - and there is a lot of it in this novel.<br/><br/>The book is arranged in almost two hundred short chapters - like flashes of light, a flickering film reel. The narrative goes back and forth, in time and place. There are really three epilogues after the curtain falls on the main acts - 1945, 1974 and 2014 - which should satisfy any reader's desire for completion.<br/><br/>There's more than one good story in this novel. A slow read reveals many themes. Follow the snails of St Malo - key characters as it happens - and take your time. It pays too to  savour the language and colour of his descriptions. In particular Doerr captures brilliantly Marie's world - when she is in the narrative my mental images were of sound and feel and smell, not sight.<br/><br/>Amazon reviews show the novel to be much more widely read in the USA. I can't think why - though he is American, of course. Fab book.
Zoe's Review - This book was recommended to me by the person working in a bookstore, they are usually very good at picking out unique books. It was very good and unique, just as the person had described it to me. This book is about Werner and Marie-Laurie. Werner works with radio's for the Germans. He has been swept up into the Nazi mindset, but he still feels a little off about what he is doing. He just does not know what to do differently. Marie-Laurie used to live in Paris, but moved to Saint Malo once France became occupied by the Germans.Marie-Laurie used to spend everyday reading in the museum her father worked at. When they left for Saint Malo, her father was carrying an artifact from the museum in hopes that the Germans would not get it. In Saint Malo, Marie-Laurie's father makes a model of the city for Laurie-Marie. She is blind and so by having the model to learn the geography of the city, she will be able to learn her way around. This book had a really cool perspective into the occupation of France and the youth mindset growing up in Nazi Germany. There are not a lot of books about what it was like to live in occupied France, and this does a good job of showing how the townspeople reacted and the lengths that they were willing to go to for France. Werner shows the common but sad side affect of growing up in Nazi Germany, although it is showing how people did not just whole heartedly accept it. This book was a good read. It was a little slow at times, but it was really cool how it was written. It jumped back and forth from the beginning of the war to the end of the war. This made it cool to see everything come together. The ending was really good, and I really liked it. I think the ending was very appropriate for the type of book it is, even if a lot of people would not like it. I recommend this book to you if you are interested in World War II or liked The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.<br/><br/>Maci's Review - All the Light we Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is about a girl named Marie-Laurie and a boy named Werner. Marie-Laurie is blind and lives with her Father in Paris. Her Father is the locksmith for the Natural History Museum in Paris. Her Father makes her a model of the city so that she can figure out how to get around. Werner lives in an orphanage wit his sister Jutta. Werner has a special skill for figuring out radios and how to fix them. He makes a radio and him and his sister listen to broadcasts at night. But since they live in Germany with the Nazi's in power they have that they listen to the Frenchman's radio in the dead of night. Marie-Laurie and her Father have to flee from the Nazi invasion of Paris. So they run to their Uncle Etienne. Werner is sent to a special academy to train him to be a perfect soldier for the Nazi's. Eventually Werner and Marie-Laurie paths meet in an epic conclusion.<br/><br/>I really liked how this book is written. It is written in a monotone and so it lets you decide how you feel about what is happening, instead of telling you how to feel by making you think like the character you are reading about. I also like how it is telling you the ending and what is happening at the same time. It jumps back and forth. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes World War II and is interest in the french side of it. Also to anyone who like The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.
The folk who study such things inform anyone interested that the range of light perceived by humans is a small fraction of the spectrum of light which actually spans. The light we cannot see inhabits the world, giving it distinction, depth and definitions beyond the distraction our limited vision offers. This wider spectrum, it seems, can only be seen when one closes one’s eyes and by allowing one to remember the light that infuses one’s being with the same intensity it illuminates all that is.<br/> Marie-Laure LeBlanc lives in Paris with her father, who is principal locksmith for the National Museum of Natural History.  Having lost her sight at age six due to a congenital defect, she learns to navigate her neighborhood from a model carved by her father. She is smart, brave and willing to explore what is around her. Her blindness has allowed her vision to be of breadth and depth beyond her environs.<br/> Werner Pfenning is an orphan living in Zollverein, a coal mining complex just outside Essen, Germany. There, he witnesses the brutal results of inflation, joblessness and poverty brought about as the results of the Marshall Plan after WWI. With his sister, Jutta, he learns to navigate life at Children’s House, the orphanage in which they reside. He learns early that electricity, as it pertains to radio waves, is as natural to him as breathing – he has the ability to “see” the elections as they travel through the conductors, transponders and wires  leading to the production of sound.<br/> The year is 1934; both of these youngsters will come of age in a time of global conflict the breadth of which will change the course of history. As the years pass, their once peaceful, inclusive country spirals into chaos and irrationality, as war draws near and these two disparate people are drawn toward each other. When they finally meet, it seems that all the light that is was waiting that moment to shine its brightest.<br/> Anthony Doerr takes a moment in history, a rare gem, two people with huge obstacles and knowledge of communication to weave a story that is enthralling, enchanting and deeply moving. This book is literature at its best, using fiction to speak truths hidden by facts; it leads the reader to see familiar history through a lens that newly directed. In placing the book at a time when the world was learning about “connectivity” and on the cusp of destroying itself, the author heightens the tension and magnifies the power of seeing what exists beneath what is apparent. War is destructive, yet it cannot annihilate hope. Evil can be powerful, but it can be defeated by those willing to resist its domination and allure. Gems are made valuable by those who seek them but they remain nothing more than stones often found in a creek.<br/> This is a book worth re-reading. By its end, the reader has all the information about the characters needed to want them never leave. By the time for goodbyes, the parting is too soon in arriving. The world has changed, having become much smaller by the ability to “visit” others across the world instantly. The world has remained unchanged, its people waiting to be lit by all the light we cannot see.
I think it's safe to say that I drowned in this book. From the very first words I was submerged in Doerr's magnificent, momentous and terrifying world of Zero: 7 August 1944.<br/><br/>There was nothing that I did not simply love about this book: the characters, the non-linearity of the narrative, the various settings, even the encroaching war which hovers, always, intrudes and then retreats only to re-appear like a spectre in the darkness. Mostly, I think, what drew me into this book was its sensoriness - one of the protagonists is a blind girl, Marie-Laure LeBlanc. She loses her sight slowly, over time and in her blindness, she leads us to appreciate the magnitude of other senses:<br/><br/>"To really touch something, she is learning - the bark of a sycamore tree in the gardens; a pinned stag beetle in the Department of Etymology; the exquisitely polished interior of a scallop shell in Dr. Geffard's workshop - is to love it."<br/><br/>On this journey with Marie-Laure, we learn that "(t)o shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness. Beneath your world of skies and faces and buildings exists a rawer and older world, a place where surface planes disintegrate and sounds ribbon in shoals through the air."<br/><br/>Marie-Laure's father assumes the role of hero-figure. He constructs a miniature, hand carved replica of the town in which they live so she can learn her way around. Eventually, without realising it, she can navigate her way from her house to the museum, the park and beyond. "Her fingers walk the tightropes of sentences; in her imagination, she walks the decks of the speedy two-funneled frigate called the Abraham Lincoln. She watches New york city recede; the forts of New Jersey salute her departure with cannons; channel markers bob in the swells. A light ship with twin beacons glides past as America recedes; ahead wait the great glittering prairies of the Atlantic."<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>"She moves along the tide line, almost crawling at first, and imagines the beach stretching off in either direction, ringing the promontory, embracing the outer islands, the whole filigreed tracery of the Breton coastline with its wild capes and crumbling batteries and vine-choked ruins. She imagines the walled city behind her, its soaring ramparts, its puzzle of streets."<br/><br/>Marie-Laure lives in Paris and far away, in Germany, lives her counterpart, our other protagonist, Werner. Unlike LeBlanc, Werner is an orphan. He lives with the lovely and loving Frau Elena who nurtures him and his sister, Jutta, with an unlikely tenderness. In this environment, Werner grows, becoming adept at mathematics and a range of engineering capabilities:<br/><br/>"He dismantles the machine, stares into its circuits, lets his fingers trace the journeys of electrons. Power source, triode, resistor, coil. Loudspeaker. His mind shapes itself around the problem, disorder becomes order, the obstacle reveals itself, and before long the radio is fixed."<br/><br/>For Marie-Laure, the world is reduced to touch and sound. She uses her hands to navigate her way through her physical space, and they always flutter before her. For Werner, it is all about the "Radio: it ties a million ears to a single mouth. Out of loudspeakers all around Zollverein, the staccato voice of the Reich grows like some imperturbable tree; its subjects lean toward its branches as if toward the lips of God. And when God stops whispering, they become desperate for someone who can put things right." He lies at night, hidden from the eyes of the growing Reich, listening to broadcasts from far-away places about science and the world and the way things work. He takes his sister on this journey with him and together they delight in the world that opens for them over the radio-waves.<br/><br/>But, life happens and "(t)he war drops its question mark" for both Marie-Laure and Werner. What unfolds is simply a marvellous tale of two young people whose lives run parallel, intersect only briefly and then diverge. Beneath the story of these amazing personalities are moral questions which Doerr raises in a subversive way. Questions like: "`Is it right,' Jutta says, `to do something only because everyone else is doing it?'" Thus, Werner yearns to belong - "never has Werner felt part of something so single-minded. Never has he felt such a hunger to belong." - but at the same time, he is keenly aware that although "(h)e is being loyal. He is being what everybody agrees is good... every time he wakes and buttons his tunic, he feels he is betraying something."<br/><br/>To tell you more about this book would be to spoil the story so I will leave off here. I will only add that as soon as I read the last line of `All the Light We Cannot See', I had this irresistible urge to return to the first page and to revisit the whole book. This rarely happens to me and is a testimony to the power of this tome.<br/><br/>Read more reviews like this one at: www.longingtobe.wordpress.com
All the Light We Cannot See is a novel that words such as "breathtaking", "lyrical", "mesmerizing" are inadequate.  The story is set between Germany and Nazi occupied France.  Maurie-Laure is a young blind girl that lives with her father who works for the museum where a legendary diamond is kept hidden under 13 locks to protect from the curse that surrounds it.  Maurie-Laure's father builds her a perfect replica of her town so she can learn to navigate it, gives her puzzle boxes with presents inside, training her mind to be deft and analytical and her spirit to be independent, observant and resourceful.  They have to flee their home town when it is invaded and flee to the home of her eccentric uncle and his housekeeper where they find refuge in his huge mansion.<br/><br/>Werner is a young orphaned German boy who can fix any radio put before him.  He listens weekly to a broadcast from an unknown area that teaches him much of what he knows and he soaks it all up like a sponge.  He should be slated to work in the mines with the rest of the children in his town, but is recognized for his gift with electronics and sent to the German youth schools, a brutal place where he is slowly brought into the Nazi way of "selection."<br/><br/>The story itself is not overwhelmingly original.  Stories about Germany and invaded countries during WWII could feel whole rooms of libraries and a large percentage being devoted to the merging of the lives of two characters from opposite sides of the war.  What sets this novel apart is the way it is prepared.  For just as chicken is one of the more common meats that people eat, it is in the preparation and presentation that determine if it is a simple dull fare or a gourmet feast for the senses.  "All The Light We Cannot See" is a gourmet fare of the highest caliber.<br/><br/>With his deft prose, we are given brief glimpses into the windows of his characters and he takes us into their minds to become one with them, flitting between them and tasting, smelling, breathing and being this capsule of moments of their lives.  Too many stories of the Occupation period focus entirely on the horror of that time.  And Anthony doesn't ignore that horror.  For one cannot fully tell a story of then without including it.  But, he does so without the anger, without dwelling on the savagery.  By simply weaving fragments into the story, you are never far from the reminder of the stark stripping of what life was like, the cruelty that can take over even the gentlest of souls, you feel even stronger the triumph, the beauty, the incredible strength of the human heart and spirit to survive.  And not just survive, but to also be able to find moments to live, to savor, to laugh.<br/><br/>It is not a happy story.  Nor is it a sad one.  It is a real story that is a mixture of both.  It is full of humanness, compassion, cruelty and an unfiltered view of the stripping of color of the world that way brings in its wake.  It is a story told in dream fragments, thoughts, wishes, fears and perceptions.  It is slow and melodic and breathtakingly intricate, often bringing you to tears as well as filling your chest with hope and joy.<br/><br/>I bow deeply to the word painting of this master artist.  I will keep my eye open for my own copy of this book, as this was a library book, for the words are ones I want to be able to re-savor again and again. I shall look for the rest of his body of work and pray that he has many, many, many more tales in his soul that need to come out and be shared with the world.  The tapestry he has created in the pages make the jewel within them pale by comparison.<br/><br/>SephiPiderWitch<br/>http://sephipiderwitch.com/light-cannot-see-anthony-doerr/
Marie-Laure is a young, motherless blind girl, well-loved and protected by her amazing father, a skilled locksmith at the National History Museum in Paris where he takes young Marie each day. Here she learns to love science and is fathered as well by the museum’s curator (?). Werner Pfennig is a young white-haired orphan who lives with his younger sister and various other young orphans in the care of a kind woman with few resources. Werner has amazing skills in mechanical engineering (?) and is able to construct a crude radio from scraps he and his sister find in the streets. Werner’s skills eventually lead to his becoming known and the Nazi command demands that he work for them (at age 16). Marie continues to be cared for by her father until the Nazis begin to bomb Paris. They escape to St. Malo on the coast where Marie’s psychologically damaged (from WWI) but kindly uncle lives in relatie comfort. Naturally, their lives eventually collide in St. Malo. In the course of the story Werner is forced to reveal the locations of resistance fighters by triangulating their radio broadcasts. Marie-Laure stays safe with kindly Uncle Etienne and his housekeeper while her father makes her a tiny model of St. Malo so that she will be able to make her way around the town. The Germans, now occupying the town, observe him taking measurements and arrest him, certain that he is a resistance fighter. (Father has hidden an extremely valuable gem inside one of the model houses; later a German visits the home in a desperate attempt to find the gem before he dies.) Etienne continues to be limited but grows braver in admiration of Marie’s bravery; Marie serves the resistance by transporting bread with messages baked inside to her uncle who broadcasts the messages. Eventually, of course, Werner arrives in the town as well; his job is to find the last broadcaster in the area. In the end, Werner dies though his sister lives; Marie survives and has become a university expert on marine snails, etc. All the characters are memorable, and the story, although told in a jumbled order, is truly touching and memorable. Loved it!!!
Set against the backdrop of the second world war, All The Light We Cannot See is a captivating tale that gives the reader a look into the lives of two extraordinary people. Radio specialist, Werner, and blind Marie-Laure are swept along by the fear, horror and devastation of the Second World War, until they meet in Saint-Malo. When they meet, Werner literally makes a difference in Marie-Laure's life.<br/><br/>The lively, somewhat explosive beginning of this book hooked me immediately. Frequent leaps to different parts of the main characters' lives kept the story interesting. However, the constant return to the ultimate crisis is what kept me riveted to the pages.<br/><br/>The magic of this book is, firstly, in the beautiful prose and the vivid descriptions that cast the reality of the war into the sharpest, most believable relief; more so, in fact, than in numerous other books about said war. Secondly, the characters are extremely believable and well fleshed out—the kind of characters that one will remember for life.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a self-sufficient, highly intelligent, and compassionate young girl. Despite her blindness she contributes positively to the efforts of the French Resistance. This is one author who, fortunately, truly did his homework on blindness.<br/><br/>Werner is a gentle soul with the heart of a lion. He keeps a cool head in times of immense danger—something that keeps him as well as others, like Marie-Laure, alive against impossible odds.<br/><br/>Other characters like gentle Frederick, the giant Volkheimer, and Werner's sister, Jutta, fill out the character cast in a highly professional and very fulfilling way. In a book full of war villains, Reinhold von Rumpel, the mentally and physically sick antagonist, inspired a small measure of pity from me.<br/><br/>Truly a keeper, All The Light We Cannot See is one of the books that I'll read over and over again, and each time I'll come through it a richer person. (Ellen Fritz)
I had a hard time deciding how to rate this book. On the one hand, I loved the author's way with words; it is almost poetic. But on the other hand, I did not like the structure of the book. It is a sequence of vignettes that leap back and forth in time to form the narrative. This works for the most part, but not always. At times, this method of storytelling weakened the emotional impact of the tale, and I don't think it was the best choice here. Also, Doerr takes much too long to tell this story. It seemed as though he got caught up in weaving the poetic narrative and lost sight of the story as a whole.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with the book was its lack of historical accuracy. He states that Marie-Laure had congenital cataracts and that there was nothing the doctors could do. Cataract surgery, of one type or another, has been practiced for thousands of years. In the mid-1900s cataracts were routinely removed, and while replacement lens were not yet available, the surgery made it possible for the patient to see somewhat. Another time Doerr says that "The beaches were devouring men - Americans, Canadians, Brits, Germans, Russians - and all through Normandy, heavy bombers pulverize country towns," and that this was taking place in May 1944. D-Day was June 6, 1944. The beaches did not "devour" men until then. There are additional historical errors, and other reviewers have pointed them out. I feel that they seriously detract from the story.<br/><br/>However, I generally enjoyed the book. Two of the main characters, Marie-Laure and her uncle Etienne, are beautifully developed and communicated. Another major character, Werner Pfennig, was not as expertly done, but his part of the tale was nevertheless interesting. The final major "character," is a rare gem, the story of which I found distracting and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The main thesis of the book is that individuals, when placed under extreme, long-lasting duress must choose how to react. Do they retain their moral center and adhere to what is right regardless of the consequences? Or, do they allow themselves to be corrupted and lose themselves in the process? Each character in the book comes face to face with this choice, and the choices they make provide the heart of the story.<br/><br/>If you can ignore the historical inaccuracies, slog through the sections that add nothing to the book, and focus on the beautiful writing and the exploration into human nature, you will enjoy the book. I did - for the most part.
Is there a name for a short chapter book? I don’t think so, but it makes for elongated reading. By that I mean it’s easy to say to yourself…”I’ll read one more chapter before retiring for the night”... again and again until you have read 50 to 100 pages. Get the picture? Then to make you read even more, the author alternates every short chapter (one to eight pages) between characters, time frame, or cliffhangers. Brilliant. If I’m reading a book with long chapters, I tend to look ahead to see how long the next chapter will be. If it’s too long, I say “sayonara” and retire for the evening. It doesn’t get any better than this, unless you are reading one of the greatest short chapter novels ever...'Animal Farm' (1945) by the dystopian writer, George Orwell. We will talk about this “writer innovation” later in the comment section.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr’s novel seems to tell several stories that collide in the waning chapters. We follow blind child Marie-Laure Leblanc and her father out of soon to be German occupied Paris during WWII to a walled French sea town named Saint-Malo, in a house occupied my Marie-Laure’s strange great uncle Etienne. Wow, that was a long sentence! Anyway, Marie-Laure’s father, Daniel Leblanc, is the principal locksmith for the National Museum of Natural History and is carrying a famous diamond (maybe), the Sea of Flames, which is sought after by the Nazi Party. As the Nazis approach Paris, the museum director sent Daniel and three other people in four different directions, three of them with fake diamonds. Who has the real diamond? What happens to the diamond? Does the novel even answer that question?<br/><br/>Alternatingly, we follow a German youth, Werner Pfennig, who has a propensity for fixing radios and is ultimately absorbed into the Hitler Youth Academy. The reader gets a good taste of how the Nazi’s trained and brainwashed the youths into a false bravado and hatred for non-Aryans. A good sidebar story is Werner’s relationship with his bunkmate, Frederick from Berlin. Neither boy believed in the Nazi Party, but had to join the Youth Academy (ages 9 to 17) when they got the letter saying…”You have been called, report to the National Political Institute of Education...” Werner eventually gets called into the war as a radio and transceiver repairman, working with a transceiver he partially invented. He is joined by the “giant” Frank Volkheimer from the Academy. Somehow, the meek Werner and the “giant” become sort of friends. In the ensuing chapters, Werner gets closer and closer to meeting Marie-Laure in the walled city. Will it be beneficial for both?<br/><br/>I thought the story of the terminally ill Nazi Sergeant Major Von Rumpel was pertinent to the story. As a gemologist prior to the military, he verified what this reader already knew from reading Robert M. Edsel’s non fiction book, 'The Monuments Men' (2007)...that Hitler was gathering all of Europe’s treasures. And Von Rumpel was in hot pursuit of the Sea of Flames. Will he also meet Werner and Marie-Laure in the walled city climax? Anthony Doerr has many more interesting characters in this pleasing novel, such as; Madame Manec, who runs great uncle Etienne’s six story house and the ladies resistance in Saint Malo, and Frau Elena, who runs the orphanage that Werner grew up in. This was a delightful novel with multiple stories that all come together at the book’s end. Great job of writing by Mr. Doerr.<br/><br/>Lastly, I thought that Doerr’s interchanging of the chapters between Werner, Marie-Laure, time periods, and other characters flowed brilliantly. Someone must have had a excellent continuity editor. And Mr. Doerr inadvertently whets the reader’s appetite for Jules Verne’s 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea' (1869) by constantly having Marie-Laure read chapter parts in braille and on great uncle Etienne’s attic radio. If I hadn’t already read it, I would probably be reading it as soon as I finished this review. Great job on this highly recommended novel.
In the book written by Anthony Doerr, titled ,All the Light We Cannot See, we hear the stories of children in Europe who manage to grow up during World War II.  Throughout the book, we are witness to their trials  and successes and finally see how their lives entertwine and even become fulfilled.<br/>  The main characters are fortunate enough to start out their lives with significant parental figures who have good morals and character and empathy for others and who seek to impart this to their children.  The story of the war is so profound that it is impossible to untwine its significance and effects from the formation of their lives. But in the end, the children who started out well with parental figures who showed them a "light that you cannot see"  or measure or manipulate with mathematical formulas, came to a point of growth and maturity in which they were able to intuit and trust the innate good in others.  They were also able to return that empathy and caring for others which makes humanity into the best of all of God's creations.  That seems to be the very definition of success from Anthony Doerr for these children and shows that it is possible to impart those characteristics under the most impossible circumstances.<br/>  Yes, I know that your left brain preferred mode will want to look up the elecstromagnetic spectrum and review all those lovely facts that we memorized for tests and then  promptly forgot since we never used them.  Go ahead.  In fact I did it too.  But also remember that writing for a writer is just as much a right brained experience and generally there is a message within the book which will ask us to use our right brain in order to understand the meaning which is not readily explicit.  Look for the implied meaning as you read though out this book.  Remember it when the children do not all reach the conventional definition of a successful life.  The implied meaning shines through their lives; speaking to us of "All the Light We Cannot See."  Rebecca Miller  11-14-14
A blind girl with a keen interest in everything scientific and a love of Jules Verne. Her father, raising her as best he can on his own, touchingly devoted to showing her a life full of possibilities rather than hardship. Her great-uncle Etienne, half-crazy, they say, after his harrowing experience in the last war, not ready to face the next one. His housekeeper, Madame Manec, who asks poignantly: "Don't you want to be alive before you die?" A white-haired German boy, a self-taught math whiz with a knack for building and repairing radios who is torn between his thirst for knowledge and the things he is asked to do with this knowledge. His sister Jutta, a few years younger and all he has left in the world after the death of their father in the mines, and the one who always reminds him of his conscience.<br/><br/>These are the characters in this haunting tale set during World War 2, beginning on the eve of the German occupation of Paris in 1940 and threading its way toward the liberation of Saint-Malo, one of the last bastions Germany held onto, in the summer of 1944. The book alternates between the story of Werner, the boy – how he and his sister grow up in an orphanage, how his talent is discovered and how, against all odds, he is admitted to one of the brutal Nazi schools for Germany’s elite youth, where he is ravaged by guilt about not doing more to help his friend who is remorselessly taunted and beaten for being “weak,” yet does not find the courage to act on his guilt – and the story of Marie-Laure, the French girl, whose father is a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris and entrusted with the safekeeping of one of its greatest treasures as the German army converges on Paris. They flee, all the way to Saint-Malo on Brittany’s coast, to find refuge in the great-uncle’s house, but even here they cannot escape the war and what they realize must be their role in it.<br/><br/>There is a third story line woven into this in bits and pieces: the one of the man who is on a mission to find the fabled jewel, the very treasure Marie-Laure’s father has in his possession, the treasure this man will stop at nothing to make his own.. . Eventually these threads all converge toward the end of the war, during the long and devastating shelling of the walled city of Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>It’s a hauntingly beautiful story. Aside from the historical setting of World War II and French Resistance, which I always find fascinating, there was so much beauty in the characters and the way they see the world. It was especially magical to “see” the world through the eyes of a blind person. Can they imagine color? Is the world partially closed off to them? Marie-Laure is one of those characters you will embrace with your whole heart and be reluctant to let go of when the book ends.
There are beautiful books. And then there is All the Light We Cannot See. Anthony Doerr skillfully crafts a piece of historical fiction that is guaranteed to keep one flipping through and devouring each word until the novel is complete. The novel, although nearly 550 pages, never feels long. Instead, Doerr's short chapters and parallel storylines make the book fly by.<br/><br/>Set predominantly during the later days of World War II, the book follows a blind girl (Marie-Laure LeBlanc) and a bright, orphaned recruit of the Hitler Youth (Werner Pfennig) as each comes of age in German-occupied France. Marie-Laure is, undoubtedly, far more interesting to follow. But Werner's failings as a character only help to underscore Doerr's themes of identity during wartime. As a reader, one never really understands Werner's inner monologue. Though it is debatable whether Werner himself understands what he is thinking half of the time. Mostly he is swept up in the machine of the Nazi regime--a typical behavior of young children during WWII.<br/><br/>Unlike Werner, Marie-Laure is a strong, fully realized woman. Living life without the ability to see never hinders the young LeBlanc from exploring the world. Utilizing wooden models supplied by her father, the young LeBlanc learns her way around rural France. This bond between father and daughter is so strong that it transcends their eventual departure (which happens early on in the novel and is therefore NOT a spoiler). Luckily, Marie-Laure finds solace with her eccentric grand-uncle and his kind and matronly guardian. Eventually swept up in the French Resistance, Marie-Laure exhibits a strength of character far beyond her years. She cleverly avoids capture from German officials on numerous occasions and thinks on her feet faster than many of her peers. Watching her grow throughout the book makes the story all the more compelling.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Doerr, Marie-Laure is really the only character worth getting attached to. Every chapter that does not include the young blind girl seems just like a temporary pause in the greater narrative of her. This, however, works more toward the novel's advantage. She anchors the narrative which sometimes veers in one way or another as the story is sidetracked by evil school teachers, Nazi officers, and treasure hunts. Everything builds to Werner and Marie-Laure's eventual convergence. But their time together does not last more than 30 pages. Eventually, all roads lead back to Marie-Laure--her life, her story, her narrative. With the young Ms. LeBlanc, Anthony Doerr has created a protagonist that not only carries his novel to greatness but who should be celebrated as one of the most wonderfully constructed characters in recent memory.<br/><br/>For anyone who enjoys a wonderfully fulfilling and surprisingly fast-paced read, All the Light We Cannot See will not disappoint. This novel rightfully landed on so many "best of 2014" lists for very valid reasons. Be warned though: once you pick up this book you will be unable to stop.<br/><br/>Favorite Quotation (of course if comes from Marie-Laure): "When I lost my sight, Werner, people said I was brave. When my father left, people said I was brave. But it is not bravery; I have no choice. I wake up and live my life. Don't you do the same?"
"What the war did to dreamers" - that's what the book is about.<br/><br/>The book weaves two stories: of a father and his blind daughter living in France and of an orphan boy and his younger sister living in Germany during WWII.<br/><br/>The relationship of a father and daughter is heartwarming. When the girl goes blind, the father carves a wooden miniature model of their neighborhood so she can learn her way around by touch. For her Christmas and birthday presents she receives a book, which she cherish greatly and puzzles carved by her father, which she learns to solve quicker and quicker; making her father laugh that he needs to make them harder and harder. The war forces them to move from Paris to Saint Malo, where her uncle lives. There the father builds her another wooden miniature model of the new place. Here she develops a relationship with her uncle that affects him in a positive way.<br/><br/>The other story of the orphan boy, whose fascination and talent of building and fixing radios or anything that would transmit voice wins him a place at academy for Hitler Youth. The image of the brutal academy is very vivid and heart-wrenching. His talent takes him from school to an assignment to track resistance, during which time his eyes slowly open and see what his sister saw before, that Hitler wasn't about goodness. Fight against resistance takes him to Saint Malo where he meets the blind girl and gets a chance to do the right thing. Not every story has a happy ending. I wished this one had a different one.<br/><br/>The book weaves other `threads' into the story of gemologist and perfumer and how the war effects their professions.<br/><br/>The book not only weaves all those stories, but also goes between present 1944 and past 1940, which I didn't see this as necessary. Weaving all those stories was interesting enough.<br/><br/>Many talents of the author surfaced through this story: his research, beautiful language, vivid scenes. This all resulted in an engrossing tale wrapped around many aspects of human heart.<br/><br/>The story will linger with you long after you finish the book.
Books are my passion-- at my age the only passion I have left. I love to read and to talk about books, to share comments about them; I love to write.  I have an irresistible urge to buy them, and touching a book  is a sacred ritual for me. I knew once a woman, who kissed the book after she accidentally dropped it. People thought she was crazy, but I understood her.<br/><br/>Now a book of such high quality found its way to me, all the way to Hungary. that it totally humbled me. I am as unworthy of commenting about it as if  giving my opinion of the created world.<br/><br/>Instead of a comment I would like to express my appreciation for the selection of the topic.  I am a survivor of World War Two, and just like author Helga Weiss (Helga's Diary) I too feel that  precious little was written about children and youngsters enduring the war, or the just as difficult post-war years in Europe.  Of course we read the diary of Anne Frank, or Esther Hautzig's The Endless Steppe. Later came Helga's Diary,  and  Fateless by Noble prize author Imre Kertesz, so we knew about children surviving or disappearing in the unfathomable  tragedy of Jewish children.  But very  little, as a matter of fact, close to nothing, was written about the thousands and thousands of other children and young people, who were  also victimized by the war. But their life stories, true or fictional, are just as much part of history as the great battles, or the famous (or infamous) peace treaties. This novel filled a gap.<br/><br/>As so many other survivors, who were baptized so to speak by fire and fear,  who  heard the terror of falling bombs, exploding  grenades, who learned to fear anyone in an uniform, I was not sure that I'll have the courage--or the stomach--to read a war story. As children, we lived  in violence; as adults, we can't bear to see movies or read books about  brutality and naked fear. However,  All the Light We Cannot See  is so beautifully written, with so much gentleness and understanding, that soon the love of father and child, or for that matter  the sweetness of almost anyone who plays a  major role in the book,  overshadows the terror.  The ghastly memories are tamed and real reading pleasure takes its place.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is a most special and precious novel.
This beautifully-written, well-plotted story transported me so well into the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner and their friends and family that I hated to see it end. Of course, beyond the brilliant writing, it contains some things in which I take a keen interest: birds, bleakness, sea creatures and WWII. The novel includes something related to all of these subjects plus many mentions of a novel (that I also enjoyed) within the novel, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is the story of a French girl named Marie-Laure, who, blind from the age of six, lives with her father in Paris. He is master of the many locks at the Museum of Natural History. When she is twelve, the Nazi’s occupy Paris and she and her father flee to Saint-Malo, a city by the sea where her reclusive great-uncle lives with his housekeeper. Her father and three others each carry what they believe to be a very valuable and superstitiously inauspicious jewel, known as the Sea of Flames. Meanwhile, an orphan boy named Werner with an aptitude for engineering grows up with his sister Jutta in a coal mining town in Germany. He knows that without intervention, when he turns fifteen he’ll be forced to work in the mine where his father died. Instead, he joins the Hitler Youth and eventually gains entrance to an elite military training school. It won’t spoil anything (because it’s so obvious and a bit contrived, though readers probably won't mind) that eventually the worlds of these two, Marie-Laure and Werner collide. All the Light We Cannot See is the story of these two young people, the choices they (and theirs) make, and of dealing with the consequences of their choices. It’s also about family, dedication to loved ones, ingenuity, war and peace and everything in between. It reminds me most of Suite Francaise by Irene Nemirovsky but those who enjoyed this book will likely also love: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut and The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Annie Barrows and Mary Ann Shaffer.
Almost poetic in its language and symbolism, this novel of WWII spins a web of characters and plot lines that all intersect during the Allied siege of Saint-Malo, France, towards the end of the war.  Left alone in her great-uncle's centuries-old, six-story stone house on the edge of the walled city, blind (but far from helpless) 16-year-old Marie-Laure hides in the attic awaiting her fate.  But fate has a strange way of settling old scores, and the twists of the plot will make for a very good movie some day.<br/><br/>Yes, the structure of this book can be challenging as it flips backwards and forwards through time and place, and its brief chapters change narrators in and out of sequence.  But each narrator's voice is so clear and concise and the place descriptions are so real and absorbing that you rather easily can let the pace and rhythm of the story sweep you along.<br/><br/>The main characters are the young blind French girl Marie-Laure and the near-genius but hugely conflicted young German soldier Werner.  But so many of the secondary characters are also significant and equally as compelling: the girl's locksmith father, her WWI-ravaged great uncle, the uncle's brave housekeeper and the owner of the bakery; plus the young soldier's sister, the housemother at their orphanage, the bird-watching best friend at the Hitler Youth school and the "giant" soldier who teams up with Werner to hunt down partisan radio transmissions.  All of these characters are richly drawn and intricately interwoven into the fabric of the story.<br/><br/>This is not just a book about compelling characters from a dramatic setting during WWII, but a more thoughtful look into the nature of the human experience and what impact war and technology can have on the human soul.  I highly recommend this book.
To date the literary world encompasses many talented authors but as you know, there are always stars shining higher in any firmament and this work of fiction is by far one of the brightest!<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr has successfully shaken any empathy we might experience with the volume of novels published in one given year! This is a novel you shall enjoy for its rich visual depth, each sentence bringing to mind another picture and a wealth of feelings guaranteed to make you feel you found a treasure here at last!<br/><br/>Doerr's words palpates as if he immersed himself in the very soul of his protagonists. In turn Marie-Laure and Werner leave the reader no alternative but to read yet another page and witness their attempts to survive another day in a world gone absolutely mad.<br/><br/>Through young blind Marie-Laure is perceived a wealth of sensations hidden behind the veil of darkness, sound, smell and touch highlighted against the backdrop of Malacology and Conchology....<br/><br/>Young Werner is the German orphan who yearns for his place in the exalted life promised by the new Fascist Party and their idolized leader.<br/>As a chosen Cadet for Essen's National Political Institute of Education he is challenged to brutal extremes as he discovers a brand new world of unimaginable sciences.<br/>His skills in Trigonometry will take him from the Fatherland to Poland, Ukraine, Austria into the hellish Russian winters and finally into the ruins of St Malo, France.<br/><br/>"All Winter the Germans drive their horses and sledges and tanks and trucks over the same roads, packing down the snow, transforming it into a slick bloodstained ice-cement, And when April finally comes, reeking of sawdust and corpses, the canyon walls of snow give way while the ice on the roads remains stubbornly fixed, a luminous internecine network of invasion: a record of the crucifixion of Russia."<br/><br/>From Paris's world of Natural Sciences to the destruction of St Malo we follow a young girl caught in a whorl of events which ultimately will see her cross Werner's path, reminding us we are all like sea shells washed ashore, rolling with the tides to rest eventually on far away beaches...<br/><br/>A stunning work of fiction ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE brims in physical details of lives touched in countless ways by a senseless war and spanning lifetimes. Featuring short chapters this magnificent novel is to be savoured without rushing and don't be surprised if you are sorry to see those two little words: "The End".<br/>Let us hope Mr. Doerr will soon grant us another literary gem!<br/><br/>5 Stars (Only because there are no higher rating!)<br/><br/>Warning: Due to adult thematic contents and some strong language, recommended for mature readers only.<br/><br/>Note: This was a library loan (albeit a copy has already been placed on order for my shelves!) and all opinions are mine only.
All the Light We Cannot See is a beautiful novel about innocence lost and finding the inner strength to endure the worst of times.<br/><br/>This isn't my typical kind of summer read. This is the sort of story I would search out if it were a film, but with books I tend to gravitate towards darker, weirder genre efforts. However, whenever I looked up the 'best books of 2014,' Anthony Doerr’s latest novel kept popping up on all the lists. So, I figured what the hell and gave it a go.<br/><br/>The story takes place during WWII and follows a young blind girl from France named Marie-Laure and a young boy from Germany named Werner. The blind girl has only her father and a love of books. Werner has only his sister Jutta. When the German's invade France, Marie-Laure and her father are forced to evacuate from their home and search for her uncle. It's not long before her father is taken away, leaving the young blind girl with relatives she has never known. Werner is similarly separated from those whom he loves as he is trained and schooled to be the future of the Third Reich. Any letters he sends to his sister Jutta are heavily censored or do not arrive at all. At its core this is the story of two young, innocent children who are forced into the ugliness of the war, both of them victims in some way, neither of them innocent for long.<br/><br/>But it is more than that. It's a story of deceptive simplicity, one that manages to say much about the world and its people, while it seems to tell the story of individuals far removed from the troubles of today.<br/><br/>It's a book about the invisible ties that bring us together. The strength of family. The bond of friendship and love. Much of the story takes place in two separate places, detailing the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner. As the book progresses, Marie-Laure and her uncle find themselves doing radio broadcasts for the French resistance. At the same time, Werner makes a name for himself in his young troop as he is able to repair electronics and intercept radio broadcasts. Destiny's invisible pathways will one day lead our two young characters to intercept.<br/><br/>Tragedy seems to be inevitable in a story such as this. And maybe it is. But Doerr has other things on his mind than simply telling us a sad story. He wants to charm us with beautiful language and wonderful characters. I came to love and care for both Marie-Laure and Werner. This book is one of the few that I can say that I became so emotionally involved with that there might've been a tear or two shed while reading it.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See deserves all the praise it gets. It's a fantastic book, one filled with beautiful, effortless prose and characters that will stay with you forever.<br/><br/>One of the best books of the year? Very much so.
I have read many books set during World War II and it is one era of history that I find utterly fascinating. It’s hard to find a story set in that time frame that doesn’t feel like something I’ve read before. All the Light We Cannot See rises to the challenge and exceeded all my expectations.<br/>Marie Claire is a young girl living in Paris with her father Daniel; she has been blind since the age of six. When the German Army prepares to March on Paris Marie and her father flee to the walled city of Saint-Malo, where Daniel’s brother Etienne lives in seclusion.<br/><br/>Werner is an orphan, living with his younger sister Jutta in Children’s House, an orphanage in Germany. He is a bright enterprising young boy, a gifted mechanic, but because he is an orphan he is destined to work in the coalmines. Through a chance encounter with a high ranking official Werner is admitted to an academy for Hitler Youth, which alters the course of his life.<br/><br/>The Sea of Flames is a supposed cursed diamond that an officer in the Nazi Army is determined to add to his collection of stolen art and jewels that are being accumulated in Germany.<br/><br/>To say much more would reveal too much, it is much more enjoyable to read the book to see how these lives very slowly become entwined.<br/><br/>The writing in the book is so beautiful and the story is peopled with such rich characters, from Etienne, a damaged soldier of The Great War to Madame Manec, Etienne’s housekeeper who is harboring some secrets. Even some of the minor characters are very well drawn and add so much to the tale.<br/><br/>Written in short chapters the book moves back and forth between 1940 and 1944, when American forces laid siege to the German stronghold in Saint-Malo. At the start I found it a little confusing, but once I paid attention to the dates on every chapter it was easy to follow.<br/><br/>This is a long book, 544 pages, but it is a very fast read, I couldn’t put it down and read every chance I could. It took me three days to read it, which is very fast for me.<br/><br/>This is my favorite book of 2014, so far, and is a very strong contender to be my top book of the year.
This is a remarkably well written book with a different approach to the Holocaust. Rather than one that depicts the plight of the Jews and the Concentration Camps, this one attempts to get behind the evil that man can create because of the inability to see clearly; it focuses on those who were not the original targets of Hitler and his henchmen. It closely follows the lives of two young children, Marie LeBlanc and Werner Pfennig, made enemies primarily because of the countries in which they were born, although Marie’s character might have made her a resistance fighter no matter where she lived. The author illustrates how the absence of light, the blindness that prevents sighted people from seeing the truth, can cause otherwise ordinary individuals to behave badly, to allow themselves to deny what they are actually seeing, in order to advance their own cause, regardless of the cost to others who are innocent, others who may or may not fit the Aryan mold of perfection visualized by Hitler. The story travels in time, primarily from 1934 when Werner is 12 (his sister Jutta is 7) and Marie is 8, to the end of WWII, ultimately taking us briefly into their futures, to tie up all the loose ends. It concentrates on the year 1944, setting the stage for the enlightenment of the reader. Werner wants to explore light that is essentially invisible to him, like electricity and UV rays, while Marie, for whom light is non-existent, tries to fathom an invisible world. Both children are in search of what cannot be seen. The connection, between Marie and Werner, that “comes to light” at the end of the book, profoundly effected how they both faced their futures.<br/>Marie and her father live in Paris and she makes the most of her life, even though she lost her sight as a young child. Father and daughter are exceptionally close. Daniel worships Marie and Marie depends on her father completely. He is her mentor, her teacher, her protector. Marie is a cheerful, optimistic child. Daniel LeBlanc is the locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. He builds special storage places to store the valuable objects housed by the museum. He carves a miniature version of their neighborhood for Marie, and she studies it with her fingers. He walks her through the streets pointing out landmarks, sewers, doorways, etc. so she can discover where she is and comfortably move about.  He builds puzzles for her to solve by planting surprises inside them to motivate her to overcome her blindness and decipher the world around her. When he can, he purchases Braille books for her to read. He takes her to work with him and she learns her way around the museum. When Hitler rises to power and the museum fears that their precious cargo will be stolen, they try to protect an especially precious gem by creating several counterfeit duplicates. It is a priceless diamond which is supposed to possess magical powers, the power to keep its owner alive while it brings misfortune to those around him. A German officer, incurably ill, becomes obsessed with obtaining it, and as the war rages on, he uses his search for the true gem as the catalyst for arrests and murders. The gem plays a major role in Marie’s life.<br/>Werner lives in the Children’s House with his younger sister, Jutta. They are orphans under the care of Frau Elena, a gentle mother figure to several children there. Jutta watches as her well-loved brother is corrupted by the rewards offered by the Nazis. The special school he is offered a place in, is an escape from the mines, which is a dire future, and it makes him feel more worthy than he has ever before felt in his life.  Although Marie is not sighted, she and Jutta see and understand far more than Werner does, and their characters are far more compassionate and less self centered. Jutta tries to encourage Werner not to be “blind” to the things occurring around him, not to give in to the cruelty of the Hitler Youth and the Nazis, as Marie later tries to encourage her uncle Etienne to rise to the task he is faced with, and not be blinded by his fear when his help is so badly needed to help prevent that same cruelty.<br/>Werner is exceptionally bright. He loves to explore and find out how things work. He is curious about electricity and other things that you cannot see, but that you can create. He builds his own radio from scraps he figures out how to transmit radio waves. At the special school he “decides” to attend (who really had the choice to do anything under Hitler), he is basically taught how to hate and how to obey, along with the skills of a radioman. He helps to design ways to track down the illegal radios used by the underground resistance movement in their broadcasts and spy network.<br/>As the characters are developed, we witness how they see what is in front of them, how they avoid seeing what is in front of them and how they create different versions of the reality in front of their very own eyes to suit their own needs and purposes. Some look away and get a perverted view, some stare into the lives of others and are themselves perverted. Does everyone have a price? Daniel watches as his daughter grows into a kind, resourceful young woman in spite of her handicap. She is well loved. In her mind’s eye, she lets in the truth while Werner shuts it out. Werner represents Marie’s enemy, the enemy of France and the world, and yet he is depicted with two sides of the same coin and seems a sympathetic figure; one is a young innocent victim of the times, and the other is as a guilty conspirator, aiding Hitler to advance himself. Werner tracks enemy radio signals and he discovers one that emanates from Marie’s home. How Werner reacts to Marie’s plight, to Marie as his enemy, is the life lesson of the book.<br/>To me, Werner represented the waste of the minds of brilliant young men and women of all stripes, because as a population, they felt so downtrodden, so hopeless and helpless, so jealous and greedy, they simply chose to follow a madman to advance their own cause rather than see the light of what was happening around them. All light was absent! They blinded themselves to the horrors they were helping to create, to the murders and the torture of innocent victims. Yet the one that was truly blind, Marie, had more vision and could intuit what was happening around her, could sense the pain and the absence of those who were disappearing slowly. The population’s willful blindness was far more dangerous and debilitating than Marie’s medical blindness. Through the eyes of these children, we learn about true blindness. Marie would like to see what she cannot and Werner was closing his eyes to what he could see, directly in front of them.<br/>Told in the voices of the young main characters, we watch as Werner is brainwashed along with many other young impressionable boys and girls, lured with promises of strength, success, nationalism, and ultimately, power. The Fuhrer demands absolute fealty, devotion, worship, and loyalty, on pain of death, torture, and imprisonment for themselves and/or their families. They wanted order and hope and he gave it to them as the ultimate father figure. Often, they were too frightened to fight back. Most were corrupted by Hitler’s polices and thugs when they were merely innocent, impressionable children, young enough to be shaped into the perfect Aryan, the concept Hitler promoted; yet some were basically evil in their nature, waiting for an opportunity to prey on others, others they believe had once preyed on them because they perceived them as weak and inferior. Thus the weak and inferior soon rose to the top. Hitler was worshiped as a G-d, a G-d who could grant an escape from the emptiness, oppression and waste of their lives, and in desperation, they did not think about the consequences of their actions, they thought only of personal rewards.<br/>Because the timeline moves back and forth and the action takes place in different locales, it can get a little confusing to keep the story straight. The chapters are very short and this too, can be a bit off-putting since the narrative stops and starts very quickly, as it moves from place to place and character to character, forward and backwards in time. The reader will wonder who is better off, Marie who sees and understands more in her blindness or Werner, who chooses to not see or understand what is happening, or what he is doing, because in supporting the evil of Hitler, in his evil genius, he will be set free from a future in the mines, the same mines that took the life of his father. Hitler had cleverly figured out how to make the unimportant and undeserving, powerful believers in themselves, and Hitler actively encouraged them to blame others for their own shortcomings, to engage in violent, vengeful behavior toward those they felt had held them down, that were not pure Aryans. We can all thank the powers that be that he did not succeed. How blind and different the world would be if he was at the helm; it would be a very dark place, indeed if the light had not eventually shone through.
Anthony Doerr has now put his own stamp on the World War II novel with this story of the lives of two children of wartime: young Werner, a German orphan with dreams of mastering the world of science, and the even younger Parisian girl Marie-Laure, who becomes blind as a child and then must learn an entirely new life. Both then become wrapped up in the mechanism of war.<br/><br/>Doerr's prose is impeccable, precisely describing his characters, the settings whether they be in Paris, the French coast in St Malo, the mining town of Werner's birth, or the many European fronts of his schooling and war-time travels. The action moves in waves from Germany to France, pre-war years to action in the midst of war to the end of fighting and back again. Some readers have had issues with this method...I did not. Any sense of displacement only added to the overall feeling of the horror of war in which the story is set. Time and memory do not always seem to run in one direction, especially when anxiety and fear are present.<br/><br/>One description of Paris before the war hits home for the French:<br/><br/>From a certain angle, the spring seems so calm: warm,<br/>tender, each night redolent and composed. And yet<br/>everything radiates tension, as if the city has been<br/>built upon the skin of a balloon and someone is inflating<br/>it toward the breaking point.<br/><br/>Bees work the blooming aisles of the Jardins des Plantes.<br/>the plane trees drop their seeds and huge drifts of fluff<br/>gather on the walkways.<br/>"If they attack, why would they attack, they would be<br/>crazy to attack."<br/>"to retreat is to save lives."<br/>Deliveries stop. Sandbags appear around the museum gates....<br/>But the huge bowl of the sky remains untracked: no zeppelins,<br/>no bombers, no superhuman paratroopers, just the last<br/>songbirds returning from their winter homes, and the<br/>quicksilver winds of spring transmuting into the heavier,<br/>greener breezes of summer. (loc 735)<br/><br/>In contrast, Werner is in school, learning the lessons of The Reich.<br/><br/>"Entropy, who can say what that is?"<br/>The boys hunch over their desks. No one raises a hand.<br/>Hauptmann stalks the rows. Werner tries not to twitch a<br/>single muscle.<br/>"Pfennig."<br/>"Entropy is the degree of randomness or disorder in a<br/>system, Doctor."<br/>His eyes fix on Werner's for a heartbeat, a glance both<br/>warm and chilling. "Disorder. You hear the commandant say it.<br/>You hear your bunk masters say it. There must be order.<br/>Life is chaos, gentlemen. And what we represent is an<br/>ordering to that chaos. Even down to the genes. We are<br/>ordering the evolution of the species. Winnowing out the<br/>inferior, the unruly, the chaff. This is the great project<br/>of the Reich, the greatest project human beings have ever<br/>embarked upon." (loc 2474)<br/><br/>But Werner is a thinking boy though he he also fears being different.<br/><br/>For Werner, doubts turn up regularly. Racial purity,<br/>political purity---Bastian speaks to a horror of any sort<br/>of corruption, and yet, Werner wonders in the dead of<br/>night, isn't life a kind of corruption? A child is born,<br/>and the world sets upon it. Taking things from it, stuffing<br/>things into it. Each bit of food, each particle of light<br/>entering the eye---the body can never be pure. But this is<br/>what the commandant insists upon, why the Reich measures<br/>their noses, clocks their hair color. (loc 2866)<br/><br/>The stage is set for the story to play out, Werner on his side and Marie-Laure on her side. The outcome of the war is known. The outcome for these two and their families, their friends, is not, but is held within the pages of this book.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!<br/><br/>An ecopy of this book was provided by the publisher through NetGalley for the purpose of review.
All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a beautiful written deeply metaphorical novel set alternately in Germany and France during World War II.  Unlike most WWII historical fiction novels this story does not revolve around Nazism or the rise of Adolf Hitler, rather it shares the struggles of survivors, children in fact, who must fight to endure and survive against overwhelming odds.  "All the Light We Cannot See" metaphorically refers to both protagonists, the highly intelligent German orphan Werner and the young French girl Marie-Laure.  Werner is enthralled by radio waves, science and energy transmissions that travels on "all the light we cannot see" while Marie-Laure loses her sight at age 6 and survives World War II as a blind teenager.<br/><br/>Seeing the occupation of Paris through the "eyes" of a blind young girl helps readers feel an entirely need understanding of this time in our world's history.  As a reader I become wary when beginning a book that immediately strikes a main character with a such a dramatic tragic flaw (similar to the mute protagonist in Gibbin House by Carola Perla).  Marie-Laure suffering from blindness prohibited Doerr from using sight references when referring to her experiences but it is an obstacle he overcame with incredible ease.  Restricted from describing her experiences with sight Doerr focuses heavily on smell, touch and sound which not only succeeds in building a relationship between reader and Marie-Laure but also in bringing the reader into a full sensory experience of this tragic war.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See should quickly be considered a must-read book by any reader who enjoys WWII fiction, especially those WWII fiction novels that break away from the standard Germany/Nazi motifs.  Doerr simply succeeds in every single aspect of literary writing.  The dialogue is beautiful and the words are always spoken with a purpose; the characters are impeccable with obvious care taken to develop even the most minor of characters; and what is there not to love about a story that makes another classic story such an crucial plot device?  If you haven't read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne reading All the Light You Cannot See will make you want to quickly acquaint yourself with that book.<br/><br/>This is a remarkable read and I can understand why it is becoming one of the most talked about books of the summer.  It is a bit of a lengthy book but the story is absolutely enthralling.<br/><br/>Review by Ashley LaMar<br/>Closed the Cover
how do I begin this? Okay, this book will take you on a journey that you will remember forever, the characters, events, will certainly tug at your heartstrings, and that's saying a lot from someone who's indifferent about most things... This book is an absolute masterpiece.
There is so much to this book that one just needs to read it and get involved in it. I have seen the reviews about slow pace, boring, they didn't like the switching back and forth in time, etc. I submit that those reviewers did not get into the book enough. They did not understand the depth of it. The character development is fantastic. Switching between time frames was not done in a vacuum. The stories presented from the past impacted on the characters and their future. All the Light We Cannot See means so much from a precious jewel, a blind girl, a smoky cellar with no light, to the small shining moments that give a glimmer of hope and cause us to act. It is not a book that compelled me to pick it up every chance I got but, rather, a book that made me sit down with a cup of tea with my feet up and let all of the lyrical descriptions and feelings wash over me. This shows us a small part of WWII that we hardly ever hear about. Those "insignificant" people involved in the war or engulfed in it so much they either lose themselves, their lives, loved ones, or their innocence. I believe the title means so much more than what a blind girl can "see" in her dark world. I think there are so many points of light that we do not see or even realize were there. I will not give examples because that would create too many spoilers and I think that one needs to see those points of light for themselves. As for those that say the details of France in 1940 are off, well I have never been to France, was certainly not there in 1940 because I was not alive so I did not even notice these little details.  The book is a novel which means it isn't true.  Just enjoy it! I truly enjoyed this book and wept to read its final pages.
This is a book that stays with you. The story pivots between a blind girl in france and a young German soldier as their lives are hit and shaped by Hitler’s rise to power and the disasters of World War II. What I like most about this book isn’t the descriptions, which are gorgeous, or the plot, which is fast-paced and deeply moving. Nor was it the interesting characters or the realistic setting. No, what I liked most about this novel was the fact that it gives both sides of the story. The inclusion of a protagonist who isn’t simply a German, but a German soldier – a Nazi – adds a dimension you don’t often find in WWII literature. It really shows you that war is never black and white. For every Nazi soldier who followed in Hitler’s footsteps with evil in his heart, there were others who fought for Germany because they were given no choice, because they had families to protect and gruesome ultimatums hanging over their heads, because they were just boys who were rounded up, brainwashed, and forced into hive-minded obedience; already in trenches before the true horrors of their mission became clear. This poignant novel does not sugarcoat the atrocities of war, but it also reminds readers that nothing in life is as it seems. There are no easy answers or set lines. Every man is at war with himself, with his nature, at all times. Every man is capable of unspeakable acts of violence and immeasurable acts of kindness, often simultaneously. A person, like a war, is all gray areas and shady borderlands. The trick, no matter where you fall, is trying to get back up again and live. This isn’t a book I’m likely to forget. Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>themathom-house is my website (see for more reviews like this)
Not to be a bummer.. But This book bled me dry. This lovely piece of literature - was a monumental tail of tragedy after tragedy. I hung in there trying to finish it; prying for some light of happiness in such dark times - but the hope was merely a small  payoff for what little I got back at the end. In short, this book is f*&k; all<br/>depressing - Sorry
Beautifully written: Every page glows and the characters allow you into their war-ravaged world to the point that you even feel sympathy for the young Nazi, given that he is swept into his role by forces betond his control.  Didn't want this long, rich book to end!
This book was very difficult to put down, and when I had to put it down, I could not stop thinking about it!  I would highly recommend to anyone who loves great stories, but especially to those who are  interested in novels taking place during the second world war.
I was sorry when this book ended. This author is an accomplished writer who writes beautifully.  Very impressed with his  style and ability to keep the reader glued to the book.  I couldn't put it down.  Extremely satisfying book.  Will look for more of his work.
Listened to as audiobook.<br/>This has been thrown out there as the best book of 2014. I don't think I would take it that far but it was a really great book.<br/><br/>First impression: it reminds me a great deal of The Book Thief, although they have similar settings, they are totally different stories.<br/><br/>What I liked: one can not overstate how beautifully this book was written. When discussing war, tragedy and even rape, the author does it in prose that is just lovely. The characters are also fantastic; rich and well developed and very likeable. I like the change in character perspective. I enjoy seeing this story from two very different angles-one of a young German boy and one of a young French girl. It also made it easier to get through some of the sections that were uninteresting to me. I was satisfied with the resolution of the story. I didn't necessarily like how she dealt with some characters, but I was satisfied.<br/><br/>Some reviewers disliked the insertion of the Sea of Flames storyline. I liked it. I enjoy fantasy and magical realism much more than historical fiction and I thought it gave this novel something different compared to the many other books about WW2.<br/><br/>Not so much: I'm not a big fan of WW2 retellings and of course I knew that was the setting of the story. It just makes some of the storyline...boring FOR ME. There is some jumping around in time as well as in narrator. If you have a physical novel in front of you, you can always flip back to see where you are, but in audio format, there were parts of the novel where I felt disoriented and confused.<br/><br/>Overall, great book and I would highly recommend it.
Over the past few years I have noticed the many books that have collected on my shelves over a lifetime, unopened after the initial reading or maybe not read at all. Slowly, I have been passing them on to friends, family members, used bookstores, and strangers. All the Light We Cannot See, however, is one of the few books I would like to keep. The blind French girl, Marie-Laure, and the young German prodigy, Werner Pfennig, are characters I will not soon forget. The cruelty, tragedy, and sadness of World War II are everywhere in the novel, but embodied in these two characters and in Jutta, Etienne, Madame Manec, and Daniel LeBlanc are also courage, love, and hope. To be uplifted by the stories of such characters is wonderful. For me, that is what a great novel does--it gives hope, shows the possibility of the good in human beings. But this book does even more. In the title, and in passage after passage, Doerr communicates the mystical beauty of the world, its sacredness, the threads of its collective soul that reach, like Etienne's radio waves, into the ether, that exist in all of us and in everything. Doerr is a masterful storyteller, constantly going forward and backward in time, constantly alternating between Marie-Laure and Werner and other characters in the novel, but always showing the way as surely as Marie-Laure can negotiate the streets of Paris and St. Malo with her cane and with her memory of the scale models her father created of the neighborhoods where they lived. Make sure you have some time ahead of you when you sit down with this book; once the master of the locks opens the door to the Museum of Natural History, you won't want to stop.
Yes, there is room for another novel about World War Two.  Without being "preachy" the story uncovers how technology (the radio in this instance) can simultaneously be used to foster the good aspects of mankind (music) and the evil aspects (racist propaganda).This author is new to me and I look forward to reading his other works.
I am no literary guru, but appreciate literature that imparts indelible impressions, awakes my conscience, tortures my sense of compassion and sends rays of color deep into my soul. This story does that and more. One of the best reads in such a long time. Beautiful.
This is a long book but worth the time. The background of the war with the characters is beautifully done. The reality of the times is portrayed with empathy and sensitivity. I loved the way the arts of reading and music were paired with science and technology.
I read quite a bit and this story is at another level compared to everything else I have read recently. Truely a specially writen novel. It will make you think about your life on many levels, the characters are terrific. Loved this book!!! I recommend this book
This is a Pulitzer Prize winner, which is usually a sure thing anyway. I liked the book so much, I bought the audio version so I could listen to it and savour it more completely. The story takes place mostly in France and in Germany in the years leading up to and during WWII. The main protagonists are a blind young French girl whose father works in a museum of natural history in Paris and an impoverished young German orphan who is fascinated with radios and is a naturally gifted electrical engineer. (The Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels is quoted in a prologue saying the Nazis could never have gone so far without the radio.) In fact, the radio is an important character in the story, too. The writer follows their separate lives, the girl and her father eventually fleeing Paris and taking refuge in the French seaside town of St. Malo. The boy is drafted into an elite Nazi youth corps and taken off to fight in Eastern Europe before ending up in St. Malo, where the story reaches its climax. The writing is wonderful; the writer creates a rich picture by increments of information from the experience of a blind girl being raised with the utmost care and sensitivity by her father and then by her uncle and aunt, while contrasting her life with the environment of brutality and battlefield horror through which the young German must pass before he reaches St. Malo.  Such a story could hardly avoid tragedy. I like it especially because it reminds us that there is beauty that we do not see and it hides inside the most horrendous situations. It should also, in my opinion, shame anyone who has been complicit in sending soldiers off to war lightly.
This is probably the best novel I've ever read.  I wanted to savor all 500-plus pages, at the same time that I wanted to get to the end to find out what happened.  The language was beautiful, yet I never remembered that I was reading a book that someone had written. Some raters complained about the jumps in time; I thought that the jumps added to the poignancy of the story because we readers (though I didn't feel like a reader, I felt like a participant in the story) would know what was going to happen before it happened, like when in our own lives we reminisce about times past and think, at that time I didn't realize that this present would be the result of that past - that is, we knew some of the things in this story, like being bombed, but not other things, like what happened ultimately, thus the suspense. If the reason readers love to read fiction is because we want to use our inborn ability to empathize, this novel delivers better than any others I've read, with the possible exception of "Remains of the Day" by Kazuo Ishiguro.  I thought I WAS the blind girl, Marie-Laure, and that I WAS the German boy Werner, and even the "bad" German, Rumpel, in his desperate search for the stone. To me, their motivations developed to a crystal clear degree (other reviewers disagreed).I won't forget this book for a long long time. But in fact, I'm going to have to read it again, because there are shades of meaning that I missed because I couldn't keep myself from reading on, when I should have stopped to ponder.  I can see why it took so long to write; every decision the author made contributed to the power of this story.
This book was well written. I could not put it down. I hate that I finished it because I loved the main characters. I know it will be difficult to find another book like this one  that I was instantly sucked into. It will be highly recommended to my friends.
As another reviewer has stated, I never thought I could LOVE a novel that featured a Nazi soldier, and I don't know if I can improve on all the wonderful reviews I've read of this book on this site, but I insist on adding my vote for a novel that captivated me despite my initial reluctnce to embrace the characters.  You must read this book if you are interested in expanding your understanding of "the big war", or science, or,yes, the human heart and how the best of us deal with difficult times.<br/>It will make you cry [both in sorrow and with joy], tremble and miss your stop on the way to work.  Yes, you will want to keep reading when you should be doing anything else, and, yes, you will choose not to do so because you cannot bear the thought of leaving that universe.<br/><br/>For the folks that didn't like the book, I see your points . There are discrepancies between the historical record and some of the details in the novel.  For those who cannot get past these, maybe you want to skip this one.  And to those who were confused by the doubling back in time, I get it.  Ordinarily, I hate flash backs and have been known to put a novel aside when I've reached my limit, but I could not do that with this novel.  I was determined to stick with this story, and these fully realized characters, through anything.  After a few moments of disorientation, I got used to the time shifts and began to appreciate the additional insights they afforded me into the lives of Werner  and Marie-Laure.<br/><br/>This is one of the best novels I've read in years and I hope to convince as many people as possible to do likewise.
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. A masterpiece of fine writing and storytelling. If there was a better book in the last year, I can't recall what it might be. Could not put it down, and at the same time, could not bear for it to end.  Don't miss this one!
A story that you willingly enter into completely, with heart, mind and soul. Story lines so intricately interwoven with characters you care deeply about. I'm left feeling the story was so profound that there are meanings and connections I have yet to make
Clever details keep you intrigued about what will happen next and yet savoring the descriptive writing style.  I really enjoyed this book and felt I knew the characters personally and identified with each one in their strengths and failures.  Must read!
This is another book about World War II. Set in France and Germany, it uses many viewpoints to tell the story of the blind heroine and a young German radioman.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure became blind at a young age. Her father teaches the motherless girl how to make her own way around Paris by building her a miniature city. By the time WWII begins, she is comfortable going around the streets and the art gallery where he works. Then her father agrees to help smuggle the museum's prize gem, the Sea of Flames, out of Paris. There are four smugglers. Three will have copies, one the real diamond. With no idea which he holds, he and Marie-Laure flee to St. Malo.<br/><br/>Then her father is recalled and disappears. Marie-Laure is left with her great-uncle, his housekeeper active in the Resistance, and a miniature version of St. Malo to guide her.<br/><br/>In Germany, Werner, a young orphan, falls in love with radios. He grows to understand them in a way that gets him into a special program for gifted Aryans. Later, his knowledge of how to repair, build, and find radios gets him out of the program. He's sixteen, but they claim his birth certificate is wrong, that he's really eighteen. They send him to the front where his skills are needed.<br/><br/>There, Werner works to pinpoint resistance radios and learns the real cost of war.<br/><br/>For most of the story, Marie-Laure and Werner lead separate lives, but the reader knows all along their meeting is destined. And when they do meet, the satisfaction that it happens almost makes up for the disappointment later.<br/><br/>Lovely writing. Good read.
I can see why this book is an award winning book, a bestseller. However, the story is slow and its ending leaves a lot to be desired.  The author is truly talented. He writes so that the images can be seen as well as heard.  The characters are so real that in spite of the story, I still finished the book to see what happened to them.  He also captured the horrors of war which is very important. However, the book is steeped in Modernist thought. Only the minor characters have faith.  The major characters are fascinated with Science.  Even Werner's talent for using his science and math skills to find Marie-Lauren and to save her three times, his heroism was overshadowed by the tragedy of war.  The author missed the opportunity to lift up the reader by presenting characters that triumph over tragedy.<br/>  I gave this book three stars, because the imagery deserves at least three stars, but the storyline and thee modern worldview deserve only 1 star. Authors that present war realistically, but also present strong characters who heroically triumph over their tragedies are Michael D. O'Brien (Island of the World, Father Elijah, and Sophia House) and Lucy Beckett (Postcard from the Volcano and The Leaves are Falling).  Their books provide some brutal scenes of the reality of war.  They also present strong characters whose faith and worldview help them do amazing things to help others. Also, a nonfiction example of this is With God in Russia by Fr. Walter Cisek.  It gives the reader a good dose of realism, but it also gives hope which is missing in many modern books and Fr. Cisek's story is true.
Those three adjectives are just the beginning of the accolades that I could bestow upon this book. It was a book of many pages that I didn't want to end. If you loved The Book Thief, you will love this book as well. One is evocative of the other, but yet dissimilar. Doerr's writing is lyrical, I could go on and on, but won't. Enjoy!
You will enjoy this story of the German occupation of Paris in WWII as told by a young girl who sees not through her eyes but her senses,  and the young German soldier who suffers the emotional and moral struggles of the war. The imagery is beautiful.
Only up to page 30, the rhythm in the introduction, tension, the sense of place and depth of characters, as well, what kind of story teller this author is, I'm relishing it all. One of the best 'first 30' I've read this year. Update when I finish it.
This was so different; so many perspectives!  Tried to imagine myself in those circumstances (not really possible!) ...would have wanted to be surrounded by the same lovable neighbors and relative saviors.  Look forward to reading his previous books.
I can't stand long-winded reviews that retell the entire story without offering an opinion until paragraph 10 so I will just leave you with this.....this book is FANTASTIC! Extraordinary writing, compelling story full of hope and heartbreak. Buy it.
My thoughts on "All The Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr: There is a moment near the end of the movie version of Fiddler on the Roof when all the Jews are leaving Anatevka. As they tell each other where they are going, one of them - I think it's Tevye's eldest daughter, Tzeitel, says her family is heading for Germany. Every time I see the movie, I stop breathing for a second at this moment, and in that flash of time an entirely different epic story flashes through my head, because I can anticipate what lies ahead for Tzeitel and her family. Even though Fiddler is about Jewish life in Russia before the Russian revolution, the horror of the upcoming Holocaust lurks in the background. I had very similar feelings while reading "All the Light We Cannot See." It is set in Europe before, during and after the German takeover. Although none of the action takes place in the death camps, the horror lurks behind every line of the book. As I read about a blind French girl and her loving family, and a German orphan boy with a genius talent for electronics and making radios, I can't help but imagine the more horrific stories that are not told in this book, but don't have to be told to be present. By showing how these two lives interconnect, Doerr lets us see all the love and all the hate, all the beauty and all the horror that humanity is capable of. The precise details, the minute descriptions of images and moments and interactions are spellbinding. I recommend this book highly. I plan to read it again sometime soon, and also hope to read more by this author.
I especially liked the well developed characters.  Werner's personality and predicament as a Nazi era soldier, with many personal doubts about what he was doing,  was very believable.  I could not have predicted the ending, which I like in a novel.
This was a breathtaking read. No wonder it's been on the bestseller list for the past 6+ months!<br/><br/>It's an epic character story about the lives of a blind French girl named Marie-Laure and a brilliant German boy named Werner Pfennig, and the mysterious and powerful way they're connected. But it's also the story of a legendary cursed diamond, the Sea of Flames, and how it passes from hand to hand.<br/><br/>This book showcases a few different aspects of World War II: Nazi-occupied France where a resistance steadily grows, Germany before and after Hitler rises to power, and the immediate aftermath of the war on the world. I'd never realized how impoverished Germany was following World War I, the lack of choice given to citizens such as Werner. I really empathized with Werner as his discomfort in the German army grows, culminating in his final brave decision.<br/><br/>There was so much interesting about this novel. From the various quirks and passions of characters to the surprising twists and turns. And, oh, that moment when Werner and Marie-Laure meet...Perfection. Well worth the wait!<br/><br/>But, if for nothing else, read this book for the beautiful writing. The descriptions from Marie-Laure's point of view are especially visceral, which may seem surprising given there were no visual cues. One of my favorite quotes: "To shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness. Beneath your world of skies and faces and buildings exists a rawer and older world, a place where surface planes disintegrate and sounds ribbon in shoals through the air."
I want to see a movie made from this book. Beautifully, elegantly, yet not pretentiously written. I love how the characters are developed slowly and how you begin to sense their paths converging. It's brilliantly plotted and paced. Love love love.
I enjoyed this novel with its historical background. It was informative and keep me wanting to turn the page and read on. There was some "heavy" duty scenes which I didn't enjoy as much . However, i highly recommend this well written book.
As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a book that I can put down because I am so enjoying it so much.  I do not want it to come to an end as rolling the characters around in my mind is like rolling marbles in the hand.  A true pleasure to read.
An impressive and captivating tale of World War II from the perspective of particular individuals--both French and German.  The characters were well developed and multi-dimensional, not just good guys and bad guys.  I hope it is adapted for film.
"All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr is one of those books that I want to go back and reread because I missed a lot the first time.  I was so absorbed in the story that I flew through the book and now I need to go back and savor the beauty and metaphors that I missed the first time.  It is a wonderful book, full of characters that I really cared about and who were developed over the course of the story, becoming real and difficult to leave at the end.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a blind girl who lives with her father in Paris during the German occupation of France dueing WWII.  When it becomes too dangerous to stay, she and her father take to the countryside and make their way to the walled city of Saint-Malo where great uncle Etienne lives a reclusive life and the housekeeper is like a mother to Marie-Laure, and both becomes part of the Resistance.  While there, she meets Werner, a boy who from childhood was only interested in radios, electricity, and taking apart things and putting them back together good as new.  Werner was chosen to be a student at a very harsh technical school after being part of the Hitler Youth program.<br/><br/>The story of these two people and others, as well as the secret of a diamond that is in the possesion of one of them, is a story that is not easily forgotten. It isn't just the light that Marie-Laure can't see, but so many other types that are present, as well. Written beautifully, lyrically and very readable, this is one of my very favorites of the year so far.<br/><br/>Highly recommended literary fiction.
The other day a friend posted something on Facebook that caught my eye.  It was a picture of a girl on the beach reading a book.  The caption read, "The moment when you're reading a book and the whole world around you does not exist anymore."<br/><br/>As an avid reader, being lost in a novel is a rare and magical moment.  You know you have uncovered something wonderful.  When I began All The Light We Cannot See, the world around me ceased to exist when I read page one.  I was in heaven! I couldn't put this book down.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a blind girl living in Paris as Hitler is rising to power in Germany.  Her father is the lock master at the museum, the keeper of all its keys.  Papa builds Marie-Laure models of the city so she can learn to navigate the streets on her own.  She counts steps and storm drains under his loving guidance.<br/><br/> Werner is an orphan in Germany with a talent for fixing radios.  He's sent to a special school to learn engineering since his skills are in demand by the Nazis.  His loyalty is a way to survive and he learns to hide his compassionate heart from view.<br/><br/>All The Light We Cannot See is the story of two young lives coping with the horrors of war from different viewpoints.  One has the ability to see, the other can only feel. This book is filled with love and terror, mystery and myth, kindness and hatred, all told so vividly I bubbled over with every emotion.<br/><br/>Ah! My disappointing streak is finally over.  No wonder this novel won the Pulitzer Prize.  I adored every single page.
I loved how this account was narrated and the descriptive language.  It was very creative how the two protagonists' lives ultimately meet.  I thought the storyline was a fresh and unique approach to a story set during WWII.  Well worth reading!
This is a book that will make you "see" the physics of sound and light differently. It does present a different perspective of WWII, but it is more universal than that.  It is both entertaining and thought-provoking. An excellent read.
You can see the characters and scenes through his descriptions.  He is lush and painterly in every sentence and yet you feel it is natural and without effort.  The use of short chapters with the parallel story keep you engaged and continually present as the tale unfolds.  It is more than a story, it is an experience.
I have enjoyed reading this book, although It was written almost in script. I wonder last few chapters were nessesary ?<br/>  main theme of being true to himself and others in difficult time was done in this WWll setting in Occupied France.<br/>visually very effective story I am sure it will go for as movie or TV.
Anthony Doerr graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1995. He is the author of several short story collections (Shell Collector 2002) and (Memory wall 2010) and several works including a non-fiction memoir, “Four Seasons in Rome:” and the novel “All the Light We Cannot See” (2014).<br/><br/>The rise and fall of Nazi Germany is perhaps the most prodigious of events experienced in the period from 1933 to 1945. It is known best by the anti-Semitism perpetrated by the Germans; and as a result the murder of millions of Jewish decent. However, there are a number of other underlying forces that defined the period as well. One of those is described most adroitly by Joseph Goebbels in the lead in to Doerr’s Novel: “It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio”.<br/><br/>It is the radio that casts a path in time waiting for the moment two unwitting strangers will meet; it is the ensuing force to the trajectory of their fate. The lives of a brilliant German boy, Werner Pfennig and a blind French maiden Marie-Laurie LaBlanc start in two divergent worlds and end in a narrow house at Number 4 rue Vauborel. It is a melancholy story of brutality, tenderness, survival, and young love unfulfilled.<br/><br/>The novel is very well written and uses a “back and forth” sequence to eventually bring the two protagonists together. While the work was not exceptional in any particular manner, it was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it be added to your reading list.
This Pulitzer winner tells, in subjective present tense, of parallel comings-of-age in Europe during the second World War: Marie-Laure in France and Werner in Germany. The former's youth is disrupted first by childhood blindness and then by years of Nazi occupation, while the latter - an orphaned radio whiz - is processed through the machine of the German armed forces. Their paths converge in the walled Breton coastal city of St. Malo in 1945, as the Reich is collapsing.<br/><br/>There are many fine qualities to Doerr's sweeping epic. His sense of ambient, textural detail goes a long way towards constructing Marie-Laure's sightless world. A sentence of crystalline perfection will occasionally pop up in the midst of his genteel prose, and floor you. The motif of a connecting network of light, in all its forms, is used beautifully and compellingly. And there are moments and scenes that are devastating, unforgettable. But there are also elements that felt frustratingly weak and hackneyed, like the cliche of overly precocious children, and a dollop of gushing sentimentality. There is a tertiary plotline about a possibly cursed diamond, a narrative that is both corny and completely unneeded, aside from supplying some heavy-handed metaphor and a touch of the mystic. If a character is fat, they're probably up to no good. I could go on.<br/><br/>Doerr's book is certainly engrossing, and built with tiny chapters that move with breakneck speed. It's worth your time, but just not quite the great work of art I was expecting.
Rarely do I find a book which makes me stop and reread sentences again and again because of their sheer beauty or breathtaking insight. This book is stunning. Not only is the writing spectular but the story is beautiful as well as riveting.
I put off reading this book because I thought it was going to be depressing & I was not in the mood for a depressing read about Nazis and WWII.  But this book was not depressing - thought provoking, yes!  It was so well written and the points of view were so believable that I could not put this book down & I still think about these characters & their actions weeks after finishing the book.<br/><br/>Doerr captures the complicated Nazi brain washing that happened in Germany.  I found myself feeling sorry for Werner (the Nazi Youth) something I did not expect.  But Doerr is not writing an apologist story for what the Nazis did or make the Nazis seem "right/good".  Things were very complicated.  Everyday good people did horrible things & sometimes came to know and understand that they were complicit in something horrible & some people are just horrible.  Life is not always black & white/dark & light.<br/><br/>Telling the story from a blind girl's perspective was so interesting.  The miniature neighborhood & the gifts in hidden compartments; intricate does not even begin to describe how wonderful Doerr wove this story.  The paths crossing could seem silly in a less adept author's hands but in this story, it works so well.  Even the back & forth timeline was well done.  I normally find that style of storytelling obnoxious but not in this book.  The success or failure really does depend on the author & the story.<br/><br/>I love how the story ended & it was not what I was expecting.  I am going to reread this book for sheer enjoyment.
All the Light We Cannot See has been on the New York Times bestseller list for (as of this writing) 38 weeks and was a 2014 National Book award finalist. The book jacket states it Doerr spent a decade writing this story. I can see why, it’s filled with historical details.<br/>Marie-Laure has been blind since she was six years old.  Now fourteen, she and her father live in Paris on the eve of WWII.<br/>Werner has a gift with radios. His “knack” leads the orphan boy to be admitted into a brutal branch Hitler’s Youth Army.<br/>The story weaves back and forth between Marie-Laure and Werner, each chapter no more than two to three pages.<br/>All the Light We Cannot See in not another WWII story. It’s not plot-driven, but character driven, except the small scenario of a stolen gem.<br/>Marie-Laure and her father are forced to flee Paris as the Nazi’s march in. They escape to Saint-Malo to the home of her great-uncle and his eccentric housekeeper.<br/>As Werner becomes a soldier and his expertise with radios and tracking signals becomes well-known, he isn’t sent to the front lines. He’s sent into France to help track the Resistance.<br/>Eventually, and inevitably, Marie-Laure and Werner’s paths cross in Saint-Malo. The intertwined tales recreates in harrowing detail the deprivation for civilians in Nazi-occupied  France and the brutality of Hitler’s soldiers.<br/>It almost seems that All the Light We Cannot See would be a hard book to read. However, given the magic of Doerr’s writing, it becomes a book of hope.
This is a book that Amazon recommended for me.  I couldn't put it down.  What a great glimpse at people from many different perspectives during the war.  I hope he writes many more books.  I will be recommending this book for my book club.
Anthony Doerr's spare yet descriptive prose pulls you right in to this engrossing story and never falters. While describing the events his characters go through during the chaos and confusion of World War II, he also presents us with opportunities to think about the wonder of life and the connections that tie us together.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure, the daughter of the locksmith of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, is a young blind girl living quietly with her caring, gentle father.  She enjoys her days spent at the museum, and is especially interested in marine life. Werner Pfennig is a young orphan living with his sister in an orphanage in a small coal-mining village in Germany. He, too, is scientifically inclined, fascinated with radios and the transmission and reception of sound that allows him to listen to voices and music from far away. The author carefully takes us through each character's life during the 10 years leading up to fateful events in 1944. Although he jumps back and forth from character to character and year to year the chapters are clear and well-organized so the reader is not confused. Eventually the author brings us to the present day where we see the events of the past, like the radio transmissions that enthralled Werner, reach long distances.<br/><br/>This is one of the best books I have read this year. It is not just a suspenseful tale of ordinary people caught in a war they don't really understand or want, it also explores the larger themes of our connections to each other and the world around us.
Beautifully written, enchanting characters, and intriguing plot lines.  A subtle and sobering reminder of war's impact on citizens of all factions and the reverberations of their actions that echo through the decades following cease-fire.
Beautifully woven plot.  Engaging characters and relationships with depth.  Historical background that creates concrete experiences of the hardships of war.  Cruelty and suffering along with bravery and kindness.  A very satisfying read.
This book is luminous.  It's plot, characters, and setting all serve to make it compulsively readable.  I read it on a car trip and left my poor husband without company for 22 hours.  This will be one of your favorite books of the year.
The author pulls you into that time and makes you realize how easily people can be lulled into routine lives and not wake up until it is too late to stop evil from overtaking an entire country.<br/>I could hardly put the book down.
This novel looks at the complexities of war and the human soul with a keen eye. The characters become friends--almost family--in the course of the book. Not an easy read but a deeply rewarding one. In the middle I thought of Milton.
I absolutely loved this book.  I thought the flow / back and forth between the story lines worked perfectly and created a sense of urgency which enhanced the overall read.  The character development was on point.  It's a MUST read.
Living within a war machine a creative German youth uses his gifts, yet is draw into the light of truth and love. A blind girl's father constructs a way for her to see and live in a world of war and  intrigue via touch and sound.
I was waiting for the right words to describe just how much I REVERE this novel and this author, and now it's gone an won the Pulitzer, so writers far more accomplished than I'll ever be are now out there posting glowing reviews of Doerr's masterwork.  Read those and know every single thing that sounds like it could possibly be an exaggeration is in fact true.  If Anthony Doerr had actually been a young blind French girl evacuated from Paris to St. Malo during world War II, he couldn't have written Marie Laure's point of view any more authentically than he has here.  If he'd actually been a young orphaned German boy with Arian good looks and genius skills with radio technology, he couldn't have written Werner any more authentically than he has here. These two take center stage, but the full cast of characters is equally compelling and real.  But the truest strength of this novel is its story.  It builds and weaves itself together from numerous viewpoints, casting lights and shadow, snippets of songs and meanings that demand the readers full attention.  Doerr takes no short-cuts.  No hint of trouble enters a page without a future pay-off.  No suggestion of resolution comes without eventually delivering that too.  You don't just read this novel, you step inside it and participate, and at the end, you're deeply grateful for the experience.  If any of those Pulitzer people are writing something like that, I can assure you, they're telling the truth.
I've read everything he has written and "Memory Wall" is one of my favorite stories.  I love the way he writes and crafts a story and people will be reading him 300 years from now.  I loved this novel just as I expected.
I loved this book. The writing was beautiful and so descriptive I felt I could "see"  the little town by the sea.  The story line was interesting but I enjoy ww2 stories. Made its point but not preachy. War hurts us all.
Some of us are writers who, if we're lucky, manage to create a memorable image from time to time; and then there are the rare authors like Monsieur Doerr, whose writing is a continuous patchwork of colorful metaphors and similes. A poet writing prose, such as, "She can sense his thoughts fluttering like trapped birds."<br/><br/>More than that, this book lets you--makes you--experience what life was like for the average person living in Europe before and during the second "Great War." A war fought so soon after the first Great War, the one that was supposed to end all wars. How long has it been for you since 911, since 2001? It doesn't seem that long ago, does it? And yet, that is about the length of time between the first and second world wars. The adults living in 1939, 1940, 1941 had fresh memories of the previous grinding, dirty, bloody conflict and knew what was coming. The children, on the other hand, had nothing to compare it to. The ones in Germany knew only the glory of blatant nationalism. And in France, they knew only the hardship and uncertainty of day-to-day living.<br/><br/>Being an editor and proofreader, I watch for errors that many others would overlook or not care about; and I watch for below-standard formatting found too often in Kindle books. None of this did I find in this book. It is professional on all levels.<br/><br/>Thank you for creating a very special piece of fiction--one that makes a turbulent time seem very real and non-fictional.
This was an amazing book! Back and forth between August 1944 and earlier.  It touched the heart and gave one the sense of what it was like to live and love during that time, both as a French citizen and a German.  A classic!
I couldn't put this one down, except for every so often because I didn't want it to end too soon..IBeautiful language and very well developed characters. It brought the reality of war and occupation home to me in a mew way.
At last, not just a great novel to read and study, but literature!<br/><br/>It is impossible to describe a plot outline of this book and attract your interest, and yet it is one of the most beautifully crafted and compelling novels. The war comes to us differently--not the massive atrocities of Hitler the regime which paints the shadows, but the individual and personal deeds that ordinary people carried out: betrayal, bullying, torturing, killing innocents. Yet every character is at once a villain or at minimum a follower of false ambitions and also a hero and savior at times when least expected--in other words, real and complex people, even the worst of those we get to know.<br/><br/>The reader experiences the war as though present in the small houses lining the villages under attack--not from afar but from within. The thirst, hunger, and uncertainty are palpable. The caregivers--and there are many--are challenged to create normalcy and safety in an environment that is none of that. They are some of the many heroes here. Everyone begins in this tale as ordinary and humble in their beginnings, rises to extraordinary in both good and bad ways, and returns once again to the ordinary--so ordinary in fact, that one wonders how the author created such commitment from the readers to follow their journey in every detail and every beautiful and poetic image, with every phrase and every scene a masterpiece of writing.
So beautifully written, with characters so well developed and real, this  has been my favorite book of the year.<br/>The relationships between and among all the characters were as compelling as the characters themselves.
A truly beautiful story written in lyrical prose.<br/>It tells the poignant tale of a blind French girl and a brilliant German orphan boy during World War II.  Their lives intertwine in the most unexpected ways through the boy's childhood interest in radios.  It is a heart-wrenching story of the horror of war, and the effect it has on the lives of the people living in those times, especially the children. But it is so much more than that.  It places you squarely in Paris, St. Malo and Germany at that time, with such detailed descriptions that you feel you are walking the streets with the characters in the book. The storyline is expansive in scope and time, but the author contrasts this with the most exquisite descriptions of the miniature models blind Marie-Laure's father fashions for her, so that she can find her way around Paris and St. Malo; and of the exhibits in the Museum of Natural History where he works. The  verbal illustrations of the crustaceans Marie-Laure studies fascinated me to such an extent that I want to further my knowledge of these sea creatures.<br/>The contrasts between the brutality of humanity and the splendour of our natural world are evident, but the story accentuates the fact that humans can also display remarkable courage, tenacity and selflessness.<br/>A wonderful novel. Memorable and enlightening in so many ways- (All the Light We Cannot See).<br/>Highly recommended.
Captivating and unusual story set in WWII.  There are so many short chapters that it makes great bedtime reading at the end of a long day.  This book kept my attention all they way through.  Beautifully written as well.
Wonderful characters. very well depicted,.  The interweaving of the two sides of the European War of  both the German and French sides were so well told through the main characters,  Portrayed their humanity very well.
As six-year-old Marie-Laure LeBlanc slowly loses her sight, she adapts to the ensuing darkness with the help of her father's ingenuity and love. The setting is Paris in 1934, and a more formidable darkness is coming, one that cannot be controlled or ignored by anyone until the LeBlancs are forced to flee to Saint-Malo. Meanwhile, eight-year-old Werner Pfenning lives in a German orphanage with his younger sister Jutta, and dreams of better things. But he too is swept up in a world stripped of choice where harsh decisions must be made.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is one of the best novels I've ever read. Part of me could go on for pages about the exquisite sentences and incredible structure that moves back and forth over a decade while gracefully folding back the layers. I love that the book is written in short scenes. Most of all, I love that a story about the horrors of World War II are revealed through the eyes of gentle, smart, inquisitive children who view things so differently than adults.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure's and Werner's lives are overwhelmed by politics and brutality, fear and distrust. But does this truly change them? How much do destructive events alter some peoples' souls? How is it that some survivors still manage to see a tiny fragment of light amongst danger and hunger and poverty? The answers took my breath away. Enough said. Pick up a copy. Now!
really interesting concept of which of our senses is more important - sight or sound.  A bit too much detail in some areas but overall a great story.  The ending left me hanging - I would have liked a better wrap up.
Two protagonists--a blind girl from Paris and an orphan boy forced into the German army--offer different but parallel perspectives on WWII.  A compelling story includes information on mollusks and radio electronics!
As a Boisean, we all love Tony Doerr as a community member and artist.  But I can't give this book a strong recommendation. First, do we really all want to read about War right now, especially the overworked and overwrought topic of World War II??<br/><br/>Doerr does write beautifully, of course, but it is from the perspective of two children/young people, not my favorite characters from which to view the World.<br/><br/>His organization of the book is the most perturbing though:  his chapters are only 3-4 pages long and each chapter alternates between the two characters.  He also skips back and forth between 1941 and 1944 at seemingly haphazard places in the book.  I feel like I'm on a seesaw, and I want off. This structure may be more challenging to Doerr as a writer, but to the reader he destroys the strength and intensity of his own storyline.  It is literature interruptus.  Plus I'm a big fan of chronological time, and this book would have been much stronger to stick with the way time works in the real World.
"Every hour, she thinks, someone for whom the war was memory falls out of the world.<br/><br/>We rise again in the grass. In the flowers. In songs."<br/><br/>Such an excellent story and so well written.
There is nothing about this book that I dislike. Exquisite! Well written, warm and alive characters, and all the emotion one wants/needs from a novel.  I read the last ten chapters in one sitting,  I couldn't stop.
This is the kind of book that doesn't come along too often: rich in detail, resonating with tension, exquisitely crafted, and destined to become a classic.<br/><br/>The Girl:  Marie-Laure LeBlanc, blind and driven from the safety of her Paris home by Nazi occupiers, travels to her great uncle's home in Saint-Malo, the walled city destined to be destroyed by American bombers.<br/><br/>The Boy:  German orphan Werner Pfennig, a self-made engineer whose expertise with radios puts him in the middle of WWII at a tender age, must seek out and destroy enemy radios from Berlin to Russia to Saint-Malo, where a young girl transmits beautiful music.<br/><br/>With characters we will long remember in settings too stark to forget, Anthony Doerr's latest book reads like a poem for the human soul, begging for the light of redemption with each page we turn - forward and then back - to savor the prose once again.<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr, whose stories have garnered many awards, has written a book for the ages and an extraordinary chronicle of war-ravaged days and nights, months and years, that rips innocence from the soul of children and makes them old before their time.<br/><br/>ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE must be on your reading list. And make sure you have time set aside because, once you begin reading, you won't be able to put it down - it's that kind of book.
I recommend this book with out reservation.  Well written, Amazing change between the voices, and the growth of  my own insight into that period of our world's history. Hart warming and saddening at the same time.
The language is poetic and the story often overwhelming but both combine to make this story unforgettable. It was a roller coaster of emotion reading about young adults trying to make sense of an illogical world.
Beautiifully written in graceful but powerful language that mesmerizes and captures the essence of the chaos of the second world war and yet also the importance of the simplest acts lending meaning to daily life
Beautifully written and well read.  Loved hearing the story but was extremely disappointed with the ending.  I gave it my own ending in my thoughts as the story demands.  I guess that it the light we do not see.
I recommended this book to my daughter and while we were talking she looked up the reviews on her smart phone.  She said:  "Wow, people really like this book."  A five star rating is definitely deserved.
All the Light We Cannot See was easily the best book I've read in 2014. The way I describe it to friends and family is that there is a blind girl from Paris and an orphan in Germany whose lives during WWII converge on Saint Malo during the Allied invasion. But this doesn't begin to convey the true nature of the book, and I'm no wordsmith so all I can say is that I get a warm feeling in my stomach when I think of the main Marie-Laure and Werner Pfennig.<br/><br/>Besides the beautiful prose, meaningful prose filled with metaphors with so many possible interpretations (I've never been good at understanding what an author is truly hinting at), and loveable characters, you've got the narrative. There are two timelines and one moves very slowly, from August 8, 1944 and the other covers ground more quickly, beginning in 1934. Interleaved chapters cover one or the other in alternating fashion. The non-linear timeline of the book creates an added depth that I've rarely encountered.<br/><br/>In the more slowly moving narrative that is happening years in the future, there are questions forming in your head- how did they get there? why are they there? where is her uncle and father?- questions that will be answered later in the book. It's almost like foreshadowing, (again, I'm no literary critic) but more blatant, more true.<br/><br/>In the end, there is a satisfying resolution. I am left with the emptiness that always follows the conclusion of a great read: the dread that I'll never find something to compare to it again. This book compares to The Art of Fielding in likeability of the characters, and to The Orphan Master's Son in terms of the narrative. Finishing both of those books was a similarly downcast affair, but looking back on them I just remember the enjoyment I got from them. That will come with All the Light We Cannot See too, but not for weeks.
This book completely took me away. I held it in my hands and it swept me up and took me deep into Europe during World War II. I was completely in the mind of all the characters, feeling the illness of von Rumpel in my own legs, tapping steps through my day like Marie-Laure, holding a battery with the electric excitement of Werner. Reading this book, I felt no choice but to be empathetic to all sides described; in one way or another, I saw how they could get swept away by the time of their adolescence. The book toys with the idea of purity. Our youthful stars M-L, Werner, Frederick, Jutta... and others too may look for it, but we see they are just trying to fight for a life of wonder, learning, and decency in a grown up's mad game. I do believe the title is not only literal to the storyline, but also alludes to the small kindnesses that must happen anywhere... even during the World's darkest time.<br/><br/>The writing is outstanding. Every sentence artfully crafted with a decade of care. I could select any one to use as an example of master imagery. It has been a very long time - perhaps a decade - since I've had a book haunt me in my dreams while I read it. This one succeeded... These characters sat with me in my living room, I felt they filled up the room.<br/>My only wish for the book, if I were the almighty editor, would be to move the final "Sea of Flames" entry to the very end of the book, set in the time of now. Re-reading several parts and the closure to the book several times, I like the feeling of an ending that takes us back to the jewel - a tiny piece of brightness, lurking in the very very dark of the ocean and possibly still the grotto.<br/><br/>I have a career in science and a love for writing that's worth it. This book serves you the observations of a child holding their first seashell, described with a voice of a veteran seaman. Totally worth it.
It is not often that I read a book that so enchants me that I totally lose myself in it - this is that sort of book. Set during the dark days of the second World War we are introduced to two German orphans Werner and Jutta Pfennig . He is being brought up to go down the same mine that killed his father. But he has a talent for making and mending radios and so by dint of his own enthusiasm he manages to secure an alternative future.<br/><br/>He ends up going to one of the National Political Educational schools or NAPOLA's as they were known. This is where boys were turned into fighting machines to maintain the Thousand year Reich. We also have the story of a locksmith and his blind daughter - Marie-Laure Le Blanc. Once the invasion is on and The Battle of France is all but lost they escape to St Malo where he has a reclusive cousin. He is also taking something that is both cursed and attractive to rare gem enthusiasts. The story of these two unassuming children is destined to cross, but the story of how that comes to be is as incredible as it is moving.<br/><br/>There is so much more to this book, author Anthony Doerr has written a master piece along the lines I would expect of Louis De Bernier - which is a massive compliment. The story starts off at what we think is near the end and we play catch up as the story unfolds and we are taken back to the beginnings for both Werner and Marie-Laure. The language is both subtle and inventive with simple words being used in effortless analogies to bring the characters, situations and landscape to vivid life.<br/><br/>It is over 500 pages and I just wish it had been twice as long it was that enjoyable. I could go on all day piling on praise - suffice to say that this is the best read I have had this year and will now take a look at the other four works from this remarkable author.
A young woman tries to deal with the onslaught of German soldiers in her city, despite her blindness. A young man tries to reconcile his morals with the demands of Hitler’s armed forces. Both cross paths in the most unbelievable and heartbreaking of ways in Anthony Doerr’s touching novel All the Light We Cannot See.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure LeBlanc lives with her Great Uncle Etienne in Saint-Malo, France. At the age of 16, she has lived with blindness for a decade but navigates Saint-Malo like a seeing person thanks to her father. A lock master at the Museum of Natural History, her father built her a model of Saint-Malo and taught Marie-Laure to familiarize herself with the town just before disappearing. Now Marie-Laure must learn to accept his disappearance and take care of her great uncle.<br/><br/>But taking care of anyone has become a challenge. The French face the Germans in the heat of World War II, and the relentless, ruthless methods the Germans employ almost guarantee their victory. Life’s simplest pleasures have become its greatest dangers.<br/><br/>Not far away Werner Pfennig awaits orders. The army tapped him for his extraordinary intelligence and capacity with electronics, but Werner can’t forget his upbringing. Although he and his younger sister, Jutta, spent most of their childhood in an orphanage, the woman running the home always treated all of the children with love and encouragement. When a member of the military identifies Werner’s talent, he wonders whether joining the Hitler Youth will benefit him.<br/><br/>Jutta doesn’t wonder. She and Werner have spent their nights listening in secret to radio programs from other cities, and Jutta has heard what people outside of Germany call the Nazis. She knows that the heavily-skewed propaganda on government radio shows doesn’t give nearly the whole story. Werner dithers but eventually joins the Hitler Youth; more than anything he wants to learn about electronics and other engineering subjects, and getting into the military gives him the ticket to his educational freedom. Little does he know how much of a prisoner he will become in other ways.<br/><br/>As Marie-Laure and Werner live through the early years of the war and then face its darkest hours, they begin to understand just how low mankind can sink. When they finally come face to face, it will offer both of them the chance to make some of the most difficult choices of their lives. But they also learn how kindness can appear when a person least expects it—like a burst of light after spending years in the dark.<br/><br/>Author Anthony Doerr spent 10 years working on this novel, and clearly he spent his time researching information about Saint-Malo and what it represented in the war. Some writers could end up drowning their readers in historical facts, but Doerr blends those facts with prose that will keep readers awake at night. Many reviewers have already “blamed” Doerr for sleepless nights, and he fully justifies the accusation.<br/><br/>Readers will worry about Marie-Laure and hold their breaths as she works her way around the situations of the war. They will follow Werner from the orphanage into the Hitler Youth and agonize with him over his internal struggle. More than anything, however, readers will come to appreciate Doerr’s handling of language and will want to turn back to the first page after finishing the last.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See has everything readers love in a sumptuous historical novel, and I highly recommend it to anyone.
An incredibly well crafted novel. The author took the time to create memorable main characters, but also developed the secondary characters which birthed a lush vivid story one can see, smell, feel and taste.
This book is very well written with many phrases that I kept going back and rereading just for the beauty of the phrase. I could not put it down, now I am sorry it is over. This is one book I will not forget.
The dual stories keep the read fascinating and compelling.  The way the writer weaves the story amid the chaos of WWII France and Germany makes this ones of the best historical fictions I have recently read.
This is a story set in WW II  and follows the two young characters. One is a little French girl, Marie-Laure who becomes blind at a young age. She and  her father, the museum locksmith, make their way to Saint Malo when Paris is invaded by the Nazis. Here they stay with the father’s eccentric agoraphobic uncle.<br/>The other character followed in the book is Werner who is a little German orphan boy with great curiosity which leads him to become an expert in radios. His skills are recognised,  and he is taken in to the Hitler Youth group for training. His involvement in the war comes early due to a falsification of his age.<br/>The lives of these young characters eventually meet.<br/>The book is full of wonderfully written sentences but it was not enough to make a it a wonderful story for me. I have difficulty putting my finger on why I was not easily entertained by this book. The idea was good, the descriptions stimulating, the characters were interesting, but I just found the story a little long and tedious. I did read to the end where there is an epilogue of sorts which is a nice conclusion,  but this seemed slightly rushed compared to the writing in the rest of the book.<br/>I also did not think anything was gained by not telling the story in its correct time sequence.<br/>I realise that there is something special about this book which has been appreciated by many others, as is evident from the ratings.
I am so glad my sister recommended that I read Anthony Doerr's latest book.  He has woven a story about two very different lives during a dark time in the 20th century that is breath taking.  A must read!
The best book I have read so far this year!  The war is going on in the background but the focus is on how lives intersect in surprising ways.  A original storyline that is very easy to get caught up in.
What a great story.  The imagery is fantastic.  I would highly recommend this book to those interested in little known aspects of WWII and the relationships created by chance.  I could't put it down!
This is a story that lives in your mind 24/7, a world you can't wait to get back to.  Set in Europe and Russia in the early to mid-1940's, The juxtaposition of village and city life bound tightly in international warfare, the impossibility of growing up emotionally free from such a whirlpool of fear and rage sets the scene for this unforgettable tale of Marie-Laure, a Parisian girl, brilliant - and  blind, and Werner, a German student of the National Political Institute of Education at Schulpforta.<br/>The only point they have in common are fond memories of an illegal  wireless radio program in their youth that encouraged knowledge and science and classical music.<br/><br/>This is another book with first person chapters divided among the protagonists, and a good deal of time jumping - worth the challenge but I had to keep my mental timeline at the forefront of my mind. A second reading will be easier, and necessary - I need to re-read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea before I pick it up again.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful story.  An interesting insight into countries at war, children trying to grow up in countries at war, and the frailty of the human, both body and mind. But especially it is the documentation of the human spirit, and will to survive.  Please read it.
This is the one.  It's astounding and I'm only 150 pages into this book.  A must read for anyone interested in historical fiction.  I can hardly wait to turn each page!  Kudos to the author and the ten years it took to write this book was well worth it.
Some stories are hurt by the way their plot is summarized. I expected this novel to be a superficial story about a boy and girl helping each other survive in war-torn Europe, but in actuality these two main characters meet for only a brief encounter. The story is told through short chapters with alternating perspectives, primarily about a boy growing up in Nazi Germany and a blind girl growing up in a wealthy French family, and how their lives change before and during WWII. As the stories of these two characters unfold, the reader becomes increasing aware of how their separate paths are likely to cross, and this anticipation adds a rich dynamic to the narration of their individual lives. The author is extremely effective in pulling this off, leading me to believe I intimately knew these two main characters even though they are visible only through a series of short, interspersed chapters. I was fully engaged with the book and the characters stayed with me--a sure sign of good writing.  I gave it less than five stars because the last chapters left me dissatisfied--I understand the strategy of bringing the story forward to the present but that portion of the book felt hollow, as if it retreated to mere plot after taking me on a rich, engaging journey.
I loved this book and did not want it to end.  Wonderful read, would highly recommended it.  Characters were wonderful, settings and whole story was just great!  Definitely one of my favorites!
I cannot recommend this book enough. It's beautifully written with great characters and a completely engaging, compelling story full of insights and wonder. My favorite book in a year at least!
This book is good on so many levels, I'm not sure where to start. I loved it! It really addresses the question 'what makes a person heroic?' Can an average person in unusual circumstances  be a hero? Of course. What about challenged people in very challenging situations? Can a blind teenage girl be heroic when her world falls apart around her, when her father disappears, with war on her doorstep, with duties and responsibilities weighing on her? Oh, yes, this is when heroines are made!<br/>The action is incredible, and though the current date changed frequently, I had no trouble following. If you know that D-Day was June 6, 1944, you will be able to follow easily.<br/>Were there any heroes in the Third Reich? You will find one here, in a boy genius who loves radios, but realizes that radios can be used to destroy lives. He reaches into the depths of his spirit and holds to the absolute value of life. It is about the supreme value of life, in a setting where life had no apparent value.<br/>The story leaps from the page through the author's precise use of language, and his facility with words. There are no unnecessary passages in the book. This plus a skillful plot keeps the reader engaged and involved.<br/>I recommend this book!
Our library fiction book group read and discussed this book tonight.  Most were amazed by it.  Two of our members lived in London and Czechoslovakia during WWII as children and the book seemed true to life to them.  The Czech woman said it gave her nightmares, although she loved the book.  She said she still doesn't lock her door at night as the Russians used to come into their home and use their facilities.  Were they mean, we asked?  Oh, no, they were young men. They were nice to them.  They used to play cards, and toss sausages and coins to her and her siblings.  They wanted to go home to their families.  Our London participant said the author captured the fear of the environment of the war.<br/><br/>Participants appreciated the storytelling, the writing, the use of two children protagonists, the short chapters which helped the page-turning factor, the fantasy, the suspense, the originality of the story, and the setting.  We listened to a short talk on youtube where the author discussed how he got the idea for the structure of the book, and found that fascinating.  This novel provoked lively discussion, and we had larger than normal turnout with new members coming to discuss the book.  It's a great book group selection
The writing is very polished and beautiful, but sorry, it's didn't grab me. It seemed  contrived and carefully ornate, a book built for success and easy tear jerking emotions, without any ounce of bravery and no risks.<br/><br/>Moreover, "All the Light we Cannot See" is not a genuine novel about American life, like the Pulitzer's are suppose to find in the haystack of commercial works. It seems written with a glossy and clever Steven Spielberg movie about WWII in mind, when I'd like to believe that the Pulitzers have the real bite of indies.<br/><br/>The plot seems not only contrived but also so Politically Correct, as in 2015: the blind French girl and the good German boy. And the missing diamond reminds me of the Goldfinch's stolen painting. Is this all our best writers can up with? (when they don't write about yet a zillionths crime?) Just Frazen, from the big names, is actually tackling the bite of today... I am sure there are many more obscure names.<br/><br/>There is a disturbing trend with the latest Pulitzer's (Donna Tart last year, now this one): grand, beautiful. and intricate edifices (novels) about nothing really, at fundamental level about American life, just like the Hollywood movies. Contrived and carefully crafted for success, not the real deal. These MFA grads seem to have acquired all the tools to say a story very well (even exquisitely) but nothing or very little to say actually....or they just lack the courage and just give people what they think will sell/win notice, etc. I'd rather read something really genuine.<br/><br/>Am I the only one thinking this way?
Best book I've read this year! Best WWII book ever! The story is gripping, and the characters are memorable. It holds the reader captive from page one until the end. The writing is flawless!
It is a historical novel set in World War II.  It jumps back and forth in time and from one first person to another and from setting to setting.  The characters interact from a distance.  The literary devices and methods of laying out the story are unusual but oddly effective.  There is a certain pathos in the anticipation of what will happen both by knowledge of events in World War II and knowing what must ultimately happen to some of the characters.  There is also suspense in not knowing what will happen to some characters who go missing and whose fates are not resolved until the war ends.  Some resolutions do not happen until many years after the war  with follow-ups on characters and what happens to then later in their lives.  It is a very  emotional read, the characters three-dimensional​, the circumstances of their horror of being caught up in a terrible time in history--all interwoven in Nazi terror and the Holocaust.  These are ordinary people who are sucked into the Nazi machine who meet that machine and the vicious perpetrators of that violence and the indoctrination and the bloodbath caused by the head on.  It is at times hard to read but ultimately worth the effort.  It is not sugar coated, tough.
The characters, imagery, sorrow and joy and light...beautifully written.  Not really a page turner, stay up all night kind of book...more the kind of book you want to read slowly and savor.
This novel portrays the  complex passions of war in a light devoid of hate and strikingly full of love for the world as one entity. It is a testimonial  to morality..  It is a poem of life.
I connected with this book on several levels.  The writing is excellent, the characters well drawn, the relationships heart-grabbing and the historical background used well.  The novel is imbedded in an accurate description of what the events of WWII in Germany and France did to those countries and the people who were caught up in a horror beyond their control.<br/><br/>In the interest of full disclosure it may have been more meaningful to me because elements of the story resonated with personal events in my husband's life.  In Doerr's novel a hidden short wave radio allows two young children in Germany, a brother and sister, to listen clandestinely to broadcasts coming from France and the results of that inform a highly significant thread in the story.  In my husband's case, as a boy, not in Germany but in Wyoming, his life was significantly affected by the short wave radio that brought the rest of the world, and in his case, classical music and Winston Churchill, into his basement bedroom while the rest of family slept.  Additionally, as a Paratrooper in World War II he took part in the liberation of Southern France and was later stationed in Berlin.  Through his stories and those of others who served with him, that time and place took on a reality for me that no doubt informed my reading of this book.<br/><br/>But above all else it is a compelling, well written story about people you come to care greatly about.  It is about connections and disconnections, about love, about obsession and about courage.  Read it, you'll see.
All the (5) star rave reviews are true.  This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves and appreciates beautiful writing, real character portraits, and understands that a happy" ending can be expressed in many ways.  I loved this book.
If you are asking yourself why the world needs another book on World War II, you will find the answer and much more in “All the Light We Cannot See.” In his new novel, Anthony Doerr creates a magical combination of characters who manage to carve out pockets of peace and kindness in a world of separation, loneliness and unspeakable inhumanity.<br/><br/>Nothing about this beautifully crafted book feels forced or manipulated, even though the reader knows from the outset that the two children introduced in the first pages are certain to cross paths. But when and why and what will happen? Ironically, one child cannot physically see; and one is technically gifted with radio – a medium dependent on hearing alone.<br/><br/>In maintaining the tension of the storyline while letting the story unfold, Doerr creates a pacing that is brilliant. There is not one chapter, one line, one word that I would cut. The writing is direct and unflinching, while at the same time poetic. The question of war hangs in the air, debated until the battle begins. “The war drops its question mark,” says Doerr. Six simple words, heartbreaking in their simplicity.<br/><br/>Some books haunt you forever. This is one of those.
This is a beautifully poetic story.  Simply yet beautifully told - a really unique look at a WWII story - interwoven from many points of view.  A great read, highly recommend this book!!
All The Light We Cannot See - Doerr  5 stars<br/>It’s too easy to say that this book is about blind teenaged French girl and a teenaged German radio operator during WW2. It is about those two children from opposing sides of the conflict, their suffering, loss, and the strange convergence of their lives. It is also reaches back to WW1 with its political and personal scars. At the very end, Doerr ties his story to the present day. A reminder, lest we forget, that it wasn’t really so long ago.<br/><br/>This story is unique, similar to, but unlike, other WW2 fiction that I’ve read, and I rank it with my favorites. The character and plot complexity were as good as Russell’s  A Thread of Grace. The prose was as lyrical and atmospheric as in Eng’s The Garden of Evening Mists. Marie-Laure and her brailled Jules Verne and Werner with his radios were as appealing as Liesel Meminger and Rudy Steiner from The Book Thief. The plot was suspenseful and kept me turning the pages of the short chapters.<br/><br/>Before you begin, get a recording of Debussy’s Claire de Lune. You need it, and if you can arrange for it to sound like an ancient scratched gramophone recording, that would be better.
Words infused with light and characters who will haunt many different frequencies.  Makes me long to see the sea sparkling with light, and has me listening more carefully to the trees.
One of the best books I have ever read. The descriptions of people and places and things were excellent and most enjoyable. I found myself reading some passages twice for their beauty.
There are few books I've ever read that match Anthony Doerr's writing and story.  I can only say that this is on my list of lifetime favorites...and my life has already been very long.
This book quite simply is one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  I will NEVER forget the last line of the book.  It took my breath away and will stay with me forever.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I loved the character development and the way the two storylines converge at the end of the book.  Doerr has a wonderful way with descriptive language
This is one of the best books I have ever read.... Amazing description and prose weaving a tale of human goodness in a time and place that we all have perceived as completely evil...
Simply one of the best books I have ever read. It is up there with The Red Tent, anything by Jonathan Carroll, Kate DiCamillo, Louise Erdrich,or Karen Russell. Just a beautiful book.
This story has unique and engaging characters in a story about the end (and middle) of World War II in France. It is easy to read and was a believable tale. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
I definitely put this at 3.5 stars.  Maybe more.  But overall I just did not have the reading experience I wanted.  I wanted more depth to the characters.  I felt there were shortcuts made simply because who when and where they were.  As if the general idea of the story was enough and I should get more nuance.<br/><br/>A good part of this was due to the over short sections devoted to characters and time.  The jumps from one to another seemed almost a deliberate attempt to deliver the story in broad strokes instead of small and more telling intimate ones.  Again I felt that the general concept of the story, German Boy, Blind Girl.  WWII, France, Nazis etc. where like a storyboard set up for producers to make the next big important star studded awards driven movie.<br/><br/>I can love something that is poignant and tragic and maudlin enough but I like to be given the material that prompts these emotions and not forced to swallow them a certain way.  Something I felt the author tried to so.  Again with a movie parallel it is a bit when the soundtrack intrudes just slightly too much to prompt the viewer on how he is supposed to feel during a certain scene.
Historical fiction at its best! Great character development.  Plot twists and turns.  I didn't want to stop reading to go to sleep and spent several nights with not a lot of sleep.
This is a heartbreaking novel set in WWII Paris and France.  A widowed locksmith for the Museum of Natural History  is raising his daughter creating three dimensional maps of the city to help her get an understanding of her surroundings as she becomes blind at the age of 16  Invaded by the German army , the father and daughter flee the city and end up in St Malo after a difficult journey.  His uncle Etienne lives in the family home, a grand mansion overlooking the harbor. There is tension and mystery in the story, a hint of redemption of the uncle who was “shell shocked" during the first World War, who had not lived a normal life in the years since. The need to care for his grand niece after her father is imprisoned by the Germans forces Etienne to come to terms with his sheltered, fear-filled existence and awakens him to the realities of the condition they find themselves in.  Tired of the killing and the futility of war, a young German radio engineer allows them to remain undiscovered by the German army seeking to dismantle their transmitter.  Though one hopes for reconciliation of all parties, neither father nor radio engineer survive the war.
Doerr has written a marvelous story set in the the second World War. The book is beautifully written and will appeal to a wide audience. The two principal protagonists are a young blind French girl - Marie-Laure and young orphaned German boy -Werner. The story of these young persons are told in parallel fashion. Marie-Laure's father is a key-maker and in charge of the keys of the French Museum of Art in Paris which contains a unique and valuable gem known as the Sea of Flames. The protection of this gem and the search for it by German authorities plays a central roll in the story. Werner is a small boy extraordinarily gifted in science and engineering (a nerd, in other words) which helps earn his way out of the orphanage and into a school especially designed for the 'best and brightest' of the Fuhrer's youth and is inducted into the German army at the tender age of 15. The lives of the two protagonists cross in 1944 in the small city of St. Malo on the Brittany coast when this city is being destroyed by allied bombers. It is a gripping tale, beautifully told with excellent character development and  real-world heroes who are all flawed in some way.
A really excellent read! "All the Light We Cannot See" is  beautifully written ( with rich prose) and ultimately offers a very uplifting story.  My highest recommendation!
I enjoyed this book. It is the story of a blind girl, a radio enthusiast, and a diamond.<br/><br/>This won't sound very urbane, but I wonder sometimes how an author like Doerr can dream up a story like this. It's quite detailed, and provides a window into the life of someone who turned blind at age 6. It also sheds light on how easy it is (was) to be enchanted by the medium of radio, one that has largely disappeared from modern life except for a select few who still listen behind the wheel of a car.<br/><br/>Those of us old enough to have listened to the radio at night are reminded of the excitement of hearing voices from far away in the darkness. Both the blind girl and the radio fan (a budding Nazi) share this fascination, to differing degrees and to different ends.<br/><br/>The novel is quite lyrical, and reads quite quickly, but it's a little heavy on the symbolism and light, in places, on plot. For example, at the end of the book, I didn't understand what happened to the diamond or its ultimate significance to the story.<br/><br/>This is a problem where there is such attention placed on how something is being said rather than the root message. Some, at least one (me) could not see the forest for the trees.<br/><br/>But I enjoyed reading the book. And Mr. Doerr gets kudos for giving so much attention to radio. After working in the business for 20 years, I'll always appreciate what radio has to offer--mystery and a story.
The best book I've read this year.  Wonderful story flawlessly written.  Takes you through two sides of WWII through the eyes of two young characters caught in the maelstrom.
This historical novel from a writer of short stories is beautifully written and dense - as well written short stories are.  It captures "all the light we cannot see".
It was sheer stubbornness that got me through this book - with all the awards and rave reviews, I kept telling myself it must get better. I love historical fiction, but this book made the historical setting feel like a gimmick. It felt very young adult historical fiction - something done much better by YA authors such as Avi.<br/><br/>Also gimmicky and without much purpose was the narrative style of using multiple time jumps, forward and backward. WIth the multiple storylines, this added construct just made the story feel more disjointed.<br/><br/>After the climax, the book continues with more time jumps and contrived occurrences which seem to be included merely to revisit the earlier characters. Usually it can be satisfying to have circular plots that wrap up loose ends and answer questions, but these “visits” to the different characters were void of emotional connection and too improbable. Would a medical camp for prisoners of war really save the small nameless effects of a soldier and track down his leader in the defeated military?<br/><br/>With the tragedy and loss - trying not to give spoilers- the theme of the devastation of war could be present, but then the glib epilogue style of the last chapters undermines this theme.<br/><br/>I don’t have much time for leisure reading, and I regret the hours spent on this book and I am perplexed by the multitude of positive reviews.
Doerr's story about two young people, one in Germany and the other in France, evokes life for citizens before, during and after World War II. The girl is blind and dependent on her father who is determined that she will be self-sufficient.  When he is not working as the locksmith for the town's museum, he whittles small wooden edifices of the entire small French town, and arranges them just as the town is laid out. Thus, the young blind girl learns how to make her way on her own.  The German boy, together with his younger sister,is an orphan.  He becomes interested in radios, and becomes known in the town for repairing them.  As the Nazis come to power, the boy is sent to an elite Nazi school because of his technical prowess.  The reader intuits that the two main characters will meet at some point in the story, but it is only when both of them have suffered losses and despair that they do.  Doerr's novel clearly shows the inhumanity of Hitler's war, but also the compassion and resilience of the occupied French citizenry.  An irreplaceable gem symbolizes the journeys these two characters travel .
* Not a proper review. Just thoughts after reading. Potential spoilers.<br/><br/>So much remains: the sweet juices of canned peaches, piano pieces haunting through the radio, fresh loaves of bread hiding slips of courage and comfort, clarity in blindness, the importance of stories, the importance of a house that would not fall, the fog, the grotto, the smell of the ocean, Werner the pale-haired boy who quietly risked everything, Frederick the dreamer (whom I'll always picture pressing his forehead against glass windows and peering out at birds) broken by brutality, Volkheimer the giant who suffered just as much and was perhaps one of the most compassionate characters, Frau Elena's sacrifice, Jutta's strong will and expectations which might have drawn her brother a little taller than he thought he could be, Madame Manec's fiesty bravery, Etienne's shrunken bravery then cowardice, Papa's love, and Marie-Lauer's fight one step, one touch, one thought at a time.<br/><br/>The narrative jumps back and forth in time, which did bother me at first. But in the end, it just wasn't that big a deal.
The novel clarifies the hideous consequence of other people's conflicts and how they destroy or horrifically alter the lives of perfectly good, thoughtful, and worthy characters. Marie-Laure, the blind French girl, has enough trouble in her life already, trying to survive and make it in her dark world, but when she and her father flee the Nazis to her shell-shocked uncle's home, and then her father disappears, we feel a sense of desperation for her. Werner, the young German orphan with a gift for repairing and using radios, is small and gentle, and cares only for his little sister Jutta and his foster mother. Werner is thrust into the world of Nazi discipline and power lust at a special school for Hitler youth. He is repulsed by the bullying of the other boys and by the leaders there, but he does become the special student of the electronics teacher, where he is allowed to work on radios and hone his natural skills. Eventually, Werner's radios bring him in contact with Marie-Laure, and the author creates a connection that is brilliant and very realistic, full of complication and suspense.
I read 3 or 4 books per month, this is one of the best books I've read.  I couldn't start a new book for days after finishing this one, it was constantly in my thoughts.
Rarely do I take the opportunity to write out a review of a book, but sometimes I am compelled but the power of a certain work to express my thoughts. This is such a moving book on so many different levels. I must confess, it took me a little time to get used to the shorter chapters as Mr. Doerr went back and forth, sometimes very abruptly, between lives and time periods. Once I adjusted to this style of writing, I simply could not stop reading. There is history here, which is rich and haunting. There is a level of fantasy and mysticism in the book that keeps one coming back to the pages. The characters are developed superbly and we see how circumstance–good and bad–shapes them for better or worse. Mr. Doerr takes the reader on a journey into the heart of humanity, and sometimes, I forgot I was reading a work of fiction, and was actually in France/Germany walking beside Marie or Werner, watching their life unfold. I will let you read the other reviews which are longer, I simply desired to say, read this book. I plan on rereading once I've finished processing the first read through.
Anthony Doerr has written a beautiful and richly detailed book that is one of the best novels I've read in years. There are already dozens of reviews that go into greater detail than I can, but I want to highlight just a few points. Doerr writes beautifully, and the way he constructs characters really draws you into the book. Marie-Laure, Werner, Etienne, and others are colorful, fully-formed personalities with unique and believable motives. Also, he does a terrific job of setting the historical context, creating a realistic environment that is also infused with spirit.<br/><br/>The structure of the book may jump around a bit too much for some (the chapters are often only a few pages long), but I loved his style. Doerr writes in such a way that you never lose track of any of the major plot threads -- which is also consistent with the idea of interconnectedness that is so essential to the story.<br/><br/>I usually stick with non-fiction, but I had heard so much good buzz about this book that I knew I needed to check it out. The bottom line is that it lived up to the hype.
Very touching story.  Interesting to view WWII through the eyes of a blind girl.  I couldn't put my Kindle down, waiting to see how she manages to survive.  Loved it!
5 stars. Every page a treat...the use of beautiful language make this difficult subject a wonderful journey. The characters stepped out if the story and into my life.
Intricate moving story and lush writing made life during the war come to life. The characters were well developed and stayed with me long after I finished the book.
A real page turner. Love that you get two different views of WWII thought the eyes of young people. It reminds one more time why war more terrifying than anything.
One of the best reads I've experienced; I couldn't put this book down.  I had enjoyed a number of recently written books on WW II, but this has to be the best yet.
What memorable characters and stunning language Anthony Doerr weaves in this WWII novel. Each sentence is a gem. Doerr tells parallel stories, and this is both a coming of age story and one of human resilience with each of the children having to make choices that children should not have to make. The first story is that of the young blind daughter of the French National Museum locksmith in possession of a valuable jewel sought by the Nazis. When the Germans invade Paris, she and her father flee to stay with his house-bound uncle, Etienne, in Brittany, St. Malo. (Having been there when I was in France, the author's rich descriptions of the landscape and area brought back fond memories.) The second story is that of a German orphan, whose talents in electronics grabs the attention of the Nazi war machine. As a Hitler youth, he eventually is recruited to the front to determine the coordinates of enemy resistance fighters using hidden radios. Secondary characters are also well developed, and this is a book I will surely recommend to my friends.
This book was amazing. The details, story line and characters brought you right there. I will definitely be reading his other books. This would be a great movie!
Best novel I've read all summer!<br/><br/>World War II stories abound, with good cause. Not  only did it change the course of the world, there are now three generations of Americans who cannot relate to it. Anthony Doerr has woven an intriguing tale of greed and man's inhumanity to man, setting it in Europe, predominately France, during the closing months of the war.<br/><br/>His prose, descriptive detail of minute wood carvings, his ability to inable us to see the Sea of Flames diamond, his way of drawing us to Marie-Laure, the young blind girl and her father----are all, in my opinion, without equal. I spent two nights reading long past my comfort zone, until the words on my Kindle blurred. At one point, when an unexpected event drew from me a distressed, "Oh, no!", I knew that this book is one that will not fade from my memory.<br/><br/>The novel is a masterpiece, pure and simple. Be sure to add it to your library. I read it on my Kindle, but I should have bought the hard cover. It is a keeper, and I will read it again.
This is one of the best novels I've read in a very long time.  The premise - the "what if"- is extremely creative, and the plot  twists and turns around the characters, the war, and the stone in a way that leaves the reader almost breathless with anticipation and fear.  Mr. Doerr portrays the deep emotions and confusion of common men, women, and children thrown into a war over which they have no control and no vested interest.  There is no effort by the writer to place guilt, but the senselessness of it all is made obvious.  And so is the cruelty and ineptness of the war's leaders and those who were chosen to carry out their orders.<br/><br/>His style is unique, with quick and unexpected backflashes everywhere that show the reasons for the multiple protagonists' emotions, weaknesses and bravery. And the language is beautiful.  You can hear the planes overhead, the waves of the ocean in the distance, the bombs exploding, the flapping of birds' wings, the rustle of leaves; and you can feel the heartbeats and surge of fear and goodness rushing through the bodies of all the characters.  I found myself re-reading entire pages, not wanting to let go of the beauty and integrity of the descriptions. It is an incredible novel of bravery and tragedy written by a very giftet writer.
What a beautiful writer Mr Doer is. The fact that he takes you right into the hearts and minds of his characters. .... it's simply a lovely gift to the reader.
This is the most beautiful book I've read in the past few years. The imagery and characters will remain lit in my memory for a long time. Thank you, Mr. Doerr.
It has been a while since I have found a book that I wanted to read slowly so that I could soak in every detail in hopes that the last page seems to never come.<br/><br/>When reading the synopsis of this novel, I never imagined that I would feel so connected to a book where one of the main characters is blind and the other a brilliant young German orphan who was chosen to attend a brutal military academy under Hitler's power using his innate engineering skills.<br/><br/>This novel was so much more than the above states. The idiosyncrasies of each individual character are so well defined and expressed in such ways that come across the page almost lyrically. I was invited into the pages and could not only imagine the atmosphere, but all of my senses were collectively enticed from the very first page until the last.<br/><br/>I was so amazed with the way that the author was able to heighten all my senses in a way that I felt like I knew what it was like to be blind. In most well-written books you get of a sens... Read more
This is one of those properly fabulous books which gently, carefully wraps skeins of gossamer around the reader, taking its time, settling into character, relationship and location, until it steals upon you, that for all the quietness and subtlety of the scene setting, you are wrapped up, little fly, in Doerr's spider's web of a novel, which traps you more deeply, line by line<br/><br/>Paris, 1934 and later St. Malo, before and during the war. Marie-Laure is a young girl, whose father works as a locksmith in the Museum. She is precocious, intelligent, sensitive, with a thirst for knowledge. Loved and loveable. And she is blind.<br/><br/>1934, an orphanage in Zollverein, a coal mining complex near Essen. Werner Pfennig, a scant year older than Marie Laure is another young child with huge potential.

I just read this book in 2 long sittings. Yes, the chapters alternate in scene/time so you have to keep track, but the plot is so compelling and the writing so moving and lyrical that I defy any reader to put it down. I loved the chapters about the relationship between the blind girl and her father who prepared her to survive on her own against all odds. THe diamond curse/sub plot was a great unifier. The settings are vivid, the characters memorable and so many scenes that will bring you to your knees. I can't look at a radio without thinking of the sounds moving through space and time. The scenes from the Hitler youth school were riveting and the Ftederick sub plot really touched me along with the "giant" caught in the basement with Werner during the bombing. Not many novels focus so intently on the fate of kids caught up in the hellish events of this period. Europe was laid to waste but in this beautiful novel, there is redemption and joy amidst the deepest suffering. One of the best books of the year.
I really wanted to love this book since so many gave it rave reviews.  Although I did eventually get into the story, it took me many, many pages to do so.  I was also very put off by the frequent shifts from one time frame to another, from the past and then back again to the present of the novel's time frame.  In general, I am not a big fan of flashbacks unless they add to the story as a whole; in this book, the flashbacks left me disengaged and a little unfocused as a reader.  Also, the constant small chapters, which alternated from the young girl to the young boy, were annoying to me as the reader. This kind of telling of the story also made me very aware of the fact that I was reading a novel.  I'm guessing that was not the original idea of the writer, but rather an editor of the book since the actual story-telling in this book was well done.<br/>Again, I so wanted to love this book but I feel the story lost so much from the way in which it was presented.  It would not be my choice for book of the year.
This was an extremely tender-hearted book. It was brilliantly written and difficult to put down.<br/>The plot was ingeniously  crafted, and it was easy to sympathize with both main characters.
It was a very  pleased that I purchased this book I learned so much about the occcupation of France and what all of those countries endured during the war.
Reading this book is a distinct experience. The prose is intricately gorgeous and the characters are vividly alive. The story follows a young, blind French girl, daughter of a museum locksmith who creates model cities just to help her learn her way around and encourage her independence. It also follows an orphaned German boy who is selected to be one of Hitler's Youth, yet part of him questions and silently, confusedly resists the relentless brainwashing. Their stories weave back and forth between time periods in the midst of World War II, along with a what is almost a third main character: a diamond called The Sea Of Flames which is surrounded by legends of blessings and curses. Hunted by a Nazi collector, it is guarded by the museum collector and finally, accidentally, by Marie-Laure, the blind girl who knows its value yet must focus instead on a combination of survival and doing what she can to fight the war through secret radio broadcasts with her uncle and other brave, though unlikely, warriors.
When I first read a blurb about Anthony Doerr’s novel, All the Light We Cannot See, my first thought was that the last way I wanted to spend time was reading another book set during World War II, let alone one containing more than five hundred pages. I didn’t expect much especially from themes of blindness and radio waves. I decided to start reading it, and I’m delighted that I did. Doerr’s novel is among the best I’ve read this year for several reasons. The plot kept me interested from beginning to end. The finely written prose provided just the right level of description, imagery and dialogue. Character development provided one component the best novels always offer: insight into our human condition and the values that underlie our behavior. The structure of the novel with shifting time periods and narrators drew me in to the story, developed the characters and mesmerized me through finely written lyrical prose. I highly recommend this novel to any reader.<br/><br/>Rating: Five-star (I love it)
I loved the developed characters. Glad novel never sank to "happy ever after"  depths. Almost Dickensesque as so many threads and incidents meet.
I love reading & have been reading books for over 60 years.  I have also read numerous fiction & non fiction books on WWII. In many ways this is & is not a book about the war.  So many themes, under currents of meaning, human choices & limits & consequences to these choices, the sucking of whole societies & continents into vortexes of political & economic  oceanic currents are just a few of the encompassing human experiences that weave through out this book.  Do we always have a choice?  Viktor Frankl thinks that we do & I am not so sure.  I do not know much about the author at this point & I am amazed of the unable to express spiritual vastness like pulsating northern lights that was experienced ( & no, I am not on drugs or liquor)  On another level, I have come to appreciate the other dimensions of the peoples of Germany whom with few exceptions suffered greatly as for example "the harvested" youth of Germany.  For myself, the connections seen & not seen between peoples, the connections that I felt to the characters, to the times & vast processes & to the ocean of life itself left me feeling mournful  when I finished the book.  This is a great book whose stories are the stories of these present global times.
Agree that the story is original, the characters are people you care about, and there are many interesting subplots. I did follow the jumps in time. Unfortunately for me, the interactions between Marie-Laurie and her father became quite tedious as they escaped Paris. Marie-Laurie's constant question asking required the firm hand of a strong editor. And the writing in some places was outright bad. Here are examples: "Rumors circulate....moving fast, as quick and brightly colored as scarves"; "The eggs taste like clouds;" "she's eating wedges of wet sunlight"; "the tender hissing of the grass"; "wine glows sleepily in Werner's stomach"; "briny, weedy, pewter-colored air slips down her collar"; "the air tastes of silver polish". Rubbish! Have you ever had eggs that tasted like clouds? Eaten wedges of wet sunlight? Heard grass hiss? Seen pewter-colored air? Tasted silver polish air? So as I read after one of these clunkers, I was waiting for yet another bit of metaphorical madness to come at me. They left my mouth tasting like wet slate dipped in bitter apple. I longed for chocolate to clear my palette. I imagine this book is so popular because the story is easy enough to follow, Werner is a great character, as are Frederick, Etienne, Marie-Laurie, and her wonderful father. And yes, the story gets more and more intense as it moves to its conclusion. But sorry, the author himself tripped up too often for me to think this is anything like a masterpiece.
I will make one suggestion before proceeding into my review of the book. Do not read on the train! This was my 'commute' book, and by the time I finished I was attempting to hide my sobbing on a crowded A train. Both embarrassing and slightly concerning to my fellow commuters.<br/><br/>Anyway, I absolutely fell in love with this book. Doerr expertly weaves together the stories of two young people, Werner and Marie-Laure, living during WWII, following a mostly non-linear time frame. Along with Marie-Laure and Werner, we are introduced to a cast of incredibly diverse and multifaceted characters, all of whom are fleshed out. I don't want to give away too many details, but I will say that Doerr did a wonderful job avoiding tropes, both in his characterization and in the inclusion of a more 'mythological' vein by way of the story of the diamond. I was worried at first that the diamond might end up dominating the story in an unpleasant way, but instead it provided more of an undercurrent of a fairy tale, that didn't at all seem out of place. All the Light We Cannot See was beautifully crafted, and definitely one of the best books I've read in a while. I imagine it will stick with me in a way that only best books do.
I absolutely LOVED this book. It's a truly sensory experience of WWII through the eyes of a young blind girl, whose father held the key to unlocking  something for which it seems everyone is searching. It is a fabulous story of a stone, which - apparently - if in one's possession kept him/her safe, but simultaneously destroyed others surrounding him. Her story is woven together with that of a young orphan boy, who (in some ways) was also blind - blinded by the excitement that holds him captive to the idea of joining the Nazi movement in WWII-era Germany. The blind girl meets "crazy uncle" Etienne, who refuses to go outside out of fear due to schizophrenia. Meanwhile, the young orphan boy, in his search for a prized radio transmitter, meets the young girl and forge a deep connection. The book is deeply insightful and moves like the ebbing and flowing of the sea and is a story of how lost and blinded souls can come together and form a family through the harshest of times.
This is an unusual book in that it is beautifully written but the subject matter is somewhat boring, which is odd because it takes place in the midst of war and mayhem and extreme cruelty on the part of the occupying German forces in France. I have been reading it for almost a month now (it has become my "put me to sleep" book at the end of a day) and I'm beginning to wonder if it will ever end. My Kindle has stopped registering page numbers or even location numbers within the book, so I have no idea where I am. The blind heroine and her father are wonderful creations, and the brilliant, orphaned German boy is fascinating (if somewhat cowardly), but somehow the story just never seems to get where it wants to go ... assuming it wants to "go" anywhere. I'm a determined, if slow, reader, however, and, by golly, if I made it through Thomas Mann's "The Magic Mountain," I can make it through this thing. The book is beautiful but not much fun at all.
A fabulous way to help me drive 1100 miles.<br/>The book is both lyrical and captivating.  I realized the Reader Zach Appelman made the book more alive.
I loved this book.  The characters had depth, the story was captivating, sensitive, well-researched and well-written.  It was easy to relate to and care about the characters.  I was sad when it ended.  It is another heart-rending story centered around the Holocaust with an interesting twist, and it has a soft landing at the end.  This story made me realize more deeply the incredible loss the entire world suffered from that war .. by the hand of Hitler.  How brilliant minds were squelched or snuffed out; lives ruined and history lost.  It's amazing to me that one person can accomplish this much destruction; the amount of control he wielded over thousands who hated him but were powerless to change it.  Also amazing to me is the number of true believers who supported him, committing unspeakable acts of cruelty.  This book was reminiscent of The Tin Drum, though with more realism.  I had a hard time putting this one down.  I will read more from this author.
This is one of the most intriguing books I have ever read. I was almost deterred from reading it by the description but then I began to notice all of the positive reviews. And, I'm so happy that I did.  The story itself of two remarkable young people (actually children when WW2 began)  and their experiences of that War was simply magical.  The descriptive writing is some of the best I have read in a long time. I could really see & hear what they were feeling. A real accomplishment when the young girl is blind.  You could sense her gradually feeling her way in the world and hear all of the many sounds she could hear. The young boy is another incredible character, and, again, you could feel all of his excitements, young desires and ultimately fear. All of the other characters are equally remarkable and there are just so many instances where ordinary people exhibit extraordinary bravery. What an accomplishment. As for the ending, it did not disappoint.
Normally when I reach the end of a chapter, it's a chance to refresh my beverage, check my e-mail, use the restroom, or otherwise take a break from reading.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, with All The Light We Cannot See, such chances occur every other page.<br/><br/>Normally I'd finish a book of this length within a week, but here I am 7 days after starting and only on page 300 of 550. Of books they love people often say, "I couldn't put it down!" I have the opposite trouble with a book of 178 chapters, the longest of which is 3 pages - it is exceedingly put-down-able, no matter how good the story may be.<br/><br/>Perhaps a good layout for younger readers with nearly nonexistent attention spans, but I want a story I can immerse myself, lose myself in - and I cannot do so when chapters end every other page.<br/><br/>I like the story and I like Doerr's writing and I'll probably finish the book - but I find the 2-page-per-chapter format infuriating.
This book is written so that the reader can see, feel, smell and taste what is going on. It is a real oage turner and it was hard for me to put it down and get anything else done.
Doerr's writing is unique and imaginative. The story covers a huge canvas--occupied France and Germany in 1940-45. There are many characters and most all of them are memorable. Those caught up in doing evil are still human on some level, making their lockstep normalization of violence and Naziism all the more terrible. The use of language alone is a reason to read this book. My only negative was the erratic timing of the scenes, out of chronological order. I was distracted by this, puzzling why he wanted the reader to know what would happen in 1944 when we are still several years away from that year. He uses this scrambling of sequence several places and I found it frustrating. However, the depiction of ordinary people living desperate lives immersed in this war that dictates almost all aspects of their lives, people who still find ways to be kind to each other--this was most powerful to me and an underlying current in this powerful story.
Mr. Doerr is an extremely fine writer.  In this work, he moves the reader backwards and forwards from the period just prior to the beginning of WWII to the present - day of the story's 'action,' the latter stage of the war at and just after D-Day; and late in the book to the early 1970's and the actual present day.  He accomplishes these flashes forward- and backward smoothly and without leaving the reader to flip back several pages saying, "what?"  all the while training the narrator's voice back and forth between several characters in the story.  This could easily have been confusing, but Doerr makes the shifts smooth almost to the point of desultory.  There is a tone here, almost elegiac, despite the horrific backdrop of the war, which draws the reader along even when the pace is not as brisk.  The writer also works in a continuing theme of shells and marine life, seemingly in reference to his earlier (and also wonderful) short story compendium, The Shell Collector.  This is a fantastic book, and I am almost sorry to have finished it, so forward did I look to reading it each evening.  I would read anything written by Anthony Doerr.
I loved this book! Bought The Shell Collector in paperbacktoday because I loved this book so much. My husband and I share our Kindle account and I told him to read it next as I know he will like it too.  Short chapters and hard to put down.  I loved every character in the book, from the Great Uncle with PTSD,  to the housekeeper,  to the baker's wife slipping secret codes into the loaves of bread.  A book for all readers, both men and women. I can even picture this book making its way to a high school reading list.  I convinced my Mom to get it on her Kindle and told her to have my Dad read it too as he is a retired  engineer and I know he will enjoy it!!  I am an avid knitter and a nurse by day and spent the last few days not knitting in my off hours so that I could read this book at every free moment. Best book that I have read in quite a long time. Thank you to this author and I am looking forward to reading his other books.
I'm sure there's a fiction prize out there for this finely crafted novel.  Elegant prose along with an engaging plot and wonderful characters.
I can completely understand all the 5 star reviews of this book.  The writing is beautiful and the characters are deep and you become emotionally attached to them.  On top of all this, the story makes you reflect, ponder, and question. The book runs deep with an array of thematic elements.  The most prevalent theme being the literal and metaphorical element of "light and darkness".  With all that being said, I felt like the books biggest strength also became a weakness at times.  There is no question that Doerr is a world class writer.  He paints a picture with his words as good as anyone writing today.  But there were times where I thought his metaphors and description were so over the top I had a hard time connecting with the feeling he was trying to convey.  It seemed like some of the metaphors seemed forced,  In the end though, this didn't bother me much, and I enjoyed this book.  I would highly recommend it.
One of the few books that I have enjoyed reading in the past few years and hard to put it down once you start reading. It is a very well-written story about a boy growing up in Nazi Germany and a girl in France during WW2.<br/><br/>It beautifully tells their story which runs in parallel but connects at the end. How just a curious boy, who is fascinated by the radio growing up in the Ruhr, gets sucked into the Nazi war machine. And yet at every stage in the war, he yearns for those moments of simple happiness with his loved ones. How a blind girl growing up in occupied France lives through the days and braves against all the calamities, learning the streets of Paris and Saint Malo through a model city designed by her father to satisfy her curious mind.<br/><br/>It gives a simple message that despite all the evil in the war, it is only the general goodness among the people that survives and remains years after that.
A haunting read. Gorgeous and inevitably too short for my taste. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story written in the most beautiful way.
Having read all of the author's prior works, i knew this would be something very special.  Never a wasted word,  Clear evocative metaphors that stir the soul.  Each character depicts a different take at how war effects humans, for example Jutta, not directly involved in the war who many years after the war ends, feels despised while in France because she is German.  I liked that the word Hitler was used at most maybe 2-3 times in the entire novel.  These people were exceptional in their humanness.  Being blind was no liability for Marie-laure, it actually contributes to her strength and determination. All the characters exhibited sensitivity perhaps with the exception of Major Von Rumpel, whilst the war is swirling its gritty vortex around them.  The young German patriot Werner is forced by the regime to enter war and adulthood as a child because his age has been falsely documented. Suspense builds around a gem removed from the museum by the Resistance and cleverly recreated  x 3 to mislead the greedy Occupation.  I will stop here and hope this pique's more readers to be swept/blown away by this masterpiece.
I AM ENJOYING THIS FABULOUS STORY OF WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIPS DURING TERRIBLE TIMES..  I WHOLE HARDEDLY RECOMMEND.  MUST GET BACK TO IT NOW!
This is one of the best books I have ever read, an epic historical novel in the same class as "Gone with the Wind", "Anna Karenina", and "Sophie's Choice." The settings are primarily in France and Germany during WWII. The two main characters are a young blind girl and a young boy who is a recruited by the German army because of his brilliant talent with radio technology. These characters do not solicit the readers pity, though one feels strongly the agony of their lives -and everyone's lives- during the time of war. Another main character, that doesn't even speak, is a large diamond with a mysterious power that affects the lives of all who come in contact with it. The author's prose is very poetic as he captures images from birds in flight to bullets in flight. This is a story of many complexities that can be told about the history of the world, across many centuries. Brilliant!
Light is all around. We take its presence for granted. Yet, it is Through light that we see and live. Light makes all creation visible, it contains all colors. A rainbow makes the colors of light visible as it does all things. Who has not been dazzled by a bouganvillia when the sun turns all it petals glowing?<br/>Unseen by human eyes, all kinds of electronics fill the very air around us. It is by light that we have life. And though the night seems to obscure everything, yet it is made magnificent by the twinkling of stars beyond numbers..."and the light shines in the darkness and the darkness cannot overpower  it"  we  are encompassed by light _by love, we exist because of light. When we love, we bring light into the world and to others. Thornton wilder wrote: there is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love" in death we become our essence which is light,which is love...
A  story with two parallel storylines set in different parts of Europe during WWII.  The reader knows that their paths will ultimately cross.  The vocabulary is superb, guiding the reader into multiple subject areas, all of them interesting and enlightening.<br/><br/>All through the story I wanted to read more and more and yet often didn't want to finish either.  Occupied coastal France is where young blind Marie struggles to get by in desperate situations.  Poor Werner tries to escape his dismal prospects (working in. A coal mine that claimed his father's life) in Germany and ends up being a gifted radio technician in the army.  For a good portion of the book you know these characters' paths will cross.  But then again the more you read, perhaps not.  A beautifully woven story line that gives honor to the people that can endure the horrors of war with extreme perseverance and dignity.
This may be the best book I have ever read -- and I read ALL the time.  This is how much I liked it:  I got it at the library, but only because my favorite librarian said I should and I didn't want to be rude to her.  I usually read thrillers, mysteries, suspense novels, with an occasional Jane Austin thrown in.  So, I didn't really want this book.  However, I took it home and started it so I could be sure to get it back to the library without paying a late fee.  Are you getting my reluctance and lack of enthusiasm?  Well, I couldn't put this book down.  The two main characters are incredible.  The writing is extraordinarily literary.  The author jumps back and forth in time, yet it is not confusing.  The story deals with WWII in a new and fresh way.<br/>Now to continue with how much I liked this book:  I just ordered two hardback copies of it, one for my daughter and one for myself.
This is a must read book.  Beautifully written, appropriate for all ages - youth to elder.  Doerr brings you in and does not disappoint.
So lyrical and rhythmic is Anthony Doerr's language that although my eyes focused on his words, what resonated in my head was sound, exquisitely layered literary music.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is multi-faceted, mainly focusing in alternating very short chapters on two young people caught in the events of WWII…one, a blind girl who flees Paris for St. Malo with her father, the head locksmith of the Paris Museum of Natural History.....the other, an orphaned boy whose genius with the mechanics of radios lands him in an elite Nazi Youth training school and beyond.  The unseen light is equally multi-faceted, from the literal, to what one sublimates, to the heightening of other senses....touch, auditory, empathy, elements of nature, to the blending of science and literature, to instances of good in the face of evil.<br/><br/>There is so much that is thought-provoking in that title, but less revealed is more in the case of this truly exceptional work whose elegant language continues to awe right up to the last word. Immerse yourself in Doerr’s novel.  It’s magnificent.
This is a wonderful work... Highly recommend!! Well written and plotted....and makes you think.  You will not regret reading this work.
Doerr has written a well-crafted novel of world war II. In 178 brief chapters he tells us the stories of a blind French girl living in the coastal city of Saint Malo, a very young German soldier with a talent for using radios, whose special skill is put to use by the German army locating Russian, and later French illegal broadcasts, and thirdly a German solider with the private ambition and means to locate and steal a valuable jewel which the French girl may possess. With a well-described cast of strong supporting characters, and the gradual convergence of the three narratives, this book keeps the reader engaged and enriched.  The brevity of the chapters is well suited for reading online, the plot is believable, and Doerr makes a good move when he carries the story beyond the war, to tie up some loose ends afterwards. There are some poetic passages; mostly the writing is crisp.
One of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  I smiled, I cried, I was on the edge of my seat from the bravery of these people.  I have relatives that went through World War II in Europe but they never expressed how harrowing it was.  it was awful for all sides and I never realized how blinded the good people were by the lies they were fed before the war because of the poverty they were experiencing.  But the strength of these wonderful people!  I don't think most Americans today would have the wherewithall to handle what these people handled and survive.  Yet I see the poverty here and know that they will do most anything to believe they will have a better life by promises that just cannot come true in todays government and economy.  What a frightening parallel!  Anthony Doerr did his research well and his characters were so amazing.  How could someone not love this book?
I've read way too many WWII novels in my life, but a friend's recommendation compelled me to read one more. I loved this book! The unique format, in which the novel vacillated between the early war years and August 1944, added to the suspense of the novel as the two time periods (as well as the two stories) gradually merged into one. Instead of focusing on the Holocaust or the battles of WWII, the author chose to tell us about two children, one French and one German, whose lives are profoundly changed by the war. Everything about this book was well-thought out and beautifully crafted. My only regret is that I read it on a Kindle instead of a print book because there were a a number of times when I wanted to glance back at an earlier chapter. My guess is that it wouldn't be as satisfying as an audio book for the same reason. Regardless of format, Doerr's book is a real gem.
I strongly recommend this book to all lovers of historical fiction.  There are two things I demand for good books in that genre:  very good writing and historical accuracy outside the clearly fictional details.  This book offers both.<br/><br/>I do not want to speak excessively about the plot, but I'll say this:  When you are done reading, you will understand the multiple meanings of the great title, and love the main characters.<br/><br/>One thing I appreciate about the book that I rarely find is that it uses foreign languages (mostly German and French, in both of which I am fluent) absolutely correctly.  I so hate books where the author insists on putting mangled or plain wrong foreign words and sentences into the mouths of characters.<br/><br/>The plot is truly one-of-a kind, and hard to put down.  The end leaves the reader satisfied and both happy and sad about how people fared through a war.
A beautiful relationship between science and history and mystery and humanity. Hopeful!  For engineers and artists. For young and old.
One of the best books I've ever read.  And I've read a ton of 'em. Anthony Doerr's writing style .....  wow. Truly a God-given talent.
We are inundated these days with new novels of numerous genres.  However, if you are seeking something special, this novel is worth the time.  If you want something that is truly in the category of literature and not just something to read, choose this one. Anthony Doerr is in the tradition of authors who have the skill and dedication to produce something special and lasting.  This novel about the sentinel events of the twentieth century, namely the Second World War, will be one of the best novels of the twenty-first century.  Previous reviews have well described the plots, characters, and setting.  These will satisfy virtually every reader, as evidenced by the rave reviews.  What will capture the lover of great literature involves the subtler themes and symbols, especially the resonances of the meaning of "light".  Don't let this masterpiece slip by.
Stunningly, beautiful writing, a novel that gives a uniquely different historic look at WWII.  The novel does not follow a chronological timeline, and adding to the complicated but compelling structure of the novel there are two separate storylines that follow two young main characters.  I repeatedly referred to the table of contents for reminders of when previous chapters had taken place, but that in no way detracted from the enjoyment of the story.  I believe the author carefully considered when certain events should take their place in the telling of the stories and the moving back and forth in time and place builds suspense and engages the reader.  At this point in my life I'm not drawn to stories about war, but this novel was one of the best I've read in a long time and I came away with a deeper sense of some of the realities of war, especially WWII.
Mr. Doerr, the author, had to familiarize himself with SO many subjects so he could describe them in the amazing details -- from being temporily entombed with no light to wiring a radio to learning to 'see' Marie Laure's world to the little sea creatures.  The richness of these details is what drew me back to a second read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly both times.  I had sworn off books about WWII, so it took me a while to pick this up.  I hated the violence of the school and their radio-destroying job, but it was an integral part of the story.  It is a book that will stay with me a long time.  However, I have one question/criticism -- the lack of linearity. For my part, I would have preferred having it follow a time sequence, especially since the author is telling the story from multiple viewpoints. It bothered a few of the other book club members too.
All the Light We Cannot See is remarkable.  It's a different point of view, after so many formulaic WWII stories, and so well written. The two young characters are well defined and interesting. The tidbits of science add dimension to the blind French girl and the young German orphan, so we care about these characters - they have interests, lives, connections. The typically graphic horrors of war are not center stage here - they're there, but not seen through the eyes of an omniscient narrator. There's more uncertainty, more questioning, and as a reader I felt as though I was there with the characters, not circling above them. The short chapters move back and forth between characters, but also through time, which at some points became confusing. But the writing is excellent and the journey worthwhile. I didn't want this book to end. Highly recommended.
While this plot driven story may satisfy many, I found it less than compelling.  Despite the amount of time alternating between the two protagonists, it was the brief relationship between Jutta and her brother Werner that was more captivating than the character of Marie-Laure.  I found the vacillating chronology to be disjointed and confusing at times. While the war is clearly a backdrop for the story, the war-related details often felt contrived rather than organic to the story. Both the references to train cars filled with stacked corpses and the chapter which concerns war-related rape appear as though such references were determined to be obligatory, rather than a necessary part of a story that is so decidedly rooted in fantasy. That said, I thought the book did an excellent job of capturing what it must have felt like to be a post-war German.
compelling story. lovely writing. i may have to juggle my "all-time top 10 favorite books" list to make room for this one.
Loved the intertwining stories and the characters in this book.  Would recommend to anyone - great stories and historical fiction.
This book pulls you in and won't let you go. You will be up all night reading it and will pass it on to your friends. A must read!
This is a well-written but complex novel set during Nazi occupied France. Two gifted children, a blind French girl and a German orphan, meet only once during their lives, but we follow each of them from beginnings of war until the end if their lives. A third thread of the plot involves a German sergeant major, intent on finding a precious stone that will save his life.  How does a young blind girl survive in such horrific times, and how is she able to develop her sense of responsibilities ? Why does this brilliant young boy become a part of the prestigious corps of ideal German boys and participate in the Nazi domination of The French, in this case, and Jews in general? Radio communications and the aforementioned stone tie the separate lives together. Complex, revealing, and intriguing...... I could hardly put it down.  Superb characterization.
This book affected me.  This book inspired me.  I cried when this book was over!  All the Light We Cannot See is one of the best books I have read in decades.  Yes, decades.  Mr. Doerr's characters became real breathing people in my mind as I read.  This book is not a fairy tale, however.  His character, like real people, did not live through the war unchanged and unbroken.  The way he moves from character to character and back again allowed him to get into the minds and lives of several disparate character, several different viewpoints within the war time narrative.  This book has left me forever changed.  The characters are now living people in my mind that I remember and reminisce.  Mr. Doer created the characters, and to me they are still walking the earth, carrying their wartime experiences and dealing with the loss they have suffered.
When I started this book, I did not think it was going to be a 5-star.  Humph!  I guess I thought it was either going to be too violent or too pat.  It ended up being neither.  The story line surprised me at several points in time, and although the violence was less than I had anticipated, the cruelty was present, and the way in which the Nazis were so masterful at building fear and compliance in their citizenry, making Nazis out of folks like you and me.  The sense of dread I carried through the middle of the book was uncomfortable enough that I had to read something else at bedtime for a few nights.  The characters were fully fleshed out, which I love, and the plot, while surprising at times, did not develop at the expense of everything else. Too bad Geoffrey Rush is too old for the role of the father.  A quietly 5-star work of fiction.
Engaging and great prose. Well written story. Thought provoking. A book I would recommend to my friends. I enjoyed it immensely.
Beautifully written, wanted it to go on, was falling in love with characters. Saddened by the loss of the young and their gifts.
All the Light We Cannot See<br/>Story of a little French  blind girl and a poor intelligent German young boy.  It is the best book I have read in years.  The author is an excellent writer.  I coulldn't put book down.  It was not a book you just read but one that you experienced, felt the emoitions of the characters, and sure increased my understanding of the German youth and what it would be like to live through a war.  Super writing.  I would consider this a classic and something I would read again.  My husband loved it also.  Have recommended to all my friends and grandkids.  Must one experience how horrible war is and how leaders force nice people into monster.  Like Machiavelli Hitler used fear.  Answered questions about how young men are brainwashed and intimidated.  The plot was really clever-- I think everyone should read this
I got this book, because I joined a book club. Usually I will start a book, then find another one, never to finish reading the first one. This book is phenomenal. I read it in three days. The other ladies in my book club, said it was a very hard book to get into, because there are so many stories and the timeline is all-over the place, but I got right into it. Maybe it was, because I could identify with the characters from hearing all the stories growing up, from my GrandPa and all the older people from my village in Europe. This book made me homesick, because of its content and such great writing style, that it felt like I was inside the movie. I don't wish to spoil anything, so I will only tell you it is about the WW2, a blind girl and a precious diamond, that goes missing. Now, buy the book, find a great spot, and enjoy the ride.
This is an amazing book..for many reasons. The writing is so descriptive, flowing, and rich. Historical fiction is my favorite genre and this novel was perhaps the best I have ever read.
I have read many books on WWII over the years and thought I had covered every kind of genre of both fiction and nonfiction, but Dowrr's brilliant novel was a great surprise and a mesmerizing story. I could never choose which character I wanted to follow most: Werner or Marie. So much has been written about the young boys who were thrown into the Wermarcht, but Werner gave them all flesh and blood and allowed me to feel the agony of separation from his sister and attaching himself to the other "boys" in his unit that live and fight and die with him. Marie's blindness allows us to feel the war and its terror more than we see it. That she survived the war was a pleasant surprise. The book's tension never lets up and we feel the stress and powerlessness of our heroes right to the end. Great writing and great story telling.
Excellent read.  Really felt characters were well done. I would definitely recommend this book. Will read more by this author.
This was a beautifully written story w/wonderful characters.  I hated to see it end.  I definitely recommend it to my friends.
This book was the most beautiful and sometimes painful depiction of the dramatic and mundane thoughts and days of a group of people during and after WWII. It describes in sumptuous detail the simple poetry of normal lives lived and tortured by war...but even more than that it gives every reader the opportunity to extrapolate how the speed and unstoppable passage of time moves us past days that seem, while we live them, to last forever. "All the Light We Cannot See" offered me a powerful reminder that issues and years pass in the blink of an eye. In beautifully constructed language Anthony Doerr has given me inspiration this day, as I turned the last page of his amazing book, to look for light in the dark moments. I will never forget these characters and I will reread this book many times. This book should be read by millions...
I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and I learned great deal more about the war between Germany and other places such as France, the USA, etc. To me, it seemed that previous novels regarding World War Two focused primarily on war troops fighting. In All the Light We Cannot See, I was so much more aware of how relatively younger children were involved in the war, either by participating in the war, and/or being aware of how the war affected so many people, not just adults but also children who were involved. All in all, I felt it was an excellent novel that helped me better understand how two different young folks, one from Germany and one from France, followed the war, one who was involved in fighting during the war, and the other who was affected by the war and concerned about how the war would affect their loved ones.
Book #94 Read in 2014<br/>All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr<br/><br/>This book takes place during World War 2 and is told in alternating chapters from the viewpoint of Werner, a young boy in the Nazi Party, and Marie-Laure, a blind French girl.  Both viewpoints detail the effects of war and the trials that people had to go through.  Near the end of the book (quick moving even though it is over 500 pages long) the two intersect for a brief but meaningful period of time.<br/><br/>The writing of this book is lush and excellent.  The characters are wonderfully developed and leap off the page.  As I said, this book is long but the chapters are short and the book's pace is quick moving.  I would recommend this book to high school students and adults alike.<br/><br/>http://melissasbookpicks.blogspot.com
All the Light We Cannot See was an excellent read. Just when I believe I can't read another WWII book, I find a review that convinces me to do it again>. This book is beautifully composed and though tough at times to read it's words , it gives another perspective on how Hitler so brilliantly and cunningly manages to have so many young soldiers who believe... or not... his convincing propaganda, messages of righteousness and its benefits to Germans and Germany. This book is from the perspective of a young boy. He is confused, torn and unsure, but also understands if he is to survive, he needs to play. And it can be devastating . It was a sweet, sad, strong , suspenseful  and tragic story , wonderfully rich in descriptions and emotions. I really enjoyed it and caught it in my thoughts long after its conclusion.
A beautifully conceived and written book.  Far-ranging in scope, great characters, and a page-turner.  An absolute pleasure.
I've 25 pages left and am hesitant to read them as I don't want the book to end however I will finish tonight.<br/><br/>I described the book to a friend as being the most visual book I believe I've ever read and the metaphors just insist they be be read with great pleasure as they are truly beautiful.<br/><br/>Magnificent story told in great detail while developing the characters. Yes, much sadness but then such is the fact of war yet there is so much love in this story and for some the hope is always there.<br/><br/>Doerr definitely uses his research as the story is rich in detail as the layers unfold and the war progresses to its end.<br/><br/>This magnificent book is literature at its very best and I thank the author and his characters for a great book and one I'll not forget in the years ahead.
Contrary to the book title, there is very little "light" in it.  Taking place in France and Germany during World War II, mostly telling the story of a blind French girl and an orphan German boy, you would expect a dire tale; but I was hoping for some hope and came away with very little.<br/><br/>Mr. Doerr is an excellent writer, and the story is almost poetic.  I knew nothing about the siege of Saint-Malo, France, and the details of each family is spell-binding.<br/><br/>When I go to movies (not often), I do not select those that are full of sadness and/or terror.  I prefer lighter ones, and this is true for books as well.  I knew this novel was highly touted, but if I had known about the lack of "lightness," I probably would not have selected it.  I like stories that end happy.
Enjoyed this book enormously. Best story I have read in some time. You will fall in love with Marie-Laure. Superb reading.
The characters are underdeveloped which makes it very difficult to connect to as a reader.  The book was very slow paced from the beginning which made it extremely hard to finish in even a month.  The author is so descriptive of surrounding details in some chapters and cuts other chapters so short it is almost painful to read and throws off the balance of the book. The author flashes back and forth in time which seems pointless since it does not add to any of the few action scenes.  Instead of building suspense the flash backs exasperated and confused me.  When I finally got to the end of the book I was very disappointed. I don't want to give anything away, but the author could have made up for the lack of emotion in the characters by providing more closure for Jutta about her brother's fate.
All the Light We Cannot See brought me into its richly detailed world of two children, one a blind French girl whose father builds her intricate models of their Paris neighborhood so she can memorize it, and the other an orphaned German boy fascinated by radio technology, and how their paths cross near the end of WWII.  I LOVED this book - it's the first book in a long time that so completely and eloquently swept me  into the characters and their world Mr. Doerr created that i read for hours with no sense of time passing, and no desire for the book to end. I am on amazon searching for more of this author's books. I think it took Mr. Doerr ten years to write this book - I really hope I don't wait ten more years for another one of his novels! this book is really terrific - trust me on this one.
Amazing. This is literature at its best. It changes you and it changes the world.<br/>It leaves you different and quiet.
So well written!  Gripping!  I just couldn't put it down.  Rare to find a novel of historical significance so compelling.
What a well crafted story.  Normally, I find books that jump forward and backward in time to be confusing and often annoying, but this one allowed the story to slowly reveal itself, making the formula effective.  I loved the little handcrafted models of the cities and buildings and how they were weaved into the heart of the story.  I liked the fact that there were well defined characters, both good and bad, on both sides of the conflict and as the story progressed the characters evolved becoming intertwined although separated by time, location or experience. The writing offered a visual picture, so easy to see and feel, at times even smell and hear, it made me want to savor every word while at the same time reading with abandon so enveloped was I in the tale.  Masterfully done.  Great read.
I listened to this book as an audio book.  It was beautifully written, with such heartbreaking truths about war and love.  I cared deeply about the characters....the blind young girl, Marie-Laure, her father who loved her so deeply, her Great Uncle Etienne, so shattered and fearful who takes her in.  And the German boy Werner, drawn into the Hitler Youth Organization. and always questioning what he sees and hears and is told to do.  I even cared for his giant comrade-at-arms, Volkheimer, who calmly shot whatever "enemy" his unit was able to root out through Werner's amazing ability to use radio tracking.  The reader, Zach Appelman, read the story beautifully, taking the listener along on this journey of sadness and longing, love and humanity without drawing attention to himself.
This book is a passageway to another time, another place, and another way of life as well as a front row seat to the story of two young lives.  The young people are so different, and experience the time period from such different vantage points, yet they have some similar hearts.<br/><br/>The love stories in this books are familial, yet they helped me remember long-forgotten relationships, hopes and dreams--and a reminder to celebrate life no matter the circumstances.<br/><br/>I hate it when people say things like what I'm going to say in my next sentence, because I usually don't believe them.  This book transported me out of myself and when I'd regretfully stop reading for the night, I felt that I had to shake myself to remember who I was and where I was.  That's powerful fiction.
This is one of those books that I didn't want to end ... great writing style, subject matter and storyline.  Perfection.
This  story jumps back and forth in time, but in a good way! From the mid 1930s forward, from character to character.<br/><br/>It focuses on two children. Marie-Laure the blind daughter of a Parisian locksmith and museum security manager, and also Werner Pfennig, an orphaned half Jewish boy and his sister Jutta who live in an orphans home near Essen in Germany.<br/><br/>Werner has an enquiring mind and skills with electronics that singles him out for a future in Nazi Germany, while Marie-Laure’s father is entrusted with protecting a special treasure from the museum while they flee Paris.<br/><br/>The novel follows the outbreak of war and its effect on both of their lives.<br/><br/>The book is full of sadness and joy, but it is one that I whole heartedly recommend! Loved it!
I thought the writing in this book was spectacular.  In fact, when I was about two-thirds through the book, I considered writing the author to tell him how I enjoyed his writing.  Then four days before I finished the book, I found that he won the Pulitzer Prize for this novel.  By winning this award, I guess he didn't need my affirmation.  The book alternates chapters between a blind girl in France and a German soldier during World War II.  Although the book is long, the story moved quickly to a conclusion.  My only criticism is that I wish it had ended earlier.  The author, who took ten years to write this book, continues on with the story until the protagonist is elderly.  I wish the book had ended when she was young.  Nonetheless, it is a great book by a very talented author.
This was a great read. The writer kept my wrapped attention. I would recommend this book for sure. Without going into detail about the summary of the book (you can do that by reading the story summary) I was enthralled with the characters. It was a novel for sure but I do love how he incorporated true history into the book with a touch of unrealism. I must say this, however. I would have given it 5 stars but the scene in the book on the rape did not flow with the story. It was not graphic or anything like that (which I appreciate) but it seemed like an after thought or just didn't fit the story. I do realize it was part of the time period and such things happened but it stuck out like a sore thumb and was unnecessary....But it was a great NOVEL. Mr. Doerr is a very good writer.
As William Vollman in his NYTimes review said...“All the Light We Cannot See” is more than a thriller and less than great literature. As such, it is<br/>In the NYTimes review, William Vollman wrote...“All the Light We Cannot See” is more than a thriller and less than great literature. As such, it is what the English would call “a good read.” Maybe Doerr could write great literature if he really tried. I would be happy if he did."<br/><br/>It was just okay...with all due respect to Mr. Doerr, I frankly found it BORING ....the characters one dimensional...the story very slow....drawn out and predictable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I neither found it "great literature" or "a great read"... However most people I know loved the book...so to each his own...
I don't normally read WWII stories but this was beautifully written, tender, compassionate, mysterious, and wonderful.
This is one of the most moving and well written novels I've read in a long time.  The characters are truly memorable.
This is a story that tells much of the civilian horrors of world war on both sides of the Franco-Prussian divide.<br/>It centres on the harrowing experiences of two children, a gifted German boy and a blind French girl, whose destinies in World War II are cleverly entwined around the lure of a precious stone and the early power of radio.<br/>Resplendent with imagery and rich colour, even in the sightless perceptions of the girl, the narrative promises inevitable sadness, and engenders wistfulness within the reader that it has to end at all.<br/>It fulfills the mandate of most new millenium war accounts, whose focus is on the experiences of ordinary people rather than those who drew them into that terrible time. They became extraordinary in the circumstances thrust upon them.
This was one of the better books I've read in quite some time.  I would highly recommend this book to other readers.
This novel was engrossing for me. I loved the parallel development of the two main characters - it worked very well and didn't feel contrived. Like the shells of snails that Marie so loved and the puzzles her father made for her, as well as the radio circuits the boy made from scrap, the two stories came together and touched gracefully, just barely, and seemingly inevitably despite very long odds. This is, above all, the story of the inner lives of these characters, and this is made more poignant by being set against the backdrop of WWII with the characters trying to figure out how to live in a time of death. Even the end of the novel completed another circuit, unexpectedly, yielding contact, communication, and closure. I thought that it was done beautifully.
Wow! Wow! Wow! And again wow! This incredibly captivating story that takes place in Europe during World War II and is really two tales in one--the story of a blind French girl and the story of a brilliant, orphaned German boy--that finally converge for just a few pages about 75 percent into the book. In addition, author Anthony Doerr skips around chronologically, but in his expert hands this only adds to the suspense of the stories he so compellingly weaves. This is a book that extols the evils of war as seen through the actions of individuals...but individuals who also possess goodness. Sprinkle it with a bit of magic and myth, and the result is enthralling. Unlike so many novels, this is a book both men and women will equally enjoy. I highly recommend this.
Real insight into the impact of war. Short chapters from one character to another. Very powerful. Hard to put down,
I would gladly give this book ten stars. This novel is a poetic rendering of the WWII attack on the fortified city of St. Malo, France. The reader is not spared the horrors of war, but as in a similar novel The Book Thief, the atrocities are couched in poetic literary irony.  The stories of an adolescent blind French girl and a young German soldier are told in parallel and contrasting chapters. Of course the word light takes on many meanings.  Anthony Doerr, the author, is a master of plot and character.  He slowly reveals the many details that will come to fruition in the final chapters.  This is one book that is carefully executed so that the ending is as good as the beginning.  This is a novel for adults and mature adolescent readers.  A must read.
A modern day "Les Miserables?"<br/><br/>"To Kill a Mockingbird?"<br/><br/>Maybe that is overstating it a bit, but this is a very, very good and moving book.<br/><br/>It is the story of a blind French girl and a young German soldier--not a Nazi, but a German who never wanted to go to war--and how they find the light of humanity in the worst of times, in the chaos of World War II and German occupation of France.<br/><br/>In addition to a very human story, it also offers the reader excellent insight, a sense of the horrors of war, on soldiers, refugees and regular citizens trying to survive and live a somewhat normal life in trying times.<br/><br/>A great book?  Yes.<br/><br/>A classic?  Could be. Only time will tell.<br/><br/>And that's enough to make it one of hte best books of our time...y
Captivating and intense.  It is one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read.  You won't be disappointed.
This is a wonderful wartime story of two children one French and one German at the height of WW2.  While Werner is a poor orphan eating boiled potatoes with every expectation that he will work in the coal mines like his father before him when he turns 16, and Marie Laure a blind and very brave French girl whose father teaches her how to navigate the streets of St. Malo.  Young Warner is a young wiz at fixing electronic gadgets.  He is celebrated with cake and inducted into a special school that trains Hitlers finest youth to be brutal with the enemy.  Enough happens during the war to change this young man and he becomes very empathetic with this pretty young girl and saves her life when st.Malo is bombed by the americans.  A very beautiful novel.
This is at the very top of my list of the most amazing books I have ever read.  It is wonderfully written, both in the language and in the story.  The reader gets great insight into life before, during and after the war.  About how the war affected innocents, and their dreams, on both sides.  How both normal people, and those that were involved in the fighting (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) survived.  There are so many angles to this story.  I didn't want to put it down and I didn't want it to end.  I don't often pursue books by one author but Anthony Doere is one author I WILL read again.  Do NOT miss reading this book!!!  This is also the first review I have ever written.  That is how strongly I feel about this book being a must read.
The story is told in short scenes and images, sometimes bouncing back and forth in time.....but it works. Some of the scenes/images are absolutely riveting. The horror of war displayed by the inability of the young German radio whiz to not "follow the crowd". He finds himself doing things he knows are morally repugnant, but every else is doing it. He cannot bring himself to stand alone against the mass psychosis. He sees what happens when someone does.<br/>Meanwhile, a blind French girl attempts to solve the mystery of the miniature city her father has created to assist her with her travels. More than knowledge of her environment lies there.<br/>And so, the two hurtle towards one another, WWII Paris as the back drop. Good stuff.
This book surprised me! Not just the fantastic storyline, but the way it was executed. I don't typically like present tense. And I get frustrated when stories flip back and forth with characters. For me, this format reads to slow and pulls me out of the rhythm of the book.<br/><br/>Not so with this book.<br/><br/>The prose are almost lyrical and moving from each character a few pages at a time, actually made the pacing quicker. I understand why the author won a Pulitzer for this!!!<br/><br/>Excellent historical WWII telling with complex, interesting characters. The setting was lush and visceral. The ending, although not a happily ever after, it was satisfying.<br/><br/>I can't think of anyone who I wouldn't recommend this too.
i am speechless with admiration for this book. I am ordinarily a very fast reader but I lingered over sentences and paragraphs like they were the most delicious and unusual chocolates. I drew out reading it for weeks because I couldn't bear the thought of it being over. It isn't the characters or even the story, it is the ideas and especially the language. This is a book you want to reread immediately and which I suspect I will read many times. The characters and story are wonderful, but they pale in comparison to the language. I just marvelled at the images Mr. Doerr created. What must it be like to live in his brain? There is pretty much nothing I didn't adore about this book.I am deeply jealous of anyone who has not yet read it.
Thought I was completely finished with WWII lit, but this book made it all come alive again.  The characters were people for whom I cared and descriptions of the French cities were easy to visualize.  There is much tension achieved as the two main characters come closer and closer to meeting and no obvious indication as to what outcome will be.  There is too much traveling forward and backward in time for me -- more like the way a movie is edited.  And I predict a movie of the novel in the near future.  I liked the writing so much that I am now halfway through a memoir by the author written about a year he spent in Rome while writing this book.  It is completely different but just as readable --" Four Seasons in Rome."
One of the books that you don't want to end. What a brilliant author! Thank you for suggesting that I read it.
I would highly recommend this book to anyone who did not live through WWII, to anyone who has difficulty understanding the collective mindset, to anyone whose parent could never speak about the war, to anyone who might feel discouraged that humanity might survive.  At first I found it disconcerting to be flip flopping back and forth on the time line, but soon realized that the author was allowing us to see how his main characters came to be who they were.  This book was a significant reminder to me to value my own sensitivity, to honor people's differences and contributions, and mostly that the many kindnesses we do are remembered for years to come, especially when we take personal risks to be kind or protective of others.
This novel swept me in from the first chapter.  The story is immediate and moving.  It spirals the reader through the sad horrors of World War II, but the characters are warm, human, believable and generally likable.  There is a hint of mystery that keeps the reader interested lo the end.  The descriptive language and imagery are superb.  My only complaint is that the book is overlong.  I had to work to get through the middle sections.  The story needed to move along at a slightly faster pace. About 80 pages could have been edited from this book to improve the pace.  This is a minor complaint though, as I am convinced this is definitely one of the most imaginative novels that I have ever read.  We'll worth the time spent!
I truly loved this book. For so many reasons. I don't have the time to write a full review today; however, I wanted to say something so that anybody who is in doubt about purchasing this book will know it is worth the price - whatever format you get it in.<br/><br/>It is set in WWII and if you think that time period and the war is not for you, then think again. Yes, it's about two main characters who find themselves in the middle of the war - however, it is more about them than of anything else. And these two are wonderfully described and developed from childhood on. You feel that you really know them and care about them. You want the best outcome for each. I won't spoil it by telling you the end or even much about it. Just know that it is a different story - one you haven't read before.<br/><br/>That's it for now. I will finish this review later on.
I watched a lot of the D Day programing on the Invasion of France, 70 years later, so this novel was very timely.  I could not decide between giving the book 4 or 5 stars.  I ended up selecting a 4 because I could put it down, versus reading it while I made a meal or performed some other chore as I have with some books.  With that said, I did look forward to picking it up again.  One of the best things about the book was the little bits and pieces of information tucked here and there that drove home the subtle ways the Nazi Regime gained control of the German minds.  I kept thinking how different it is today with internet access all over the place as compared to the radios, or lack of them, in the 1940's.  Of course today, we are still barraged with "propaganda" from sources like FOX 'News' and advertisements that make Walmart sound like heaven.
My jaw, neck. and back muscles are stiff and sore today because I was so tense towards the end of the book waiting to see what happened. There were parts that my heart raced, and I couldn't breath due to anticipation of what was going to happen. That, my friends, is emotional investment in characters! This book is incredibly beautiful, like reading a painting, and it's going to be incredibly difficult to find a book with which to follow. It was uplifting, and heartbreaking, and I couldn't sleep last night thinking about the intricacies of the stories and characters. Sometimes I felt like it was taking too long, but there's a point to the description and it does pay off in the end, so don't lose heart.  Highly recommend!
This book was referred by a respected friend, and he was truly on target with his recommendation. The story counterpoints the journey of two main characters; one a young blind French girl and the other a poor German boy living in an orphanage in Essen against the backdrop of the invasion of France at the beginning of WWII by the Nazis. How the lives of these two and those whom each of them loved became inextricably entwined is a most compelling and poignant tale; how innocent lives are swept up in a global battle between good and evil, power and helplessness. I become emotional just writing about it. Riveting story of war and its awfulness, and how the human spirit survives it all with overwhelming bravery and courage.
I enjoyed this story very much although the chronology of the events took a little getting used to. The sections cover different time periods during the war and each  character's life not necessarily in order, so pay attention to it! I have read books about occupied cities During WW  2  by other authors and found that this one is comparable to the better ones :  The Book Thief, The Goernsey Literary and Sweet Potatoe Pie Society, The BronzeHorseman,Shanghai Girls. The two main characters are unusual in their handicaps; one is blind but cherished by her family and one is intellectually gifted but emotionally abandoned. How they experience the changing world around them is what is so compelling about this novel. Read it.
I didn't want this story to end, as I became so invested in the characters. I don't retread many books, but I this one is calling me back. Twists and turns, figuratively and literally continue throughout and some made me gasp aloud and feel as if I should have known what would happen; but this book surprises, just like life. Descriptive passages are beautifully written and memorable. I understand why the author labored for so long to complete this winner.<br/>Yes, this is a novel, but I'd rather believe that I read a true account of the struggles,  of those caught in wartime. I want to soak in the beauty of the human spirit as he presented it; it's resilience and strength even when the world gives no reason for hope.
Great read. Compelling story. Well written. Could not put it down on my honey moon! Recommend to all to read.
I don't know where to begin to describe this book or how it made me feel. Please, just read (and cherish) it.
This is a great book that humanizes both civilians and soldiers who are trying to do their best to survive the war with some level of dignity.  It is too easy to see the other side of a conflict as violent monsters, but at the lowest level the soldiers on each side are often not that different from each other.  Civilians who suffer bombings and other atrocities lived through the war in their own private hell with each hoping to have food and water each day and looking for any glimpse of normalcy.  The stresses of war bring out the best and the worst in both soldiers and civilians.  The relationships described in this book are thought provoking and very well may stay with you well after the last page has been read.
These days I'm constantly on the road and so rely on audio books to entertain. This one seemed at first bewildering as the author moved between two children who I finally realized were destined to meet near the end of the book. When I realized the connection, I was taken in and willingly rode the wave of suspense and terror that always accompanies any book involving Nazis.<br/>What these children and their families endured is terrifying and fascinating. I grew to love them both and was disappointed at the long drawn-out and unsatisfying ending. Still, the book gets four stars and I would listen all over again. So, in spite of the slow start and the denouement, I recommend this book, especially the audio edition.
Yes! I finally found a holocaust book that wasn't too romantically sad. This book is amazing, really thought provoking, and has intense emotions running through it. I love how this book is so painstakingly real sometimes, and I got sort of teary about Frederick. I admit, this isn't one of those skimming books that I usually buy. This takes time, it's slow, steady, and very real. Werner and Marie-Laure will always hold a special place in my heart. The character development was steady and slow, making you love them even more. They are flawed, loyal, and utterly perfect in my eyes. The storyline draws you in, making you eagerly flipping pages just to find out what happens next. Anthony Doerr has done a superb job!
This novel is one that based on the summary, I didn't expect to even start reading.  For whatever reason, it just didn't seem like the type of story I would want to dig into.  In part this is because of it's length and in part I have other preferences for the types of novels I like.  I am grateful I read the reviews and took a chance on this book.  The setting, the history, the characters...all are excellent and the author really makes you feel like you are present in these stories and lives.  I even catch myself wanting to visit Saint Malo someday.  This is an investment-of-time, but it's fairly simple and smooth reading.  And the layers of the story and the meaning of it's lessons makes it entirely worth it.
I enjoyed this book very much.  Even though the chapters move from one character to another, it is still easy to keep them straight.  I loved the young French blind girl and it was amazing how she learned to cope with her blindness, with the help of her father early on.  I also enjoyed the young boy and his talents that kept him safe with the Germans who made use of his talents through the war. Throughout<br/> the book I felt a connection between both the boy and girl early on, even though they were far apart.  I read this with many interruptions, so I think it would be easier to read this in fewer days to be able to focus on the story's back and forth between characters easier.  I would recommend this book!
One of the best books I've read in a long time.<br/><br/>I taught English for almost a decade, and in my teaching, selected a WWII book each year to read with my classes.  I considered myself a bit of an expert on the topic, and frankly, have felt oversaturated with the subject and avoided it for the past few years.  Gladly, my book club chose this book, and after seeing it on so many "must read" lists, I was eager to see what the buzz was about. I was not disappointed.  What a beautiful and unique perspective that made me think about new and untouched subject matter within the WWII genre.  I have bought this book for several people since I finished it myself and look forward to reading it again.
A beautifully written description of ordinary people forced to survive in their war dominated environments.
3.5 stars mostly for the beautiful, descriptive language, but it loses points for the meandering storyline that goes on too long and moves around in time for no discernible reason. Taking place in France during World War II, parts of the book are intriguing. The character of Marie-Laure, a young blind teenager, is touching, as well as her relationship with the father who does his best to protect her. The book begins to become tedious, though, as the short chapters continually alternate between Marie-Laure and Werner, the teenage Nazi soldier. His character arc is not as effective. The book could have easily been one hundred pages shorter without losing the flow, but then again, I'm an impatient reader.
This is a real page turner- based on the actual firebombing of St. Malo, France, the story intertwines the lives of a variety of identifiable characters to create unique perspectives from wholly different backgrounds. That the reader can so quickly relate to many of the primary characters makes it easy to see that if placed in extreme circumstances, any one of us might transform into someone else who we wouldn't recognize. And it likewise becomes difficult to say with certainty what we could never become capable of.<br/><br/>On the whole this book is both uplifting and quite  well written. But the Pulitzer Prize speaks louder than a simple reviewer can; this story seems destined to become a classic.
Didn't expect to enjoy this as much as I did.  Many books that win literary prizes are such disappointments!  This is not. A tightly woven plot that was not totally predictable. Reader could really empathize with the blind Marie-Laure and feels her confusion.  Using the locksmith, puzzles, and models of cities is ingenious and believable.  It's a bit of a stretch joining Marie-Laure and Werner by past radio broadcasts, but it works.  Uncle Etienne is a fascinating character.<br/>Using the diamond was an interesting way to leave a trail of crumbs for the characters to follow, but not realistic.<br/>I was relieved Doerr didn't attempt a happy-ever-after fairy tale ending - this was more realistic.
This book is absolutely extraordinary!! Repulsive, disturbing, hopeful, and triumphant, you are taken on a sensory and emotional journey that turns you inside out and back again. The story is woven together in stages as the 2 characters, the blind girl and the German soldier heads towards their destiny of meeting. It's a truly beautiful narrative set in an horrific time in history. The backstories of these 2 characters reminds us that nothing is ever what it seems, and that darkness, though it may envelope us, cannot crush us. The blind girl is the Light in this novel. Her innocence, inquisitiveness, tenacity and hope is the string which one holds onto desperately. It is that hope that one holds onto for the German lad to retain his sense of innate goodness amidst the cruelty, horror and desolation of WWII. A must-read.
The author and this book had such brilliant potential, but the execution (of the book and audio version) left a lot to be desired.  I am all for eloquent prose (versus just story and dialog), but this author got carried away with metaphors.  It was as if he couldn't describe something without a flowery comparison.  It got tiring and silly.  The story dragged on and on...instead of abandoning the book, I created my own abridged version of the story by forwarding the audio.  Speaking of audio, the narrator spoke French with such an American accent that it hurt my ears.  Note to authors, if you have many foreign words, please find a reader who has command of the language and an ear for the accent.
I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! In fact, it was so delightful, I read it in three days. I am grateful to have discovered Anthony Doer. I just downloaded two more of his books. One might call him a "poet-novelist!" His descriptions of the sea, shells, snails and whelks [even difficult scenes of the tragedies of war] are sheer poetry! The unique structure of short chapters incentiveize the reader to want to keep reading. I fell in love with Marie Laure, his blind daughter central figure. I hope they find some sensitive film director (like Brian Percival - THE BOOK THIEF) and his young female lead (Sophie Nelisse) and make a movie of this delightful novel. I hated finishing this book: I wanted more..
Every once in a while I enjoy and respect a book so much that I want to have an autographed copy, so even though I already bought the hardback copy that I read, I've also gone ahead and bought online an autographed copy to add to my collection.  I know it may not sound logical...in fact, I know that it's not logical...but for whatever reason I feel like this is my way of honoring the author for such a job well-done.  I have about twenty books that I enjoyed so much that I sought out an autographed copy: "All The Light We Cannot See" is the latest addition to my collection.  Loved it.  Thank you, Mr. Doerr, for writing it, and congratulations on your accomplishment.  I envy you greatly.
Superb writing style, no spare words. A story that grabs you and is a joy to read. Could not put it down.
Three stars, for while the writing is superb, the story slowed down at about 39 percent and so did my interest.  While Doerr is a truly gifted wordsmith, for me the story became bogged down by the serious descriptions of everything and slow pace, while at the same time failing to engage my heart and emotions enough to make this a satisfying read.  In other words, reading it became a chore and I wouldn't pick it up again.<br/><br/>That being said, this could make a fabulous movie--Oscar bait really--with the right cast supplying the much needed emotion to make the story come alive, a musical score that could liven up the unending seriousness, a screenwriter to write a better ending and a time limit of two hours to ensure more even pacing.
I just really liked this book.  it was such an interesting story and told of the love and compassion of all the characters.
I was drawn into this book from page one. Mr. Doerr's gift of crafting such beautiful, literary and precisely descriptive sentences "without" it sounding superfluous is only one of the many joys this crown jewel author shares with his readers. I loved the story and the richness of the characters. The hues and tones of the devastation painted so brilliantly and respectfully does a justice to the tragedies of world war II which he very sensitively tells.  I devoured this book in one weekend and I truly tried to pace myself and savor the last hundred or so pages. This is one of my top picks for 2014…I look forward to the next endeavor by Anthony. His writing truly touches my hear and soul.
I passed this book over many times simply because of the subject matter.  I didn't want to read a gloomy story about WWII, Nazi's & a blind girl but this book received so many great reviews that I knew so many people couldn't be wrong!  I finally gave in and I am so very happy that I did!  The story is so beautifully written and you will connect with every character.  Each of the characters were described so well that I felt as if I knew them.  All the items, places, and scenes were described to the degree that I felt as if I could see and feel it all too.  I had many nights where I had to force myself to put the book down and go to sleep!  You should buy this book, you won't be sorry!
This book started off a bit slow at first, so if you purchase it, stick with it...it gets way better.  I feel like I learned something about war....the human aspect of it. As I sit in the comfort of my warm home, belly full, and with very few cares, this story enlightens me.  War  affects everyone. It changes people and it never leaves them the way it found them.  This book is not what I would call fast paced action, but more of a book that looks at the characters and how they perceive things and feel about them. The main characters are two children who find themselves in the midst of war, and the reader takes the journey with them through the war.  I thought it was a great book.
This is my favorite novel of 2014.  Both main characters are sympathetic, and their interaction moving.
Well written. Doerr causes the reader to care about the characters instantly. He is an excellent author
I thought this was so well written. The story was different and it held my interest all the way through
I really enjoyed this story. The author alternates the narrative between the blind girl and the German boy. The characters are developed over time and are realistic. The Nazi portions with bullying are very difficult to read through but I thought they were not over dramatic. The story helped me understand veterans from WWI as well as how it must have felt to live in an occupied country. The methods of 'doing something' against the regime were very believable.<br/>The girl, the boy, their families and the lives they led were told in a believable way. Just when you think you can't read another WWII story one like this one comes along and you find it compelling and well written.
A gourmet feast for the all the senses! I enhanced my experience by switching back and forth between reading and listening to the audio.  Not a single sentence of 530 pages is wasted--every word presents a visual, creates a feeling, poses a moral discussion, and places the reader in the characters 'shoes.  Non-stop reading challenge!  This is a masterpiece of Art and will ultimately be compared to best of the great artists-and receive a well deserved place among the best.  Do not miss this brilliant piece of literature! By Anthony Doerr.  It took Mr. Doerr 10 years to write and I am happy to reap the benefits of his brilliant mind and writing skills.  Best book I've ever read!
One of the best books I have ever read. First novel I have given five stars to. Very emotional story about a boy and a blind girl growing up during WWII ,the girl in France and the boy in Germany.  Eventually their lives intersect close to the end of the war.<br/>One of the many historical aspects of the story I found very interesting was how in Germany Hitler created special schools for the brightest young Germans to become elite soldiers. The young German boy is selected. Part of the story is about his training.<br/>A very emotional ending brought many tears to my eyes. The writing is excellent, some almost poetic. The pace of the story is good. Short chapters. Great read.
I chose this novel because of its great reviews and I was not disappointed in the least. The description of life perceived by the young blind Marie are ravishing, Werners experiments with long distance communication and particularly the circumstances of WII that shake the two  French and German youth"s lives  are beautifully narrated while gripping, and devastating at times. I think that the way Doerr presents the girl and boy"s appreciation of the sea, their resilience in the middle of loss and separation makes this a book of light and hope in the midst of  unsraveling plots the characters are able to endure. TOO intriguing to let down  bitterly sweet  I recommend  it fully!
This story could have been real-life.  It didn't feel like a fiction novel.  The characters seemed to be breathing, talking, moving, feeling,  every time I picked up the book to read.  Doerr is masterful at drawing you in. Drawing you into the characters lives.  This may not be a suspense novel, but it is suspenseful. Read the other reviews, but don't spoil the experience by reading the plot described on the jacket cover flap. There are hundreds of books written about WWII, but I have yet to read one of this magnitude.  Also, I have never read one coming from this angle.  A young German boy, and a young blind French girl.  Do yourself a favor. Don't underestimate the importance, nor the impact this book will have on you. Buy this book now!!! (no, I have not been paid to write this review)
I read The Goldfinch just before reading this book.  Both stories center around an object that drives the action of the books' narrative, but whereas The Goldfinch loses its way in its 774 pages, this book stays right on target in its more taunt 530.  This was a wonderfully written story, or more accurately, stories.  The book follows the lives of two children; one German, and one French, as they grow up in the changing world dynamics of World War II.  Doerr handles the back and forth between time periods and locations artfully, while creating seamless, and believable, transitions for unrelated characters to interact with each other.  This is a novel I devoured more than read.
It's pointless to offer up a plot summary and presumptuous  to offer a personal take on the novel's "meaning" or symbolism so I'll  keep things simple. This is one of the most beautifully written and deeply moving books you're likely to encounter in this or any other year. It certainly was for me. It's rare (at least for me) to come across a novel where you truly care about so many individual characters, some rather unexpectedly. You needn't take my word for it. There are more than enough detailed comments on Amazon and professional reviews to be found elsewhere. This is a book I will pick up and read again at some point. That very rarely happens.<br/>  .
This is an amazing book. It works on so many levels. The balance and structure are intriguing and the characters so well drawn. It is so refreshing to read a modern novel where the characters have depth and can be believed, even when living such extraordinary lives.<br/><br/>The parallel development of the two protagonists ensures that we are kept in a state of constant suspense and even when they eventually move towards the final stages of the story, we are breathless to find out what will happen.<br/><br/>One of the best books I have read for some time. I highly recommend it if you want an emotional challenge which will entertain you from start to finish.
What a phenomenal tour de force!! I have not been this deeply affected by a novel for quite some time. Doerr gives us characters -- both major and minor -- that we actually care about; and interwoven stories that keep us riveted from the first page to the last. Other reviewers have spoken about these things more eloquently than I have here,  so I suggest that you read several of their reviews, and then purchase a copy of the book and immerse yourselves in a novel that, in my estimation is one of the greatest American novels to surface in recent years. Kudos to Anthony Doerr -- one of our true and abiding literary treasures. Thank you for your literary artistry.
One of my favored authors of which I own every book he writes. Truly gifted and meticulous in depth.
What a lovely non-conceptual set of seemingly random images strung together like seemingly trivial events of strangers, disconnected lives....woven masterfully into a tapestry of people who converge amidst wartime chaos and horrors, finding a breath of humanity in the madness. Always just under the surface of human events is a heart that yearns to be touched, that brutality cannot crush. People find each other with their hearts, yet it does not provide any ground, they drift by each other, but know they have touched another's soul, that theirs has been touched.<br/>Amazingly what humans can bear, can hold, can heal, can forgive the scars that will never go.
Anthony Doerr shines a torch into the recesses of what it means to be fully human, with our capacities for good and evil teased out against a chilling WWII backdrop. A suspenseful plot and a pair of well drawn youths who fatefully are brought together, deliver a remarkable story, but the author's attentive eye and vivid prose take in the beauty of the natural world, a counterpoint to the ugly wreckage and waste of war. Doerr is strongest when he humanizes evenhis least sympathetic characters, and when he explores notions of courage and duty that expose the contradictions of both. All of the characters have a story worth pondering. Highly recommended book.
I don't know why I enjoy books about WWII and Germany; maybe it is because I lived in Germany at one time. This book is long and perhaps like I did, you should read it twice to catch all the hints for the future the author gives us. Especially if you are confused about the diamond at the end of the book, reread the first part of the book. The characters are so strongly drawn that you might feel the author had enough material for two books. I wished for so much for Werner as he was so intelligent, and of course the father in the story. However, I am grateful for the extended story for blind girl. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and even  reading it twice!
This was a good story and Doerr is a good writer but I didn't think this was a Pulitzer Prize winner - oops, good thing I wasn't one of the judges this year!  Actually, Doerr is an excellent writer.  So good, in fact, that I think he kind of got bogged down in too much detail at time so that it interrupted the flow of the story.  And shifting back and forth in time and story line didn't really add to the impact of the story, imho.  So, overall a good book and worth the read but it didn't make me want to read any of his other works, unlike when I read 2013's National Book Award winner, The Good Lord Bird by James McBride.  Now that was a good story.
This book is amazing! Truly one of the best I've read in a while. Good book club book! Don't miss.
It's a good story but the chapters are short and jump from one person/place to another abruptly and, what really bothers me is that it also jumps forward and back and forward again in time--to no apparent purpose.  For me, it makes the story fractured and frustrating to follow.  I do appreciate novels that skillfully use flashbacks to flesh in the history of a character or event but, in this story, I feel almost as if I have reader's whiplash.  I'd like to be able to able to disassemble the book and reassemble it in an easier-to-follow order.  Still, it is a fascinating tale and probably worth the effort required to follow it through to the end.
Separate lives come together in a critical moment in time, the blind French girl with a love of mollusks and Jules Verne, her father the lock smith, Werner, the German engineering prodigy, Ettiene, her uncle and Radio and the War.  Like The Bridge of San Luis Rey, they are drawn to a place and a point in time when lives are taken and lives are melded.  To read All The Light We Cannot See is to be transformed.  Not many books can do that anymore but this one does<br/><br/>If you can read, you understand war, loss, struggle and redemption then you must pick up this book and feel the joy and the pain when it is done.  Do so and thank me later.
Well written.  You could just see it all in your mind as you read.  A good vision of what history
This book was amazing!  I had never heard of it before, but it popped up on my suggestions list.  I enjoy period pieces that aren't overly serious.  This has a little of everything, multiple story lines, but more than clear enough to keep everyone straight.  Gripping enough that I didn't want to put the book down!  Short enough chapters that when I finally made myself go to sleep I could find a nice break in the story so I didn't feel like I needed to keep turning pages.  Easy to read, just enough magical fancy and fact to be very entertaining.  Interesting points of view to stories that are happening simultaneously.  Thoroughly enjoyable!
I've never written a review before, but I cannot recommend this book enough. I chose to read it because I personally had some eye problems recently that threatened, but thankfully did not claim, my vision. I may not have read this otherwise, making it the best thing to come from my personal issues. The stories of all of the characters are incredible and the author is masterful at bouncing among them, and periods in time, without the stories ever becoming confusing. When I finished reading this, I wanted to start it over immediately. Instead, I bought Doerr's other novel, Saving Grace, but I think I'll reread this when I'm done with that.
This isn't a book. It's a relationship you form with two vulnerable, strong, resourceful children who you will travel with through their lives. They live in very difficult times. World War II pushs each of them out of childhood, into desperate times way beyond what people of their age and liabilities should ever have to endure. One a German, the other French. The writer is extremely talented. You will have all your senses engaged as you read. Read this book. Look into the WWII history of Saint Malo, France. I am thankful to the author for writing this story. Werner and and Marie-Laure will forever be with me. I'll visit this book again.
Once started, I couldn't put it down.  The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating is the flash-forward/flashback device the author used to spin the tail.  This method of narrative seams to be a trend.  I read "The Girl on the Train", which was also very well done,  just prior to this, and it was the same thing.  It can be sometimes confusing, but the real drawback for me is that when I know how an aspect of the story turns out, it takes away from the suspense of the story.  As much as I enjoyed this book, I think it would have been better if it started at the beginning, and went to the conclusion on a linear path.
A beautifully written story that follows two very different people who both face tremendous adversity.  The visual imagery in this book is stunning, which seems slightly ironic given one of the main characters is blind, but she 'sees' more than most people.  While this book is set during the war torn years in Europe, the war seems to be part of the background, and the incredible story of the two main characters is the central focus.  I was captivated by the story and the eventual intersection of the two main characters.  It is a lengthy book, but it didn't feel long, as the chapters were so brief.  I would highly recommend his book.
The author allows the reader to enter the life of a young blind girl. She loses her ingenious father who provided so many life skills to her as she was growing up. He makes tactile models of her world so she can maintain a mental image for navigation.  The disruption and occupation of her world by the advancing German army and their subsequent demise draw the reader emotionally into her world. The author writes in a manner which causes the reader to carry the story into our daily lives. There is some intrigue related to her father.  I seem to be attracted to literature about the second world war.  This book is a wonderful addition.
This work is simply exquisite.  The language and the story are as fine as any I have ever read.
Seldom do I come across a book that I feel is worthy of finding a permanent spot on my bookshelf, but this one has. My critique expertise only spans as deep as "I liked it" or, " I didn't like it," so I cannot give the technical analysis you would find in a college literature course. However, I purchased three books last week thinking I would read this one last, but after reading a few pages the other books slipped into oblivion. I did not put this book down for three days. I loved every page of this book and became completely engrossed and obsessed with what would happen next. I look forward to ready this again.
This was a great book about about living during war time without being depressing. Not that it sugar coated the atrocities, but I wasn't depressed for a week after reading it as it showed the courage of the characters and you felt pride in their accomplishments.  The ending was a surprise and unpredictable which I like. I don't enjoy a book that I can figure out the ending. I agree with the other critics that the time jumps were confusing at times, but it made you pay attention and concentrate. Doer has a way of making you feel like the characters which is truly a gift. I highly recommend this book - you won't be disappointed.
I have read this novel for about 3 times now and it was really really great. I love the story.
Suspense with a moral message. Enjoyed reading this book, the author's writing style brought the story to life. An introspective account of what it was like to be one of Hitler's youth and the challenges faced by the young to be thrust into a world at war. It also gave a look into the French resistance and the pressures that they faced along with the added challenge of the heroine's blindness. Although not being able to see the heroine gave wonderful accounts of the heart. Her descriptions of the emotions that she felt and understood about those around her, both human and in the animal world, make this book a must read.
Of course, there are a few more characters, but the story is of their inevitable collision in time. A very easy read (most chapters are less than three minutes),  yet the quick cuts are interesting. Non-linear, the story bounces around a bit, but is never distracting. Ah the characters, the blind girl, the father, the radio wiz, the German sergeant major, the uncle, the housekeeper, the sister, and my favorite, Volkheimer the giant. Lovingly written, you feel the duty, the struggles, and the impetus for their actions. A well deserved best seller that reminds us what living through WW II was like for the regular folk.
Award-winning author, Anthony Doerr, has accomplished that most masterful of human endeavors: a redemption of the horrors of war through a glimpse at the creative human spirit shining through the individual. His grasp of the hunger and curiosity that lead to excellence plays itself out in a beautiful litany of sensory detail, metaphor and simile that is unexcelled. Plot, character, and the large questions of what it means to be human in inhuman conditions are all presented in language as beautiful as the best poetry. Though I was reluctant to reach the end of this book, the last few chapters drug out a bit for me.
Deeply engaging story of two star-crossed teens during the occupation of France in the last months of WWII. Not so much a romantic story as a testament to inherent goodness in the worst of times and an exploration of the human casualties of war, both physically and emotionally. Doerr embodies this construct in the two teens, one physically blind, the other blind to the cost of his country's ruthless ambition. Each is a product of their very different environments yet they are equally dogged in their will to survive and to "see" beyond the confines of the small coastal town they find themselves trapped in.
Mr Doerr crafts does a remarkable job of crafting two stories that do not entwine until the end.  Each story has its own unique and  well developed characters.  The time is before and during World War ll but is not a typical war story.  He uses quite a bit of foreshadowing so it helps if you are reading with attention.  Since I did not have long stretches of reading time available, I sometimes got lost and had to backtrack to remind myself of the situation.  That being the case, my reading was fragmented and I am now reading it again.  This is not a cticism of the book but rather a reflection of my present life!!
So enchanting, such a great story, told in alternating view points, mostly between Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and Werner, an orphaned German boy who is good with mechanics, a skill which eventually winds him up in the Wehrmacht.  There are a few other characters woven throughout the book, and the majority of these characters are all so likeable, you cannot wait to hear more of their story.  Marie-Laure's father has built a model of their section of the city, so she can find her way around, a job he resumes once they flee Paris for her Great-Uncles house in Brittany.  The book moves along at a quick pace.
Stay alert for the last couple chapters - things happen fast and the details are important..
Take 1/3 measure of superb narrative,1/3 credible characters, 1/3 beautiful writing. Add a twist of poetry and phantasy. Mix carefully. Partake slowly, enjoy.  If you are the type that has a lengthy wish list, do not hesitate. Move All the Light... up to the top of the list and purchase asap. Clearly one of the best conceived, intelligent, and well written books I have read this year, the type that generates tension between gobbling up pages to see what happens next and holding back to delay arriving to the end. Missing Werner and Marie Laure once you've finished it. This book surpasses the star qualification.
It's a good, basic read.  I certainly was looking forward to coming home and having a few hours with the book each night.  My issues come more at the end.  I find that many authors have a difficult time wrapping up their plots and Mr. Doerr doesn't seem to be an exception.  He also seems as if he has a few separate stories that he wanted to cram into one.  This technique can work very well, but I think he would have done better by exploring them further and maybe eliminating a narrator POV or two.  Overall, I enjoyed the book but felt it would have benefited from a bit of tightening up in the editing process.
I wasn't that impressed with this book. I thought the writing was very good, but I had two issues with the story. One, I couldn't identify with either main character. I think that was because the chapters jump back and forth between their two stories, so much so that right about the time I started to get interested in one character or the other, it would switch to the other. Two, nothing ever happens until you're about 50 pages from the end. I like fiction with action scenes. This has none. That was very disappointing considering that Doerr is very good at creating tension. He's just terrible at releasing it.
This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time, and I am in two monthly book clubs.  A woman in the one club I belong to chose it, and everyone in the group (of about eight or ten) loved it.  We voted it an 8.7 out of 10.  I personally gave it a 10.  I did not want it to end.  The author has taken a totally-different approach to the 1944-45 period (time of Hitler).  The author very deftly goes back and forth (chapter by chapter) from telling about a young blind girl in Paris to a young orphaned Nazi youth.  Doerr is a masterful writer, his descriptions are vivid, and the book is deeply moving.
Definitely a page turner written with knowledge that gives the reader the feeling they are right there experiencing WWII with the people of the area.  Anthony Doerr's prose is written with sensitivity, with knowledge, with expertise.  My husband and I read it aloud to each other and, thus, were awed by the elegant structure of Doerr's sentences, some of them 14 and 20 lines long, and each one exquisite with the words so masterfully chosen.  We'd stop reading to discuss the awe, the emotions, the sentence structure.  We'll both keep recommending this fine masterpiece and will talk about it for many moons.
This is the most amazing story I have read in years! The story itself is complicated, intriguing and often mysterious. It demands attention and thought. It caused me to think about war, people and how they deal with war. It made me think about who we are as human beings and how we are easily destroyed or sometimes made strong. "What does not kill us, makes us strong," - not always. Sometimes what makes us strong might also get us killed! We like to think we have control; life and death are shown in this story to be quite random. And yet, and yet - there is mystery. Are life and death really that random? Possibly what passes for life is really death and what we fear about death really sets us free?
This is a spectacularly moving book. It starts slowly and at first we don't see the connection between the characters but as time moves closer towards the center we follow along with the author to the eventual connection. And Doerr's language is a beautiful conduit there. He doesn't so much describe action or thought. It's more like a reverie we enter with him, which makes the story all the more moving because it feels like there's a synchronicity between us and him.<br/>I didn't t want the story to end. The lyricism and beauty of Doerr's words made me feel a little like Marie Laure's vision of life.
I absolutely loved this book! Anthony Doerr uses technics in his writing that everyone would appreciate (e.g., a repeating element, time, the senses, metaphors/similes, emotional connections, character development), but he also makes the reader use their own mind by requiring the reader to make inferences and really engage in the story. You can't miss a word or get lazy in your reading or you've lost the real connections. This should be required reading for LA students 6th grade and up, not only as a tool for teaching effective writing technics  but also as an example of absolutely beautiful writing.
One of the best books I have read centered around the WWII era. You receive an insight on the accounts of various individuals involved in this sad time of our world's history. Each character is written well. They each have their flaws as well as their heroism.<br/><br/>The story itself is very touching and moving. While the outcome of WWII is known, the story itself is not predictable. It is a long book, but a quick read. I was sad when the book was finished.<br/><br/>I will not say the ending was happy, but it was also not disappointing. Again, a great account of those involved in WWII history.
this is an amazing novel that has gotten way too little public notice and attention.  it is a riveting story of two children growing up under the shadow and with the trauma of the second world war as it tore apart communities in Europe and left children bereft of parents, coping on their own, trying to make sense of the world.  the book does a magnificent job of telling the story of each of these children over the years of the war, largely separate from each other but very occasionally connected in unimagined ways, and it updates the story through to today, reminding us of the long shadow of trauma.
Good story and very well written.  Brings you face to face with terror and hardships faced by civilians during the second world war. If you are to young to remember WW2, this will give you a pretty good idea of what it might have been like for people trying to survive during those nightmarish times. We here in the USA never had the experience of foreign armies occupying our country and imposing their will in a most cruel way.  All The Light We Cannot See, captures what it might and probably did feel like to live in France during the German occupation. One of the best books I have read in some time.
A very well written novel. A total new approach on this historical fiction on World War 2. Two children on different ends of the conflict totally robbed of their childhood. I loved the beautiful way the author entwines the characters and the descriptive and thought provoking look into their souls. The author focuses on the characters thoughts and the way they deal with what they are going through and less on the actual horrible events because he knows his readers are all too familiar with this part of history.<br/> The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that it left me feeling sad.
I found this book very interesting.  It put the build-up to World War II in Europe, specifically Germany and France, in the perspective of two young people and how their lives were affected by the conflict.  The major two individuals of the story actually interact only briefly, but the lead up to that encounter reveals much about their how the horrors of war changed them forever.  I would highly recommend this book.  It is really about how two people live their lives without bending to hardships they encounter or letting those hardships change the basic goodness of humanity they both possessed.
I spent a late night/early morning finishing Anthony Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See and upon reading the last page, I felt like this author’s words made a light within me burn brighter. I didn’t sleep a wink as my mind wouldn’t let go of the characters, the imagery, the intricacies of the story that made this book so precious. I found myself highlighting so many passages that I wanted to commit to memory, so thought-provoking and emotive they were as to leave me referring back to them even before I finished reading this book in its entirety. All the Light We Cannot See is a work of art.
This is my favorite genre so maybe I am biased but this tale of star crossed individuals each battling their own difficulties as well as a world at war made for riveting reading.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure's dialog was so limited, but each verse was perfectly written. So vulnerable and sympathetic yet also strong and resilient. Werner's suffering is equally poignant as he struggles into manhood against a backdrop of true evil.<br/><br/>Showing these two fates, comparing and contrasting at points, was very exciting. A satisfying read, at times bittersweet, but always enlightening and enjoyable.
DEAR GOD IN HEAVEN:  I have never read such a book before.  It blew me away.<br/>I was about a fourth of the way through when I realized that the youngsters and<br/>the adults were German and not one of our allies.<br/>I am 85 now, and remember that war very well.  I was a teenager then and It left a<br/>mark on me that I never understood.<br/>I am in awe of Anthony Doerr and will never forget this deep and gentle writing.  Oh,<br/>I feel as if I  flunked a test.  How can I really say what I am thinking. There are no words.<br/>The best I can say is what I said before.  "I have never read such a book before."<br/><br/>Thank you Sir, I will never forget.<br/><br/>Sincerely,  Jacqueliine Carey Lair
This was an excellent story. I will admit that, about 3/4 of the way thorough the book, as the horrors of WW II were being described, I had to put the book down for a day, as I was becoming too depressed. When I picked it up again, however, I felt compelled to read it to the end. I'm so very glad I did. This book is not about the Holocaust (though at one point it alludes to it,) but rather about a blind girl in France, and an orphan in Germany who is recruited by the Nazis. Doerr's descriptions of the blind girl and the orphan boy are magnificent. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!
One of the best books I've read in a long time. (and I read a lot) Book Club member for over 20 years!
I loved this book so much, it brilliantly showcases ways in which War affects children ( the innocent) it comes down to a simple and time old question that adults can not even truly answer and that is how hard it is to be "good" during bad times. Both charters struggle with who the good guys are and try ways to survive their situations.  A simple paragraph can not do this book justice, I read a review that stuck with me it said " Just as light is complex, so is ALL THE LIGHT YOU CAN NOT SEE.  It is well worth your time I may have finished this book but it has never left me..
The book starts out so beautifully, magically, wonderfully.  But what happened in the last 30 pages?  The ending lacks consistency, as though the book were finished by another writer or group of writers.  The quality of writing takes such a noticeable nose-dive.  Like Mozart's Requiem was finished by his students after his death, this book loses its voice and becomes dull - as though the author was blinded himself to a way to finish the novel.  Very disappointing.  I want to erase those last chapters and send them back for a rewrite.  They don't hold up in logic or quality of writing.
The writing in this book is beautiful and moving, such that you want to take your time to read it and savor ever word. The characters feel real and endearing, and each storyline and point of view introduced is enthralling. The story flips back and forth between the two main characters and with every switch, I was both sad to leave the one character but also excited to continue the story of the other character, where in most books that employ this style, I favor one character over another. It is one of the most beautifully written and emotionally captivating stories I have ever read.
This is the most beautifully-written novel I have read.  The characters portrayed are enigmatic, especially given the time during which the book takes place (WWII).  Lately, I've read many books about the gut-wrenching effects the Nazis had on Germans, e.g., "Where Is Sylvia?", "The Book Thief," "The Plum Tree," and on the French, e.g., "The Nightingale."  This book far surpasses those novels by way of literary expertise and pure creative genius. I loved the characters' "back stories" and how these intertwined.  I have re-read the book twice.
I looked forward to reading this book because it came so highly recommended. It is true that the sentences and paragraphs go together in an almost lyrical style. I enjoy books that have me referring to the dictionary for word meaning. The story is centered on WWII which is one of my favorite literary eras.  But.  The author used a technique of moving back and forth in time and place in a way that seemed nonsensical. I enjoyed reading about Parisienne Marie Laure who was blind and about Werner who was a gifted orphan boy in Germany before the war.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the book but not enough to give more stars. The non-linear chronology didn't enhance the story for me.
I enjoyed the book, couldn't wait to turn the next page to see what was happening next.
Well written.  Different perspective from other books I've read that were historically based during this period of time.  A blind girl and a boy genius with electronics.  The paths they end of having to take and the effect on their lives.  In regard to the blind girl, it adds a whole new perspective to dealing with being uprooted from what she knows and how to adapt to a new environment.  The fear and resourcefulness of being alone, in a building, and needing to protect herself from the enemy.  It is so well written that you can actually feel her emotions.  Definite recommend.
The stories of Marie-Laure, living in Paris, and Werner, surviving  the Hitler regime, were told magnificently.  Although the reader is almost pre-conditioned to expect a long romantic union after they meet, the author, Anthony Doerr, provides only the briefest encounter -- like the soft touch of a gentle bird that is here one moment and gone the next.  I believe the multiple awards the author received for this book were well deserved and the 10 years he spent writing the story were well spent.  I will recommend this book to my book club readers and all my literary friends.
Fantastic book that you can easily get lost in.  I hated my job because it took me away from this book - seriously it's that good.  It's well written and the story telling is excellent.  Many of the chapters are very short which is a big plus in my opinion because I could easily find a stopping point in my busy schedule.  (I rarely did though because I found myself checking ahead at how long the next chapter was and deciding, "what the heck"...over and over again.)  I highly recommend this book which is all at once a romance novel, historical fiction and suspense.
Although I have on rare occasion chosen not to finish reading a book once I have started it, this was the first book I did not read in its entirety because it was so outstanding.  The incredible descriptions and settings of the absolute horror of war and its merciless affect on innocent children (on both sides) was simply unbearable to read and maintain one's emotional  balance.  Extraordinarily well written with an intriguing plot, this was an amazing book. The last several chapters were searing in their intensity.<br/>Well worth reading (as much of it as you can ....)
This is a skillfully told yarn of the best sort, excellent characters, suspenseful action, and one my favorite settings for historical fiction: WWII. There are so many predictable, formulaic books out out there, "summer reading", that are a waste of time for me. This is the real deal. You will not only be rewarded with learning more about this era in time, but also be treated to delicious and poignant metaphor after metaphor about these wonderful characters and their times. This book will live in your head afterwards, and would be a great book club selection too.
I like the style of writing. I could really get into it. Problems were this:<br/>1) a Little too long and going nowhere towards the end. Was this a true story? That's what it sounded like. If fiction, the ending could have been much better.<br/>2) The whole radio business from beginning to end was mostly hogwash. I grew up in the time of building my own radios from crystal to tubes. I have located hidden transmitters many times with a simple receiver, map, straight edge and pencil. No formulas etc. What the author needed was some real help in the technical department.
This is a World War II book unlike anything else I have read.  The story of the war as seen through the senses of a French blind girl and a German orphan boy make the war so immediate and make clear how people were trapped in their roles, no matter how they felt about it.  Because Marie Laure is blind, we experience the smell and feel of the world, rather than how it looks.  I mostly liked the way the book alternated very short chapters between the two main characters, but my only criticism is the switching of time periods throughout the book made it a little confusing.
I thought it was boring. The characters did not hold my interest. Hard to follow what was really going on, and  the ending was done poorly. Would not recommend this book
This novel is a stunning achievement. The way Doerr brings the strands of the plot together and paces the novel is faultless. I know that many readers had trouble with the shifting timeline but I thought it worked. I was right there with Werner and Jutta, Marie Laure and Madame Manec, Frederick, Von Rumple, and the rest, each of them described with telling detail. I devoured the book and then read it again. I have one wish though, a small one—that the author had ended the book sooner – without resolution. I long to have the characters futures left open to possibility.
This is a book to recommend - and a book to remember. The tale is told through two very different characters, who share a common humanity under threat by war. Two very different victims of the same violence, they manage to transcend it. Possibly because the narrative alternates from the young French blind girl Marie-Laure and German orphan Werner, the pace of the novel never lags. You have the one scene in your mind while you catch up on what has happened in the other. The book salvaged a very soggy summer for me, and I have already recommended it to several friends.
This is a brilliantly constructed novel by an author who is brilliant with the use of language. He paints such vivid descriptions of everything that the reader becomes part of the story. Forget what others have said about the story being hard to follow. The leaps from present to past and back are easy to follow and make the story construct much more interesting. The ending was not what I had hoped for but probably what the story deserves. This is a novel that is truly worth your time to read and one that you will recommend to anyone who appreciates great literature.
Hands down one of the finest stories I've ever read.  Seldom does a book capture my interest so completely from the very first page and has me dreading coming to the end of it.  An amazingly original story, with characters so well drawn out that you feel compassion for each and every one of their situations.  The author has a great talent for description and keeping the dialogue uncomplicated and real.  I think it's a real compliment just to say I hated that the book wasn't two or three times longer than it was, I could have gone on and on just turning those pages.
I can't say sufficiently wonderful things to explain this otherworldly, gorgeously told story. The rich prose delivered me from my everyday routine and took me into the real lives of all those who suffered terribly during WWII. It increased my compassion, dwarfed my own problems and gave me more faith in our capacity to love. The story shows very clearly how ever person in the midst of that war suffered, both the perpetrators and the victims alike. The depth and humanity of the characters gave me a view into the great skill of their author. Please read this book!
I have always been a fan about stories involving WWII.  This story jumps between two youths during a time when most of the world is being torn apart.  Seeing the war from behind enemy lines as well as the poor innocent lives of so many was riveting.<br/><br/>I loved picking this book up and escaping into a former life on the other side of the planet.<br/><br/>The descriptions are gorgeous and heartbreaking.  This is a tale of woe, regret, anger and so many other indescribable emotions that millions felt during the war.<br/><br/>A must read for any bookworm!
Dazzling imagery and rich language but well shy of overwrought.  Doerr is able to capture sensations as sensed by the various characters, especially Marie-Laure.<br/>  There are two or three shocks to the reader's comfort zone that are artfully drawn.  I found myself wishing I could get into the action to help tie up the loose ends.<br/>  The author's ploy of tripping around in time during the war years was disconcerting at first... but perhaps is what makes the story so compelling.<br/>  Two questions remain: (1) is the curse real? (2) exactly how tall is Volkheimer?
This was an enlightening book and I really enjoyed reading it.<br/>Seeing things from a young woman who is totally blind was so amazing and very true.  Her hearing and other senses were so amazing.  Almost unreal, but after talking to seeing impaired people, I know it is true.<br/>The information about the war and Germany,France,Russia was very interesting and very authentic.  I had two brothers who fought in France and Germany so heard many stories.  Still it was educational and interesting.<br/><br/>This would be a good read for anyone over 16 years.  Especially, for history students and middle age adults.  I do recommend this book.
I'm not good at writing reviews but this is one of the best novels I've ever read. It is sad at times of course, being a war novel but the story is riveting, there are layers of symbolism and mysticism as well. I don't want to re-hash the plot and spoil it in any way but it's stays in your consciousness, and makes you think, about how the girl who is blind of course sees the most clearly, about how the nazis were mostly just trying to survive themselves, about how hard it was to do the right things in a time of war and insanity, about many things. I can't do it justice here but it's a rare gem that will definitely stand the test of time.
I was a kid during WWll and heard the nightly news many times with fear. The characters in the book went through conditions I heard about but thankfully never had to endure. We had Air Raids and drills in school which were fearful for a child my age.  I collected scrap metal and sold War Stamps and life everyday was a little fearful. We had Blackouts and I went to bed worrying that the Germans were going to bomb us that night.<br/>It was life as a child picturing the conditions that these characters went through and only by the Grace Of God we never had to.
What a brilliant book!  I have loved Anthony Doerr's work since The Shell Collector.  This novel is in a class by itself.  The characters and the story are complex and interesting with the terrible backdrop of WWII always looming like another dark character.  I was not able to put this book down and I loved all of it, although the ending wrapped up a bit quickly.  I could have read another 100 pages to even out the ending.  I have be recommending All The Light We Cannot See to all of my friends and this book should definitely be nominated for the Pulitzer.
One of my favorite books! I found the format a bit confusing at first, but re-read the first 50 pages or so and loved it. Basically toggles back and forth between short chapters that tell of a blind French girl in WW II and a German boy who loves radios and is drafted. It tells in simply lovely language of their worlds and as the cadence of the book moves back and forth between them it  gradually brings them to a point where their paths cross. Compelling descriptions of a wonderfully developed world from the perspectives of two characters you will enjoy!
Easily the best American book of 2014, though that doesn't seem praise enough. I can think of only a handful of authors who write as well as Doerr, and most are from other countries (Makine, Bolano, Saramago, Keret, Murakami). This novel is a masterpiece and you will find many reviews explaining why (starting with the back cover, hint hint). Instead, I'd like to mention the ACCESSIBILITY of this book, to anyone, any age, gender, race. It's the highest quality literary fiction to be sure, but through his masterful talent, Doerr has managed to make the art of fiction enjoyable for everyone--and that means you. Highest Recommendation.
My main hangup is that I found the author's technique for writing chapters a bit disjointed, where each chapter is 2-4 pages and continually bouncing between characters. This technique pulled me out of the story rather than immersing me and as a consequence I never had trouble putting the book down. The story was alright, but again I never felt 'sucked in'. I'm sure that people who enjoy mulling over gossamer threads of meaning will find plenty to consider during or after their read. I did enjoy the narrative description of various scenes and locations.
This book was tremendous, and showed great sensitivity covering characters who were enemies to each other.  Very suspenseful, and I really liked the way the author reminds us that we are all human, and quite often end up in the same boat together.  I can see why this took him many years to write.  It is superbly done, and a story that tears at one's heart for many months after the reading of it is done.  I hope Mr. Doerr will keep writing.  I look forward to reading more of his work.  This is easily one of the best books I've read in a very long time.
This is a brilliant book; full of light, tenderness, mystery and suspense, and evil and good.  The story is set during WWII in Germany and France and follows the lives of two children, Werner, a German orphan and Marie Claire, a blind girl living with her father in Paris and then in St. Malo.  I read this book while traveling in France and visiting the beaches of Normandy.  The beauty and peace of the countryside contrasted sharply with the turmoil, terror and horror of war.  This book is on the short list for the National Book Award.  I hope it wins!
I'm sorry but I can't give this book one or two stars because I know it was well written and lots of other people love it. I gave it 100 pages and I just could not continue. I will usually read about 10-20 pages of a book before deciding if I want to continue but since so many love this book I really tried to love it as well. It's not because I'm not well read, I have read many much more difficult novels, but I just didn't care about the characters after 100 pages. It just didn't grab me. I usually love historical fiction but this just wasn't for me.
This is a book that brings forth so many thoughts and emotions that I able only to describe it as beautifully written. If you read 50 books this year, this is the one that will leave memories. Yes it is a war novel and yes there is violence and death, but there is so much more and you cannot help feeling the emotion. Doerr's touch is so gentle and so clear that you simply are carried along in the hands of a master story teller. I almost never feel this strongly about a book or give 5 star ratings, but this deserves every accolade that it receives.
Wow!  I know I won't be able to adequately put into words how amazing Anthony Doerr is, author of All the Light We Cannot See.  The words on the page will have you transfixed and in awe of his descriptive ability.  The story is so full of detail, simultaneously depicting the lives of German and French citizens during WWII.  I have never read a story that transported me into a realm where I felt so connected with the characters, events, and hardships.  There are many twists, turns, and intertwining of the events and lives.  Absolutely mesmerizing!
It may seem odd to describe a novel about war as 'beautiful', but there were so many gems wrapped up in the lives of the characters in this book - and the intriguing threads which bound young Marie-Laure and Werner together - which made it impossible not to see the beauty in their young selves and lives, even amidst the horror and fears they both faced.  The writing is utterly compelling, so much so that I was sorry when the book came to an end.  I'd not previously read any of Anthony Doerr's books, but I'll now buy more of this author's works!
I've read many books set during the WW II and it always seems the prevailing theme is the Holocaust.  This book only made mention of it but focused on the citizens who were trying to stay alive throughout the war, especially the youth and how their lives were robbed of childhood.  I couldn't help contrast two things, the Fuehrer's thirst to acquire all the cultured items possible, stolen from the Jews to built a monumental museum of beauty, and the dark depravity and cruelty of the Nazi movement.  This would be a terrific book for book clubs.
All The Light We Cannot See is not only the best novel I have read this year it is the best novel I have read in many, many years. It is a beautiful story told from the alternating perspective of a blind girl, who lives in Paris when the story begins, and a German boy who is an orphan. Mr. Doerr weaves this tale beautifully and seamlessly. The chapters are addictively short. The prose is stunning. The characters are intimately drawn. I think I have to go back many years to find a novel that captured me like this one. BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR!!!!
Beautiful in every respect. I typically stay away from "war books" but was thoroughly enamored with the writing and characters. I especially loved how it begins in the middle, and brings the reader through in such a way that you wonder if/when the characters will ever actually meet. The supporting elements - the mystery of the diamond, the puzzle boxes, and the radio broadcasts all make for an enchanting story. It truly reveals light, goodness and grace in a very dark time of history. I definitely would love to re-read this some day.
A very interesting and well researched book.  A lovely story with many mysteries.
This book takes a poignant look at how people make decisions in war time that they would not normally make.  A richly detailed account of two children and how they grow well beyond their years.  One a French, blind girl who lives with her father, a master key maker in the Paris National Museum; and one German orphan boy who lives with his younger sister in the coal mining town's orphanage with a French nun. The book travels back and forth in time, location and characters with rich details and emotion.  It is the best book I've read in 2014!
An unlikely couple of protagonists whose paths cross due to  the haphazard and irrational circumstances of war.  A young and scientifically curious and gifted young German boy who is not politically in tune with the Nazi regime  and a blind and also curious and intelligent young French girl who becomes a small cog in the French Resistance.  Their paths cross and the result is bittersweet ,a bit sentimental but still  somewhat believable .  Doerr describes detail well and one can really "see" the towns and cities he writes about.
A truly wonderful book.  I am in awe of the author's ability to write from the standpoint of a blind person and make it so realistic.  This book takes us away from the big picture of WWII and allows us to see it through the eyes of individuals who are forced to experience the daily grind of war, much of it from the civilian point of view.  It reminds us that even german citizens who were not considered enemies of the state were grist in the Nazi propaganda, industrial, and military complex.  I now also feel the need to visit St. Malo.
I'll admit that at first, I was so enthralled with the beautiful writing, as well as the carefully crafted details of the characters' lives, that I wasn't quite connecting with the story. I'd put it down for days without giving it a thought. As with any great story, the author builds the plot bit by bit, weaving the back-stories of young Marie-Laure and Werner until the pieces of their lives fit together. Seemingly random details, in the end, make sense. Stick with this one, because it is a powerfully gripping, unforgettable tale.
I had such high expectations for this book based upon other recommendations. I was disappointed, and almost stopped reading several times. I didn't like the way the author kept going back & forth in time - I just wanted him to tell the story. I was also expecting more of a connection between the two characters. Instead, it seemed like two completely separate stories that found a way to be connected at the end. I would not recommend this book, nor would I read another book by this author. I feel I'm being kind with a 3-star rating.
What was a fun book to read turned out to be a reinforcement of values and love of French culture. Reading in New York and then Paris made the book all the more real.  Character development makes the book wonderful but the plot grabs you and never lets do. I believe we can make choices that affect others forever. Werner and Marie-Laurie are surrogates for all men and women,young and old, who are faced with life choices big and small.  DOING the right thing can be much more difficult than just letting life take you where it may.
I like a book to take me where I have never been, and paint a picture so vivid that I can see it.  I was completely satisfied by this story.<br/>The first third of the book slides back and forth between time, place and character.  It is a bit difficult to follow at first, but I found sticking with it to be worth it.  The disparate characters' stories and the books themes intertwine in an absorbing  and intricate way.  Some question are left unanswered, but I did not feel this detracted from my enjoyment in reading this book.
One of the most beautiful and heartbreaking books I've read this year, and the characters that the author created will haunt me for a long time. I doubt whether I will ever be able to think about WWII without the images of this book floating back to me. I found myself constantly choked up from the tenderness of the relationships, and still feel the heartbreak of it days after finishing it. Every character is so well developed, so remarkable, and the most heartbreaking thing of all is seeing all that promise destroyed by war.
This is an incredibly moving piece of fiction that anyone who loves reading owes it to themselves to check out. Telling the story of a young German boy and a young, blind French girl over the course of World War II; Anthony Doerr weaves together themes of the horrors of war, the love of one's family, and the beauty that exists in the world around us and within ourselves. The story moves forward at a quick pace and all of the characters will remain with you long after the story is over. Simply put: this is a beautiful book.
LOVED IT!!<br/>LOVED IT!!<br/>LOVED IT!!<br/><br/>CAN I GIVE THIS 6 STARS?
Excellent - well written, took hold of you and didn't let go. Loved this book.
Wow, the best book I read in years! Bravo Mr. Doerr!  Took me a few weeks to read this rather long book but not because of the length but every sentence was like poetry and I had to re-read to savor it.  Without revealing the plot, the only comment I would have is the last couple of chapters could have been eliminated. When Marie-Laure and Werner part ways in Saint Malo would have been a perfect ending to this book leaving the rest for imagination. But who am I to criticize this master story teller? A movie in the making?
Well written and charming novel!  Anthony Doerr has created two wonderful primary characters and fleshed out their individual worlds extremely well.  Each is uniquely appealing, resilient and has major life issues to deal with.  Their ultimate meeting is set on the life-altering stage of a continent in the midst of WII.  How events that shaped their lives affect them years later and the changes they undergo as they mature, make for a truly wonderful read.  I have not given this novel justice in this review, I can only encourage you to read it for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.
A beautifully written and realized novel about a young blind French girl and a young German boy and their struggles to survive amidst the devastation of World War II. When Marie-Laure is 12, her and her father flee Paris and the Nazis to the Saint-Malo and the home of her reclusive uncle. Meanwhile, Werner, an orphan growing up in a poor mining town, gets noticed by the Nazis for his genius with radios. Their stories are linked in many ways and come together in a beautiful heart-rending story. Highest recommendation.
I loved it.  There was a lot of sad loss of life throughout the novel.  But, of course, it was a story that took place during WW II.  By the same token, the novel was brilliantly positive about people dedicated to helping one another.  A wonderful story of a father's love for his daughter and her love for him.  How her intelligence overcame her handicap of the loss of her vision.  The story was an illustration of how the ordinary citizen fought secretly and bravely to help destroy the Nazi army overtaking their town.
This book made me feel as though I was in another world while i read it. Once I got the jist of the writing style ( the back story recap writing style) I was beyond hooked. Didn't even consider the "good or bad" side of the war. I was rooting for all concerned. I never thought I'd read another book that would suck me in like The Book Thief did.....but this definitely gave it a run for its money..... Very glad I took my wife's recommendation to read it.... now my only regret is that I finished it, and it's over.....
The story unveiled itself in a very lovely, almost lilting way... for a while I thought the author would never quite get on with it.  However, the character development was superb and the depiction of the cities before, during and after the war were beautiful and heartbreaking.  It made me realize that something small like hearing a narrator on a radio when one is young can have a real lasting impact on one's heart well into the future and long after the rest of life has unfolded.  Deeply moving and lovely novel.
Great book. Their are so many interesting threads.<br/> The love the father has for his blind daughter and how this drives him to protect her. The dreams their uncle had as a young boy but lost in World War I and how his relationship with the blind daughter restores him. A young blind girls struggle to survive.<br/>I have read many World War II novels and this is the first that attempts to show how a Nazi soldiers as a human being fighting for an unjust cause but swept into it by circumstances.<br/>So good....
An astounding book. The writing is concise yet poetic, almost luminous. The author skillfully interweaves story lines of finely drawn characters at different points in time. A phrase that occurs near the end of the novel conjured, for me, the basic theme of the book: What the war did to dreamers. Even the scenes that should be difficult to read are infused with an effective sort of beauty. Taking place during WWII, the story is understandably tragic at points, but it is also totally and unquestioningly brilliant.
A very descriptive novel in which the parallel stories of the main characters builds connections that makes a reader recognize what a talented writer Mr. Doerr is.  The fact that the story wasn't told in a linear time frame created confusion at first,  but it was like putting puzzle pieces together.  As a teacher, I always heard students ask what would happen to the characters later.  I liked that this author did tell us what happened during their remaining years.  I ended my reading with a sigh of satisfaction.
A beautiful weave of lives on separate but intertwined trajectories in tragic times, All The Light We Cannot see is one of the best reads I have enjoyed in a long time. Adding to the experience is Doerr's masterful explanatory powers so that some forms of light we cannot see, like radio waves, become more real to us than ever. The same goes for the internal light of the characters, sometimes ugly light but mostly gorgeous light, which Doerr makes visible to readers minds' even though all they see are his words.
Beautifully written and poignant story of a young girl and her grandfather who left Paris when the Germans came in during World War ll.  The grandfather was the "keeper of keys" at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris and left the museum there with possibly the most valuable mineral on earth.  The girl is blind and has to use her other senses to acclimate herself to all the many changes and dangers which she faces when they arrive in Brittany.  This is a book impossible to put down. Excellent in every way.
I will be looking for another book by this author.  This one was outstanding!  This man can make you see and feel his subject, and when the subject is the stark reality of life  during the second WW in France and Germany it can make you ache for the innocents of that horrific time in human history.  The characters he paints with his words are ugly and beautiful, brave and cowardly all at the same time.  One feels like you know them after a time.  I hated to finish the book.  My next read paled in comparison.
World War II as experienced by two children. The book is exquisite, history and allegory, with characters you carry with you and into whose minds you have entered. How The Reich established control of a crippled Germany, how nationalism blotted out nearly every trace of compassion and decency, but shown through the impossible choices made by a child. The role of the French and acts of sabotage of the occupying Nazis reflects bravery of everyday people who rose to exceptional heights of defiance. Beautiful
WWII..a blind girl and a young German soldier.  That premise didn't seem like much to me but the book is superb.  It is beautifully written, almost poetic in places.  The alternate chapters treating the two main characters kept me racing through the plot as I sympathized with them, experiencing their blindness to beauty and to treachery.<br/>Many readers may be tempted to skip over "just another war novel," but this is one to cherish.  Readers of all levels will discover a world we cannot forget.
I seem to be in the minority about this book but I just don't think it was as good as most people think.  I ended up skimming many passages.  For me, the story just seemed to drag at points and, overall, it was too long.  Also, I couldn't help wondering if the descriptions of  the Nazi training of the youth were really accurate.  He claims to have done a lot of research, so maybe he got it right.  But maybe he didn't.  This isn't a bad novel. I just don't think it's as wonderful as so many seem to think.
If you want to give yourself a great holiday present this year - this book will fit the bill.  Honestly, this book transported me back to WWII - I found myself reading the book and finding all the places on a map as I read.  Because of this book, my next trip is to Saint Malo, France.  The author's ability to describe a time and place will make you lose yourself - in a good way!  I loved the book so much I quickly bought 2 more of his books, and can't wait to read them.  This is a must read for 2014-15.
The book was an experience to read and stays with you once you are finished.  It  presents the details of World War II through the eyes of two<br/>extraordinary  young  people.  They are growing up, one in in Germany and the other in France, as the Nazis are coming to power.  It tells of the horrors  taking place in an almost normal tone and leaves it to the reader to grasp the terrible ugliness of the description.  It is not only a great book for adults but also a telling one for mature young people.
"All the Light We Cannot See" is simply beautiful. Anthony Doerr's delicate crafting of Marie-Laure and Werner's stories feels effortless. Even the jumping to-and-fro in time (NB: pay attention to chapter titles!) doesn't wreck havoc with the reader, as the story and characters feel different in earlier/later years.<br/><br/>The final chapters bring swells of emotion and closure, too, which, as an emotionally caught reader, is greatly appreciated!<br/><br/>I recommend this book to everyone.
Two children, a German boy and a French girl, grow up during during a destructive, soul crushing age, the lead up and time of WW II. Living under continual threat and deprivation, their curious intellects and soaring imaginations succor them through terrible fears, atrocities and loss. All the while, fertile, diverse, inexorable nature pulses, mesmerizing and giving hope to the children and the reader. The most beautiful story, characters and prose I have had the pleasure to experience in a long while.
What a beautifully written book about such a painful, dramatic time in human history. It's absolutely amazing and destined to be a literary classic. I wish I had the words to describe how wonderful it is, but I don't. Suffice it to say if you are looking for an engaging tale of hope, pain, loss, love in a book that takes you places you'll feel like you've been to after reading it, every conceivable emotion as well as the greatest and worst of human behavior, you too will love this book. Don't miss it.
This was the first Anthony Doerr novel that I've read.  I was thoroughly impressed by Doerr's vivid use of language to set the scenes for you in the most intimate way.  You really begin to feel yourself in the characters and immerse yourself in their situation. The plotlines are not overly complicated but are certainly not cliched, and take some interesting twists and turns.  A thoughtful look at both sides of the war.  You won't regret the ride.  Doerr is a great conductor of this symphony of a book.
I was disappointed. Very clever plotting, some well-wrought descriptions, some likeable characters with a little wisdom thrown in. And then a super-hero (Volkheiemer), a silly scene on the 6th floor with a good guy, a bad guy, a girl, a distracting bit of fire apparently meant to ratchet up the suspense?, and a precious diamond. The novel was very good in parts  but felt comic-bookish in other parts. If this is National Book Award material, I'm worried about the quality of nation's fiction this year.
I heard Doerr speaking on NPR, answering the question of, "Why yet another book about the war?"  But this one is lovely in the way that it creates compassion for and gives humanity to its central characters, whether they are French or German.  Once again--and yes, by way of fiction--I feel as though I can understand the people of this generation more fully.  This is a gorgeous, almost musical book with a light touch: I rarely have the sense that I don't want a novel to end, but with this work, I did.
I truly enjoyed this book.  What more could be said that hasn't already been written here.  It's rare I find a book I can't put down, but this one held my attention wanting to know what would happen next and when two lives would merge.  We've all read books telling stories of World War II and prisoners of that horrible war, but not much has been written about how individual lives are affected...especially those not on the front lines.  Imagine being blind and not being able to see your environment.
I loved this book.  I did not want it to end.  Both magical and factual in its writing, it is a book which I found enchanting, historically fascinating and beautifully written.  The author writes about the period of time around WW II from various perspectives.  The chapters are short and switch seamlessly between the girl in Paris and St. Malo, and the boy in Germany.  I felt as if I was the girl and then the boy; I felt the story become mine.  This is a gift, a gem of a read.  Savor every page.
Deeply insightive book about personal sacrifice and strengths. Taking place during WWII, the lives of the characters slowly work towards each other in an intriguing way. The author has obviously done a great deal of research and the places where the main scenes take place are so well presented that the reader becomes almost part of the brickwork as they watch the story unfold. A different take on the war and a brilliant read. This is my first book by this author and I shall look out for others.
It has been a long time since I read a book that captured me.  You knew the characters and you felt their emotions like you were part of their story.  The book took place in a time that was so devastating and yet amidst the atrocities that were going on,  people never ceased to amaze.  There was still inherent goodness to be found.  I loved  how the stories of the individuals  entertwined and wove throughout the book.  Don't miss this book it is fabulous and will stick in your mind a long time.
This is a wonderful book, beautifully written. A young blind girl who has her wits about her, carefully trained by her very incredibly talented father, cared for by her great uncle as France is occupied by the Nazis. A young German orphan boy, who sees joining the Hitler youth as the only way to escape, & becomes horrified by what he witnesses. Both are engaging, heart tugging stories, then they come together.<br/>A great book, highly recommended. I don't usually re-read, but I might this one.
A story that gets inside you and it kept me interested to the very end.Its about survival, courage, hope, during World War II.It astounds me that those atrocities happened. .The characters in the book come to life with every page you read... the horrors they go through.The author was brilliant in the way he was able to describe the simplest of things in every day life .This book drew me in and I ended up loving these characters as though they really existed. I give it my highest recommendation.
I highly recommend this book. I read and then re-read chapters because of the beauty of the author's use of descriptive language. It is set in World War II but the story captivates its audience because it is a people story not a story simply about devastation of war. The author spins us in the web of the very real and everyday lives of his characters as they survive the upheaval and pain of war. We truly care about each character on each side of the battle. A book one simply can not put down.
The book arrived in short time and was just as described, "like New'!
While obviously the story is fiction, the historical events described actually occurred and thus the story takes on a sense of realism as if it could have taken place.  I found the insights into Hitler's and the Nazi Parties Germany to be if anything somewhat understated while nevertheless real enough to lend an air of believability to the story.  All in all a great read and one that I found difficult to put down between reading sessions…I found myself actually not wanting the story to end.
AN INTERESTING NOVEL FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF CHILDREN GROWING UP DURING WORLD WAR II.  THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY GOOD AND THE STORY IS VERY GOOD.  ONE CHILD IS FRENCH AND ONE IS GERMAN.  YOU WILL LEARN A GREAT DEAL OF THE CHALLENGES EACH FACED.  I DON'T WANT TO GIVE TOO MANY DETAILS AS YOU NEED TO DISCOVER THE INTRICATE STORY LINE ON YOUR OWN.  ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VE READ THIS YEAR.  AS THE CHILDREN MATURE INTO THEIR TEENAGE YEARS THE HORRORS OF WAR PLACE TREMENDOUS ON STRESSES ON THEM.
A multi-layered novel that is an excellent read. Beautifully written this book is a historical novel with themes of science vs superstition, art, literary analogies, interplay of relationships, a mystery to be solved, but it reads effortlessly. Different characters make different moral choices under the duress of fascism and war - from courageous to cowardice to complicit indifference. I found it to be a moving book with sadness but hopeful, too. One of the best books I have read this year.
Unique reflexions of souls have rarely found their way to paper as they have in this novel. Never skipping a single sentence or words I was swept by the simple and artful storytelling. Anthony Doerr is truly a gifted writer. My time was well used reading this novel. I waited three weeks until reading the Shell Collector after reading this novel..... I am so happy to have found this book. I can give only one advice... buy it, read it, savoir it and I promise you will read it mire than omce.
I can't imagine how this book could be better.  The characters are genuine, flawed, loving, believable . . . I cared so much about what happened to them.  The level of detail is astonishing; the author must have spent years researching, yet you don't even think about that when you're reading it.<br/><br/>You just want to know what happens next, you cheer or cry as each character develops and hope so passionately for a happy ending.<br/><br/>This is not a book anyone will easily forget.
Excellent book I couldn't put it down. I was a 10 yr. old French girl in Vermillion Parish Louisiana<br/>My Grandfather would read to me The New Orleans Times Picyune as we followed the progress of WW11. I am almost 80 yrs. old. WW11 consumed my childhood. As an adult I lived in Scotland my husband worked in oil industry.  We have traveled throughout Germany and France. I was in St Mailo 3 years ago. This book is on my Kindle. I want to read it again. Joyce Enderle - muzzyenderle@cox.net.
This is an incredible story - light is themed from the coal mines in Germany pre-WWII to the French town on the Normandy coast during German occupation and D-Day.  Also included is the very real description of how a blind girl manages her life and how she "sees"  that everything has a color.  You could also call the radio waves that predominate in the story a form of light.<br/>But more than light, the weaving of experiences accentuates the brutality of war and how to survive it.
It's rare to find a book about World War II not written about the atrocities of the war camps.  This book is actually written from the point of view of the innocents loyal to their country and yet caught up in a war they don't understand and don't want to be in.  It's about the everyday person living in Germany and France forced to go through a war going on all around them and just trying to survive.  It's written beautifully.  Character development is incredible.  I couldn't put it down.
A remarkable novel which made me interested in reading more by Mr. Doerr.  In his book he combines two characters, a young blind girl and a young German orphan and we follow these two characters from the late 1930's to particularly World War II.  Mr. Doerr has a very descriptive style of writing that puts the reader at the scenes of the story.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes European (French St. Malo) sites  and World War II history.  It kept my interest from beginning to end.
I have a few books I have read that have a profound effect on me and the way I see life.  This is one of those books.  I loved the story and how the characters entwined was very clever.  I expected the usual story that he would be a German soldier caught up in the cruelties of war, and that when he met her, a wonderful, but blind girl who would change him and they would fall in love.  But, the story is deeper than that.  This is one of few books I recommend reading, and I think I'll feel it's effects on me for a long time. Should be a must read.
Anthony Doerr takes the reader right along with the characters in their experiences. His clear prose makes it is one of the most real novels I have read, anytime. To have lived through the era the novel covers adds to the appeal.<br/>The inclusion of characters from both sides of the conflict erases the conflict entirely, and the reader is compelled to sympathize with each of them. The several decades of the action brings conclusion to the story for the reader. A very satisfying read.
All The Lights We Cannot See deserves all the stars available. In countless ways the storylines of this book go against clichés. The characters, places and situations weave wondrously around but not always side by side or in linear order. We get a sense of capture in the world of a French girl, a German boy and his sister as they move and grow up among adults in the years leading to World War II and beyond. My first time reading was the Kindle version but I will own this book as well.
I give 4 stars to lots of  books but not many 5s.  This book deserves all the raves and awards.  The author's ability to bring the reader into the emotional world of each character is incredible. Such a beautiful read that I went slowly, giving myself time to think about all the things I was learning and feeling as I went.  How amazing to read a story set during WWII in which the war was not the main character, in which daily events were more important than what happened at the end.
France and Germany WWII.  14 year old blind Marie; whose doting father recreates their Parisian neighborhood by building a miniature wooden city for her, and 14 year old Werner, raised in a German orphanage by a caring woman who allows his love of radios and technology to grow and develop until his reputation is made known to the Nazi hierarchy.  Two innocent adolescents who grow up too quickly as Germany tramples across France. Their paths cross briefly in a life-changing meeting.
This is a wonderful novel! It is extremely well written and easy to read. Those with a husband, children and grandchildren who are inquisitive and mechanically inclined will relate to Werner, a young boy in an orphanage who finds broken items in the trash and makes them work. This novel has two ongoing different stories, but Anthony Doerr brings the two stories together. What a talent! This deserves the title of Best Book of the Year and is at the top of my list of favorite books.
A book that shows the horror of war but the strength of a young girl as she strives to survive under horrific conditions. As a child who was evacuated from the city and the bombing in WWII England I can again remember the fear and hunger, the gradual disappearance of all you have held dear.  I pray that we will never see the like of this again while realizing that in many parts of the world it continues. A well written and enlightening story woven within the deprivations of war.
Granted, it's only July, but it's my "book of the year" so far.
All the Light We Cannot See is excellently written and interesting. The book is unusual (as related by other reviewers) in that it alternates between the main characters continually in short chapters, and alternates between the present and the past. These elements to the form of the story may be disconcerting/confusing to some, but for me they were a welcome change of format. Overall, this is one of the best fiction books that I've read in awhile, and will recommend to friends.
I don't usually like books about WWII but this one is written exceptionally well.  The characters are beautifully drawn, complex human beings on both sides that we end up caring about.  However, it would not have been an accurate portrayal had he not included certain characters, mostly German men of the time, who are totally self-serving and truly evil in intent.  The short, vivid chapters keep the story moving back and forth through time but easy to follow. A wonderful read!!
This book held my attention from beginning to end.  Sometimes the cruelty expressed in this WWII novel made it painful to read, and I even skimmed over a few passages.  But the book delved into the characters and expressed reasons for their actions.  It was a little unusual in having a blind girl as one of the major characters, but Marie-Laure was handled brilliantly and was someone you always wanted to know better.  I am recommending this book to my next years Book Club list.
I do recognize  that this is a beautifully written story, deserving of 5 stars. I have given it four primarily because I found it very disturbing. It sheds a light on some of the horror and senseless cruelty of World War 2.  The story primarily shifts back and forth between the two main characters, alternating chapters between a German boy and a French girl for most of the book.  I found it very sad and extremely haunting.  I am still haunted by it, long after it is finished.
What an amazing book! Poignant and yet unsentimental. What I loved was that each of the characters (even the minor ones) had so much depth and were so rich in detail. The author really captures the period in history (the Second World War) and brings to life how each of the characters does his/her best to survive in the terrifying circumstances of war. The menace in the environment grows subtly as the book and the war progresses. Beautifully nuanced and beautifully written!
Loved this book, hated to have it end...I wanted it to go on and on...
I cannot say enough good things about this book. It's a touching story full of extraordinarily beautiful language. I sometimes don't care for books that go back and forth between story lines and in time, but it worked terrifically in this book. The book presents thought-provoking questions about life, death, and destiny--how much control do we really have? I read it on my Kindle; I only wish I had gotten the print version so that I could put it into someone else's hands.
Our book club picked this book for our March selection and at the time I thought, "Another WWII book. Great."  But this was insightful, touching, and SO well written. How can you not love this sentence: "Levitte the perfumer is flabby and plump, basted in his own self-importance." The author seemed to know where to draw the line for it to be sad, but not too sad, sometimes brutal, but not too brutal. I came away with new understanding and a warmer heart.
Doer presents us with portraits of two protagonists, allowing us to view the events of World War II from completely different perspectives.  The style of brief chapters alternating between the two points of view make for an easy, compelling read.  The male character, Werner, is a tragic hero in the classical sense.  Marie-laure, the female, is a heroine of exceptional virtue.  Their story will stay with me.  Some readers may have some difficulty following the timeline.
One of the very best books I have seen in many years, so well written, touching  !!!!<br/>Makes me realize what our dutch families have gone through as well during the German occupation, to try to feed their families and lose their freedoms. My husband and his brother helped save many Jewish people, by hiding them and made sure the families they stayed with had enough food stamps to provide for them. We should be all keep telling these stories to the younger generatio
This is easily the best book I've read in a decade. Choose the book you read after All the Light We Cannot See carefully, as the next book will pale in comparison to Anthony Doerr's carefully crafted, sparse and beautiful prose. This book does what all good books should do - elevate your interaction with the English language, in a way that is neither obvious, nor pretentious. Additionally, the story and the characters were enrapturing. I didn't want this book to end.
When I first began the book, I could only read a few pages at a time because the details of man's inhumanity to man were overpowering me. I probably would have quit reading after the first few chapters and certainly by the stories of the school if I weren't reading for my book club.  Once I became invested in the characters, however, I found the story compelling.  This is a story of brokenness and, therefore, difficult to enjoy.  A very well written historical novel.
One of the most riveting books I've read.<br/>I couldn't put it down. A heart wrenching story. A very poignant reminder of a horrible time in history, that is still happening today.  Beautifully written. I loved the characters and was pleased with the happy ending. I detested what happened to Frederick, Werner and all the people caught up in Hitler's<br/>scheme. I would recommend for high school through adults. I believe it wood be a difficult read for JV readers.
I've been to St Milo and was so excited to read of its history.  I was thoroughly engrossed in the setting, the characters and the setting.  Some would feel that the story dragged a little but I felt it emphasized the tedious length and frustrations of the war.  The caves and tunnels were amazing but hard to realize so close to the ocean.  I had just read 'The Boys in the Boat' on the German Olympics so the overall German hubris was emphasized.  I really enjoyed it.
Very well and engagingly written, with absorbing character development and accurate history.  Gives us a convincing portrayal of what it must have been like to live through some of the European experiences of WWII.  My only complaint would be that the final few chapters, where Doerr seems compelled to draw all the character arcs into neat packages, actually detract from the overall experience.  The story would more satisfyingly have ended with Werner's final scene.
Anthony Doerr has created a story richly layered through the sight of a blind girl during the Second World War. This is a story not to be rushed through but experienced through all of the senses slowly, although impossible not to race through the pages. I recommend going back and reading again as the young girl did with her books. Anyone who is interested in history, biology, radios, French food, young people, wise old people......dig in. This is a wonderful book.
I felt immersed in the book until the last few chapters.  Then it just sort of fell apart and I felt disconnected from the characters and disappointed.  If I would have known it was going to end FLAT, I probably wouldn't have read it.  The rest of the book is actually really good.  The story line just builds and builds with nothing at the end.  Sort of like that TV show lost, where you keep watching waiting for something to happen at the end and then it doesn't.
I gave this book to my fifteen year old grand daughter for Christmas based on the Amazon description.  I recently got it for myself and realize I made a big mistake with the Christmas gift.  One really should have a basic knowledge of European geography and WW II history to fully grasp the unfolding plot.  I enjoyed the story, however I found the author's moving back and forth in time a bit difficult to sort out.  Also, the ending was an unexpected surprise .
A magnificent book that, by describing the occurrences in the daily lives of people affected, brings to memory the awful behaviors that were practiced in Nazism.  This is a book that beautifully relates how serial invasions by German forces, followed by rescue of the populace, impacted the full lives of all participants whether victim or perpetrator. I often caught my breath when reminded of the activities underway and the ability of the populace to cope.
I know this book won a Pulitzer Prize and I'm sure it was because it is so well written with an unbelievable vocabulary and sentence/paragraph construction.  And thinking about WWII from the viewpoint of young teens was refreshing, it didn't change the ugliness of the Nazi campaign nor the beauty of those who resist!  I read this book as part of a book club, but probably would never have chosen to read it on my own as I'm not one for historical fiction.
I am a retired veteran from the Army signal corps and found timeless traits that I related to in Werner Pfennig's character. For someone usually resistant to trauma stories of the Nazi regime, because it was evil, the book defied time and made WWII vividly relatable to the present. I agree strongly with one of it's themes where sometimes what looks to be bravery is really action taken in a do or die situation. I didn't expect to be impressed but the more I read the more being impressed snuck up on me.
A wrenching tale of the struggles and sacrifices on all sides of the conflict, some unbelievably heartbreaking.  How did the survivors manage, and why were some singled out for death or fates even worse?  What were the motivations of those impacted by war, and what sustained them during the hardest times, including the soldiers, many of whom were only children themselves.  Finally, how did it affect the survivors, decades later.  Long, but interesting.
I loved this book. The chapters are short and change location and timeframe, so the book moves quickly. It does a great job at creating care for and interest in the characters, so you feel vested in their outcomes and respond emotionally to the events that unfold. I wouldn't say that the plot was "full of surprises" because it is set in World War II France and Germany, so you expect sadness and difficulty, but some of them were gut-wrenching.
I fell in love with the rich, three dimensional characters _and of course the plot was riveting. My only reason for.4 stars_- would really give it 4.5, is that at times mid book it dragged. I realize the background had to be developed 're Werner and his schooling- but for me it was tedious and I almost stopped 'reading the book- I put it down for over a week-but was so glad I pushed through- as it developed beautifully.  I highly recommend this book.
Beautiful writing, but the characters just didn't gel for me. I found the young blind girl to have insights that just didn't ring true for her age and experience. I had been looking forward to this book after reading all of the glowing reviews, but in the end I didn't even bother to finish it because I never felt drawn into the story. It's hard to believe this book won the Pulitzer, but I guess the reading public never tires of reading WWII fiction.
For someone of my age who was a little girl during WWII I am fascinated by the courage and intrigue of the happenings that took place in Europe during these years.  It was especially interesting on how a blind young girl could manage all the difficulties of the times.  And it was especially interesting that the book gives it to you from both sides of these young lives.  Werner was truly a good young man with deep seated feelings for what was happening in his country.  I recommend the book highly.
What an amazing storyteller! While reading the story, one can't help but feel amazed that the story is not a true story of a blind girl and an orphan boy! The descriptions are riveting and the emotional nuances are definitely believable.<br/><br/>The novel takes place during WWII. Although not a WW buff or historian, because of the author's expert handling of the English language, the reader is immediately mesmerized and enveloped into the story.
A great story on so many levels! The backstory  is compelling and the other just keeps building in tension as well as symbolism! Such  a terrific topic for debate ? Is survival  our most important  instinct or a life well lived according to  our moral concienseore important ? This story has it all!!! I loved it and haven't been able to read anything else in a week as I keep thinking of the characters in this book and the choices  they made! Bravo!!
I found this book slow to start, and the only reason I didn't give up on it at first was because it was my book club's selection. Glad I persevered. Slowly but steadily, the plot drew me in. A horrific, heavy topic. As a child of Holocaust survivors, at times I wanted to turn away, but Doerr's writing kept my head just above the waves. And his characters showed me that instead of drowning in pain, one can swim through it. Thank you, Anthony Doerr.
This ranks as my 2nd all-time favorite book.  Riveting.  You simply cannot put it down and want desperately to know what is going to happen to these characters we love.  I highly recommend this book.  My husband almost never reads fiction, but he, too, cannot put it down.  It's everything you want in a book and more...plus you learn so much.  This author is a brilliant writer and storyteller.  I've gone online already and ordered his other books.
An excellent well written book. I highly recommended it to friends
Beautiful well written and thoughtful. Should be best of the year.
I enjoyed the first 60% of this book immensely and will read that portion again in the future - probably many times.  It was an exquisite experience.  The characters intrigued me, as did the circumstances they faced.  And the writing itself is GORGEOUS.  However, the last 40% of the book took a dive into some terrible situations and events that I won't want to revisit.  I found the end result for almost all characters to be very disappointing.
One of the best books I've ever read! Brilliant! Poignant and unforgettable. A tour de force! I'm a historian and am very familiar with this period (World War II) and I try to read every book--non-fiction and fiction--which deals with this war and the forces leading up to it. Yet I was still unprepared for the beauty of the language and the treatment of this subject through the lens of a blind teenage French girl and an orphaned, 20 year old German soldier with a gift for math and physics.
This book was satisfying on many levels!<br/>1. The story was VERY intriguing.<br/>2. Details were carefully woven throughout to enhance the story, keeping me interested. Brilliant!<br/>3. It was written with a sense of grace and poetry that made every page not only easy to read, but very pleasant to read as well (even the gritty parts). I savored every page!<br/>This is easily one of the best books I've ever read by a modern-day author.
This guy can write.  Anthony Doerr laced together two magnificently gripping stories so brilliantly it appeared effortless. I hardly felt like I was reading because the story pulled me through to the next page along with my heart.  The end, while it wasn't what I expected, (and I loved that) released me gently from the books embrace leaving me completely fulfilled.  I immediately went back to Amazon to download another Anthony Doerr book.
I loved this book for many reasons.  It was an unusual story of WWII in that it was told only  as it impacted the lives of the two main characters, a French girl and a German boy.  The writing was exquisite with descriptions that made me feel, hear. see. taste and smell whatever the characters were experiencing.  Mostly I loved this book because of the many wonderful characters whom I met, came to care deeply about and will never forget.
You do not offer enough stars!  Intuitively wonderful on many levels.  The assurance  and healing powers of certain sounds like listening to a person reading out loud or hearing universally famous pieces of music surpass politics!  The BOOK THIEF also recalls describes this calming magic of reading aloud in the midst of chaos.  Just in passing, I will never walk along the street and go by one storm drain without looking for the next one!
I had heard this book was wonderful from so many soures.....but it was horribly boring. I found the timeline confusing because the author jumps back and forth so often and in such short bursts. However the worst part was there seemed no point to the story. There is hardly any dialogue.....just endless descriptions that left me exhausted and irritated....just get on with the story! The two characters meet ever so briefly and I expected the story to pick up at this point but sadly it did not. The story line about the stone was silly and unbelievable. Everythimg about this book was depressing....maybe that was the author's point. I could never get invested in the characters and was extremely disappointed. After reading this book I felt like I had wasted my money and many hours of my life.
The writing was like poetry-the prose so descriptive.  In our book club discussion we questioned  Werner's decisions during the war. Would we have done things differently. We thought the radio was like a character in a book.  It transposed the characters so they could escape, if only momentarily, the horrors of war. There were several characters that I would like to have known better.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know..
This is a beautifully engaging novel which follows the lives of two young people, one a blind French girl, the other a bright orphaned German boy during the rise of World War II.  This sentence makes it sound rather sappy, which it is not. It is also offers a rare perspective on the impact of what we have long considered a good war on the lives of civilians and reluctant combatants.  This is one of the best novels I've read this year.
This is a magnificent story. It starts out a bit slow as you try to follow the story line, but grows into engulfing magnificence. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to read a wonderful book, providing a very different perspective on World War II than many other books one comes across. I want to read it again as there are so many interlocking details that I'm still making the connection between. It is a true literary masterpiece!
It could have been a more enjoyable read as stories set in World War II Europe are always interesting to me.  But there was too much jumping back and forth in time lines and the whole book was dragged out way too long.  It was more like the author was showing off his command of English vocabulary, describing the bombing and explotion in a thousand different ways.  For me, it became exhausting and boring half way through the book .
This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. The character development from the very first page encourages you to pay close attention to each and every detail that surrounds and creates this interesting, intriguing, emotional story. Mr. Doerr's ability to allow the reader to reach into each character's life is simply amazing and allows you to feel as if you know each of them - and their trials - personally. Enjoy it!
It took me a little while to get into the characters of the book and to realize how they were all linked together - almost like a mystery. I really enjoyed the characterization and the events of the war that so influenced their lives. There were so many interesting aspects especially with the weakness of some of the characters. I would definitely recommend it especially if you enjoy historical fiction with great characterization.
I loved this book. The descriptions and story unfolded beautifully. Each character played an important role and their thoughts, feelings, and experiences were vividly described. It felt like I was there. Having read several WWII books recently, this only added to my fascination with how people coped and survived thru such difficult times. There are many unsung heroes, and discovering their stories in fiction in truly a delight.
Until I read this, I have not felt any desire to re-read a book, since there are too many others books awaiting my attention.  But I enjoyed this so much, on so many levels, that I am now reading it for the third time!  A multiple layered story, it appeals to so many emotions, and is beautifully written with such insight, backgrounded by excellent knowledge and research.  Congratulations Anthony Doerr.  I look forward to more.
This is a wonderful novel.  It was chosen as a selection for our book group.  Initially I had thought it could be another overworked WWII story and I was not looking forward to reading it.  I had also been concerned that the blind girl angle might be a bit maudlin. Bu t turns out that this is one of the best anti-war novels I have ever read.  Wonderful characters and descriptions, especially of St. Malo.  Beautifully written!
I was sorry to come to the end of this lyrical journey through human relationships which were stained to tragic extremes during the German occupation of France.  Doerr has an unusual approach to the seamless weaving of the dream world and the real world, with blurring of those boundaries throughout the book, but manages to make that work beautifully, perhaps because he never strays very far from the resonant theme of love...
This is not a book to be read on Kindle.  I would have preferred to have read the hard copy because it was  too laborious<br/>going back and forth, as I  had to do with this book,  because of the way the work is structured.  This is not meant to<br/>be a criticism,  as the author  succeeded in weaving  together  the humanity, or in some cases the non-humanity, of the characters  within<br/>the brutal history of the time.
This was not only a great historical novel, but the characters were very well defined. There was a lot of switching between stories until everyone came together in one section, but the switches were easy to follow. The ending seemed believable, moving into the world beyond the original story with an easy transition. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, the story stayed in my mind even after the book was finished. Great writing.
If I could only read one book this year, this would be the book. 10 years in the writing, Anthony Doerr has produced a work of fiction filled with eloquent prose, complex and developed characters that are brave, kind and filled with courage. It is a tale of a father's love for his daughter, friendship between unlikely people and how one overcomes life's obstacles in the face of war and adversity. Don't pass this book by.
I rarely read fiction.  My leisure reading time is so limited that I fear I will regret having invested my valuable time when I finish a piece of modern fiction.  In this case, a friend talked so much about the book that I decided to take a chance.  The reviews were accurate.  The prose is indeed beautifully written - a joy to read.  And the story was completely engaging, poignant and worth every minute spent reading it.
Probably the most moving, humane picture of the war in Europe from "everyman's" point of view.  I loved it.  I cried for the German boys and the French girls and the Jewish suffering and for my father who operated a radio in one of the US airplanes that evacuated planeloads of injured of all nations to inadequate hospital tents.  All the victims.  All the heroes.  Thank you, Mister Doerr, for a lovely experience.
The author's imagery is beautiful and the similes and metaphors are beautiful. The reader "sees" as Marie-Laure "sees" as told through the vivid descriptions. The book intrigued me and I found myself reading quickly to discover the connection between Marie-Laure and Werner. However, the story seemed to drag endlessly and I had to stop reading it and read another book in between before I could finish it.
I was not at all attracted by the description of this book -- World War II, blind French girl, German soldier -- but it turned out to be one of the most beautiful books I have read in some time.  The writing is lyrical, and the story is told so artfully that it is almost impossible to put it down.  And despite all the brutality, degradation, and horror of war, the reading experience is at once affirming and reassuring.
I'm a WWII history major and actually studied abroad in the cities mentioned in the story.  Loved how accurate the information and description of the cities and their surroundings were.  As every war novel and historical fiction book related to World War 2 this was very sad but loved the engagement and complexity of the story.  Definitely agree that this is one of the top novels that everyone should read this year. :)
Exquisitely written and a joy to read.  All the Light gently unfolds and draws the reader into a richly woven story set in an interesting time and place.  The book effortlessly floats between characters, countries and time at an unhurried pace that is steeped in detail yet leaves much unsaid.  It's this restrained light touch that makes the writing such a joy to experience and the story so special to discover.
Could not put this book down!  I enjoyed it immensely and plan to read other books written by Anthony Doerr. The way the author described everything "seen" by the little girl was amazing and the angst of the German soldier was so palpable. Tears came during the last few pages and I felt that I had witnessed a sliver of the horrors of the war through the lives of these two young people. Excellent story!
Brilliant but brutal; hard to read, hard to put down. I was a little girl during WW II and saw the black and white newsreels every week at the movies. This vivid novel made me feel the devastating fear of being at war; the hunger, the cold, the suspicion. All these things are even now being felt by the people at war in the Middle East.  Can we never learn? Whatever it takes to bring world peace, let us do it.
Doer's novel on WW two told through the lives of German children Werner Pfennig  technical genius, Jutta his sister, and the blind and brilliant Marie-Lauren LeBlanc show a different perspective on this horrific and historical time. The role the played in the war was significant and new to me. I hated losing Werner and still wonder what happened to the diamond (jewel). Thank you Mr. Doer for a wonderful book.
This is a great, meaningful, inspiring book. You will be transported to a world past and your heart will ache with the suffering of the characters. This book offers a genuine experience of empathy for those who experienced the turmoil of World War II, yet it's so much more. The wonders of nature, the love of family, the bravery of those who lived through these times, the wonder of it all! Do read this book!
Since WW II books are a topic I really look forward to reading, I thought I would enjoy this book.  It also had the aspect of following a few characters through the book's story.  However, jumping back and forth in time and extremely short chapters created a huge discord for me.  Those 2  issues so affected  following the stories of each character for me that I kept thinking it will get better.  It did not.
When the final page was read and the book closed for the last time, I felt a bittersweetness that I have not felt with many books in the past. I willingly drew out the process of reading, for this book was conjured in my head as more of an HBO hit series than words on pages. You could take the driest sentence of this masterpiece and wring from it tubs worth of emotion and depth. Absolutely phenomenal book.
I loved the prose of this book, as well as the potential of the two young lives, destined to meet one day.  Unfortunately the short chapters that alternately followed the young German boy and the young blind French girl during World War Two made the book disjointed.  The author does a great job of humanizing a horrible period of time, and yet the flow and certain turns of fate left something to be desired.
The storyline and characters were interesting and I found myself invested in what happened to them. The difference between this book and one I would have given five stars is that I so frequently had to mentally readjust to time, place, age and situation that I was hoping for the book to end soon. There was  just too much mental gymnastics required for me to truly lose myself in the story as I wanted to.
Beautifully written this lyrical story follows the invisible threads of light connecting two gifted young adults during ww2. One a German boy orphan with a passion and talent for radios and the other the sensitive blind french girl. The atmosphere created by the intense and detailed descriptions of not just the story but also the inner life of all the finely drawn characters is truly beyond the norm.
I loved this book because the story itself was so unique and intriguing.  A definite page turner.  Sometimes I got lost when the time frames changed, but I happily plowed through.  The author has a wonderful imagination and wrote a story both authentic and realistic.  The characters were so engaging, I wanted to just jump into the story and help them out! Like Cutting For Stone, I just didn't want it to end.  Hurray for Anthony Doerr!
Interesting perspectives about life and war that I hadn't considered previously - what the life of a young, German soldier could have been coming of age during the rise of Hitler and how a blind girl could have survived during that time.  Need to pay careful attention to the dates as they flipped forward and back, sometime only by a few months.  That was a little confusing but enjoyable nonetheless.
"All the Light We Cannot See" was possibly the best piece of  writing I have ever read.<br/>Doerr's choice of verbs were so artful, that they made me want to take up writing again, as a hobby.<br/>His characters are vivid. He makes you care about them, makes you want to know what they feel,<br/>makes you want to know how they will survive. Read the first four pages and you will be hooked.
This is Doerr at the pinnacle of his writing.  The stories in Memory Wall gave one the feeling of experiencing lifetimes.  This novel brings the ocean, sea shells and all of nature he so loves through the Paris Museum of Natural History, the walled city of St. Malo and the wonderous insights of a blind girl as WWII descends upon Europe.  This book left me ful of sadness, joy but most of all wonder.
Thinking in the beginning this was the usual World War 11 war story. I was delightfully surprised to find this was an emotional account of the lives of many people.  the main character being a blind French girl who learns about the danger and the beauty of life behind her tapping cane.  It is actually a love story told within the brutal confines of war ravaged Europe.  I liked this book very much.
This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The author is a wordsmith who is able to create a beautiful story with an amazing use of language, where the reader not only can feel and hear their environments through their senses, but can be part of the amazing journey that this story takes you on. What a beautiful gift this story was to me, and to the other members of our book club.
I'm not too free with my five star ratings but this book really held me in its spell the whole way through. Its a great story but told in such an inventive way. It will remind you sometimes of poetry (maybe even going a little bit overboard) but when its time to talk about harsh facts and sad lives of the people whom you really care about, you really start to feel its power. Highly recommend.
I loved the author's use of the English language.  It's a pleasure to read.  Great story.  The only thing that is a half-way negative is that the story jumps from one time line to another, often chapter to chapter.  So it is a little difficult to keep up with which year the narrative is taking place.  But each chapter is dated, so just watch for that before you begin.  I recommend the book.
I love, love , love this novel. I was hooked from the beginning and barely stopped to sleep. I felt it was a great historical novel along with being realistic. I have to admit the WWII historical fictions have become a new favorite of mine, but this author made me  feel empathy for all involved which for I think is incredible. I didn't skip or skim any paragraphs and I respected the ending,
I am reading it twice=almost finished the second go-round.  There are so many details of the structure that weren't evident the first time. . .and I love the ways foreshadowing and suspense work when the times in the novel get rearranged and one incident bleeds into the next.  So happy that the characters defy cliches, and are not helpless in confronting war and its handmaiden, propaganda.
Beautifully written. The language and waving in of images of light and darkness both external and within are beautifully provoking. A longing for the world we have yet to see that moves beyond fear and domination and greed tugs at the reader and teases as to whether or not the characters through whom we travel into life's depths will come to know and inhabit that light filled unseen world.
I enjoyed this book. I must say after hearing mixed reviews I was skeptical about it, but I thought the main characters were well developed and "real", and it was a different telling of WWII for me. A different perspective was presented, and there was heart and compassion shown.  I liked that the author completed the story and characters, and I didn't feel like I was left with questions,
STUNNING WORK OF LITERATURE.  This is not just a story.  It is beautiful literary art to be slowly savored.  The ending is perfection.<br/><br/>Be sure to pay attention to the dates in the beginning of the book.  I didn't do so and had to turn back several times to reorient myself.  Once you get used to the switching among characters and changing times it is easy to flow along with the book.
I read great reviews of this book which is why I bought it. I kept hoping it would get better. But for me it did not. It was just had a confusing shift back and forth and seems to be leading to a climactic conclusion which frankly never came.  The chapters were short and easy to read but over all it took me a long time to get through this book and ultimately it was a disappointment.
I'm going to be honest, reading anything that has to do with war or history makes me feel like I'm in school and it's the summer. I don't wanna feel that way. But let me tell you, this novel was AMAZING. I want to read it again and again. It's such a beautifully well-written story and it crushes your heart in both good and bad ways. I love it. Please read. You won't be disappointed.
This is an exceptional book wherein the author parallells the lives of two young people at the advent of WWII.  He is German with a talent for applied science; she is a blind french girl struggling to survive German occupation and to self-educate herself.  Eventually their lives intersect briefly.  The characters and the events in this highly believable book are spell binding.  It is more than a page turner.  It captures the reader.
Yes just another of the 4000+ reviews.  Mine is short.  All the LIGHT... touches the soul.  It's energy is within me  and will dwell there for a LONG time.  It becomes a part of your "knowing-ness."  Doerr's subtle way of presenting life at one of the worst times without beating us over the head is a gift.  I cannot remember a book affecting me so much so quietly.
The vivid descriptions, characters that I really cared about, good historical detail even in some of the parts that may not have been completely accurate, and a unique structure that made me want to keep reading. I didn't know where it was going or how the writer was going to get there. The perspectives on WWII were fresh for a historical novel that was not predictable.
A wonderfully written and inspirational story of life and hardships during World War II in Europe.  It is told from the perspective of a young German boy entrenched in the Hitler Youth movement and a young, blind French girl whose lives are intertwined for many years.  The book depicts the worst and the best of the human condition.  In my opinion, it is Pulitzer worthy.
This book was so beautifully written, it was almost like reading poetry!!!  Besides the story was compelling!!!  Of course the historical perspective, was very interesting from the German point of view.  The goodness of the characters came through all the horrors and destruction brought by the war.  I consider this a must read, for anyone who loves a well-written story.
I picked this book for my book club, hoping to find a great summer read (fiction) that was a page turner.  So beautifully written and soulful.<br/><br/>Only downside- There were parts of the story that lost me, because it was not perfectly chronological...<br/><br/>One of the best books I've read in a long time, I only hope my other book club members feel the same.
I truly enjoyed this story.  The author was able to bring me to the locales and feel the pain, strength and struggle of each character.  Didn't know about the World War II experience in Saint Malo, France. Reading about war and suffering is hard but so necessary for us to understand that evil exists, and can be fought by even the most unlikely person, and least likely.
This is by far the best book I have read in years. I read at least a book a week and this was just absolutely beautiful. The language is gorgeous. I didn't think anyone wrote like this anymore. While I may not have agreed or liked every plot point, overall I can't wait to read it again. I want to sit and dissect it, think about the themes, the messages, the insights.
One of the best books I have ever read. The author is a master at putting words together to create pure magic for the reader. This is NOT just another story set during WWII, but, instead, WWII is the backdrop (the magician's hat) from which our author (the magician) pulls out characters who are unforgettable and deeply inspiring. Pulitzer Prize writing at its finest!
This book is well written but not that exciting.  Doerr tells parallel stories and you keep waiting for them to merge.  The finally do at the end and it's kind of a disappointment when they do.  The book is more an elegy then a thriller.  It's an interesting story of what life was like for an ordinary German or French teenager during WW2 but the plot never takes off.
This book is fantastic! It focuses on two main characters throughout the story. It gives vivid descriptions which helps you feel like you are walking along with them. There are many subplots throughout this book which keeps it very interesting, I could not put it down until I was finished reading. I highly recommend and look forward to reading more from this author!
I would have given 5 stars because the story was beautifully written and spellbinding, and, being a war story, heartwrenching and tragic. But the fascinating stories of Werner and Marie-Laure, and the priceless diamond, don't ever come to a satisfying conclusion. It's like the author wove all these magical threads that just did not create the cloth I was hoping for.
An absolutely brilliant book and written with such beauty and tenderness. The character development makes this book more about coming of age than about WWII and its atrocities. I loved it so much that I decided to go back and read it again to really soak in all of the details that I'm sure I missed the first time around. Truly a gifted writer and an exquisite novel.
I seldom grant a five star review, but this book easily deserves it. I don't know when I have read any piece of work more richly descriptive. I found that I wanted to absorb every word, and wanted to learn the fate of each character, understanding that such knowledge would come with a price. That price, I knew, was the end of a superb and masterfully written story.
"Practically perfect in every way," to quote Mary Poppins.  No, I am not being coy.  I just loved the setting, the images and the language of this book.<br/>Historical fiction at its best, is how I describe Anthony Doerr's masterpiece " All the Light We Cannot See."<br/>To see a longer review, check out my book review blog www.BESTBOOKSBYBETH.com
Once you are wrapped up into characters and the climax is building you anticipate the endings for the bad (yet inherently good) characters. .and then the story jumps decades and the author makes a haphazard attempt to end the story. Why go through so much effort building characters only to end with no meaning.<br/>Enjoy the journey, the destination..not so much.
The characters are wonderfully developed, the writing is very lyrical and this whole novel really flows together.  There are dark times throughout the book but ultimately the intensely likeable main characters shine and captivate on each page.<br/><br/>This is the best I have read in quite a while.  I will be reading more of Anthony Doerr's work in the future.
with over 15k reviews here suffice it to say, I agree - what a read. I bought it on audible to listen to while working, but after an hour or so I stopped and bought the "real" book instead, just to make it all last and to fully enjoy the ride. I've 20 pages to go and I'm saving them to enjoy with a nice meal and a good beer. Best book I've read in years!<br/>- update - Beautiful! weeks after finishing this I am still fully taken with it - the writing and the story amazed me. Thank you Mr. Doerr for your generosity of spirit, and your complete commitment to your craft - it shows, wondrously.
Unsure from reading the synopsis that I'd like this book, I nonetheless bought it and absolutely loved it. Each single little chapter is as gorgeous as a beautifully faceted diamond. It's miraculous how the writer gets inside a young blind girl's head and psyche -- and in a bygone era at that. Story, characters, writing -- it has it all. More, please, Mr. Doerr.
Very intriguing book from the WWII era.  I read it and immediately began re-reading it.  The story flashes back and forth from 1944 to 1940 and even to 1934.  It is well written and very believable. The characters are well developed.  There are basically two stories that are presented and then intertwined.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves WWII stories.
All the Light We Cannot See is an excellent book.  Anthony Doerr's writing is excellent.  His descriptions are so well written that you can picture each scene. His ability to move from one period in time to another is seamless and he does this for both of the main characters.  A very well written book that you will not want to put down.  I highly recommend it.
I suppose if you have not studied world war II, there is something to be gained by reading this and being exposed to horror s of Hitler.  There really was not much else in this book. The will to survive and the horror of blindly following is demonstrated.  For me, at age 73 , I know all of this stuff already.  I would rather read something that expands my mind
This book was captivating! I loved how it intertwined the lives of the characters, all from different backgrounds, nationalities and political persuasions and then wove all those lives together throughout the war to illustrate it's effect on everybody. This is a perspective that was unique and very effective inn its storytelling! Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
It took a few chapters to get into the rhythm of this story... but before long I could  not put it down.  The characters are well developed, the story woven between them moving, heart-wrenching, and beautifying crafted.  It is not a story of war, but of the connection between young lives, and the impact of war.  Powerfully told, I highly recommend this book.
Doerr created a cast of luminous magical characters against the back drop of one of the worst events of the last 75 years, World War II.  Like great works of art, the more you looked under the surface, the more the reader found.  The author used science in a lyrical way.  Some of his sentences were poetic.  It is a great work of art with much to think about.
This is one of the best books I have read in a long, long time.  The author writes in such a descriptive style that you can imagine being there, witnessing a very bleak period in the lives of German and French people.  The story goes back and forth between a young blind girl and a youth in the German army during World War II.  I highly recommend this book.
Great perspective with the two characters living the difficulties and horrors of WWII, one from the French side by a blind girl and the other from the German side from a very handy German boy.  Great characterizations of all the players on both sides.  Unusual and effective on a much written about war.  The "light" metaphor is subtle and pervasive.
I highly recommend this book.  I had decided not to read more WWII books, or books about the terrible things the Germans did to the Jews, but it was chosen by our book club so I had to read it, and I am so glad I did. It is extremely well written. Athough not a suspense, I couldn't stop reading until I could find out what was happening to the characters.
This is an incredible book. Beautifully written. I now feel like I have lived through the early 1940s in France. It was so realistic, so bleak and so painful to experience. I even know how it smelled. I also feel like I understand just a little of what it is to be blind. This falls into the category of great literature. It will stay with me a long time.
As fine a book as one could ever hope to read.  It is rare to find a novel with such an inticate plot, palpable suspense, and brilliant characterization all told in narrative voice that is pure poetry.  I never wanted this book to end.  It is one of those reads that become a significant part of your life experiences and shapes the way you think forever.
Anthony Doerr weaves a stunningly poignant accounting of World War II events seen through the eyes of children affected by the decisions of their respective countries, France and Germany.  His words are "prose like" and float in your thoughts providing you with insights to the insanity of war and the resiliency of the human spirit.  What a gem!
This was one of the most satisfying reads I have had in a long time. It's going to be hard for me to pick up the next book with enthusiasm. The writing is so smooth and enchanting, the characters so perfect and delightful, the plot and suspense so subtly weaved. Who knew I would be this interested in snails and radios waves? Thank-you - just beautiful!
The character development, the magical descriptive quality, the extraordinary story of two souls. One may be tempted to call these souls damaged by their circumstances but their intellect, courage, curiousity and character take them out of that realm. It is obvious that their trajectory will bring them together but nothing is lost in their individual development. Great read.
I like the authors use of language to create an empathetic portrayal of the characters. This ability is not displayed by many authors. It's a gift ; one which the author will be able to develop continuously. This is an interesting and humane story of people during the war on an individual level. How the events effected each person and how they adapted to changing situations.
A wonderful story about a German boy who is a radio genius and a blind French girl whose father makes models of the neighborhood houses so she can find her way around by feel.  This all happens before, during and after World War II.  They don't get even near each until near the end of the war and then are separated again but it is still a love story.
Didn't really like this book.  The author's writing however poetic and descriptive in style ends up being too convoluted, making it hard at times to follow the story line. In the beginning it was hard to follow the story when he went back and forth between two very different and seemingly unrelated characters.  The last 25% of the book was the best.
Fabulous novel! As engaging as any book I've read in years.  World War II is such a heartbreaking human event, it takes a gifted storyteller<br/>to craft a sympathetic tale of individuals caught on both sides of the conflict.  Doerr succeeds in doing precisely that.  This a book I'll appreciate<br/>reading a second time.<br/>.<br/><br/>.<br/>.
This book makes you really think about how fortunate we are to be living in a country without war.  It touches your soul and I could not put it down.<br/>It is no wonder that this book won the Pulitzer prize for fiction.  I continued to think about each character for days and weeks after I finished the book.  An amazing story well worth your time.
The story was compelling and especially in the beginning, it was hard to put the book down.  Very well written and full of interesting history.<br/><br/>The book seemed to drag on rather long, especially toward the end.  I had a feeling of relief that I was done rather than regret that the book was finished.  However, i would recommend this book.
Great book, great story. I see why this book is getting good reviews. It is intertwining stories of a young blind girl in France, an orphaned boy in Germany, a valuable gem, a radio and Europe during World War II. Doerr is a beautiful writer and develops his characters very well. I found the whole book to be moving, although parts made me very sad.
A fascinating story of youth and innocence and beauty in the midst of great struggle. It was interesting to get the story of WWII as it was experienced by these specific (fictional) characters. And the setting in Paris and throughout France added charm and life to an otherwise oppressive story. An easy and enjoyable read, to say the least.
I'm telling everyone I know about this book!  The characters are beautifully developed and the human connection is strong.  My knowledge of WW2 is limited to reminiscence of my late father, a Marine stationed in the South Pacific, and a few paragraphs about the Resistance in history books.  I found the story about the French Resistance very interesting and compelling. The history came to life for me as did the personal struggles and growth of Werner and Marie-Laure.  I felt as if I was there with them - the author did a great job!
Fascinating story with many suspenseful twists and turns.  It keeps going and going, surprising the reader and drawing him deeper into the story.  Wonderful characters!
Phenomenal book.  It was a lilttle hard to get into, but any other book I have read since, pales by comparison.
This is the best book I have written in a while.  This writer is up there with Kate Morton and Daniel Silva, two of my top ten authors.  You have to pay attention, but there is so much to experience along with the characters in this book.  I just finished this book and there is a little letdown now that it's over.  I will definitely read his other books.  Do not miss the opportunity to enjoy writing at its best!
It opens your eyes to the blind.<br/>Beautiful, emotional and well written.<br/>A story of what really matters. Life is so previous and beautiful
I was pleasantly surprised to find out the book was mostly set in St. Malo, France.  (My son and I had visited there a few years ago.)  I loved the in -depth feelings and personalities of the two main characters, who were just children caught up in a terrible war.  This was a very good read.
Such an interesting perspective of the war and our perspective of war winners, losers and motivation and desires. Eye opening, great read!
Doerr leads us blindly into a tale of devotion, heartache and wonder not told before.<br/>Unexpected twists and surprises tempted and drove this reader to crave the next chapters.
This is a wonderful story.  The writing is beautiful. The characters are compelling. It is a future classic to be read for many years to come.
A beautiful narrative. Sensitive yet non judgemental; especially with a difficult subject. Loved it.
This is a spectacular novel. Poetically written. We wait eagerly to see what happens to the separate stories of the main characters. It tells an old story of war in a new way by focusing in on a few individuals.The metaphors of blindness and sight are carried off beautifually
When I thought the world didn't need any more WWII novels about loss and survivors, when I thought all that should be said had been said, along came this beautiful book.<br/><br/>The writing and the characters are wonderful and had depth.  I even had sympathy for a young German soldier, seeing the world through his eyes.  I couldn't see the world through Marie-Laure's eyes because she was blind, but her descriptions of sounds, of what she noticed that most of us do not, was lyrical.<br/><br/>There are orphans and good fathers, traitors, and a whole cast of characters that were occasionally hard to keep straight, but the payback was well worth the effort.  Lives intersected, souls were bared, and bits of natural history added another interesting layer as did descriptions of city models.<br/>Among other story lines, this is a story of a father's love for his daughter.<br/><br/>Yet another war story, but this one managed to put itself head and shoulders above so many others.
I wasn't really interested in reading one more book about WWII.  I did read glowing reviews on NPR and Amazon.  I watched as it held its own as the flood of summer books grew.  Decided to take a chance.  What a great book.  I loved the style, the softly beautiful writing, and the character development.  The setting and the time were not what this book was about.  Highly recommend.
An excellent read. Fast, thoughtful and emotionally raw. Would highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys romance and historical backdrops.
The first Kindle book I hv read though I hv ordered the paper version as well. The Best work of fiction I hv read this year. Wonderful, memorable characters. I hated for it to end. Would recommend to anyone who loves getting lost in a great novel.
A war story beautifully written. Gorgeous prose. Gut-wrenchingly human. Tragic yet hopeful. I loved every page. Read it slowly to absorb the emotion
It was an excellent book, one of the best I have read in a while.
Incredible book!  I did not want it to end.  This book ranks up there with my top 5 favorite novels of all time.
I thought this was a beautifully crafted story.  One of those books that I couldn't wait to read each night but knew, that in doing so, it would bring me closer to the end and I didn't want that to happen.
I loved his writing style his attention to detail and his vocabulary. This book is a history not many know about and it's important. This is a time we should never forget and a time that should NEVER be repeated.  Mr Doerr displays family and the conflict choices made can cause but the bond and love between brother and sister does not die. The love a parent has for their child and the desire to protect at all cost and be true to ones own principles while giving that child an independence and trust in her own abilities to thrive.  A terrible time in the history of mankind but all things come to pass and we pick up the pieces and move forward
Enjoyed the story - well written.
A page turner that I couldn't put down.  I highly recommend it to those who want to understand what really happened during WWII in Brittany and Germany.
Beautifully written. Loved the structure of the story.
A most interesting story.  Very well written.  Intriquing to the end.
I read many, many books during the course of a year. All the Light You Cannot See was by far the best book I've read in many seasons of reading. The characters are well drawn, haunting and true to life. The second world war setting invoked many memories of that evil time.
Very intriguing book!  Best I've read in a long time
Beautifully written, very touching story.  Couldn't put it down.
I havent read anything that has compared to this is a long time. Two different lives come together in such a strange, sad, and beautiful way.
I would just like to take a minute to give this book 5 stars.  I think this is a book that has wide appeal to readers of many age groups.  I have grandparents who were affected by WWII, and the subject is explored on many levels, including the people who were victims of the war, as well as the young German soldiers who were solicited by the Reich.  It is a great book on many levels; an intricate plot spanning several decades, poetic prose, and beautiful characters.
A beautifully woven story of characters whose lives were formed by the war. What they did and how their lives spiralled together in strange and wonderful ways. Evocative and deeply moving
Well written book. Was an absolute page turner. Loved it!
This was a great read!  I couldn't put the book down and I hated to see it end.
Great read.  The description of the scenes made you feel like you were there.
I loved this book. It was really well written. I was totally absorbed in the story, loved how it moved between the characters and I was desperate to know how they all came together. I wasn't disappointed either, but didn't want it to end..
Absolutely loved this book and I will never forget it's haunting story. Marie-Laure is so vulnerable in her blindness and yet such a strong character with an unbelievable will to survive. Werner, the tiny little white haired boy, is so alive and so naturally curious and gifted. The descriptive phrasing in the writing and the insight into life in time of war could be breath taking. The loss in war can never be fully evaluated unless you consider the loss of an individual and their potential contribution to our society that will never be fully realized. I put this book right up there with The Power of One as an unforgettable book with it's rich and engaging characters. Don't miss this one.
Deeply thought out moving story of two people caught in the absurdity and violence of war. Well worth reading on many levels.
Another incredible story of the sadness and peril the youth suffered during the war.  It has a touching twist of friendship that happens between a blind French girl and a Hitler indoctrinated German boy .  It is wonderfully written, and  a testament to courage and humanity which is sometimes so hard to find in the throes of hate and destruction in any war.  V
Rich, deep characters, history one can feel and a story that never drags. I loved this book! Really loved it.
One of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Doer is a master...a true artist. I didn't want this book to end.
Excellent combination of historical fiction, intrigue, and storytelling. The characters were fascinating and the author does a phenomenal job of tying together the lives of those who would without the war never have crossed paths.
The author keeps you entranced with his weaving together with the father of a blind girl who is a keeper of keys and secrets to a brilliant German orphan boy and his sister. He can build a radio transmitter out of practically nothing and solve complicated math problems so of course he was recruited into Hitler's youth army. He soon begins to see the cruelty that surrounds him.<br/><br/>The devotion of the girls father and her courage is heart warming.
This book was meant to be my summer "beach book". Something lite on my Paper white that I would dip into for entertainment. It barely lasted a week and I haven't been to the beach yet.  It drew me in and remains with me weeks later. The characters and their particular circumstances drew a unique sense memory of the limitless dimensions of WWII specifically and war in general and how deep and detailed are its consequences. These characters were fiction and so real at once. Their metaphors represent all of those without clear cut edges of villain or victim: that thin line between cowardice and heroism that we all wonder whether we could cross if presented, that grey area between good and evil, the difference between being alive and avoiding death, the liminal space between human and divine... All the light we cannot see.
Marvelous book, beautifully written.  Really delves into the minds of the characters.  The blind girl is not the only one who "cannot see".
great read .
Excellent book. Lots of history and character development was a+
Magically poetic in his descriptions, Mr. Doerr creates a world of wonder and delight, dread and fear.  The events and stories surrounding World War II are boundless, but it becomes easy to assume that the characters in this story could have lived and experienced all that unfolds as you read this novel.  I tend to keep reviews short because I am not writing a book but sharing my impression of one!  So, if you wish to enjoy a story that will fill your heart and mind, engage your wonder and keep you believing that goodness can survive in a world turned upside down, here it is.<br/>My one disappointment is not in the telling, (magical as I said) it is that I could not step into the book and give warning or advise to the people I began to care about. Live does not offer us that opportunity either and that, I think, is part of Mr. Doerr's message to us all.
loved it
Great story of WWII, great characters
Very interesting;  sometimes difficult, sometimes depressing.  Very educational.
This book is beautifully written. It evokes the beauty, the horror, the magic of these characters lives. It transports you to the cold and death on the front in Russia and yet you can also taste the delicious canned peaches in st malo. It gives you a glimpse into the horrors of war, on so many levels and how good people due to all sorts of bizarre circumstances find themselves doing terrible things. I wouldn't miss this book!!
If you only read one novel this year, you won't go wrong by making it this one.  Beautifully written and wonderfully told, this is a book to savor; one to reflect upon and to perhaps even purchase in a hardcover edition in case your ipad or Kindle break.  Like Donna Tartt and Mark Helperin, Doerr selects every word as though they were ornaments on a tree - he takes only the best ones and puts them together in a way that only those at the top of their craft achieve.  I felt honored to read this book.  Honored that, when the worst is published, somewhere out there are publishers who still recognize the best.<br/><br/>Against the backdrop of the ugliest chapter in recorded human history, the tiny kindness of a scrap of bread or the least bit of rebellion gives the hope that life will sprout a tendril through the charred remains and the unlikeliest of survivors will live to tell the tale.<br/><br/>The plot has been described by many before me, so this is nothing more than a tribute to great writing and the hope that tendrils will keep growing through the piles of rubbish.
Such a beautiful story of war and humanity.  Warm, rich characters woven together in such beautiful and intricate ways.  A must read!
I have thought about this book and the characters many times since finishing last week. This is no "cookie cutter",  "fits the mold" story or plot line. It is hauntingly beautiful while heart breakingly tragic. It is so well written that I could smell the sea and smell the destruction. Visually, it is a rare treat even though it tells a sad story in our history.
Very engrossing story. Beautifully written. Wonderful characters. You find yourself living the story with each character. The author keeps you involved , making it hard to put Down
This novel was so wonderful, I really feel at a loss to leave any kind of review about it.  The characters were so beautifully sketched, and the descriptions were so clear and vivid that I always felt I was seeing and smelling everything that was happening.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure lives with her father in France, while Werner is growing up in Germany.  Their stories are told in alternating chapters until the time their lives intersect as WWII is coming to its end.  It was a page turner, and yet I wanted to read slowly in order to soak in the rich imagery and beautiful language.  I'm looking forward to reading it again in the future.
This is one of those books you will read again, and savor.  Original, compelling, beautifully written, with characters that enter your heart and mind. The writing transcends storytelling and becomes a paean to the human soul. The best book I've read in a long time.
Writing of great beauty. WW II from beginning to end as experienced by a young blind French girl and a German boy. Brutal at ties, at others, lyrical.
Marvelous writing. Compelling stories. Interesting juxtaposition of each chapeter. It kept me reading to all hours of the night. Difficult to put down.
This book (you can read the story summaries elsewhere) is an extraordinarily lovely reading experience on many levels, even richer and more engaging than its wonderful characters, substantial historical acumen, and amazing ease of transitions involving different physical locations and time periods. There is a beauty to the elemental depth, and simplicity, of the writing-reading, act-event itself. Quite uncommon style as a writer: improving the odds of a reader being-with a storied event. Treat yourself. Enjoy!
Well written and researched - a moving account of how two young people caught up in the terror of the War deal with it.  How one is at first caught up in the Nazi cause, but manages to regain his humanity in the end.
All the light we cannot see is a compelling read.  A beautiful story in every aspect.  Told in the backdrop of WWII and the oppression of the Nazis-the individual stories of of the characters amidst the horror, is tragically beautiful.
A blind French girl, a brilliant German boy caught in the warfare between their nations.  Both of them able to "see" in ways other than the visual; the girl through an extraordinary ability to paint a mind's picture of her world; the boy able to visualize another world through radio waves.  Doerr manages to paint lovely images in print, but the true message is the universal loss experienced by both sides as they try to cope with the tragedies and crimes of the war.  There are no winners here.
This book was beautifully written and the story line was compelling, which is why I gave the full five stars.  I am a huge fan of novels set around both the World Wars, and particularly enjoy stories told about the people in enemy countries, just from Great Britain and her allies.  It is good to learn how all the normal citizens suffered during these horrific wars, no matter which side you were on.<br/><br/>The Nazi youth organizations were appalling, and I feel it is too easy to jump to the conclusion that all involved were there of their own free will.  This book amougst others, show that clearly some of the individuals were left with no choice but to be press ganged into joining groups of which they disapprove.<br/><br/> The author's lovely descriptions conjured up for me how very difficult the life of a blind person can be, whilst at the creating wonderful pictures of the scenes at the same time.<br/><br/>It is quite a long book, but it keeps the interest level going, and I was desperate to get to the end and find out what happened to main characters.
I loved reading this book.  It is full of feeling and information.  I will definitely be rereading it over and over.
The story of a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy during World War II really held my interest. Marie-Laure has an enchanted life despite her blindness until her father disappears during the war. And Werner is raised in an orphanage with his sister while yearning to learn more, demonstrating great skills with radios that lead to a role for him in the German army. Both teens struggle to understand the surrounding destruction. The novel gives a sense of the complexities of making ethical decisions in the midst of a world where usual rules no longer apply. I finished the book days ago but I find myself still thinking about it. This is a fabulous book club read with plenty to discuss.
I am so impressed with this book. Doerr has drawn rich, complex characters and woven a story that compels the reader to turn from one page to the next. I couldn't put it down.
I am a dedicated nonfiction reader. By happy accident I chanced on this title and was struck by the poetry of it. I decided to read the sample and just couldn't stop. How a book can weave the magic this one does is beyond me, but I was carried to the end, and at the end I couldn't believe so much about life was revealed in it's pages. My god, what a writer!
Anthony Doerr has the gift. He writes a compelling story that by itself is gripping and goes on to do so in a prosaic manner.
I was completely caught up in this beautiful story by Anothony Doerr. The details are vivid, the characters so well developed that you can't help but love them. Even the "bad" guy in the story, you feel for him. I was sad to end the book.
What a wonderful novel of the human spirit in a time of madness and cruelty!<br/>We follow the lives of two young people whose character and destiny enfold in light and love amidst unimaginable<br/>tension and heartbreak.<br/><br/>Highly involving, beautifully written and important.
This book was wonderful.  I have already recommended it to my book club and to others.  If you enjoyed The Book Thief, you will enjoy this book as well.
Nice balance between a young German youth, and a blind French girl during WW 11.  Seeing how eventually they would come together, was a trip worth taking.  Excellent read.
The writing itself is beautiful, vivid descriptions and brilliant imagery.  The characters, even the minor ones, are three dimensional, fully realized human beings. I was so absorbed in the story I hated to stop reading but then again I wanted to stay in the book's world as long as possible. Set before, during, and after WWTwo, the novel has a dark side, the light we cannot see, not just because one character is physically blind (she actually sees more than most of the other characters) but because the war's atrocities, its cruelty, its endless soul killing blinds people to the possibility of life after the war.  An exceptional read -- a book I'm sure will stay with me a long time.
This is the first book I've read since "the Goldfinch" that I found just as good.  It has great character development, an intriguing storyline and just enough of human nature at both it's most delightful and infuriating! I hated putting it down.  This book could be a good read for a more advanced young reader as long as a very non descriptive rape scene and the violence of war would not offend.
Loved this story. A different WW2 angle with the Nazi youth history and impossible odds of a blind girl in war torn French town  - would have liked the back story to go on
Beautifully written - one could feel every emotion of both characters, as well as the Hell of War!  Going to find more of his books.
The story lines in this book were outstanding.  The author writes so that you can feel what these people are feeling.  The manner in which he presents the material flows so well and makes everything so vivid.
I loved this book. The blind French girl and the remarkable German boy whose individual stories come together beautifully at the end. Most of the book centers on how the lives of each of these two evolve between 1940 and 1944. But it also moves back and forth between this background and a very few days in August of 1944 in the remarkable French town of Saint-Malo, where most of the story concludes. (And if you are not familiar with Saint-Malo I would strongly recommend googling some photos of it. Beautiful.) Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
What a powerful book!  I gave it many stars when I finished it and would recommend it to many people.  It was a very poignent story about what people suffered during WW!!.<br/><br/>Hats off to a great author!<br/><br/>Pat RAe
Almost like reading poetry-beautifully written,  sympathetic characters, subtle and thought provoking.plot. Insight to the human heart. Just gorgeous all around.
this book is so well written, that I can not put it down.  Oops, I have to go, this book is calling!
Thoroughly enjoyable ! My simple litmus of a great book is the imagery that is created in my mind as i proceed( like my own personal movie). Characters are well developed and unique . I had no problem with following the story line as a few reviewers commented on as being a challenge. Would strongly recommend. On my list of "you should read this book!".
This is not a war story though set during a terrible time in WWII.  It is a story of life and some of those people who walk through it.. It will stay with you
This book has good depth of character development.  It takes these characters through the war as ordinary people who were caught in action but had no opinion or stake in Nazi Germany.  The characters are richly developed.
This book was so good I couldn't put it down.  It had so many twists and turns,  You couldn;t predict what was going to  happen.. I was sorry when it was over
This is a complex book with a compelling story. It not only tells in detail the horrors of war, it shows the determlnation and intellect that a blind person must have to survive and live a rich, rewarding life. I recommend it to anyone that has the imagination to see the story through Marie Laurie's eyes.
This is the story of youth in times of war.  It is told from both sides: the aggressors and the victims.  The main character is a blind girl of 13 fleeing war-torn Paris in WWII. On the other side is a bright, young German orphan boy, conscripted into the Nazi organization.  Their stories are told in parallel.  The author uses short dated paragraphs to keep us oriented to the different  points of view and passing time.  It is painfully clear how their young lives are affected beyond their control by the events around them.  The boy cannot prevent the cruelties of his leaders although he tries to distance himself from them.  The girl struggles to survive as her life is made more difficult by German advances and finally Allied bombing raids. They share a common thread through radio contacts.  It is an interesting, believable story from beginning to end, beautifully written.  I highly recommend it.
All The Light We Cannot See blends two story lines, A German soldier and a blind French girl, into a seamless masterwork.  The suffering, the brutality and the randomness of war drive this fine novel.
I love historical fiction, and this is one of the most well written books I have read in a long time. The characters touch your heart, and you really care what happens to them. The setting, WWII, is well described. It is such a touching story, and one that makes you stop every so often just to soak it in and process it. I highly recommend. One caution - there were lots of words I did not know, and I pushed my dictionary button on my Kindle many times!!
While reading this book, I was reminded of the line from the Kingston Trio's version of the song Reuben James: "the worst of men must fight and the best of men must die".  This is the picture of war we seldom see, the effects on boys and men forced into the conflict and ground in its maw, and the effect on civilians ostensibly at the periphery.  There are no heroics here, just ordinary greed, degradation and fear.  The story is similar to The Goldfinch in some ways, involving a priceless museum piece, but I thought it was more credible, and the characters were certainly more sympathetic.  However, if you want your stories to have a happy ending, don.'t read this book.
A poignant WWII coming of age and historical novel that is an appropriate school assignment as well as a powerful tale for adult readers.  The language and storyline keep you completely engaged.
Good story and very well written. Real quality.  I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the human spirit. Enjoy ... Enjoy
I could not out it down. Beautiful. Characters are so well developed and the story is captivating. A must read.
Very good read. Hard to put down once I got started. The characters in this story were very interesting to know.
I really enjoyed this book though I think it could have been about 50 pages shorter.  Well-written though and filled with relatable characters. I'm still a little confused about a twist at the end, but makes for a good discussion.
This is a beautifully written story paralleling the lives of a young, blind girl living in Paris with her father during World War 2, and a young German boy who is recruited into an exclusive Nazi school because of his technical skills with radio transmission. I couldn't put it down, yet didn't want it to end.
A tender and unique story of the trials of war and innocents. A rich mixture of Storting telling and musical allusion. Characters to care about and a historical scope to keep them anchored. A rewarding read.
Interesting story.  Well developed characters.  Author told the story by switching off between the two protagonists, a blind girl from Paris and an orphan boy from a mining town in Germany.  The story is set during the build up of World War II and through the duration of the war.  This is a very worthwhile read.  It came just a smidgen shy of five stars, which I reserve for books that stay with you for quite a while after you finish reading them.  Although the story itself is very interesting,  my favorite part of this book is how some of the characters become their best selves with adversity.  Some of the quotes said by these characters are real treasures, the kind of quotes that cause you to put the book down and ponder the beauty of what you just read.
what happened to the innocents caught up in world war 2 ;wrapped around the lives ofa young french girl and a young German boy, this book is beautifully written and very hard to put down.
A story that will immediately capture your interest and cause you to see into the lives of 2 orphaned children living in Europe through the 1930's and 1940's.
A beautifully written , intriguing novel but sometimes the details got in the way. Was always anxious to get back to it.
THIS WAS A NERVE WRENCHING NOVEL WITH SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS TOWARD LIFE AND DEATH. SHEAR WILL POWER<br/>OVERCOMES DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES. MANY BONDING RELATIONSHIPS FULFILL KEEPING OUR BLIND HEROINE AFLOAT.
I enjoyed this book with the two main characters and their very different backgrounds and lives and how they briefly, but importantly come together.
Well written, engaging story of WW2 from two perspectives.  It will draw you in and keep you going to the last page.
I wish I had time to write a longer review, but it would only echo many others.  Let me just say that Anthony Doerr has a gift for writing. His imagination and apparent knowledge of the world and arcane events, cultures, craftsmanship, and history is excellent.  Even in-depth research, which I'm sure he did, doesn't give you the kind of knowledge he conveys - in a most elegant writing style.  A top ten book for me this year.  Strongly recommend.
I thought the book was pretty good.  I loved all the historical facts about WWII and France.  The author made you feel like you were right there.  Some parts were rather wordy and drawn out but for the most part a pretty good read!
Very engaging. Beautifully written. I will be thinking about these characters for weeks to come. It is an often written about time in history, seen from a different angle.
It's difficult to find the words to describe just how terrific this book is.  The writing is stellar.  The story is of the beautifully interwoven lives of a young, blind French girl and a young German boy who is inducted into the Hitler Youth.  Both are twelve years old as the book begins and sixteen when they finally cross paths in a seaside village in war-torn, occupied France.  In the four intervening years, both of these young people experience a multitude of significantly changed relationships, events, hardships and life threatening situations.  They, their families, and their beliefs are altered.  The emphasis is on Marie-Laure and Werner and not on the war itself.  This is not a war story, but rather an intensely personal story of people who live through these events and upheavals, the choices they make, the losses they experience and how they are changed.<br/><br/>There are so many aspects to this story, which enrich it while still enhancing the personal drama.  These include a rare and mythical diamond entrusted to Marie-Laure's father by the Paris museum he works for in an effort to keep it from German hands, Her father's relationship with Marie-Laure is an enviable one of great love and efforts to continually drive her to become an independent young woman, despite her blindness.  The ways he does this is remarkable.  Werner is a loving young boy thrust into a world he is not entirely comfortable with, but his genius with radios makes him invaluable to the Reich.  This is what also, ultimately, leads him to Marie-Laure.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure and Werner have no good options to change or escape their life-paths but their fortitude and good sense gets them through the worst.  I can't imagine anyone not loving this book.
A book full of historic reference, 70 years after the war. Beautifully written, so much love and so sensitive. A must read
So beautifully written.  The perfect combination of emotion, suspense and history. I've recommended this book to countless friends and book clubs.  Highly recommend.
This is a fabulous book.  I made myself slow down and savor the language, the story, the setting. I gobble up all books about the WWII resistance.  This was so well written and beautiful.  Best book of 2014 for me.
The road traveled by two young people - a blind French girl and an electronic genius of a German boy - is marked by tragedy and loss. However, in wartime Europe such was the norm. The initial mystery of their connection over many years kept this reader entranced with their individual and mutual stories. Within the setting of unimaginable suffering is the tenderness of great love and courage. I recommend this book to those interested in life in Europe during World War II and to lovers of the English language (with some French and German thrown in).
Written with understanding from the view points of two youngsters who are coming of age in war time.  The narrations move along at a leisurely pace, but it is never dull or over-written.  The background of WWII is familiar so it is not described in detail.  What is clearly portrayed is how individuals responded to stress, hardship, and fear.
A dark subject made bearable by the vivid characters. Was pulled in and captivated until the last page. Read this!
This is wonderful story, with great character development and plot lines.  You get so absorbed in the lives of the two main characters, that you can't wait to find out what happens next.  The detail about the period is fantastic.  So wonderful with the celebration of D-Day going on.
brilliant and beautiful.  You will not soon forget Marie-Laure or Werner.  And to have read it just before D-Day reminiscences. Beyond wonderful!
I don't usually write reviews but I enjoyed this book so much that I just had to. Great story. Well written.
A beautifully written novel about the changes wrought on two very different young people - a blind and resourceful Parisian girl and a reticent German boy swept into an elite Nazi school - before and throughout World War II.  In addition to adroit  development of the two main characters, including both their courage and failures in responding to the horror and losses around them, Doerr paints intimate pictures of the local neighborhoods in France and Germany.  This book is dazzling, disturbing and wonderful.
I know it is not a word, but it's the closest I can think of to describe the experience. A beautifully written and bittersweet narrative of a terrible world most of us have thankfully never experienced. All the more worthwhile because of it. Definitely worth experiencing.
A lovely book- reminiscent of Cold Mountain and The Book Thief.  Two perspectives rarely addressed in recent literature set in World War Two.
I loved Laurie.  Laurie was loved by so many caring people. She was brave, intelligent beyond measuring, She was unaware but at the same time aware of the tradagedies that was happening in Europe at the time (WWll). The book was so well written. I never wanted to put it down.
Once you start, you won't want to put it down. Sad yet charming and hopeful, during a very dark time in human history.
Appetizing  To say the least.I have not read anything of this quality in a long while.A superb novel with great heart and crafted with care and skill.<br/><br/>.
I couldn't put this book down. Loved Doerr's style of writing. If you like to read about WWII this is a different angle.
Fascinating historical fiction which weaves together a tragic story through the lives of a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy during World War II.  Short descriptive and poignant portrayals which alternate among characters and the passage of time but ultimately come together in the end.  Read carefully because all the pieces eventually fit together.  A lesson in the power and resilience of youth despite the madness of adults and the cruelty of war.  A good read.
I enjoyed the in-depth, complex characters,  and the mystery woven into suspense and caught up in history. I also enjoyed the author's use of skipping around time and perspective as the reader is pulled toward the ending. Great read.
This was a beautifully written, lovely, sweet and sad novel.  All the human emotions and angst expressed so well.  The characters are so rich and well drawn.  I am glad I read it and will be recommending it to my book club.
I had never heard of this author before but this book was wonderful and hard to put down. Even though it moved around in time and place with the two main characters I was drawn to both of them and worried about their safety and whether they could survive all the had to endure. It was sad but there were  moments of triumph as well.
Beautifully constructed story.  Many levels of "light" offered the reader to experience.  So sensitively written.  Marvelous language used.  BRAVO writing performance!
This was a beautifully crafted novel.  It managed to portray both sides of WWII in Europe through the "eyes" of innocence.
I read the last half of the book in one evening. It is now past 2am.<br/><br/>I know that thoughts of Werner will follow me into my dreams and, perhaps, whispers of his story will remain in the air that surrounds me for much time to come.<br/><br/>My hope, is that I will remember the choice we each have to create light in a sea of darkness.
By Felipe Martinez:I was a baby during WWII.  I grew up with all the movie footage and the stories of the real evil that  war represented. This book brought back memories of it. The jewel part was the beautiful souls that were the innocent victims of war who survived with so much bravery and heroism and a writer who is a wonderful soul as well.
Wow. That's all I can say. Beautiful prose, unpredictable plot, great characters. But prepare to have your heart broken every other chapter or so. The costs of war, especially for young people, have never been so clear. It was so sad I didn't want to continue reading, but so beautiful I had to continue. Surely one of the best books of the year.
Touching story of a blind French girl and an orphan German boy during World War ll<br/>and the sad, cruel effects of war on innocent children and civilians.  They are young<br/>but strong and resilient and cope with the little they have.  Although the book leads<br/>up to their meeting, they are together a very short time.  Beautiful story.
One of the best books I have read in recent years.
A beautifully written book with strong characters who you can relate to. Told from different points of view. The author's use of short chapters help move the story along and keeps your attention. This is a great book for discussion in book clubs. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a book you can really get into and hate to see end.
Loved the small characters as much as the leads.  Depicts evil as sometimes circumstantial.  True bravery is rare.  The impact of small acts of bravery was substantial in WWII and every war.  Marie and her Family were beautiful souls who navigated with quiet fortitude and bravery.  Beautifully designed story to keep the reader on the edge.
Forever people have spoken of beautiful prose, of the magic of stories, of amazing writing talent, and in this book all those phrases sing out. The story could be sentimental but the truths it encompasses, the truths of war, of blindness, of loss and death keep it from that fate. Nonetheless it is a love story, and for that I am grateful.
Beautifully written but I stopped giving a toss and stopped reading at the two thirds point. Beautiful writing is a bit like spectacular scenery for me, after staring at it too long eventually I want to see a sheep jumping off a cliff or something. I hope all worked out well for Werner & Marie but not enough to finish. It became dull and rambling. Guess I'm in the minority though.
Ok. It started slow for me, but for psychology/history/thinking (not escaping) readers, I couldn't recommend more the novel, "All the Light We Cannot See." It killed me, and I can't stop thinking about it. 1940's--blind girl in occupied France/ German boy caught up in war (and the people, good and bad, that made up their world).
I love a beautifully written story and this is an exceptional one. The characters, the events, the emotions, the details are all so carefully crafted, and often unique. The discovery is much like traveling through one of the heroine's nautilus shells, deeper and deeper, wondering where it will end, but enjoying the beautiful journey.
Doerr is a gifted writer in carrying on two stories simultaneously - very easy to follow.  By the time the stories intersect, we the readers are enthrawed and can't lay the book down if our life depended on it. My husband read the hard bound as I read on my Kindle.  We compared notes here and there without giving the story line away-
"All the Light We Cannot See" is a novel about World War II alternately told from the perspectives of a young blind girl  living in France and a very young German soldier. It is exceptionally well written and compelling. A very long book, it may need to be read in small chunks, but you will not likely give up before the end.
Excellent book that was hard to put down.  Great character development.  I felt like I "knew" each character in the book by the end. I liked the way each of the characters was able to overcome fears to help each other out. I learned a lot about World War 2 from the French point of view.  I would highly recommend this book.
As a child growing up during the big WW II, the story had a lot of meaning.  My father served with the Persian Gulf Command, Iran.  His mission was a part of the American Lend Lease Program that provided supplies for the Russians who were being decimated by the Germans during the war.  My, oh my, how the political ball swings. dsh
Just wonderful! Incredibly moving and beautifully written.
Every once in a while a GREAT book like this one is written and I have to tear myself away to stop reading it!  The characters are well developed and interesting.  The prose is intelligent and flowing.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Everything about this is as good as you can find. The character development and storytelling intertwine magically. This is one of my all time favorites.
Best book I have read and I read a lot! Once I got into the rhythm of the prose I could not put it down.
This is one of the best books I have read this year.  The story is lyrical and compelling and I found myself working quickly on my daily tasks so I could find time to read.  I usually just have time to read at night before going to bed.  One of my favorite  genres is World War II stories that help me understand the personal sacrifices and horrors of that war.  This novel accomplishes that.  The main story is about a blind French girl and a young German soldier during the Allied invasion at St. Malo, France after D-Day.  The backstories of these two young people interwoven into the main action gave me good insight into the characters and their motivations. I fell in love with both of them.  I also found an excellent video of the battle of St. Malo on Youtube, which added to my reading experience.
An amazing story of WWII, told in the most beautiful detail.  The emotions and experiences of two young people, one French and one German, as they move toward one another, suffering true hardship in their individual lives, questioning everything they thought they knew about their countries and families.  Doerr creates incredibly beautiful and visual images, as these two lives come together - for a life altering brief moment in time.
This book is beautifully written, it is rich with metaphor, with compelling, likable characters, and a wonderful plot.  Often times I found myself reading paragraphs out loud, the words so brilliantly strung together--nearly poetic.  The book is at it's best when Marie is with her Papa.  The single parent who has raised her, and as her sight begins to deteriorate rapidly--His love for her only intensifies.  She is not a burden, she is his child.  He so loves her that he carves (in wood) miniature scale replica's of the city, so that she can "see" it's lay-out.  So she can find her way home, wherever she may be.  He takes her for walks, guiding her along, teaching her to use sound, and smell, and her cane.  He takes her into the city, then spins her around, "Marie--take us home, you can do it!"  Frustrated, and scared-- She finally is able to accomplish this, her confidence and grace blooming.  Their relationship is very endearing, and the book stumbles a bit when the two become separated.<br/><br/>Then there is Werner, the white-haired, sky-blue eyed German boy, forced into the Hitler youth, his electronic genius paving the way from an orphan home, to the Nazi equivalent of West Point.  He is brainwashed, yet manages to somehow maintain his humanity, and he does this through his relationships both with Frederick, his sister Jutta, and ultimately Marie-Laurie.<br/><br/>The book slows a third of the way through, struggles to regain it's footing-- Like a driver who forgets to downshift after taking a turn, it eventually regains it's power-- but then struggles yet again at times.  When it is good, it is really very good.  Five Star good.  But when it is not, is is merely okay.  So I found myself loving, then liking, loving then liking--repeatedly, and it seemed longer than need be.  I'm not sure how I would have edited it, because the slow parts do seem necessary to fully develop the characters, but it does feel a bit redundant at times.<br/><br/>This could have been an exceptional book, there was just too much tangential stuff going on, I don't really feel as though the "diamond mystery"  was necessary, in fact--I think if the book had taken a single focus,  perhaps purely on Marie and Werner, and their struggles-- it would have seemed less scattered.  Sometimes you can toss too many ingredients into a soup, and the flavors compete with one another instead of enhancing and balancing it. I think that is what happened here.<br/><br/>I still recommend it, as I found it quite enjoyable, even though it is a bit uneven.
I found the story to be intriguing.The writer took indivuals from two different places during WW II and switched back and forth between them, telling their stories. While I liked the story, the ending seemed odd. I was sympathetic to both of the main characters and the people they were with. I would recommend the book to others.
The greatest book I have ever read concerning the time of world war 2.  Without the atrocities that need not be described, this Author has brought to life the children and parents and love.  He tells the time from The points of view of both sides intellectually, kindly and follows it through to 2014.  Thank you, Anthony Doerr!
We picked this book for our Book Club.  We seemed to mostly agree that the story was a good one but the back and forth narratives got to be distracting.  It's not that we minded the story being told from two points- of- view but the chapters were so short, for the most part, that you felt like you were watching a tennis match.
This novel made me aware of how much potential and how much genius is lost due to wars. There are so many brilliant characters in this book who either lost their lives or lost their minds because of war. Even though it shows the horror of war for both civilians and soldiers, it is so beautifully written that it is like poetry.
Anthony Doerr is a great story teller.  This novel is well written with wonderful descriptions that allow you to see in your mind's eye what the characters were seeing and to feel what those characters were feeling.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and to anyone who just loves a good story.
I don't know much about WWII but I think from reading another historical fiction book I could figure out enough to understand what was going on in this book. I had a bit of trouble sometimes following all of the different story lines but they all fell into place nicely. It was not a simple read for me but I still enjoyed it.
I became totally immersed in this book and the characters and it really transported me into a different world rich with complex characters. It's rare that I find a book with equal parts interesting plot, vivid language and description, and multi-dimensional characters.  This book will stay with me for awhile. A real gift.
I don't really know what to say or think about this book. I did read it start to finish but it was pretty jumbled in my thinking because of the way it was written to jump from one person or thing to another without really connecting them until almost the end of the book.  The last three chapters were the best in the book.
This was a beautifully written book with characters who gripped the imagination about a horrific time in history.  Each character meets the challenges  they face with an honesty and bravery that is inspiring, the context of the time creates a somber and frightening terroir for each of these children to find themselves.
I enjoyed how the book paralleled the lives of Werner and Marie-Laure.  It seemed to be building up to their paths crossing, but when it finally happened, it felt like a let down.  I felt that the book was slow at times and only increased the pace and suspense near the end.  Then it slowed down to a snail's pace again.
It's been awhile since I've picked up a book and been hooked on it by page three! This lovely, sad, wonderful story tells how people from very different walks of life can find themselves linked to one another through circumstances beyond their control, childhood imagination and a thirst for adventure. READ THIS BOOK!
Exceptionally moving superb historical fiction.  The characters enter the reader's lives as the characters face harrowing experiences but, at least for some, are able to act courageously, find and reciprocate love and let the better angels of their.nature triumph, while imprinting themselves in our hearts and minds.
An exquisite book. One of a kind. It's a poem to humankind. Loved, loved, loved. It confirmed again my belief that great books can't be written in 6 months. It took the author around 10 years to write this one and you can tell that from the book. Have been giving it as a gift to my friends and they all loved it too.
This is an almost perfect read. It is my favorite book for 2014 so far. It is a book about hope and trust. The book tells of the French loyalism to their country during the Nazi occupation. This no is in an exclusive category for and has touched me personally, since both my parents survived WWII - losing everything.
Feel it did not live up to all the hype.  Took me about 30% of book on Kindle to get into it.<br/>Author has a beautifully descriptive way of writing that really creates the time and place.<br/>Enjoyed it but would not suggest it as a "must read".<br/>The mood of WWII France and Germany was very real.
An exceptional novel, set in WW2 France with parallel stories about a blind French girl and a young German soldier, brought up in an orphanage. The two meet briefly but it is really the story of how people cope with adversity in life and war. Beautifully written, both characterisation and descriptive setting equally impelling.
All the Light We Cannot See is one of those books that you love to curl up with in your favorite chair and become totally immersed in.  The characters are well developed, and the story line is riveting and it makes one think about their own life experiences, which I think all great books do. Highly recommended!
This is a fabulous narration of two young people, a blind girl in Paris and a young boy in Germany, which provides a compelling portrait of their inner lives and how they view their circumstance.  It also gives you insight on how ordinary people were affected by the war.  Fully deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
This is one of the best books I have read, and believe me, I have read many!  The parallel lives of the two characters is beautifully done.  The reader sees the horrors of Would War II through their lives.  This book should be on the Advanced Placement list for high school students!  It is beautifully written.
My hubbie bought this to read on a trip, though he didn't finish then. Now I am reading it, too, though neither of us has completed the book. He's often calling me to "come listen to this great sentence structure." (He's a wordsmith himself). We added the professional narration and I like that feature.
"ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE"  is "one of the best novels" that I have read in over 50 years........Anthony Doerr  is a great story teller, with exceptional knowledge of human nature, The story is heart wrenching and beautiful at the same time. But you can be sure that it is well worth reading!
This is a beautifully written book.  It is such a pleasure to not only enjoy the plot development, but also the elegance of the writing.  I especially enjoyed how the parallel life stories of both Marie-Laure and Werner ultimately come together, even though the ending was not the happy one that I'd hoped for.
Very well written.  Life as seen through the eyes of a young blind French girl and a young German soldier - who only finally meet for a half day.  Enjoyed the plot and the  multiple view points and lead characters.  Very insightful view into the daily lives during WW II.  Will read more books by this author.
Very moving story....the courage in some of the characters was amazing.  I was a little disappointed in how the book ended....the romantic in me just couldn't fathom why the book ended as it did with little stories of the characters and how they ended up...and without what would have been a wonderful ending.
This is my first novel by Doerr and one of my favorite books ever. Beautiful poetic writing style with deep character development and a captivating plot. I didn't want it to end.  Didn't really think of it as a romance though. More of an exploration of courage and morality in challenging times with heart and soul drawn in.
I found the book disjointed going back and forth not only between characters but in time. I was expecting more of an interaction between the two main characters and it took forever until they met. It felt like a long introduction with a quick wrap-up. I had heard so much good about it, I was expecting more.
I loved the way the story enfolded before my eyes, as the war progressed. The more I read, the deeper the connection I felt with the blind French girl. I sympathized with her and was taken by her perception of the surroundings and the people - for she experienced the world around her as a stream of colors.
I did not care for this novel. It was recommended to me but I found it was jumping around  too much between characters and back and forward in time. Since I usually read nonfiction and holocaust era accounts it was not surprising I found this to be a lightweight story verging on fantasy. Not my cup of tea.
We know the results of WWII so it was somewhat predictable but the character development was well done, hard to imagine being blind during those horrific years much less surviving and then having a fairly normal life with a family.  The author is to be commended for a totally different approach to the war.
I don't know what to say about this book that others haven't said before me. So I'll keep it simple -- This book is beautiful. An absolutely beautiful story so well written and layered with messages, I wanted to soak in each word for fear of missing any detail. One of the very best books I've ever read.
This is an amazing book that I enjoyed immensely.  In fact I did not want it to end.  However it did end - and for my money - disappointingly.  It was almost as though he did not know how to end it, but having said that the book is so well written, well researched and heartfelt.  I highly recommend it.
well written - moving.  I didn't like the way it ended.  I felt let down and a little dissatisfied.  I felt like Marie-Laure cheated Jutta by not telling more about Werner's kindness to her.  The end of the book kept going after the story was told.  It was a poor finish to an otherwise wonderful story.
The characters in this book are so well developed and real that I found myself wondering how they were doing even when I was not reading. The book showed how the tolls taken by WWII were personal and severe, but how bravery and resilience moved extraordinary people toward the light they could not see.
A beautifully written, imaginative story which fascinated me but left me vaguely unsatisfied at the end. Perhaps that was the author's intention given the horrible destruction caused by World War II.  The principal characters are carefully drawn and fully realized, a compelling and original novel.
Superbly written - the first 2/3 of the book. The final chapters are dark and wandering. Then the author seems to have given up on the ending. He seems to have run out of time or ideas and just ends it.  Very disappointing.  Excellence consists of not just great beginnings but also great endings.
The book was most interesting; a great insight into France and WW2. I was appalled at the youth training and the desperate measures taken towards the end of war. A little disappointed that a hinted romantic relationship never came to fruition but it served to remind us of the consequences of war.
In the beginning of the book I wondered where it would lead.  The two main characters of the book are so different but have a common bound.  It is about WWII but it is really about people from both sides of the war, Germany and France.  As I really got into the book I didn't want to put it down.
This book was exceptionally well written and well researched.  I fell for the characters immediately (all of them!), and was swept up in the horror of war, and how it must have been to live in occupied and mobilized Europe during World War II.  I will be reading more of Anthony Doerr's work.
This is a terrible story written in the most beautiful prose you could imagine.  Other authors pale when compared to Anthony Doerr.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy being time traveled back to World War II and seeing with his words exactly what it must have been like.
For almost a year I procrastinated and came up with a myriad of reasons why not to start this book. What a profound mistake. Once I got fifty pages in, I found myself waking up in the middle of the night and opening my Kindle just to pick up where I left off a few hours before. Great read.
Beautiful WWII story. The story paints a realistic picture from the French perspective and the German perspective. I hated to put the book down because I wanted to see what would happen next. There were some questions left at the end of the novel that I would have liked to have an answer.
Very slow start, but got better as I went on. I thought it was pretty predictable. I did like the way he tied things together at the end so we weren't left wondering what happened to all of the characters. I am glad I read it. It reminded me of how fortunate I am to live in this country.
Loved it - had just finished "The Nightingale" before reading "All the Light We Cannot See" and to read them back-to-back was awesome as it's the same time frame, country, etc.  Probably two of the best books I've read in a long time and I'm recommending them to everyone.
One of my favorite books I have read in many years. Truly loved the characters, leads and supporting, the author just did a great job bringing to life the entry into WWII and the impact on the individual people in France and Germany. Great subject, great story, well written - Loved it.
For all lovers of historical fiction...this is the story of two children who grow up during the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. It is gripping, painful, joyful, and soulful.  And it makes the reader grateful for the many simple pleasures we all tend to take for granted.
Compelling, hypnotic, relentlessly haunting. Doerr has crafted a story that speaks to the time and yet is timeless.<br/>Who can fathom the heights and depths that man can reach? And the sorrows he cannot change? Perhaps the real question is who among us are blind and who is sighted?
The prose in this book is beautiful but it comes at the expense of the story which moves very very slowly.  The author often writes at great length about very small details.  The story just did not move fast enough for me.  It is a lovely novel but I am not sure I would recommend it.
Absolutely wonderful! All the Light We Cannot See was a treasure to read, Doerr tells two separate tales wonderfully then blends them together in perfection. If you love historical fiction/literary fiction you will not be disappointed when you crack this one open! - See more at:[...]
It was beautifully written, very different, and brought me into a world I was unfamiliar with.  Anyone who can make the workings of a lighthouse interesting and easy to understand, is a pretty good writer.  (And I know:  you're not supposed to end a sentence with a preposition!)
A riveting read, at times lyrical, almost poetic, in language while telling a tragic war story.  Doerr's writing is sensuous drawing the reader in on many levels. There is a sense that he treats "light" almost as a subtext. A powerful novel that will stay with a reader.
An amazing story that explores World War II from the viewpoint of two young people, one a French girl who is blind and one a young man in the Hitler Youth movement.  It's quite a different take on the horrors of war and is very well written.  I was engaged throughout the book.
Great book! I did the kindle/audible combo. It was so nice to go from reading to listening right where I left off. This is the only way I will buy new books!  The book itself was really capivating. I enjoyed the characters and found the challenges each faced to be very real.
Lyrical prose, with a philosophical tone. The text is rich in detail and imagery, and the fully developed characters practically leap off the page. Doerr adds something new and significant to the already crowded field of WWII-era historical fiction. This one is a must-read.
There was a weave of characters and their actions that was one of the best suspenseful, yet hopeful stories that I have ever read. I hoped for a better outcome of one of the major characters, but it added to the reality of war. There is such a sweet sadness in this novel.
This book was very descriptive.  It transport me to France and Germany during the beginnings and the end of World War II.  The story was extremely moving.  I would highly recommend this book.  It was a little slow in the beginning, but I stuck with it and I'm happy I did.
Best written book I think I have read in my life. Anthony Doerr took 10 years to write this book and his efforts shine through in this work of utter brilliance. If this book could be transformed into a framed work of Art, it would hang in the finest museums of the world!
I love well written books that are not from some formula.  This is an exquisite story of the war experience of two children and the impact  war has on the lives of the innocent.  It is touching in description of how people love, sacrifice and try to do what is required.
I just didn't feel the hype of this book. This WWII novel doesn't rate the high reviews. To me, the story drags on and the plot evaporates early with the same o same o characters and story. BOOK THIEF was more layered and dramatic with its plot and historical reference.
I find it hard to believe that this book has been on the L.A. Times best seller list for quite awhile.  It was an interesting idea on which to base a historical fiction; however, it was so slow moving, it dragged almost the entire book.  The entire book lacked emotions.
World War 2 has always been a study of very different circumstances resulting in interesting effects on different peoples lives. This book takes it to a new level of interest bringing together multiple characters with interlocking lives and interests Hard tp put down..
From beginning to end the author gave an awe inspiring narrative of life, love and dedication through the lives of ordinary citizens, soldiers,  museum artisan's and a gifted blind girl,who had better insight than her sighted companions before, during and after WWII.
This beautifully written book had poetry on every page.  The imagery took my breath away and I found myself re-reading sections to hear the words again.  I was sorry to come to the end of the story as I really cared for the characters who were well drawn and complex.
I read a fair amount for a monthly book club and this was one of the most challenging AND rewarding books we've read in years.  Well written in an interesting narrative style with characters that I understood and was sympathetic to, in very challenging circumstances.
I can't stand by and passively agree with the rave reviews for this slog. Lots of "worms, Roxanne, worms" - without much going on.  Maybe pretentious, maybe high brow - definitely boring.  Well written though.  Based on Seinfeld premise: A book about nothing.
I enjoyed this book. It was complicated to keep the story line straight due to the back and forth of each chapter.<br/>The hardship, cruelty, and loss of lives, love and property remains today. When will we ever learn...War what is it good for...absolutely Nothing!
This was a wonderfully written book as the characters from both sides of the war are developed throughout. I also enjoyed how the author makes the reader feel for each one no matter how wrong their part in the war was. Great book! I would highly recommend this one!
Historical fiction novel about a young blind girl, a young German soldier, and a large blue diamond. Loved the characters and the story line. Just wish the author hadn't made the story track back and forth in time. The story jumps between the two main characters .
I read a lot for my work as a professor, so I don't have much time for extra reading.  But this novel is so wonderfully written in such a clear style with such vivid imagery and characterization that I simply could not put it down.  A poignant and haunting story.
This novel delves into unique and vital perspectives about World War II with startling insight. Even when the 'action' is the characters' stream of consciousness, the story is captivating and compelling. The author's command of figurative language, is masterful.
The story takes place in a sad time period of the world.  I enjoyed how resourceful the blind girl was and how her father helped her by making little models of the towns they lived in.  However the story was extremely long and I felt it could have been shorten.
While the storyline was very good and the ending powerful, the time line became confusing. It is certainly an interesting concept to follow the possibility of lives from two different worlds intersecting in such an unusual way in a time of ugliness for mankind!
A recommendation from a friend of mine and I found this an excellent read. The author 's transitions between characters in the story was flawless. I have enjoyed books about this time period in our history and this is one I will definitely recommend to others.
I loved this book.  The details from the era, about the geography, the politics, "seeing" through the eyes of the characters, was all done very, very well.  Excellent book.  NOT easy and light but thoughtful and provocative.  I definitely recommend it.
I am a hopeless romantic. I wanted a happier ending. Maybe surviving such atrocities makes for a happy ending, but I think I wanted more. Many things are tied up,  but for me they seem unfulfilled. It was still a good book with wonderfully written characters.
The author is obviously brilliant! The scenes were painted so real that I was living them, hearing, smelling and feeling the moments.i  am sure the author speaks at least three languages and is well educated. Verbal and musical poetry in every word. Thank you
The author's attention to detail throughout the book gave me insight into the lives of the main characters before and throughout the World War II years.  The blind French girl and orphaned German boy showed tremendous strength of character.  Interesting read.
This was a great story! I enjoyed it immensely. I loved the descriptions of Brittany and St. Malo. It had great character development. The juxtaposition of a German and French character added a great deal of depth to the point of view of the main characters.
One of the best (if not the best) WWII-era books I've ever read. I love that the perspective is from the eyes of two teenagers: that's not a war story that you get to hear very often, and it was incredibly moving. I recommend it to anyone interested in WWII!
I found it a little tedious at times. It took me a while to get through it. The writing was good, but the story was confusing at times, trying to keep things in order as it was written during several different time periods and kept switching back and forth.
Prose that read like poetry, every character is interesting and most are sympathetic.  WWII hovers ominously, sometimes in the foreground, always in the background, until the characters are themselves surrounded by it.<br/>Long epilogue is very satisfying.
The author paints vivid pictures and pulls the reader into the historical time and place with amazing use of figurative language.  When you morn the completion of a book, the author has connected with your heart and soul...the plot was to the moon and back.
I loved the characters, and especially Marie Laure. Even though we all know the history of WWll, I have never heard much from the perspective of the French citizens and the horror they experienced. Very well written, and easy to see how it's a Bestseller!
A totally absorbing book, just loved it. What an insight to the human condition, and the "life" of 2 very different people, and the circle of their lives bringing them together for a period of time in World War 11. I was spell-bound by the story.
While reading this book I felt that vision and time were bent in ways that made the invisible visible and time timeless. The intensity of humans caught by war is exposed, admired, celebrated. If any of these words strike a chord for you, read this book.
I loved everything about this book except the switching back and forth in time.  I thought it would have been more suspenseful if the story had been chronological, but I loved it anyway.  Memorable characters, touching story, and such beautiful writing.
I  appreciated the need to read more and more with each chapter,  The author kept the reader in suspense during the whole book.  I was disappointed with the ending because I didn't want it to end.  I felt like there were still many unanswered questions.
This is a very well written book that gives the reader a fresh perspective on World War II as it follows the separate lives of a young blind French girl and a young orphaned German boy. Incredibly human and beautifully told, I would recommend this book.
Everything written about this novel in the formal reviews is accurate.  This is an excellent story that is well developed with great character presentation.  This was highly recommended by a friend, and I was not disappointed and you will not be either.
The plot  was amazing, I never knew quite how it was going to move on.<br/>Like many good books these days the end was a little disappointing, but after the fascination whole previous story it would have been difficult to achieve the perfect finish.
The writing is great.  I loved reading it.  However, the ending was a big disappointment.  It could have been so much better.  It was as if the author spent a very long time writing most of the book and hurried at the end without thinking it through.
A few comments about structure are worth noting about this book, from the outset. It has a decidedly cinematic feel and opens in the last month of Word War II, with our endangered heroine in a desperate plight, blind and trapped in a house in a burning town. The Nazi Youth hero is similarly trapped in the basement of a bombed hotel in the same town. The symmetry is strong, if a bit contrived. Likewise the plot of this book unfolds contrapuntally, bouncing in a filmic style from late war to early war, then earlier late war to later early war, and so on, allowing the plot points in between to be slowly revealed in a way that enhances the drama and the narrative pace. Sometimes it reads more like a screenplay than a novel, but this does not appear to have dulled the book’s appeal.<br/><br/>Another stylistic point: Doerr is extremely disciplined in his use of adjectives, so that whenever he allows himself to use one it is emphasized and stands out like a jeweled pendant. This lends the text a kind of drive and muscularity. Think Hemingway, for example: all verbs and adverbs are used for action; prepositional phrases, where you might have used an adjective, lend a beat and pulse to the text; short sentences add a propulsive power.<br/><br/>The novel wheels around the eventually entwined stories of two young kids, each likeable though each is trapped in their very problematic circumstances: one is blind but enormously resourceful, there are cruel Nazis everywhere, the high drama of all-enveloping war over-hangs the story, picturesque characters shine in supporting roles, there are also a giant diamond, a vicious and seemingly unstoppable pursuer, and tragically disunited families. They all present ample opportunity for fast-paced plot development. It is a bit of a melodrama to be sure, but a fairly ripping read all the same, and everybody seems to be reading it, so Doerr must have got the recipe pretty right. All this lends the book a film-ready feeling that might as well scream out, “Give me my movie deal!”
Combine elegant prose, a riveting tale that alternates between story time, and storyline, a provocative topic, war — unfortunately, always a provocative topic — and the predilection of the human spirit to survive even after losing all that is good in life, and you’ll have All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr, a book so exquisite that you may just weep with the joy of its telling.  At the very least you’ll get a few shivers.  Let me start by saying that I had no intention of reading this book, mostly because I’m exhausted by the concept of war; we all are, but my friend, Lena, whose judgment I trust implicitly insisted, so I acquiesced.  Oh my, people.  Why did I wait so long?<br/><br/> The story begins at the end in 1944 in Saint-Malo, a city on the Emerald Coast of Brittany, France where 16-year old Marie-Laure LeBlanc waits, locked in the attic with little hope for the return of her uncle Etienne who was recently taken away by Germans occupying the city.  Marie-Laure, the daughter of Monsieur LeBlanc, the principal locksmith for the Museum of Natural History and a master model maker, has fled Paris with her father to Saint-Malo by the sea to be with Etienne, Monsieur LeBlanc’s brother who resides still in their boyhood home, refusing to leave the house since his service in the first World War.  Saint-Malo was supposed to be a safe haven for the pair, but during wartime, no place is safe.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Werner and Jutta are struggling to survive in Zollverein, a coal-mining district outside of Essen, Germany.  They live in a small orphanage created as a refuge for those children whose fathers died working in the mines.  It’s no secret that when Werner turns 15 he will be sent to the mines to work, the same mines that buried his father below ground and left Werner and Jutta above as orphans to scavenge whatever kind of childhood they could.  Yet Werner’s inquisitive mind doesn’t leave much time for brooding about potential future disasters.<br/><br/>So sets the scene for a ping-pong of a ride through a ten-year period in history as seen through the impressions and experiences of our two young protagonists.  It is another story about war, yes, but the language is so sublime, the story so delicately told, the characters so inexorably profound that reading it, you almost forget the gruesomeness and are left with the only thing that ever really remains:  the light.
All I knew about this book before I read it was it was a best seller and was a WWII novel.  I got a copy by accident (a re-gifted book to me) and it sat around awhile before I read it.  I felt reluctant to get into a story about WWII knowing it would likely be a well-written, emotionally wrenching ride about a subject that has been mined before many times.  WWII is a horrible dark place of history that indeed deserves attention and investigation, but my cynical side thinks that indulging in these works sometimes verges on  exploitation.  They pander to an instinct in human nature to describe great suffering in horrific detail, in a socially justifiable way.  The subject often leads to awards being won, accolades for the author.  No wonder so much art has been made about this time period!  This may not be fair, but my divided feelings on this issue may be what caused this book not to really resonate with me the way it should have, as I went in to it ready to feel manipulated.  To be fair, this book is not a typical WWII holocaust story.  It does not even focus on the holocaust, but rather takes on the onerous task of trying to create a sympathetic German soldier, named Werner,  who is a student in an elite Nazi school and is a gifted mechanical genius, especially when it comes to radios.  His story is told alongside that of a young blind French Girl, Marie-Laure, who has to evacuate her Parisian home during the invasion.  There is a subplot about a rare, potentially cursed gem Marie-Laure's father is protecting from the Nazis.  The two young people's paths cross eventually, and there is a great deal of suffering and bad times had along the way.  Along with some good moments too.<br/><br/>Doerr has created a very carefully crafted novel, and has a lyrical way of writing.  I have read that it took ten years to create this book and sometimes it feels like it took ten years, but mostly the writing is lovely.  The main characters feel real.  Marie-Laure is strong and smart, yet somewhat enigmatic.  Doerr really made her blindness a part of her character and it felt genuine when reading her way of getting through life.  Werner is sensitive and bright, and though he follows the nazi party line, he always retains some doubts about what is going on.  He seems slightly less realistic than Marie-Laure. He is a perceptive genius but it seems like a young boy would buy into the Fuhrer and all that stuff if he was immersed in the culture from childhood.  It may have been more realistic if he had a change of heart as he came of age.  His sister Jutta is a parallel character that also had an amazing sense of perspective for a young German girl growing up in that time period.  Side characters are drawn well with relatively few strokes. The scenery and world is well laid out.  Saint Malo and Paris were well evoked and had atmosphere.  The German settings were a little less clear, but still well done.  The plot is fairly predictable and full of sad and horrible moments.  It moves stepwise towards the meeting of the two main characters and has a foreboding sense of doom throughout.  I admit I flipped to the end to see who lived and who died so I could just enjoy the novel without the uncertainty hanging over me.  The middle of the novel, while Werner is in school and Marie-Laure is learning about Saint-Malo, kind of dragged for me, but not terribly so.  The gem story seemed superfluous, though it was a mechanism to add some danger to the story and show another side to the Nazi invasion.<br/><br/>All in all, a good book.  Worth reading but doesn't entirely come together to earn 5 stars from me.  It won't be one I read over and over again, but I am glad I took the time to read it.
While I enjoyed reading this book, I did not think it merited a prize of any sort. The story of the siege of St. Malo, the lives of the little blind girl and the orphan mechanical genius German boy are all interesting. While I have read a good deal about WWII over the years and have a special interest since my Dad was in the Normandy invasion, there was a lot of fresh, fascinating material here, not least the passages that take place in the Museum in Paris, and the diaspora of the works of art. To top it all off, my wife and I spent a wonderful week buzzing around Brittany and visited Cancale, Epernay and a bunch of the other towns mentioned.<br/><br/> Doerr writes reasonably well, but there were a couple of things that did not sit right with this reader. As many have mentioned, the excessive use of flashbacks and flash forwards added nothing to the story. It distracted from the total enjoyment for me and as far as I could see, did not enhance the total understanding of the work. At this point in the development of literature, virtually any competent novelist can write a story line, cut it up and intersperse it with another line or other lines. Unless there is a genuine motive for it, it becomes a parlor trick, and that I believe is what we have here.<br/><br/>I don't want to be seen as an anti-sentimentalist, but I found what happens when the paths of Marie-Laure and Werner intersect [trying not to be a spoiler here] a bit too saccharine. And unbelievable. Finally, did the story need a) the search for the stone; b) the search for the transmitter; c) the siege of St. Malo and the Normandy invasion: and d) the denouement of Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea all to come together in a crescendo in the final stages of this book. I think not. Too much of too many good things.
Spoilers below.<br/><br/>All the Light we Cannot See is a novel written by Anthony Doerr and it covers the story of a blind french girl, Maire-Laure and a German boy, Werner and his sister, Jutta. In the story, the characters eventually give each other a hand during the hard times of the war and protected what they have sought to protect from the start of the war to the very end.<br/><br/>No doubt, one reading the book cannot deny that this book has more than successfully built up an appropriately tense and dreadful atmosphere. The intense, emotional imagery is one of the things that kept my eyes glued to the pages of this book. Doerr's writing style is definitely one that succeeds in absorbing the reader into the atmosphere and keeps their emotion level to the book. Personally, I, throughout this book had definitely felt the tense atmosphere of upcoming warfare and the sense of dread and devastation.<br/><br/>The book's plot, however, is rather intriguing and incredibly slow in building up. The brief moment the whole plot builds up onto with 400+ pages of intense description is extremely predictable and disappointingly short. I also find that Doerr described Werner's feelings for Maire-Laure extremely poorly. I did not even realize he was in love with her until his friend literally says it to Jutta, who's sudden major appearance towards the end of the book is somewhat bewildering. Besides that, I found no personality in any character. It was extremely difficult for me to tell apart who was talking, and who wasn't.<br/><br/>Overall, this wasn't a poorly written book, and I would recommend this to a friend because i found the book pretty interesting, and I would say that it deserves the fame it has received upon publication.
The poetic description in this novel transports the reader to the scene.  I don't like war novels and I wouldn't call ATLWCS a war novel, but much of the time frame is smack dab in the middle of WWII.  One main character, Werner, serves for the German Army.  The other, Marie-Laure, is a victim of the French occupation.  The point of view and the alternating sections on the two characters gave the reader breaks from Werner's grim life.  If the novel had only followed Werner's time during WWII, it would have turned off those who don't need another novel to remind them that war is hell.<br/><br/>There were actually four different points of view according to the two characters and two different time frames.  When the characters were children I had no difficulty keeping track, but as the time frames began to converge I found myself trying to remember which time frame one character died in. The reader knows that their lives will cross paths at some point.  For this reader it happened too late in the novel.  In fact, about 3/4 way through the novel dragged a bit for me or maybe I was less charmed with the elegant prose and wanted the story to progress.  I think tightening of the novel would improve it although I'm sure the poetry lovers savored every word.<br/><br/>The relationships in the novel were wonderful.  What the blind girl's father did to help Marie-Laure live as independently as possible was moving as well as his innovative birthday gifts to her.  The girl's understandable dependence and love made the reader understand the pain of separation.  Werner's relationship with his sister even after he left the orphanage remained strong. One senses her influence was responsible for Werner finally saying "enough" to the killing of civilians working to help the French resistance.  Other characters and relationships displayed a range of human goodness and flaws.<br/><br/>It is quite an achievement to write a novel in a WWII which many readers find beautiful.
So many people recommended this book to me--about a blind girl in WWII France. You can't really write a story with a blind girl as the main character I reasoned. That would be boring. Another friend, whose opinions I value highly, made me promise to read it. So I did. Wow! I could not put it down. There are remarkable characters developed throughout, and it does not end at all like one might predict.<br/><br/>At the heart of the story is a fabulous jewel, much like the jewel in the Titanic movie. There are 5 copies of it circulating to keep the Nazis guessing. Which is the real one? It appears, disappears, and reappears as a light throughout the story.<br/><br/>Another story within the story is about a young boy in Germany, an engineering genius even as a child. He becomes conscripted into the Nazi army as a youth. It was truly enlightening to me to imagine, through this story, how a clear and rational thinker such as this boy was, if brainwashed early enough, can't quite cut through the convincing propaganda mentally to understand what is really going on. His childhood circumstances contributed also to his pride in his new stature and comfort.<br/><br/>There are bad guys, really good, wonderful guys, and women who go about their lives, no matter their circumstances, with their arms wide open to help and comfort those who need it. Threaded throughout the story are these two remarkable and amazing, but totally different, teenagers whose lives could hardly be much different but whose strength and wisdom connect them eventually.<br/><br/>I could not put this book down. It has a compelling, page-turning story and also an uplifting story of virtue, humanness, and love. I give it my highest recommendation.<br/><br/>Radios also play a big part in this story as well. They are almost their own characters. Residents of occupied countries are not allowed to have them, but  not everyone turns them in. In this story radios illustrate how communication can, at various times, soothe, inform, endanger, and rescue the main and even  secondary characters.
The stories of two other-worldly children caught up in war are at the centre of this Pulitzer prize-winning novel. Their distance from the affairs of the world is established in the one case by Marie-Laure’s blindness, and in the other by Werner’s prodigious mathematical and technical ability, and his obsessive interest in radio waves. While Werner’s exceptional talents mean that, to his increasing disquiet, he is drawn into the service of the Nazi regime, Marie-Laure’s blindness and consequent isolation provide her with the determination to oppose the Germans who have invaded her country. So it seems that these two are enemies, yet the narrative draws them closer and closer because of what they share.<br/><br/>And there is a third character, which is the world, its lusts, its sins and its incredible violence, symbolised by an intensely beautiful and fabulously valuable diamond, which no person fully in the world would dream of throwing away, hidden by Marie-Laure’s father inside the world-model he has created to guide her, so that she becomes the diamond’s keeper and, perhaps, the one who must determine its fate.<br/><br/>The Father is dead in Werner’s case, or lost in the prison system in Marie-Laure’s, abandoning the children in darkness to face the violent world, which bombards Marie-Laure’s city and crushes the intelligent life out of Werner’s friend Frederick, who loves birds, whose nature embodies the radio waves where Werner’s imagination lives.<br/><br/>Is the diamond a curse, or does it bring immortality? The diamond is both a natural object and an artifice, shaped by the diamond cutter. Repeatedly we are asked to consider: is it any more than a pebble? Should it not join the other pebbles under the sea, on which sea snails and other molluscs crawl, with which Marie-Laure becomes obsessed, and whose study she eventually makes her life’s work?<br/><br/>The diamond is desired for its imagined life-giving properties by the fairy-tale villain von Rumpel, whose advancing cancer gnaws away at his life with the same inevitability as the Allies advance across France towards his country. He is desperate to find the stone which he believes will save his life but, like Germany’s hopeless defence of its borders, he fails.<br/><br/>And what of the stone? Does Werner, who eventually rejects the world’s violence, return it to the sea? This, to my mind, is made quite ambiguous in the novel. Intriguingly, Marie-Laure is bequeathed a key by Werner, suggesting that she might choose to retrieve the diamond, even though she will never be able to see its beauty. As readers we can ask ourselves what we would do if we possessed the key to the beauty, but also to the violence of the world.
I really liked the set up of this novel. Mr. Doerr can use words like artists can use colors on the canvas before them. There is no doubt he is a master of coaxing feelings from colorful descriptions of settings. The scenes almost move before the readers' eyes.  I enjoyed discerning " which light " he is talking about we cannot see. Is it the light that never reaches our young blind girl or is it the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum our vision is not sensitive to or the wavelengths of radio waves that carried messages through the air to the resistance? I guess in the end I believe it is up to me and I choose all. So why 4  stars and not 5? I think it is because I am a bit of a coward when it comes to facing this era in our world's history . The extreme evil that permeates that time, I think I always have wanted to turn away from it. I just don't want to think about it long. It is too horrible. So, when I get the opportunity to read novels of this era, I tend to back away and avoid them. That is on me. Mr. Doerr's novel is filled with so much finesse and beautiful descriptions I kept waiting a for a uplifting ending, some victory or conquering love story. Instead the novel seemed like life - a few good moments in a long grind. I normally don't do this, but I want to describe one small aspect of the novel I felt fell short on what could have been. There was a scene where Marie- Laure is teeing up a record of Clare de Lune to play over the air waves in a most desperate moment. Maybe he did achieve this but, it seems he could have ( using his wonderful crafting of words) given the music " sound" that fell on many people on all sides of this terrible war at the same moment. It would have provided a brief moment in time where all the chaos would stop and all the characters would pass by the readers' eye. We could  have a vision of all the inhumanity at once being overridden by a song of beauty. All in all, I think this will be a novel that haunts me, revisiting my mind's eye many times in the coming days and eventually wishing I had given it 5 strong stars. This novel is life at its harshest and most loving moments. It tortures the heart to find hope in the dark and grace in the light.
4.5 Stars (since Amazon doesn't do half stars, I had to give it 5 here)<br/><br/>This book kept popping up on my recommended feeds all over the place.  Then it even showed up as an answer to a crossword puzzle I happened to be doing last week.  I figured that I'd seen enough signs, it was time to check it out.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for historical novels and I've always been extremely interested in all things WWII.  So I can see why this book kept popping up on my recommendation pages.  I hadn't known that this book had won the Pulitzer Prize until I was about halfway through.  And I can definitely understand why he won the award.  Anthony Doerr has put together a novel that keeps a frenetic pace and constantly goes back and forth both between points of view and also in time.  But it works.  Instead of being something disjointed and hard to follow, it fits with the time.  How many people's lives became disjointed and frantic?  I will admit that in the very beginning, it was a bit jarring to go back and forth between two stories that didn't seem to be connected in any way.  I will say that if you can keep going, you will be richly rewarded.<br/><br/>We meet Marie-Laure in Paris when she's a young child.  Before the age of 7 she is completely blind and dependent on her only remaining parent, her Papa.  He is the master of keys at the Museum of Natural History, handing out keys to everyone while his daughter learns everything she can by feeling the shells, the plants and insects and everything else within the museum.  She talks to everyone and questions everything.  He builds for her a model of their neighborhood and over the years she begins to find her independence and can lead them home from anywhere simply by remembering the model and using her senses to determine where she is.<br/><br/>We also meet Werner an orphan in German mining town.  He lives in an orphanage with his younger sister, Jutta.  He has an exceptional mind for numbers and engineering.  He also questions everything from why is the sky blue to why do cats meow.  One day while they are out searching for food and junk they can sell, Werner and his sister find a broken radio.  Within the day, he has the radio fixed and they are listening to music.  Soon they are hearing broadcasts from France.  They hear a grandfatherly voice telling stories and playing music.  His skills are soon spread through the community and he's sent to the academy for Hitler Youth to become an instrument of the Reich.<br/><br/>Both Marie-Laure and Werner are caught up in the war as it rolls through.  We follow Marie-Laure and her Papa in their flight from Paris to the home of his "crazy uncle" Etienne in Saint-Malo, a walled citadel by the sea where he lives with his housekeeper.  In a strange new home she once again learns how to navigate the world.  Once again, her Papa builds a model of the town so she can find her way around.  But with one secret, there's something hidden inside the model of their tall house by the sea.  A gemstone that some say is cursed.  One that tends to bring out the wrong type of seeker.<br/><br/>Saint-Malo is where Werner and Marie-Laure's stories become entwined.  During an Allied bombing run that was designed to flush out the German army entrenched there and free the civilian populace.  Werner learns the human cost of his intelligence and Marie-Laure learns just how strong she really is.<br/><br/>The images that are invoked by Anthony Doerr's writing are simply amazing.  You can feel the shells, see the destruction, smell the smoke.  You can feel the frustration of the civilians in Saint-Malo as well as the apathy presented by the young soldiers of the Reich.  This was simply one of the most breathtaking novels I've read this year.  It started with a slow build, through the early years of their lives and then you're rushing headlong into the waning days of the war and beyond.  It was almost a frenetic race to the finish that left you breathless but wanting more.  I can see why he won the Pulitzer Prize for this novel.  Definitely one of the best books I've read this year and if you follow me...you know that's saying something!
Wow! What an amazing book! I chose this for the 2015 Reading Challenge "book that is currently on the best seller list," and it was easy to see why there is such a long wait for it at the library!<br/><br/>Set in World War II, "All the Light We Cannot See" starts in 1934 with the stories of Marie-Laure, a then 6 year old French girl who lives with her widowed father and goes blind at a young age and Werner, an 8 year old German orphan. The story is told in alternating chapters between Marie-Laure's life and Werner's and how they grow up during the war. Marie and her father are eventually forced out of Paris and go to live with his reclusive uncle in Saint-Malo. Werner, being a genius when it comes to radio mechanics, is ultimately recruited by the German army at a young age, which saves him from a life as a miner - a life that ultimately killed his father and left he and his sister orphaned.<br/><br/>Though not being a suspense novel, this sure did make my pulse race at times! There was such a buildup in the story and I kept wondering how, when or even if Marie-Laure's and Werner's paths would end up crossing. They had to at some point, right? And then I thought they would never cross. So when the first connection between the two was established in a way that never even crossed my mind, I was quite intrigued. I loved how Marie's dad knew he wouldn't be around forever so he built her replica cities so she could learn how to navigate her way around on her own. And I loved the relationship she developed with Etienne, the reclusive uncle, who in some ways she saved. I did wish Werner's relationship with his sister didn't deteriorate so much when he was recruited by the army, but it was told in a way that made sense.<br/><br/>This was a book I had a hard time finding the time to read, but when I did have a few minutes, I could not put it down. The ending was not what I thought it was going to be, but at the same time, I felt it was realistic, especially for the time period. The flash forward in time to the 1970's was interesting to see how life turned out after the war, but I felt the flash forward to present day took a little away from the book somehow.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that at one point the book jumps ahead in time and then goes back to 1939. After this, it bounces back and forth and this is where a lot of the suspense comes in as you see what happens in the future but have not crossed the bridge from the past to see how the characters arrived there. Once I got used to the time jumps, it was fine but at first, I was confused and thought I had a copy of the book (electronic version) in which the chapters were out of order. This was largely in part due to Werner being trapped with a character who had not yet been introduced and I wondered if I had missed something that explained who he was. As this was a book club selection, I almost asked the other members of the club if anyone else's book was messed up too! And the ending made me want to cry. I also felt it was a little unrealistic that Werner was such a genius at fixing radios starting at the age of 8. But overall this was an excellent book that I would highly recommend.<br/><br/>As a side note, while reading this book, I saw the play "Rose Colored Glass," which also takes place during WW II. It was interesting to see the characters in the play listening to the cryptic messages family members were able to send out over the radio in hopes of reaching family members, while the characters in the book were doing the same thing.
Upon finishing this book I had the conflicting emotions of joyful satisfaction mingled with a certain apprehension. Why? Because I began to wonder if I would ever read a better story in the time I have left here on this planet.<br/><br/>This is not a light read and it is advised to begin with a cup of coffee and the attitude to pay close attention from the start. The format and structure of this book are unlike any other that I have read. The chapters are times, dates, and places which shuttle to and fro in no particular order and the sub-chapters are brief, sometimes a single page which Ping-Pong back and forth between the principal characters of this epic work.<br/><br/>The majority of the story takes place from the occupation of Paris by the Nazis to the conquest of the tiny ancient coastal city of Saint Malo by the allies following the D-day invasion at Normandy. Marie Laure and her father flee Paris for what they hope is the safety and security of Saint Malo and stay with her great uncle who is a brilliant eccentric suffering with PTSD from the effects of World War One.<br/><br/>It follows the young girl Marie Laure who has been blind since the age of six and her devoted father, master locksmith to the museum of natural history in Paris. Simultaneously, it follows the orphan boy, Werner, who lives in the coal mining center of Germany near the French border. Werner finds himself captivated with radios and it is discovered he has a brilliant mathematical and engineering mind. He is sent to Hitler's youth camps for indoctrination and training, then sent into the teeth of the war to pinpoint and destroy resistance broadcasts.<br/><br/>Over-arching the events surrounding these two principals is the prime center of the conflict in what could be the most coveted and dangerous artifact in the museum: An enormous cut blue diamond as "as big as a pigeon's egg" with a scarlet center and is known as "The Sea of Fire." Legend has it that the very life of the possessor of this ancient stone would be protected against all odds and harm but misfortune would fall upon all others within the owner's sphere. Has Marie Laure's father fled with this diamond and does she eventually possess it?<br/><br/>And so, the account of the lives of Marie Laure and Werner develop in parallel as their very different lives finally unite in the walled city of Saint Malo in the most astonishing way.<br/><br/>The author's incredible attention to detail, down to what seems to be the most trivial and unimportant of items or events, are not trivial in the least because virtually EVERYTHING is pivotal to the outcome of this book. The themes of what happens to ordinary people thrown into a terrible war and how they cope with going from relative comfort to utter privation and near-death are just one of the reasons this book is so totally captivating and compelling. There are moments of sheer and agonizing suspense and terror woven in. The author's depictions of the horrors of war reminded me of Cormac McCarthy and his almost poetic language of graphic violence.<br/><br/>The "Sea of Fire" threads its way throughout the entire book teasing the reader with the sense of its supernatural curse. The coincidences, along with the climax, are astonishing and this reader was thrown for a loop as the plot unfolded in a totally unexpected way.<br/><br/>Finally, is this book too complex in its structure to be made into a thrilling motion picture? To bring this masterpiece to the art of the film would be the ultimate compliment.
I read the dust cover on the inside of the book and was intrigued by the story of two young people who are destined to meet under very terrifying circumstances.  It's WWII and it's every man for himself or basically one doesn't survive.  Strength, perseverance, and willingness to stay alive no matter the cost prevails here.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a young woman who becomes blind at age six.  Her father works in museum and is also a talented woodworker who constructs the Paris neighborhood in miniature so that his daughter can navigate the streets of that city.  The Nazis arrive, the city is surrendered, and they escape to Saint-Malo where Marie-Laure once again has to learn how to get around, except this time she is not permitted to leave as the German presence is very evident and the Nazi view is that blind people as others with deficiencies don't belong in the "master race."  There's another secret:  the father is in possession of a very valuable stone and there are those in the Third Reich who are confiscating valuables like this one.  So this family is definitely in danger.  Add to all of this, the young girl discovers a radio in the attic----another item that is verboten!  Except no one knows it's there, except Marie-Laure and her great-uncle!<br/><br/>Across the pond, a young orphan named Werner has become fascinated with radios.  He understands how they work and his proficiency in solving the problems of this wireless object brings him to the attention of higher ups in the Third Reich.  He is chosen to enter the National Political Institute of Education #6 at Schulpforta.  Here is where the Jungen find out if they have the stamina to become leaders in the forces that will conquer the weak and helpless and make Deutschland the model of  a perfect society.  It soon becomes apparent that in order to succeed others must fail and they do.  They either leave school or wish they had because the classmates are brutal and one of the young men that Werner befriends is one that pays the price!<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr in his vivid descriptions depicts the Germany, France, and generally Europe at that time.  People are starving, they've lost their homes, and they live in constant fear of being arrested for any number of reasons.  The two young people that are centered in this story are able to survive because they have indeed "found the light."  For Marie-Laure it's solace in her braille rendition of 20,000 Leagues under the sea where a fantastic world opens up for her, then there is her "little village" where she can explore the town within her own room.  Having no sight also allows her the more acute sense of sound and touch.<br/><br/>Werner's tasks during this horrific period involves tracking down the forbidden radios----we can't have people consorting with the enemy after all.  And we also see what happens to folks that have these gadgets-----his comrade in arms Volkheimer takes care of that detail!  Werner is seeing first hand the effects of war on everyone he meets.  And at some point he comes in contact with a young girl who recites her favorite novel in a broadcast from her room!  And because Werner's passion involves these wonderful mechanisms that bring voices and music  into a room, he is overcome with a kind of emotion that he hasn't experienced in this tragic environment of death and destruction!  He sees a new light into an otherwise bleak existence!<br/><br/>The characters are many in this book even though the focus is on these two young people.  Doerr gives them all depth and we either grow to like them, have compassion for them, and even hate them.  There's a lot of emotion in this story and it can get confusing at times because the author chooses not to do it in chronological order.  He jumps back and forth between the early years of the war and the later.  He also alternates between Marie-Laure and Werner---where they are, what they are doing, and what they are thinking.  I was a bit unsure of this story but persevered and am glad I did!
I liked this book very much. The writing is brilliant. At the end I was pensive, thinking about how war is so much more destructive than just body counts and material destruction, but those two measures are how we hold it accountable. War is far more meaningful than that in ways that are impossible to measure. It's the end of innocence, and those who survive have the hard part. They are the ones who must rebuild, make new, go on into the future even when the past has a grip on them like a vise from which they can't hope to escape.<br/>Doerr's style of writing is masterful. He doesn't tell the story chronologically, and so it begins in August of 1944 in Saint-Malo, and the following part is in 1934 in Paris. Then the next part is back to 1944. Then to 1940. Within each part are titled chapters that shift from one character and setting to another. It sounds confusing, but Doerr weaves everything together so effortlessly that you are left with a timeless tale of love and loss set in war-ravaged Europe. And I think it has to be written this way because time isn't linear. It spirals and folds back on itself and is propelled forward and then barely moves.<br/>SPOILER ALERT*************<br/>The characters are wonderful. Werner the German orphan who wonders if he will always do what is expected--until he doesn't. He's an odd boy both in looks and in character; a genius used as a pawn when his skill is discovered by the Reich and he is "saved" from a fate in the mines where his father died. He is able to shape his mind around problems until disorder becomes order and the obstacles and the solutions are revealed.<br/>Marie-Laure the blind Parisian girl who believes that people will do as they say. Who believes her father when he tells her he will never leave her and will always keep her safe. She has a strength and a vulnerability about her and the reader desperately wants her to be safe.<br/>Her father Daniel. I can only imagine his horror when he is arrested and unable to let his daughter know where he is, knowing that she depends on him and worries about him and that she is left with an elderly housekeeper and an uncle who won't leave the house. Daniel's existence is marked day after day for years in a prison camp with nothing to do but agonize over his daughter, never knowing if she is safe, if she is loved and cared for like he would care for her. Knowing that he has left her with the Sea of Flames, and how could he do that to anyone?<br/>Some of the secondary characters were heroic. Madame Manec who leads her friends in the old ladies' resistance movement, the baker, Frau Elena, Uncle Etienne who finally leaves the house when he must. I also liked the German giant Volkheimer, epitomizing the multi-faceted character who defies the reader's judgement. Yes, he kills when he's ordered to. He's a soldier. It's his job. And he loves classical music and is willing to turn his eyes away from seeing Werner commit treason. Because he likes and respects Werner.<br/>Are some of the characters stereotypical? I've read other WW11 books with Bastian, von Rumpel and Hauptmann as the monsters, but their names were different. It's okay and probably unavoidable.<br/>The settings are described in luscious detail. The French countryside ravaged by bombing, the German mining town, so stark and gray, and Saint-Malo, beautiful and then destroyed.<br/>The diamond was a mystery. The myth surrounding it--the darkness enveloping its beautiful perfection. The warning to those who seek to possess it. Is it a symbol of war? Maybe. I'll have to think about that!<br/>At the end I so wanted some of the characters to survive, but on reflection, the end is satisfying if not a little sad. This is a true story, after all, in the universal sense. Not a happily ever after fairy tale. I think Marie-Laure summarizes it when she says about her uncle, "This, she realizes, is the basis of his fear, all fear. That a light you are powerless to stop will turn on you and usher a bullet to its mark."
Werner Pfennig and his little sister Jutta were orphans; their father was killed in the mine which Werner was destined to work in when he turned fifteen years of age. Living in the Children’s Home in Berlin with other orphans and cared for by a kind German woman, their lives were somewhat content. Werner would drag Jutta through the streets in the little cart he'd made, exploring and investigating; forever curious. But the day he discovered an old radio, broken and battered, was the beginning of the love of engineering which would stay with Werner plus change his life’s destiny in a way never envisaged.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure LeBlanc lived with her father in an apartment in Paris. Papa worked in the museum as keeper of the keys; his daily routine never changed but his love of working with his hands, building miniature pieces, puzzles to be solved, meant Marie’s life was happy and interesting. Until the day when she was only six years old – her unexpected blindness could not be explained. But her papa’s determination that she would be as independent as possible became his life’s work. He built a miniature of the neighbourhood he and Marie lived in, and then set about teaching her to find her own way. It took some time; despair of never being able to achieve what papa wanted by Marie; but eventually she was able to navigate the streets with success. But then WWII came to Paris, and the Nazi invasion caused Marie and her papa to flee Paris…<br/><br/>Werner was discovered by a Nazi commander; his talent for fixing broken things meant he was needed by the Nazi’s – taken from the Children’s Home and Jutta and ensconced in a Military Academy which was run by brutal German zealots, the cruelty and fanaticism were a day to day occurrence. But when unexpectedly Werner was removed from the academy, he found himself in the midst of the war. His youth was ignored by his superiors; they needed his expertise.<br/><br/>Keeping to themselves, Marie and her papa lived their time quietly in Saint-Malo with Marie’s great uncle Etienne and Madame Manec. Marie once again learned to navigate the house they lived in; but there was change and danger around. What would happen to their future? Would the war; the Nazis reach Saint-Malo?<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr. A beautifully written, heartfelt rendition of WWII; the innocence of children and that loss of innocence through the heartbreak of war - the poignancy and sadness, hope and love are all there. The unbelievably descriptive words are amazing. The author has an incredible way with words; words that mean so much, explain so much – I almost felt as if I was there. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this wonderful and very special novel.
I love books set during the World Wars, I think it's a fascinating time period and full of very touching stories against a tense backdrop. This book certainly brings it to life. The story is told in two parts, moving back and forth between the past, charting the childhood of both Marie-Laure and Werner, and the 'present' (for them) - a period of a few days when they are both in the city of Saint Malo while it is bombed.<br/><br/>Through Werner's childhood you see the development of Nazi propaganda in Germany and it's effect on his village, including the children in the orphanage. For me that was as scary and sad as the events at the special boarding school he later ends up at, which is indoctrinating boys as it trains them for the army. Marie-Laure shows the changes in Paris as the Nazi's come ever closer and then how her community in Saint Malo overcome their fear and begin resistance work.<br/><br/>I got frustrated with the blurb for this book before I started because I didn't think it hinted enough at the plot but now I'm glad it left things out. There are certain threads that run through the story connecting things and acting as catalysts for events, but I don't want to talk about them because I think it was part of the experience to discover them myself as I went along, and make the connections, without being told what was going to be the connection before even starting. What I will say is that Werner's friendships and encounters shape his life, and you see how one thing leads to another. Similarly, Marie-Laure's relationship with her father, his colleagues, and then the housekeeper and my favourite, her reclusive uncle, change over the story and were beautiful and touching to see.<br/><br/>I really loved this story and I hope you'll give it a try too. The ending did let the book down a little, I think, carrying on for a few chapters past what should have been the end. Despite that, it's one of my favourite books of the year so far and I'm so glad I got to read it.
Elements of this book were amazing. The writing, itself, was beautiful. I found myself "savoring" it and unable to read it quickly. I loved the settings and descriptions. I fell in love with the characters: Marie-Laure, her father, Etienne, Madame Manec, Werner, Jutta, Frederick, Volkheimer... and the long-gone grandfather who made the recordings with Etienne. There were some heart-breaking scenes as well as heart-warming ones.<br/><br/>But the story itself... First of all, it never grabbed me. I never felt the need to keep reading and it took me over five weeks to finish it. I think part of this was the fact that it switched between characters and went back and forth in time. A character is in danger in 1944... but the next chapter is 1938... so there is no urgency to keep reading. Also, the pacing was off. Time was slowed down in much of the novel to show small, specific events. But then the author seemed to rush the climax and actually summarized the ending, which I did not like at all. It felt... empty. After connecting the reader so closely with the main characters, Doerr finishes the story by distancing us from them and not making us feel much at all.<br/><br/>One character's death was so matter-of-fact and anti-climactic that I found myself wondering (and hoping) that he had not died after all.<br/><br/>I admire Doerr's skill with prose and his ability to create such vivid characters. But I don't think writers can overlook the importance of the story itself. The prose is like the icing on a cake. It can make your cake look beautiful and add some extra sweetness. But if the cake itself (the story) lacks substance, the whole thing falls flat.<br/><br/>If this story were shorter, I'd recommend it to others, because the writing is really spectacular. But it's 530 pages.... too much of a commitment for a book that's not a "page-turner".
I read this story all the way through, and I can appreciate the scale of this book and the research involved in writing it.  I am not a writer and I couldn't have taken on something this ambitious.  I found this book to be echoing real life, with fragments, frayed ends, mistakes that never get fixed.  If you like that kind of thing, you could get very caught up in the poetic writing style and sentence fragments and find its non resolution very beautiful.  But I didn't grow to love this book's characters, I didn't like the ending or the way the book was organized.  The plot started out so promising but left several things hanging by the end, and then the book just ...stopped.  The main characters do not end up being able to love each other or spend any time together after the war is over... perhaps "true love" is too predictable as an ending, but why torture the reader with the bleakness of the war (burning cities, powerful and cruel people, horrible deaths, starvation, looting, pointless atrocities) and not give us a reason for getting through all of it?  It's a work of fiction, why choose to focus on death and not on the life and love that happened after the victory?  I felt tortured as a reader.  Sure, I suppose not all stories have happy endings.  The blind girl's father is never found, there is no reunion or resolution there.  Ok, it's war.  But what about the remaining living characters?  The blind girl's great uncle may have healed from his mental illness, they may have grown closer towards the end of his life as they lived together, but we don't find out about that, because not much time is spent tying up these details.  Jutta visits Marie as adults but they spend no time talking about Werner.  ??  Put those details in so that we do not feel like offing ourselves at the end, ha ha.  As well, the story's valuable diamond seemed so important to the plot, but in the end, we don't even find out what exactly happened to it.  Last of all, the way the story timeline was organized was too strange.  Was the author was hiding behind it and letting it distract the reader from the fact that the story as a whole didn't function as well as it could have?  I didn't understand the purpose of it.  I would have preferred something sequential with better plot. In the end, I still give this book three stars, because of the concept, the poetic writing style, the scale of the story and the interesting descriptions of the settings throughout the book.
Set in France and Germany during World War II, Anthony Doerr’s new novel alternates rhythmically between two main characters, a German boy Werner and a French girl Marie-Laure.  Each has both handicaps and extraordinary abilities.  Werner is an orphan who is a wunderkind with radios and therefore ends up in a German technical unit that tracks resistance radios.  Marie-Laure is blind and yet able to track her way around Paris and Saint-Malo with the aid of scale models built by her doting father.  Like Werner, she has a scientific fascination--with shells of all kinds.  Werner’s friend Frederick, in turn, is a bird-enthusiast.  And Marie-Laure’s father is a master of locks and 3-d puzzles.  Finally, a German officer in charge of gathering art treasures for the Third Reich has his own fixation on a particularly large and legendary diamond that involves all of the characters in one way or another.  Scientific preoccupations run through this novel, and are, without doubt, a fascination of the author.  The novel itself becomes a kind of cabinet of curiosities.  This sense is heightened by the author’s habit of making repeated lists: for example, “He oils latches, repairs cabinets, polishes escutcheons. He leads her down hallway after hallway into gallery after gallery…There are carpenters’ shops, taxidermists’ studios, acres of shelves and specimen drawers, whole museums within the museum” (29).  The lists give both a sense of repetition and order to the prose, and a sense of depersonalization.  In his most poetic passages, Doerr makes a metaphoric leap from science and technology to philosophy, as when he compares the swirling paths of electromagnetic waves to the motions of souls: “And is it so hard to believe that souls might also travel those paths?...That great shuttles of souls might fly about, faded but audible if you listen closely enough?” (529) It is these poetic moments, reflecting on the flux and transience of life, that make the novel moving.  As if each stone, each blade of grass, each word, each individual life is part of a great mystery unfolding over eons of time. If there is anything flawed in this gem of a novel, it is the way the very short chapters toss the reader back and forth from one character and setting to another, continually breaking the flow of the narrative and making the reader re-adjust their mental lens. This bipolarity eases toward the end, as the stories of the two main characters merge in a climactic finale. Lori Eshleman, author of Pachacuti: World Overturned.
Just before the start of World War II Marie-Laure LeBlanc is a little girl living in Paris with her father, the keeper of keys at the  Museum of Natural History. Marie is blinded by cataracts at age six, so her father - who's clever at building models and puzzle boxes - constructs a wooden model of the neighborhood to teach Marie to get around. Marie is an intelligent child and budding naturalist who enjoys hanging out with scientists at the museum. She also cherishes her braille book "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" by Jules Verne.<br/><br/>As it happens, the Natural History Museum is rumored to house a large, beautiful diamond called the "Sea of Flame. Myths say that whoever possesses the diamond becomes immortal but his/her loved ones suffer terrible misfortunes. After the war starts -  when the Germans are about to take over  Paris - the museum packs up and sends off its treasures in an attempt to keep them safe. Many people also flee the city and Marie and her father make their way to the coast city of Saint-Malo.  There they live with Marie's great uncle, an eccentric, kindly gentleman who, like Marie, has an interest in science.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a German town, teenager Werner Pfennig and his sister Jutta live in an orphanage. Like all boys in the area, at the age of fifteen Werner will be forced to work in the local coal mines where his father was killed. Werner, however, has an almost genius talent with electronics, especially radios. When this comes to the attention of the Nazis, Werner is sent to a select school to hone his skills. Soon afterwards young Werner is conscripted into the German army, where he joins a unit that tracks down radios used by the resistance to broadcast seditious information. When found, the resistance members are killed and the radio equipment confiscated.<br/><br/>Meanwhile a terminally ill Nazi officer - who apparently  believes the stories about the "Sea of Flame" - is obsessively searching all over France to get his hands on the stone.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, we follow Marie and Werner's experiences during the war. As Werner aids the Nazis in their destructive path around Europe Marie is drawn into a resistance movement. Towards the end of the war (and the end of the book), when the Allies are bombing Germany to smithereens, Werner's army unit arrives in Saint-Malo. At this point the various story lines come together and Werner and Marie become acquainted and form an unlikely friendship.<br/><br/>As expected in a book about war, there are many disturbing scenes. The Nazis are especially brutal, even to fellow Germans. At Werner's school, for example, 'weak students' are singled out and harassed. Werner's gentle friend Frederick, a dreamer who likes to bird-watch, becomes the focus of a particularly sadistic school official. Werner, in turn, suffers tremendous guilt for his inability to help his friend. Another unpleasant character is a French perfumer in Saint-Malo, who - wanting to gain favor with the Nazis - snitches (or make up lies) about his neighbors. This leads to fear, paranoia, and the arrest of Marie's father. In contrast, there are scenes of a vicious Nazi thinking about his beloved children, a reminder that (hard as it is to believe) Nazis had some human instincts.<br/><br/>The book has a strong, compelling plot and characters that are well-drawn and believable. And Anthony Doerr does a masterful job of interweaving the various story lines so that they all mesh at the book's climax.<br/><br/>This is a good book, worth reading.
This is not my usual read, but I was curious after seeing it everywhere, and figured I can take a break from my YA and fantasy reads. It is a book filled with beautiful prose and imagery and poignant emotions. It’s a book that you have to take time to savor and enjoy and not rush through, and that’s exactly what I did.<br/><br/>The book follows two children, Marie-Laure, a blind girl in France, and Werner, an orphan in Germany. Marie lives with her father in Paris in the 1930s before the war began and goes with her father to the National Museum where her father works as a locksmith. They had to leave Paris when the war began and went to Saint Malo, where her great-uncle lives. There is no parallel to the beauty of Doerr’s writing and how he brought the world alive for a blind girl. Marie’s story is heartbreaking and is a story of a child who had to grow up too early. It’s a similar story to other survivors who at the end of war never have closure, never find out what happened to her family or friends.<br/><br/>Werner was an orphan in a mining town in Germany, along with his sister Jutta. Werner was a natural with radios and wavelengths. Some would say he was a genius, and that was how he escaped being sent to work in the mines. One official discovered his brilliance and sent him to military school. I don’t read a lot of WWII novels often, so it was depressing even see the German side of the story. Yes, they did horrible things, but from Werner’s side, you see the brainwashing of the German population, starting with young boys. Anyone that did not fit in with the ideology was eliminated or worse. Werner’s story is an example of that. He tried so hard to fit in and had to do some horrible things, and I think he could never forgive himself. I’m not saying all Germans deserve sympathy, but Werner was just as much a victim to the regime as the people of the conquered countries.<br/><br/>The story jumped between two different timelines. It began with August 1944 then jumped all the way back to 1934 to trace the stories of these two kids. Each chapter is short and concise, and I think that’s also what made it easier for me to stop and put it down and to really take the time to enjoy it. There’re parts near the end that was very unsatisfactory, when Marie and Werner finally meet. I wish the author had done more there. I can see that the way Doerr presented it was realistic and in line with the overall tone of the story. Still, it broke my heart and left my wanting for more.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it for a book that’s usually out of my genre and am glad I experienced it.
All the Light We Cannot See is by Anthony Doerr.  The novel is about people living during WWII.  You get a view of what life was like for ordinary people under the Germans.  It begins in Paris and moves to Saint Malo on the Brittany coast.  The main characters are Marie-Laure, who is blind; her father; her uncle Etienne; Werner, a genius with radios; and Volkheimer, a very tall German soldier who is in charge of a small group of men searching for radios.<br/>Marie-Laure and her father lived in Paris.  He built her a replica of Paris so she could learn to make her way around outside.  Mainly, though she stayed inside and read the Braille books her father gave her.  She would go to the Museum with her Father while he worked.  He told her what everything was and allowed her to touch some of the items in the museum so she could become independent.  He told her of a precious blue diamond, The Sea of Flames, which was hidden away in the museum.  It brought good luck to the holder but not to those around him.  The only way to stop the curse was to throw it in the sea.<br/>As the Germans advanced towards Paris, Marie-Laure and her father left Paris to deliver something to a man in the South.  When they arrived, he had already left so they walked on towards Saint-Malo to see his brother, Etienne.  Etienne was an ex-WWI-soldier and would rarely leave his room much less his house.  He gave them sanctuary and talked to Marie-Laure about mollusks and shells.  He showed her his prized radios and even a hidden one. As they stayed, her father made her a map of the town just like the one he built in Paris.  Their house was a puzzle box that if followed correctly opened to reveal a large stone which her father said was a fake.  Father is taken to be questioned for measuring buildings.  He is thought to be a spy when in reality he was just building something for his daughter. Marie-Laure is left with her uncle.<br/>Werner is an orphan with a little sister Jutta.  In his school he out shown all the other kids and did a lot of reading on his own.  He was especially interested in radio waves.  Instead of going into the mines as he was destined, he was taken by the Germans to an elite school.  Here he learned mathematics and how to use radios.  He also learned to be a German soldier.  He was taken by a major along with Volkheimer, another student, to learn to triangulate signals to pinpoint a radio.  Once he could do this, they traveled extensively to find hidden radios. They ended up in Saint- Malo.<br/>What could Werner and Marie-Laure have in common?  How could a blind girl and a German soldier meet?  Did he know about the Star of Flames and was he after her?<br/>It is an interesting book and I would definitely recommend it even though it is a slow read. You have to read and then have to stop and think of what you read.
All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr, is a novel I probably never would have picked up had it not come to me as a gift from my daughter Sara, whom I am ever hounding to read the many books I send her way. So it was with a certain sense of obligation that I took this heavy volume out to my deck on a recent sunny Saturday morning with a cup of coffee and turned to chapter one. It was dusk on the next day with an emptying bottle of beer in the fading crepuscular light when I finished it. In between, I did little else but read this book, a complex work of literary fiction that runs well over five hundred pages yet is so compelling and so well-written that it seems impossible to let it go. I cannot recall the last time a book of this merit and intricacy has gripped me with such force, literally from cover-to-cover.  No wonder that All the Light We Cannot See was the winner of both the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the 2015 Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction, as well as other prestigious awards.<br/> Doerr, an otherwise little-known author, has written a dazzling multifaceted masterpiece that cannot adequately be described or deconstructed in a review format.  The premise of the storyline sounds simple and perhaps so sentimental that it might make the potential reader turn away: the lives of a blind teenaged French girl and a brilliant young orphaned German soldier intersect in unlikely circumstances during the tumultuous liberation of World War II German-occupied France.  But there is virtually nothing simple or sentimental in this multilayered narrative that in a microcosm manages to trace the growth of fascism in Depression-era Germany, explores the art of the locksmith, the science of electromagnetic waves, the evolution of mollusks, the construction of a radio from spare parts, the literature of Jules Verne (in Braille!), the methods of a small-town French Resistance cell, the architecture of a medieval city, the perils of combat on the Russian front – and even includes as its central character a legendary and priceless diamond that could possibly bestow upon its owner both a unique blessing and a terrible curse.<br/>There is so much to extol about this extraordinary book! What appears to be an obvious metaphor in the title turns out to be a wide panoply of allegory embedded in the narrative structure of the tale, but – in a testament to the craft of the writer – much of it is hardly evident until the closing stages of the work.  All of the characters are exceedingly well-drawn with a sophisticated dimensionality not weighed down by unnecessary detail. And the prose – well this is the shining glory of it all because Doerr writes so well that the complicated architecture of the novel never slows down the pace, so paragraphs and chapters can be gulped down by the reader as if it was pulp, which it most certainly is not.  In this and in many ways I am reminded of Hemingway, although the author’s voice could not be more different in its expression. Hemingway too used complex literary techniques like the objective correlative, but these were often only palpable for the reader on reflection and never slowed the narrative down.  Like Hemingway, there is not a single extraneous bit of information in the entire novel: Doerr imparts only and exactly what you need to know, about the characters, about the place and time, about the plot.  Thus Doerr takes apart and rebuilds a radio the way Hemingway would a rifle, not only to add veracity to the tale but because it is essential to the story.<br/>This novel truly is almost perfect. The only fault I could find is with the protagonist’s agoraphobic great-uncle, who strikes me as perhaps just a bit too old to be a veteran of the Great War in his youth as portrayed.  But this is such a minor quibble that it is perhaps hardly worth mentioning, except by way of illustrating that only in such nitpicks can we locate flaws, and even these are so minor as to barely warrant attention. I highly recommend this superlative novel to every audience.
The story is of a German boy and his sister growing up pre-WW2 in the mining districts of the Ruhr, orphaned by the mines and living in a children’s home until he grows old enough to go into the mines, and of a blind French girl growing up with her father, the head locksmith for the Paris Natural History Museum.  The reality of Nazi Germany steadily pervades the life of the former as their fellow members of the children’s home become part of Hitler Youth.  The German boy turns out to be something of a mathematical and engineering genius who can build motors and radios from scrap at a precocious age and ends up being selected for a special school to groom the new elite for the greater glory of the Reich.  The girl is taught by her father to find her way around by counting and memorizing steps, curbs, drainage sewers, etc. and is carried on his back out of Paris to a distant relative on the Brittany isle of St. Malo to escape the German invasion.  When things go bad for the Germans, the elite school is disbanded and the boys sent to the Wehrmacht.  In the meantime, the boy had worked with the physics instructor to develop a method for locating the source of radio transmission by triangulation, and is sent to one of the special units set up for this purpose to ferret out resistance radio operators in Ukraine.  This unit is sent to St. Milo to locate an operator transmitting information to the invading Americans, who happens to be the blind girl’s eccentric and reclusive uncle.  The American bombardment finally comes, the boy dies and the girl survives. There are several subplots, one about an elaborate scheme to save from the invading Germans a rare diamond from the French museum, which the girls’s father had secreted in an elaborate model of St. Malo with spring latches and sliding doors that he had built for his daughter, and a German geminologist who finally tracked it down, only to be killed in the American bombardment.<br/><br/>The  superb portrayal of the times and of the horror of Nazi Germany and of the war is what makes this gem of a novel, of course.  I am reminded of “The Book Thief” and “Stones in the River”, and the elite German boys school recalls “The Lord of the Flies”.
All the Light We Cannot See is a World War II novel primarily about two people. The first is Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl who grew up in Paris and moved, with her father to Saint-Malo, a port city in northwest France that was bombed by American and British forces as part of the invasion of France. The second is Werner Pfennig, a German orphan who has an amazing ability to understand the workings of radios as well as an ability to track down transmitters, a skill that is important to the German army. The idea of a book about an orphan and a blind child on opposite sides of WWII sounds as if it might turn sappy, but it never does. Anthony Doerr never lets his characters feel sorry for themselves, disappointed at times, but never sorry.<br/><br/>I didn't understand Doerr's choice to tell the story in a non-chronological way, or I should say partially chronological. For a good portion of the novel the book was moving between three stories. The first two took place at the same time, the stories of Marie-Laure and Werner as children and teenagers. The third was Werner's story, set when he was a little older and part of the war effort. It was easy enough to follow these story lines and the chapters were often dated, so this didn't bother me. But I didn't understand the advantage, either. The one time the odd trajectory of the story did bother me was late in the book when a sergeant-major is looking for a house. From the perspective of the reader he shows up at the house before he discovers where it is.<br/><br/>What I loved about this book were the two main characters, especially Werner. He observed the people around him and admired the ones who deserved his admiration. His actions grew out of the type of person he was and the situations in which he was placed. I also loved the way Doerr added interest to his plot through the wartime setting, the curse on a jewel, and the use of radios as both weapons and lifelines.<br/><br/>Steve Lindahl – author of Motherless Soul and White Horse Regressions
Of the books that have influenced me, whose images and memories and thoughts stay with me, this is among the most profound I’ve read in the last decade.  Before reading this, I read Kristin Hannah's Nightingale, which was excellent, but not on a par with this.<br/><br/>The story shows the lives of two children who came of age in Hitler’s web, one a blind French girl growing up in occupied France, the other a brilliant German boy reluctantly indoctrinated in the Hitler Youth.  As Doerr twines these two lives together in a plot filled with destiny, he shows how Hitler brought out the basest nature in people, how he empowered the worst, and who those people tend to be (not nationalities, but personalities).  Werner is defined not only by his brilliance but by his heart.  Though he knows right from wrong he lacks the toughness of his closest friend and of his sister to hold his course, leading to a life filled with regrets.  Marie Laure lives with few regrets but great sadness.  Her blindness creates dependencies on others that she has the strength to both appreciate and rise above.<br/><br/>You can feel Werner’s struggle with himself and Marie Laure’s struggle with a world that tears apart her life.<br/>Without ever detracting from the story, reducing the tension, or pulling us from the flow of the novel, Doerr shows us who we are at bottom and what we can be when we rise.<br/><br/>He deepens the book by drawing fully even his minor characters and always speaking through them, never for them.  The writing is lyrical but never boastful.  He avoids the clichéd phrases that too many modern writers invoke for the appearance of lyricism.  His language and metaphors are natural and evocative.<br/><br/>All The Light We Cannot See is a powerful, intricate story of a pivotal time with strong characters and beautiful writing and so much to say.  Someday I know I’ll read it again.<br/><br/>After (or before) you read this book, if you want a true story of living under occupation and fighting Hitler from a position of desperate weakness, read Jan Karski's Story of A Secret State.  It's a memoir that chronicles the Polish resistance written by one of the greatest heroes of the 20th century.
Some books are very hard to review.  This is one such book.  It evoked so many different emotions in me that I don’t know where to start and I just don’t have the words to express accurately how it moved me.  Therefore, I am afraid that this is a wordy review as I try to give you a glimpse of the visceral quality of the story.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is an engaging, beautiful, uplifting, yet heart wrenching story.  I would be incredibly surprised if it didn’t leave you a bit changed deep in your heart and soul.  The tone is not sad.  It is breath-taking.  Showing that even in the deepest and darkest moments of human depravity there are parts of the soul reaching out for glimpses of good; holding on to the beauty that they have known and now crave.  This story gives a very different voice to war.<br/><br/>You are drawn into the lives of two young people who are in some respects very similar but there is an antithesis between their fates of birth.<br/><br/>Occupied France | Marie-Laure<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is growing up in Paris.  Blind yet highly independent due to the creativity and pure genius of her father.  Through Marie-Laure you are shown the harsh reality of life in occupied France.  You see the strength of the French people as they help each other to survive and go far beyond mere survival.  You see their unified purpose and resolve in helping to defeat their enemies and you can’t help but cheer them on.<br/><br/>Through Marie-Laure we are given a picture of the deep history of France.  You are shown the pride and loyalty of the French people to their history and culture; a history worth preserving.<br/><br/>Nazi Germany | Werner<br/><br/>Werner is a young German orphan struggling to survive in an orphanage with his sister, the other orphans, and the tirelessly hardworking and loving woman caring for them.  Werner is gifted with an incredible ability to understand electronics; because of that genius he is pushed into the war machine that was Germany at the age of 14.<br/><br/>You are drawn with Werner into the depths of human nature and depravity as he finds himself caught in a militaristic system with no personal rights.  He is inundated with the continual propaganda of the time; the requirement to be strong and single-minded in excellence, strength, and ethnic purity.  You ache over the situations that Werner is forced into and you hate many of the actions that he takes but you are hard pressed to condemn them because he truly is a gentle soul and you know that he only has the choice of obedience or serious abuse and likely death.  You can viscerally feel Werner's abhorrence of the situations that he encounters in war and his disdain for the ostentatious wealth and utter lack of respect for human life within the German elite.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of my favorite quotes that give you an idea of the struggle within Werner:<br/><br/>"The bistro is overcrowded; everyone’s mouths move too quickly; the woman talking to Frederick’s mother is wearing a nauseating quantity of perfume; and in the watery light it seems suddenly as if the scarf trailing from the dancing girl’s neck is a noose."<br/><br/>"Werner feels something inside him screw tighter, tighter."<br/><br/>“Your problem, Werner,” says Frederick, “is that you still believe you own your life.<br/><br/>The most incredible aspect of the story though is how the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner intersect and how they share a mutual respect for one another which for most would never occur nor make any sense.<br/><br/>To recap, you will smile, you will laugh, you will rejoice, and you will shed a few tears.  You are moved from rapture to despair.  You experience with the characters empathy and anger, joy and loss.  You see the best of humanity and the worst.  All the Light We Cannot See pushes at the depths of your heart.<br/><br/>Take a moment out of your crazy life; relax and breathe in the beauty that is this story.  You truly shouldn’t miss it.<br/><br/>I was given this ARC in exchange for my honest opinion.  My many thanks to the author and publisher.
All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is a poetically charged tale of morality and love in wartime, as well as an exploration into the value of life even in the darkest of times. Told in the present-tense with a switchback narrative that guides the reader between different stages of past and present, All the Light We Cannot See mainly follows two characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, in the mid to late 1940’s.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a young blind girl living in France at the beginning of World War Two, while Werner is a perfectly Aryan German youth. Worlds apart and yet closer to one another than even the reader at first realizes, Marie-Laure and Werner spend the pages of the novel navigating their youth, their familial struggles, and their passions in life in the midst of wartime. Though we at first meet both characters later in their lives, we eventually trace them back to their childhood: Marie-Laure with her father in Paris and Werner in a mining town orphanage in Germany. However, within mere pages we follow Marie-Laure back to where we met her at her Uncle’s home in Saint-Malo and Werner to Schulpforta, a school for Nazi youth and eventually into the ranks.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure despite her blindness is a master of navigation and has a penchant for sea creatures and reading. Werner, not at all aligned with Hitler’s plan for the Germany or the world, sees Nazism not only as an escape from the mine that stole his father’s life but also as a gateway into engineering and science: his two greatest passions. From the outset Marie-Laure is a strong-willed character with a purity unparalleled by nearly any other character. She is constantly worrying about others, trying to do the right thing, and urging those around her into happier states of being through her optimism and persistence.<br/><br/>Werner, on the other hand, finds himself constantly silenced by a fear to act out of the ordinary and to be punished for doing so. While Marie-Laure was nearly born an outcast, Werner, with his hair of snow and eyes of blue struggles to remain neutral and invisible among the crowd so that he can pursue his passions even if at the expense of others. He does his best to protect those around him, such as his younger sister Jutta and his friend Fredrick; however, he does so passively, never actually standing up for either of them or acting on their behalves. Though rattled with guilt for his inaction throughout the novel, it is not until Werner has aged into his teens and experienced the more palpable horrors of war that he begins to act on his desire to do good.<br/><br/>Questions of value both metaphoric and literal are continually raised in the novel as Doerr prompts the reader to think about what riches really mean. The riches of gemstones, of family, and of the preciousness of life are examined by nearly every character and understood in a different way by each. Despite risking his life for a rare blue diamond, Marie-Laure’s father at one point comments that “a diamond…is only a piece of carbon compressed in the bowels of the earth for eons and driven to the surface in a volcanic pipe.” Of all the riches in the world, which is worth living for, dying for, fighting for?<br/><br/>Doerr suggests that perhaps it is all the light that we cannot see which, though invisible, guides us through the toughest of times to find purpose, happiness and rare moments of perfected and rich bliss. “All of light is invisible” Doerr notes, and yet it is there, always there, manifesting itself in different forms: in reflection, in colors, in our imagination, in dreams. Marie-Laure, the one character who is literally without light throughout nearly the entire novel proves to be the heroine: untouched by the darkness that has surrounded her.<br/><br/>A beautifully woven tale about finding light even in the darkest of places, Antony Doerr’s New York Times Best Seller and Pulitzer Prize winning novel All the Light We Cannot See is both inspiring and moving with a momentum that keeps you reading page after page.
Outstanding. This book was a mesmerizingly beautiful experience with eloquent characters and a hauntingly beautiful premise. Antony Doerr created an outstanding story that depicted World War II in a whole new light. Using children as his characters created a new layer of the story that made this book stand out.<br/><br/>Marie Laurie a little girl who goes blind when she is 8. She lives in France with her father who works at the museum as a locksmith. Her father creates a miniature scale model of the town they live in and teachers her how to navigate the world without her eyes.<br/><br/>Werner is an orphan boy living in a German orphanage. He is a curious, smart boy who has a fascination for radios. He quickly finds himself wrapped up in a Hitler training camp and finds himself thrust into war.<br/><br/>The war quickly changes both Werner and Marie Laurie’s lives and the story follows their lives as they change from these innocent children into survivors.<br/><br/>I think my most favorite feature of this book was the separate yet intertwined characters. Although Marie and Werner only meet fleetingly at the end, it seems that their stories are together throughout the whole book. I loved the way that Doerr crafted these separate, almost opposite lives of his two characters and somehow made them almost the same. They were both struggling to see what they wanted, both struggling to understand life and the war, both trying to cope with a situation that wasn’t ideal. I love how they both had a “rock” that they looked to for support and that both were forced to handle difficult situations without that person. I especially loved the subtle radio that connected the two characters from the very beginning.<br/>Doerr managed to take such an ugly event and craft this beautiful story of loss and growing up and lessons learned. He crafted strong characters that you rooted for without them feeling superficial. The support characters were heartwarming and strange yet fit so perfectly into the story. I love the ending. Like, bawled my eyes out for the entire last section of the book good. It was such an unexpected and heartwarming way to end the book. I loved that it didn’t end perfectly, or even how most would want it, but it ended perfect for the book.<br/><br/>I will say, that this book was hard; exceptionally hard. It flips from Marie to Werner every chapter which is around 1-5 pages. On top of that it switches from pre-war to war every section which can last 15 pages or more. I found that I had to flip back to remind myself where we were in the story. I found this to be different and I loved it. It created an experience in the book, you had to focus and really absorb what was going on so that you could pull from the next section and tie back what was happening. It made me have to really live the book, feel the characters and engross myself with the plot. What a wonderful experience to actually live a book, like I was walking through the pages of Saint Malo as those final bombs were dropping. I felt as if I was following Marie as she counted road grates and went to the bakery for bread.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this story for anyone that loves a good book. I have read reviews and I honestly feel that the bad reviews were because these people didn’t live this story. It is a hard book with a hard premise to grasp. There are whispers of connections between the characters throughout the whole book and if you don’t sit back and enjoy the experience, you might miss them.
ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE REVIEW<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr is a celebrated writer whose first successes were with short stories.  He has added fiction, nonfiction, and memoirs to his repertoire, creating a short but notable list of credits.  The list of prizes he has won is impressive.  “All the Light We Cannot See” won the big one—the Pulitzer.  It is deserving.<br/><br/>Two children of the 1940s, a blind French girl and a German boy prodigy, travel separate but converging paths during the last days of the Second World War and meet briefly as Germany nears defeat.  Their story is poignant, filled with individual terrors, and ends with a compassionate encounter amidst the rubble and horror of war<br/><br/>The girl, Marie Laure, blind from the age of six, lives with her father in Paris where he is master of the locks at the Museum of Natural History.  He builds her a scale model of their part of the city so the girl can navigate on her own with her feet and cane.  He hides a diamond of great value deep within it.  When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast where she ends up in her great uncle’s six-story narrow house, full of stairways, doors, and murky hidden spaces.  There she remains hidden with her treasure and uncle’s forbidden radio as the war rages around her.<br/><br/>In Germany the boy, an orphan, displays a mastery for building and fixing radios, a skill that places him in a military academy noted for its selectivity and brutality where he ultimately becomes an expert tracker of Resistant partisans and their radio traffic.  His activities take him to Russia and eventually to Saint-Malo, where he discovers Marie-Laure living in her own dark world, hiding from the Germans and the war.<br/><br/>Doerr is adept at intermingling the many lives that make up the story.  The Germans, French partisans, shopkeepers, scientists, and frightened residents are realistically depicted, their actions detailed. The book is lengthy but is so gloriously written that, aided by the writer’s use of spare language and brief chapters, time passes quickly.  The book has been criticized as being too simplistic, but I applaud the writing style that emphasizes clear narration and lyrical use of words.<br/><br/>Factual background adds to the richness of Doerr’s writing.  The<br/>science of the mind, and matters of the heart are explored in the story but are so seamlessly inserted in the narrative they seem natural and unobtrusive.<br/><br/>Doerr’s research into the diverse fields of radio, invertebrates, firearms, precious stones, and flora and fauna shows up in his expert discourses and accounts for the 10 years he needed to get this book written.  He reports that he wrote two additional books during the time he was putting together “All the Light.”<br/><br/>I recommend this book as an illuminating look at a writer who is at the top of his game.  The skills of plotting, characterization, wording, and scenic description are on full display, creating a great reading experience.<br/><br/>Schuyler T Wallace<br/>Author of TIN LIZARD TALES
'All the Light We Cannot See' by Anthony Doerr is a wonderful book with beautiful narration and a touching tale. As one can see with the majority of reviews, the narration of the story is fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed the style and way Doerr captures the feelings and imagery of the people and places in this story.<br/><br/>The story is set primarily in the years leading up to and during the Second World War. It follows two main characters, Marie - Laure, a young French girl, and Werner, a young German orphan. We meet a young Marie - Laure at a very early age. She lives with her father who works at the National History Museum as the lock smith. Marie - Laure looses her eye sight and her father teaches her to navigate Paris with the help of a scale model of the city. Werner is a young orphan living in a small coal mining town in Germany. Werner has a strong aptitude for radios and is able to fix  and understand their workings. With this skill Werner is accepted into a Hilter Youth school that teaches him more about radios and the Nazi mindset. The war soon envelopes Europe causing Marie - Laure and her father to flee Paris to a smaller coastal town and Werner enters the German army.<br/><br/>The war rages and life becomes a struggle for Marie - Laure and the French. Werner's task group roots out enemy radio signals which leads him to the first signals that sparked his interests. Enter a mysterious precious gem and a curse that is rumored to follow it. Is this gem real? Can it be the cause of a hard life? Even with a hard life, can one see the beauty in the midst of the storm?<br/><br/>This wonderful story follows our two main characters and the people that enter and leave their lives. Showing the small connections between us all and how actions and decisions cause ripples that effect us all. This has been one of my favorite books for 2015.
This story is basically about two people, Marie-Laure,  a blind girl living with her father in France before the German occupation of France and Werner Pfenning, a young German boy, orphaned and living with his sister Jutta in a home for orphaned children.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure’s father is the key holder of the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle, which is where a gemstone called the Sea of Flame is kept safe, at least for a time  Much of the story is about this stone and its whereabouts because in order to protect it, fake stones are handed out for safekeeping, the protectors unsure which stone is in fact the real gem.<br/><br/>As Marie-Laure tries to survive in France while her father is away, Werner has been chosen to attend an elite school for the Third Reich. His knack with all things electronic, primarily radios and how they work, make him a coveted asset to the Third Reich.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, the two stories intersect at some point and when they do, you can’t help but be swept up by it all. Marie-Laure is blind but a lover of books; books which are mentioned often in the novel itself. In between the serious bits, are fantastical parts of the story that lessen its blow somewhat, but at the same time, made it slightly unrealistic for me.<br/><br/>It’s not fantasy. I want to be clear about that but Doerr’s delivery lends a fantastical nature to the story. There’s a hidden room behind a wardrobe, a secret grotto, miniature houses,  and to me, it smacked of convenience (a little bit) and took me out of the story a few times.<br/><br/>We read this for book club and everyone enjoyed it, as did I. Maybe the hype of winning the Pulitzer had me thinking it would be a little more than what it was.  Not sure but it fell a little flat for me and I found myself skimming towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good read but there were times where I found myself questioning the events that took place and each time that happened, I was pulled out of the story. It read like a screenplay. Very visual, and that part I enjoyed quite a bit. I thought it had been optioned for a movie but surprisingly,  I don’t think that has happened yet.
As I sit at my computer, my fingers on the keys, I am stumped. The words won't come. I feel inadequate to the task of reviewing this book.<br/><br/>"All the Light We Cannot See" is the best book I read this year, the kind of life-changing read you come across maybe once every five years, a book that involves you and transforms you, arresting time, an instant classic.<br/><br/>In the years leading up to World War 2, Marie-Laure LeBlanc grows up blind, but beloved, in Paris, where her devoted father teaches her that, just because she is blind, it doesn't mean that she has to be helpless. Werner Pfennig grows up a penniless orphan in a grim German mining town, doomed to spend his life in the same mines that killed his father, until the Nazis notice he has a gift with radio circuits.<br/><br/>And then history takes over. Werner is sent to a brutal Nazi finishing school, where he learns, in equal measures, trigonometry and how to suppress his troubled conscience. As the Nazis invade Paris, Marie-Laure's father, who works for the Museum of Natural History, is handed a priceless jewel that he must protect, a legendary diamond with a terrible curse attached to it. They flee Paris for the island of St. Malo, where Marie-Laure eventually becomes part of the Resistance.<br/><br/>This is a powerful, engaging, beautifully written novel. It moves back and forth in time, from the present, where Marie-Laure's house is moments away from being bombed and Werner is trapped in the rubble of a hotel, to the past, where we watch two children molded into the people they become. The many pleasures of Doerr's textured writing include sly allegories and a whiff of magic. Though the story is long and intricate, the chapters are short and the writing is reader-friendly.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure, Werner, and the cast of characters around them, are so thoroughly realized, you feel like they are people the author actually met and interviewed. The settings are picture-perfect, described with astonishing you-are-there detail. The plot is like the complicated puzzle boxes that Marie-Laure's father makes for her birthdays. And the prose...oh, the prose...it is precise, light, lush, humorous, luminous, gentle, shattering. The trajectory of the two children's lives reminded me of the trajectory of the radio beams that Werner tracks to hunt down anti-Nazi partisans' radio transmitters, slowly, irrevocably, bringing them together. Doerr has compassion for everyone, including the misled German soldiers who fought on the side of Evil, and for the French who closed their doors to the Resistance, fearing for their lives.<br/><br/>This is a World War 2 story like no other, a bright, shimmering masterpiece. It will take your breath away. It will break your heart. I wish I could read it for the first time all over again.
The book is set during WWII like so many other novels. This one is better at it than so many others. Mostly because it takes place on both sides of the war's faultline, but also because we get a heart wrenching insight into the realities of war for civilians and their children. One of the book's child protagonists reflects on her world before and after:<br/><br/><i>(...) pyramids of cabbages and carrots everywhere; bakers' stalls overflowing with pastries, fish stacked like cordwood in the fishmongers' booths, the runnels awash in silver scales, alabaster gulls swooping down to carry off entrails. Every corner she turned billowed with color: the greens of leeks, the deep purple glaze of eggplants.<br/><br/>Now her world has turned gray. Gray faces and gray quiet and a gray nervous terror hanging over the queue at the bakery (...).</i><br/><br/>This quote to illustrate how civilians were tortured by fear, specific fear of bombings, fear for their loved ones at the front, fear of their neighbours. And lack of proper food! Also, this quote illustrates how good a writer Doerr is.<br/><br/>One of the protagonists is blind and Doerr is incredible at describing her condition so that we can almost feel it ourselves. The other protagonist is a child prodigy with an almost intuitive understanding of radios. Also this is so well described by Doerr.<br/><br/>The stories told are expertly woven together in true literary fashion, and it works this time too!<br/><br/>I recommend it warmly, especially perhaps to not so prolific readers, because it is well written, it incites the reader to empathise with this world's war refugees (only during WWII have there been as many war refugees in the world as now!!!), it has an inner drive and it is quite easily read.
A tale of childhood swayed by the culture of war, All the Light We Cannot See takes place in WWII but could apply to any war lived by a child. Marie-Laure faces war in Resistance France while Werner faces it in Nazi Germany. Both come to life with the challenges of less-fortunate beginnings, blindness for Marie-Laure and orphan poverty for Werner. The author uses how young children make-up what is happening because they are too young to rationally understand and explain away the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Werner experiences the undying hubris of the Third Reich that compels each person to give up their humanity to serve the glory of the state. He follows from fear but also from the impression that this brutality is what the world is made of.  Brutality is all he has ever known.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure has lead a protected life inside an intellectual institution, the museum in which her father is the locksmith. He keeps things carefully locked up, including his daughter. He makes a model of their neighborhood so she can learn how to navigate the streets. She lives in a theoretical world.<br/><br/>Werner’s story follows how the mob can carry you away into participating in the horrors of war. Marie-Laure’s story follows how the intellectual and theoretical has no impact unless put into actions and taking risks.<br/><br/>Reading it as a Writer ---- Doerr uses short chapters in a Flash Fiction style. The story leads forward via allegory, image, and language rather than a hard-driving plot. Each chapter gestures towards the larger story, rather than be explicit in meaning and plot. This is only for the careful reader who likes to savor a story small bite by bite. If you like to fill in the gaps as a reader and enjoy the subtleties as if you created them – this book will satisfy. The structure of the dual stories and alternating third person POV is a good one to study if you want to use Flash in a far longer narrative.<br/><br/>The main thing that made me pause was the ending (and I’m hard to please with endings).  Two characters who have been held back from the reader in terms of knowledge of what makes them tick – become main conduits of driving the conclusion. Now that we finally have access to their interior life, it doesn’t match the impression I had of them. I wanted to be more satisfied with an understanding of their motivations and beliefs so that past actions could take on greater meaning. Even though this is a novel that gestures towards meaning and plot action (so perhaps I shouldn’t expect clarity of expression at the end) this made the ending less satisfying. But then there were ending moments in which the gesture echoed with meaning and satisfied me (a minor childhood character scarred by the war encounters a symbol of his spirit….sounds goofy but I don’t want to give it away!).<br/><br/>I liked it. Beautiful writing. Statements about war that are worth acknowledging again and again. Great use of Flash Fiction style in a novel form.
I'm not going to take time to type a summary of the book or give a synopsis of the plot - you can find that anywhere on the internet.<br/><br/>Beautiful word painting.  Layered storytelling.  Endearing characters.  All set against the backdrop of war... but do not for one second think this is a "typical WWII novel".  WWII is only the setting and never overshadows the characters.  The "real war" being fought in this book is not one of artillery and airplanes... it is a war for our humanity.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the fact that we got to know characters from both Germany and France... without the usual "stereotypes" one finds in many books set during WWII.  I thought it was a wise choice by the author not to interrupt the story line by describing obvious historical events happening around his characters.  Another "plus" in the writing technique, is that even though Doerr doesn't hold back on the atrocities of war, this fact (or the plot in general) never overshadows the characters.  It is about human survival and strength... and the thread of life we can't see stretching between times, places and people.<br/><br/>One thing some readers may not like is that Doerr doesn't waste words describing a character's "feelings" or "emotions"... but therein lies the beauty, in my humble opinion.  He describes what they are seeing or what they are doing so eloquently that you feel what the characters are feeling... without having to be "told" what to feel by the author.  Because of this, I found myself "experiencing" the book, rather than merely "reading" it.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the book that I feel propelled the story forward is the structure of the chapters; however, I can see where some readers would find this writing technique confusing at best and annoying at worst.  The chapters are short (but the book is long) and they shift between the characters' points of view... and they take place in various time periods.  I'll admit I found myself looking back to the chapter headings a couple of times to remind myself what "year" it was.  With that said, this didn't diminish my joy in reading this novel; instead, it somewhat added to the emotion of the book.  I hope I never have to experience life during wartime as these characters did.  The simultaneous feelings of worry for the future, longing for your past and loved ones... while struggling to survive the present.  To me, the writing style emphasized this fact and added a sense of "displacement" that helped me further connect with the characters.<br/><br/>The secondary characters are anything but "secondary".  The story moves forward through these characters.  Some of these easily became my favorite characters in the book!  I can't say that for many novels.  All too often I find many authors simply using secondary characters as "plot devices" to move the plot forward, but I never felt that way when reading this novel.<br/><br/>My only complaint:  my preference would have been for the book to end without continuing it into the present day.  Some may love this ending, but I found it unnecessary... and, frankly, a bit unfulfilling.  Even though many story lines were left ambiguous (thank you Mr. Doerr!!), I felt ending with a headlong rush into the present day added nothing to the characters or plot and ultimately changed the tone of the entire book.  (so my rating is actually more of a 4.75 because of that issue)<br/><br/>Highly recommended.  It is a marvelous book not only for the literary buff who analyzes every metaphor and delves deeply into the symbolism... It is an equally good book for someone who wants to read it "at face value".
I very much enjoyed this book. Anthony Doerr is so talented. I didn't notice it was a Pulitzer prize winner until, delighting in its quality, I looked at the cover more closely, and saw the award. Over the days I read it, my own writing became better, because I slowed down and paid more attention to beautiful details. I even thought of starting a book club for writers...we would discuss technique! We would share how a certain book improved our own efforts.<br/><br/>Here's an example: The young soldiers are driving a truck of death, deeper and deeper into a city, and a main character is sinking deeper into existential despair. Doerr writes, "...the streets rising around them, whorling slowly into an engulfing spiral, into the center of which the truck will arc downward, tracing deeper and deeper all the time."<br/><br/>And, "Out in the harbor a sturgeon makes a single leap like a silver horse and then is gone."<br/><br/>And, in the snowy forest at midnight, "Dr. Hauptmann's hounds bound through frozen fields beside the school, drops of quicksilver skittering through the white."<br/><br/>There are many more examples of fresh metaphors and visceral, sensory descriptions. The characters are complex, the main ones compelling. The dramatic tension builds, the solution is unimaginable, so the reader is pulled in. We MUST know how it ends.<br/><br/>And then, the ending disappoints. I don't need a happy ending, but I want one that resolves at least some of the bigger issues, or suggests resolution. This book switches genres right at its conclusion, from dramatic adventure to literary-vagueness. The last chapter in particular was so dull and pointless, except to show us how the world has changed, which we were capable of figuring out ourselves. However, the rest of the book is so great I still give it four stars.
“That first peach slithers down his throat like rapture. A sunrise in his mouth.”<br/><br/>"All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It’s well deserved and one of the most beautiful stories I’ve read in a long time. Mr. Doerr’s gorgeous inventive language is reason alone to read his book. I highlighted dozens of passages. These are 3 picked at random:<br/><br/>“He sees a forest of dying sunflowers. He sees a flock of blackbirds explode out of a tree.”<br/>“Metallic, tattered moonlight shatters across the road.”<br/>“But God is only a white cold eye, a quarter-moon poised above the smoke.”<br/><br/>AtLWCS tells the story of Marie, a blind girl who is growing up in Paris with her locksmith father in the days before World War II.<br/><br/>“A demonic hoard. Upended sacks of beans. A hundred broken rosaries. There are a thousand metaphors and all of them are inadequate: forty bombs per aircraft, 480 altogether, 72 thousands pounds of explosives. An avalanche descends onto the city.”<br/><br/>The war forces them to flee to the coast of France, to Saint-Malo to live with her elderly great uncle and housekeeper, in a town that is so picturesque and precisely described I feel as if I’ve been there.<br/><br/>“At the lowest tides, the barnacled ribs of a thousand shipwrecks stick out above the sea.”<br/><br/>Marie’s story is intertwined with Werner, a German orphan whose self taught talent with radios and equipment sweeps him from a gloomy coal mining town into Hitler’s youth services.<br/><br/>“Coal cars grind past in the wet dark. Machinery hums in the distance: pistons throbbing, belts turning. Smoothly. Madly.”<br/><br/>The chapters are short and thrilling, going back and forth in time, and switching between Marie and Werner’s lives. I felt as if I was blowing through the book, despite its grief stricken history and violence and portent. There is an element of magic with a magnificent blue jewel that may or may not have fatal powers. There is a radio announcer with a voice like caramel and dreaming. There were words upon words I had to look up in delight:<br/><br/>gibbous, corsairs, extirpation, ordnance, transceiver, clinker brick, ambrotypes, mansard roofs, saturn-bowl keys, escutcheons, humus, lobelia, whelks, volutes, murex, solenoid, narwhal, kraken, gadrooned, portcullis, empyrean, jigsaw, halyards, rheas, boreal, vitrine, dicta, passerines, lindens, tephra, Huns, gibbets, maul, sextillion, chirring, pilastered, crenelated, pollarded, sundering, linenfold, davenport, praxis<br/><br/>I have two little complaints, neither of which should deter you from reading this book. One is the occasional vibrant visual description, odd when it comes (specifically) from a blind girl’s perspective.<br/><br/>“Briny, weedy, pewter-colored air slips down her collar.”<br/><br/>And the other is the end of the book, which does a whole bunch of neat tying up with a bow, all the characters followed through to their ends. For someone of Mr. Doerr’s considerable talents - each of his lambent chapters ending with such graceful aplomb and forward motion - I thought he might have ended the story earlier, before all the bow ties.<br/><br/>“…an ancient sea spilling through the streets, and the air streaming with possibility…”<br/><br/>That said, I am agog at Mr. Doerr’s storytelling prowess, and even more at his stunning use of language. What a perfect combination. I look forward to more.
All The Light We Cannot See is a modern day existentialist novel. A book in the tradition of Dostoevsky, although that may not be obvious right away.<br/><br/>The title alludes in different ways to the juvenile main protagonists of the novel, Marie Laure and Werner. For Marie Laure, the allusion is more literal. She is blind, from a congenital vision disorder. Nurtured by a loving father, she sees, not with her eyes, but with her ears, her nose and her fertile imagination.<br/><br/>For Werner, an orphan and part of Germany’s World War II youth indoctrination program, the allusion is more figurative and a little more complex. He chooses to be blind to the destructive effects of war because the program promises a way out of the coal mines―his inevitable future, asserted orphanage officials.<br/><br/>These two characters meet only at the end, but in so many ways, they are connected from the beginning. By time, if not by place. By their youth. By their intense need to know. By their extraordinary gifts. Finally, they meet as kindred spirits, drawn together by an illegal radio broadcast that cuts through prejudices and stereotypes, suspicions and enmities that divide people.<br/><br/>You cannot think of this novel in terms of a sweeping plot with several subplots. All the individual stories carry about equal weight, if not equal appeal: Marie-Laure moving through and surviving the war; Werner curbing a role in the war using his native gifts for electronics; the trajectory of the Sea of Flames diamond and the search for it by an obsessed German officer desperate to believe it would cure his decaying body; the healing of Marie-Laure’s great uncle, traumatized by his experience in the previous world war.<br/><br/>The setting for the story, the catastrophic event of the second world war, fits the meditative mood of the narrative. The characters live inside their heads a lot, not only about what they’re experiencing (seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling), but also about what those experiences mean, what each individual life really means. The prose flows effortlessly and images are vivid. The novel reminds me of Terence Malick’s atmospheric, meditative war film, The Thin Red Line.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, what I took away from the book is the author’s view of what life is all about, woven into the many themes of the novel and often expressed in the musings of characters. You feel the author throughout the story, editorializing about events, characters, scenes, time. A book to be read and savored more than once. As I intend to do and as I did with Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and Brothers Karamasov. Timeless and unforgettable.
Literary awards can be a poor guide to enjoyable reading. Britain’s Man Booker Award-winners, for example, strike me as a mixed bag at best. Generally, though, a book that wins a Pulitzer and is a finalist for a National Book Award deserves more than a casual look. That’s certainly the case with All the Light We Cannot See, an historical novel long at or near the top of the national best-seller lists, winner of the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.<br/><br/>Here is a wildly original boy-meets-girl story. Two teenagers are caught up in the frenzy and the mortal dangers of World War II: a German boy who is extraordinarily clever with all things electronic, and a blind French girl who reads Jules Verne. Author Anthony Doerr explores the trajectory of their lives in parallel, moving them inexorably toward a fateful intersection in the book’s surprising climax. Like millions of other Europeans, Marie-Laure LeBlanc and Werner Pfennig are victims of the war, but their stories are fresh: these are uniquely drawn individuals, each masterfully portrayed by a writer at the top of his form.<br/><br/>The action in All the Light We Cannot See takes place late in the war, two months after D-Day (June 6, 1944), with the Allies poised to turn back the German lines on all fronts. Marie-Laure is hiding out with her father and great-uncle in Saint-Malo, a coastal town near the Normandy beachhead. Werner has been pressed into service in the German army and (inevitably) is transferred to the town as the Nazis rush to reinforce their defenses in northern France.<br/><br/>However, it is the backstory Doerr tells of each of these remarkable young people that forms the backbone of the novel: how Marie-Laure lost her sight early in life and came to live with her doting father in Paris and later in Saint-Malo; how Werner demonstrated genius with electronics as a child and was later maneuvered into making a major contribution to the German war effort. These are full-bodied stories, rich with complexity, detail, and suspense.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is Doerr’s second novel. He has also written two volumes of short stories and a memoir.
Because I enjoyed this book so much, I chose to type up a review. (This review is for the most part spoiler-free.)<br/>My expectations for this book (which were basically: a realistic dip into the wartime lifestyle of said characters, a new lesson learned, and an acceptably compelling plot for literary fiction) were not only met, but exceeded. I can attest that its popularity exists for a reason: you will most likely close it feeling heartbroken, a little bit smarter, and possessing an unidentified sense of yearning — perhaps for another read with as much humanity and eye-opening content as this one.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure LeBlanc, one of the two main characters, is a French girl whose characteristics of curiosity, perseverance despite her blindness, oblivious courage, and compassion make her likable and three-dimensional. I liked reading about her struggles as the war tips her life upside down, along with the mystery of a supposedly cursed jewel in her father's possession. As seemingly worse and worse things happen around Marie-Laure, the question is raised: Fate/curse or coincidence?<br/>Marie-Laure was a bit "bigger" to me than her costar in the story, an introverted and intelligent German boy named Werner Pfennig. I was fond of him, but I found his early chapters less interesting and his traits less polished. However, though Werner may be slightly less amplified, his arc/development rings true. Werner begins as a curious young boy fascinated with the world around him, deathly afraid of being doomed to his father's fate of working in the mines. As the effects of Nazi Germany tire him, Werner becomes more closed off. He begrudgingly watches things happen while his friend, Frederick, (who admittedly is at his best a simple yet likable character, and at his worst a mere literary device to aid Werner's development) is punished. But in the end, Werner is eventually forced to confrot his original fear of darkness and confinement, and finally redeems himself by choosing to stand up for what is right (in a way that creates the epic climax).<br/>Beginning in the first quarter of the book, we are granted peeks years into the future in which Marie is being hunted down [spoiler omitted as by whom] and Werner is stuck [spoiler omitted as to where]. These flash-forwards, in my opinion, were very suspenseful, making the book more entertaining than I expected. And besides these, the book goes on at a steady pace with elevation in the character's troubles that make you want to keep on reading.<br/>I've seen many negative criticisms for this book concerning the hackneyed curse/blessing jewel plot. In honesty, it is a rather used-up concept, but Doerr's novel presents the world with such fresh perspective that he manages to pull it off. Also, isn't the very setting (World War II) already considered redundant? And yet he manages to put a refreshing spin on this as well.<br/>One other criticism is the story's supposedly weak presentation of Nazism. Now, I am by no means a well-read historian, so I possess no authority to praise or criticize its handling. But the way I saw it was: the story is written chiefly through the deep-set points-of-view of two children/teenagers, so the details of the war would be more selective according to how it affected these characters. Thus we would not expect to see a wealth of information concerning the Nazis' effect on the different parts of entire nations.<br/><br/>In my opinion, one of the qualities of a memorably good novel is that it is thought-provoking. "All the Light We Cannot See" certainly falls into this category, with lines such as:<br/>"So how, children, does the brain, which lives without a spark of light, build for us a world full of light?"<br/>"When I lost my sight [...] people said I was brave. When [spoiler omitted], people said I was brave. But it is not bravery; I have no choice. I wake up and live my life. Don't you do the same?"<br/>"Don’t you want to be alive before you die?"<br/><br/>This novel is, to put it simply: deep. Doerr's elegant writing style, cleverly executed plotline, and intense pondering on the issues of humanity during wartime, greed, chance, and graciousness to be alive make it quite an impressive read.<br/>If you have seen a single other review on this book, that you've certainly heard about how eloquent the prose is. It truly smooths out the narrative's pace (despite its unique timeline). It also makes it seem all the more artful and natural as the mood fades from the lightness of childhood to the darkness of wartime and premature loss of innocence.<br/>Qualities of life and animation are illustrated everywhere in the eyes and minds of the characters; they are pointed out in buildings, bookshelves, in nature, within the human body, in electronics, even in the dead — causing you to begin to notice it in real life yourself, at least for a while. Doerr's thoroughness and intelligence at times made me forget that the words were already printed on the page. I felt as if every object had an interesting explanation behind it, and that Doerr would explain it to me if I really wanted him to.<br/>One of intentions of Anthony Doerr when writing "All the Light We Cannot See" is reminiscent of Zusak's "The Book Thief" in reminding us of the importance of the many hidden stories of World War II. Doerr builds upon this point when one of his characters says, "You know the greatest lesson of history? It's that history is whatever the victors say it is. That's the lesson. Whoever wins, that's who decides the history." thus bringing to mind that history textbooks don't reveal it all.<br/>There are many other moments in this book that remind the reader of the raw beauty of our world which the modern lifestyle has caused us to abandon.<br/><br/>So, "All the Light We Cannot See" is not entirely "perfect", but I believe that it is close.<br/><br/>I've read a lot of books, and this is one of the few, and maybe the only that I would deem a "masterpiece".
I can’t say enough about how much I enjoyed this terrific book set during World War II in the walled coastal city of Saint Malo, France. It’s easy to understand why All the Light We Cannot See won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It’s a story full of great charaters, important themes, and a plot that’s a wonderful mix of reality and fairytale.<br/><br/>Imagine being Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a young blind girl in Paris, whose entire world revolves around her father, Daniel, a trusted locksmith at the city’s Museum of Natural History. He’s built her a miniature model of their neighborhood and is busy teaching her how to find her way. Meanwhile, the threat of German occupation is real, and the museum is rushing to pack up and send off its valuable exhibits and specimens, before they become German property. Among these priceless objects is the Sea of Flames diamond, a legendary stone of mesmerizing beauty, but thought to carry a curse. When Marie-Laure and her father flee France for Saint Malo, he’s carrying a gem, but is it the Sea of Flames or a decoy?<br/><br/>At the same time, Werner Pfennig is a young boy growing up in an orphanage in the coal mining town of Zollverein, Germany. Desperate for a way out of a life destined for the coal mines, Werner discovers a broken radio. He’s instantly fascinated and teaches himself how to fix and build radios. A genius understanding of the math behind transmitting and receiving signals earns him a glowing reputation, but his hopeful future takes a turn when he’s called to fix a radio for a German officer. The officer recruits Werner to be a member of an elite Hitler youth group and he’s sent away to a brutal camp.<br/><br/>Werner becomes an expert in radio transmission, but questions of morality weigh heavy on him, especially when he’s on missions to locate enemy transmissions. When her father has to leave, Marie-Laure feels helpless in her uncle’s house where it’s becoming more and more dangerous. Slowly, these characters develop and find a way to make a difference, but their futures carry sadness as well.<br/><br/>I won’t spoil the story for you, so I will stop here. This is the kind of book you study. It’s full of great quotes, wonderful ideas and serious moral questions. I’m sure I will be reading this again!
All the Light We Cannot See is in my top 5 books read in 2015, so far.  I listened to the Audible version and thought the narrator was perfect; I could always tell who was speaking.  Although some reviewers complain about how the book skips around in time and character, I actually liked it.  It went from Marie-Laure to Werner from the present to the past, alternating.  I like how it all came together.  Marie-Laure lives in Paris with her father and Werner lives in Germany with his sister and in an orphanage type of home.  Marie-Laure became blind at age 6 and her father builds her a model of her neighborhood so she can become independent and find her way around.  He works in the National Natural History Museum in Paris and Marie-Laure learns her academics from her father, from reading, and from the museum.  Despite her blindness, she is very very intelligent and loves to learn.  Werner is also an extremely intelligent boy and is fascinated with radios.  He learns to repair them and build them, to the point where the townspeople bring their radios to him to fix.  When World War II breaks out, Werner is selected to go to an exclusive state school and when he finishes he goes into the Army where he is to find resistance people through their radio transmissions.  Marie-Laure and her father leave Paris and go (with a valuable gem from the museum) to St. Malo, where her great-uncle, Etienne, lives, and where she lives out the rest of the WWII.  Her uncle was a  fascinating character.  He was a WWI veteran who has not left his home in 24 years and is agoraphobic.  He is wonderful to Marie-Laure and his back story, with his brother (her grandfather), is very interesting.  As the story develops, you will discover how Marie-Laure and Werner’s lives will intertwine and how the war affects each of them.  The French resistance movement plays a large part in the book, as does some fantasy surrounding the gem/diamond they are guarding. I didn’t really expect what happened towards the end (no spoilers!), but I also was not surprised. I found the book fascinating and from a different perspective of the war than that which I have previously read about.  It will stay with me for a long time.  I highly recommend it.
As a fan of historical fiction books, I’ve read my fair share of stories centered around WWII and the Holocaust and the graphic violence and brutality of the era is something that is expected (along with the moments of difficulty reading through certain passages). Although All the Light We Cannot See takes place in said era, it’s a different WWII story. While you still essence of the time period, the focus is turned toward the individual and how they perceive their world and the subsequent turbulence that surrounded them. It’s a unique route for the book to take but it didn’t take away from the emotional impact of the story.<br/><br/>Considering the nature of the story, it would’ve been easy for Anthony Doerr to fill the book with elaborate and long-winded writing, believing it’s the proper way to approach the story. However, I was pleasantly surprise by the opposite direction the writing took. Doerr manage to convey so much within such sparse narrative. Don’t let the fact that I used “sparse” to describe the writing. He manages to create a narrative that pinpointedly convey what is occurring without having to take so much time to go into details. HIs writing had a lyrical and almost a whimsical quality when it explores what the characters experience through their eyes (among their other senses). Somehow, this approach works and you get a greater sense of how the characters navigate their worlds. The old adage of “less is more” works, and is very effective, in this instance.<br/><br/>I appreciated how the story was more focused on the individual characters as opposed to the actions surrounding them. I enjoyed reading Werner’s and Marie-Laure’s stories and the journey to their convergence. While their situations were different, you can see the similarities in how they view their world. They go beyond what’s concrete and in front of their eyes. Even though the narrative is geared towards the characters, it’s through their perspective (oftentimes in a peripheral manner) in which you get the sense of the turbulence, doubt, danger and fear of the times. Having gotten to know the characters and sympathizing with them, the situations they’re in make an even stronger impact upon you. You don’t need to read every detail to know exactly the dire situation Werner and Marie-Laure find themselves in. Again, the “less is more” mentality comes into play in this aspect.<br/><br/>As good as this book was, it’s a book that you got to have patience with. Once you get through the slow beginning, the story really takes off, especially when it approaches the end. The writing is the detail that I really enjoyed the most about the book. It was a surprisingly pleasant approach to a story that could have easily gone the “overkill” route. Instead, the beauty is in its simplicity which just heightens the action of the story. I look forward to reading other works by Doerr in the future.
Set during World War II, this novel delicately and seamlessly weaves the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner together in a way that is spellbinding. The story of Marie-Laure LeBlanc, the much adored blind daughter of a French museum locksmith, and Werner Pfennig, a brilliant orphan turned German soldier, is a story of wonder, self-preservation, love, and the human desire for redemption.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure was a young child when she lost her sight, and only 12 when she and her father fled Paris to live obscurely in the French countryside with an agoraphobic uncle until the war ended. Marie-Laure did not know of the treasure they carried with them. Werner and his sister lived in an orphanage in Germany and had little time or resources for entertainment, until Werner discovered the world of radio waves with spare parts and his inherent ability to understand circuitry. He and his sister would stay up through the night listening to a gentleman broadcast a children’s show from worlds away. That very talent led Werner to attend the academy for Hitler Youth, tearing him from his sister and the only home he knew. Both Marie-Laure and Werner were set on dreadful paths not of their choosing, yet their lives would intersect tenderly amidst the chaos.<br/><br/>Each character is so clearly developed and vividly portrayed, I felt akin to them. This book is not simply set in World War II, it transports the reader to occupied France. The voice of Marie-Laure makes you feel her blindness, listening to and feeling the world around her, as that world crumbles. The voice of Werner sets your heart racing with fear: fear of losing everyone he cared about, of enduring the merciless academy for Hitler Youth, of giving his life for country.<br/><br/>From the very first chapter, it was difficult to put down. Doerr’s language is like poetry, conveying volumes of insight and feeling, yet this novel reads easily. I could read this book again and again.
Marie-Laure LeBlanc and her father travel by foot from Paris to Saint-Malo, France, to escape Nazi aggression during WWII.  Marie-Laure, however, is blind and must familiarize herself with her new surroundings with the help of an intricate model of the town that her father builds for her.  Werner Pfennig is a German boy, living in an orphanage with his sister Jutta.  Facing a miserable future in the mines, Werner plies his skills as a radio technician into an appointment to a Nazi training school.  Conflicted about the horrific hazing of weaker boys that he witnesses in school, he still is grateful for the opportunity to avoid the same fate as his father’s—death in the mines.  Jutta serves as his conscience, trying to coax him back from the influences of evil, but he knows that the consequences will be dire if he tries to leave his military training.  The author flits forward and backward in time—sometimes years and sometimes just a few months—so that we know that Werner will be trapped in rubble, and Marie-Laure will be alone and frightened—both in Saint-Malo.  Of course, even without this advance knowledge, we can assume that these two characters will converge at some point, and the author entices us to follow them back and forth in time.  I am not fond of this technique of telling the reader what is going to happen and then telling us what has already happened, but this book in particular seems to treat the timeline in a rather haphazard way.  As a reader, I would prefer to be challenged in other ways than in an effort to keep track of where I am in the sequence of events.  Each time the author heads a chapter with a date, I should have made a written note, but what a pain in the you-know-what.  Overall, I liked the book.  Almost all of the characters are kind and courageous, especially the townspeople of Saint-Malo.  One heinous villain is dying of cancer, and we can only hope that he fades away before doing any more real damage.  The author does a stellar job of creating Marie-Laure’s visionless world for us, especially during her loneliest and most desperate hours.
The description of this book begins with a question: Does the world need yet another novel about World War II?  Similarly, as I prepared to write this review, I asked myself, is there really a need for another assessment of a book that's already been reviewed 10,589 times?<br/><br/>I was so moved by the book, however, that my answer to both of these questions became a resounding YES.  Given that all of the standard accolades have already been abundantly offered, I’ll refrain from restating things like:  “Unforgettable, Worth the read, Spectacular writing, Beautifully researched, Short almost lyrical chapters.”  Instead, I'll point out what I think may have been missed in the commentary.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I would not have arrived at this somewhat different point of view had I read the book in its paper form.  When you read an eBook on a Kindle, you see what others have highlighted as being especially compelling either by virtue of content or elegant construction.  I agreed with the importance of most of the passages that my Kindle informed me were highlighted by thousands of other readers, but I found one passage, that curiously enough had not been singled out at all.  This passage appears below:<br/><br/>"Werner is succeeding. He is being loyal. He is being what everybody agrees is good. And yet every time he wakes and buttons his tunic, he feels he is betraying something."<br/><br/>Werner is a likable boy on the German side of the conflict who grows up as an orphan in a mining town and is told that in a year’s time he will be sent to toil in the mines as part of the German effort to retrieve the raw materials necessary to fuel the Nazi war machine.  His father died in those mines and to him, this is a future to be avoided at all costs.  When he gets the chance to compete for a seat in a highly selective school for the best of the best, he sees this as his way out.  He receives some preferential treatment at the school because of his unquestionable talent and skill with electronics and mathematics, but he soon realizes that the purpose of this school is to indoctrinate young men into the extreme radical ways of the Hitler Youth.  His best friend at the school, Frederick, is similarly torn with the social pressure to excel and the need to do what is right.  Werner goes along and does not let the school authorities know that he is questioning their doctrine, but his friend, Frederick, rebels, and is beaten so brutally, he spends the rest of his life in a catatonic state.  Werner is given a position in the army that takes advantage of his technical abilities, and he is able to redeem himself at the end of the novel, when he saves another of the main characters, a blind French girl by the name of Marie-Laure, from certain death.<br/><br/>As you read the story, you come to admire the courage of Fredrick for standing up for what was right at such a young age, but then you think at the end of the story that if Werner had done the same thing, he would not have been in a position to truly do something that would make a difference in the future.  In a very great way, Frederick showed courage when Werner exhibited cowardice, but in the end, Frederick was unable to make a difference when he had a better opportunity to do so.  So is it better to immediately stand up for what is right knowing the consequences may prevent you from making a difference, or is it better to bide your time and act at a more opportune moment?  That point can be debated both ways, and that became an aspect of the novel that I found especially fascinating and intriguing.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is a must read.  I strongly recommend it.
This absorbing story set in Germany and France before and during the German occupation of France is a page-turner at its best. Beautifully written, this emotional story is of two ordinary children swallowed in the horror of World War 11.<br/><br/>The two main players are: Marie-Laure a shy and resourceful blind girl who has learned to navigate the streets of her quartier in Paris, has mastered Braille and is very fond of Jules Verne’s “Twenty Thousand leagues Under the Sea”. Her and her father fled the city for Saint-Malo when the Nazis invaded France in 1940, at the time unknown to Marie-Laure, her father was entrusted by his boss, the museum’s curator with a treasure, the “Sea of Flames”, a priceless 133 carat diamond with a legend of immortality. A treasure that will be highly sought by the Nazis……<br/><br/>And<br/><br/>Werner Pfennig who is a German orphan with a natural affinity for circuitry one who can repair any broken short-wave radio that comes his way. Listening to the voice he soon becomes entranced by the lessons he mysteriously hears turning the dial. His passion for the ins and outs of the mechanics brings him to Nazi military elite training school. There he will breathe nation, live discipline and eventually sacrifice his life to the Wehrmacht.<br/><br/>The narrative is disciplined and flips between the two stories, it jumps forward and back in time, eventually weaves together and wraps up all the threads beautifully. The chapters are short and the prose is polished, very close to poetry, each sentence is finely crafted and very elegant….maybe a bit too much and the beauty of this may be slightly distracting. Once I got used to this vigorous style I was propelled onward and enjoyed every moment. The characters are multifaceted, very few to dislike and most are the heart of an engrossing journey where they are the center point. This novel is definitely narrative driven and does so expertly.<br/><br/>On a final note, “ All the Light We Cannot See” orbits around the nature of sacrifice and spotlights history with all the barbarism of war, its sights and sounds, in a vivid imaginary manner only a master story teller can express.
Anthony Doerr is the author of the novel All The Light We Cannot See. Anthony Doerr is not just a storyteller, although he tells a great story; he is a writer, a literary writer whose prose has whole other levels that take off from the story. He is a philosopher. He creates an artful world. There is rich symbolism all over the place. There is despair at the calumny of man and rapture at the triumphs of the human spirit. This is a beautifully written book.<br/><br/>Doerr gives us two young people, one French, one German; one male, one female; one treasured but blind, one with great intelligence but destined for the coal mines at fourteen. Both children have quite enough to deal with but into the midst of their lives Hitler arrives and the lives they might have lived are set on a new trajectory. Marie-Laure, blind, female, a virtual prisoner in occupied France has more freedom to act then Werner, our German boy, the occupier, who must dance, against his nature, to Hitler’s tune.<br/><br/>Science plays a fascinating and consuming role in this novel, both the quest of mankind to understand the physics of the universe and the natural history of the universe as contrasted with Hitler’s obsessive and horrific attempts to quantify the universe. Hitler keeps records on everything, he greedily steals and hides the art and wealth of Europe and yet he doesn’t really understands the possibility that art gives humans the capacity to transcend the primitive in our natures. Hitler does not transcend, although he believes himself to be the most transcendent of all humans.<br/>“It strikes Werner just then as wondrously futile to build splendid buildings, to make music, to sing songs, to print huge books full of colorful birds in the face of the seismic, engulfing indifference of the world – what pretensions humans have! Why bother to make music when the silence and the wind are so much larger? Why light lamps when the darkness will inevitably snuff them? When Russian prisoners are chained by threes and fours to fences while German privates tuck live grenades in their pockets and run?”<br/><br/>Why indeed?<br/><br/>And yet this is not a depressing novel because of the two children at its center. Here’s Marie-Laure, a true student of nature, indomitable in spite of her blindness.<br/><br/>“What mazes are there in this world, the branches of trees, the filigree of roots, the matrix of crystals…Mazes in the nodules on murex shells and in the textures of sycamore bark and inside the hollow bones of eagles. None more complicated than the human brain.”<br/><br/>Every time I say that I can’t imagine another book based in the World War II someone proves once again what a rich mine is in it for human thought and human error. Anthony Doerr has caught all of that in this bestselling novel.
This a wonderful book. It's easy to see why it has been nominated for so many awards and was voted Goodreads Best Historical Fiction winner in 2014. I can't begin to give it the insightful review it deserves and as there are already so many excellent reviews already out there, here are just a few thoughts.<br/><br/>In telling us the story of two ordinary children (both extraordinary in their own ways) as they live through WWII from childhood to adolescence, Anthony Doerr has somehow shown us the futility and brutality of war better than any story based at the battlefront. Even while he is showing us that men can be warped to destroy all that is good and beautiful, he is showing us that there is still hope and beauty to be found even at the darkest of moments. Marie-Laure LeBlanc, blind since the age of six is taught by her father to navigate the streets of Paris and to feel the amazing textures of feathers, gemstones and shells, to read in Braille and work out puzzles with her nimble fingers. Werner, growing up an orphan in Germany, is self taught, using his love of mathematics and electronics to become a master at fixing radios and then being trained to find hidden transmitters for the Reich.Marie-Laure's love of shells and snails and Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is mirrored by Werner's ability to 'see' radiowaves and imagine electrons dancing down the wires. Both are sensitive children who see beauty in books and music and are affected differently by the war. Werner, searching for the radios of the resistance is largely sheltered from the atrocities of the war as he himself does not have to kill the resistance fighters they find. He worries about his little sister, Jutta back at the orphanage, unable to accept what he is doing. By leaving Paris for Saint-Malo on the east coast, Marie-Laure's father hoped to keep her safe but when matters take a turn for the worse, she decides that she must do what she can to help to defeat the enemy.<br/><br/>In addition to Werner and Marie-Laure, there were many other wonderful characters in this book. Marie-Laure's father Daniel, locksmith at the Museum of Natural History who not only helps her to 'see' and feel the natural world but builds her tiny models of the houses and shops of her neighborhood in Paris and then in Saint-Malo so she can find her way around the streets by herself. Marie-Laure's Uncle Etienne, a recluse who returned damaged from WWI, has built a life for himself in his room with his radios, books and artifacts but can't ignore the war when it lands on his doorstep. His housekeeper Madame Manec, fierce protector of Marie-Laure and Etienne but also organising the other women of the town to stand up to the occupiers. Werner's school friend Frederick, we feel most for; a clever, sensitive boy who loves birds, he was never meant to be a soldier. His story, the saddest of them all is symbolic of the training the boys received and perhaps for the war itself, teaching them to ignore beauty and stamp out anything weak and sensitive.<br/><br/>Running alongside Werner's and Marie-Laurie's stories is also the story of a German officer searching for a valuable diamond, the Sea of Flames, taken from the Museum as the Germans marched on Paris and then hidden away. Seemingly a minor story, it is also symbolic of the light that is kept hidden during the war and freed again at the end. Towards the end of the book the three stories come together in unexpected ways as Saint-Malo is relentlessly bombed by the Allied forces as the Germans fight to keep a foothold in France.<br/><br/>All in all, this was such a good book on so many levels; great writing, good stories, great atmosphere - you can feel what it is like to be Marie-Laurie tapping down the street with her cane, listening to all the sounds, smelling scents and feeling breezes or to be Werner trapped in a cellar with a radio playing some long lost voices from his childhood.I also enjoyed the ending, even though a few reviewers have found it unsatisfying. The novel could easily stopped at the end of the war, but I felt it was a bonus that the author tied up loose ends and brought us up to current times.
Books about World War II or set in that period do not usually land on my "to be read" list, but this book was highly recommended to me by someone who knows my reading habits and tastes and has a good idea of what I will enjoy. And that's how I ended up reading a book set mostly during World War II. Thank goodness I did.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is a lyrically written, hauntingly beautiful book about two young people, a German boy and a French girl, trapped in the maelstrom of war. The climactic action of the book takes place in August 1944, two months after D-Day, but Anthony Doerr gives us his main characters' background in flashbacks. Throughout much of the book, the brief but information-packed chapters alternate between telling the stories of the German boy, Werner, and the French girl, Marie-Laure. By the time we reach August 1944, we have observed the intricate web that, for one day, finally draws these two together. Boy meets girl, but that meeting comes about by an incredibly circuitous route.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure is a privileged child in many ways. She is born in the years before the war and lives in Paris with her father. (Her mother is dead.) They live near the Museum of Natural History where the father works. He is a gifted locksmith and he is the master of the thousands of locks which are a part of the museum. When she is six, Marie-Laure goes blind because of cataracts. To help her "see" her neighborhood and learn to navigate it, her father, who is a talented builder of models, makes a perfect miniature of the community where they live for her so that she can learn the streets by touch and memorization.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure lives a charmed life in which her days are spent at the museum with her father. She is a favorite of his co-workers there and they serve as her teachers. But when she is twelve years old, war comes to Paris. The Nazis occupy the city and Marie-Laure and her father are forced to flee. The father is entrusted with a treasure from the museum - a famous diamond. Or maybe not. It may be one of the duplicates that was made to fool the Nazis. He can't be sure.<br/><br/>The two refugees travel to the walled Breton city of Saint-Malo, where the father's uncle lives. They live in the house with the old man, Etienne, and his housekeeper, and the father begins building a miniature city of Saint-Malo for his daughter.<br/><br/>Werner's life could hardly have been more different. He grew up in a mining town in Germany, along with his younger sister, Jutta. They were orphaned at an early age and they live in an orphanage. Werner's life is all planned out for him by the state. When he is fifteen, he is expected to go to work in the mines. The mines which killed his father. He faces that prospect with horror.<br/><br/>But Werner is a prodigy. He has a genius for understanding electrical circuits and for building and repairing radios. News of his talent gets around and inevitably comes to the attention of the Nazis who run things. In 1939, a German officer shows up at the orphanage and requires Werner to accompany him to the house of a rich couple who own an expensive Philco radio. The radio has stopped working and Werner is asked to fix it. He does and is rewarded with all the cake he can eat.<br/><br/>That test of his abilities brought him an opportunity to try for an elite Nazi school which provides extreme military training. He aces the entrance exams. The authorities also measure his head with calipers and rate the color of his hair (which is white-blonde) and his eyes for their shade of blue.<br/><br/>The brutality of the school experience threatens to completely extinguish any humane instincts that have survived in Werner. It is a society where kill-or-be-killed is the rule of the day. Only one cadet has the moral courage to say "no" to this philosophy - Werner's friend Frederick. Frederick is brutalized for that courage and Werner does nothing to stop it.<br/><br/>Werner lives in a world where propaganda is force-fed as a daily diet, but he struggles to keep his memories of growing up with his sister and listening to the radio late at night with her. He remembers listening to a professor speaking on the radio about the brain's power to create light in darkness. He cherishes the memory of listening to that professor talk, the professor who it turns out was Marie-Laure's grandfather, just one of the many intersections on the circuitous route of the two characters' lives. In his darkest moments, he clings to a still small voice that tells him, "Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever."<br/><br/>As Saint-Malo finally is occupied by the Nazis and then bombarded by Allied bombers in August 1944, both Marie-Laure and Werner are in the city. How they finally come to meet and what proceeds from that meeting is the emotional peak of the novel, but there are years yet to transpire in the telling of this story. The ending was a bit anticlimactic, but it was Anthony Doerr's choice to write it in this manner. I can't criticize that choice.
I'm usually a private reader.  I read my books, think about them a bit, maybe review them on Amazon if the spirit moves me, and pick up another book.  But I couldn't stop talking about this book while I was reading it and after.  I felt like a storyteller myself as I described the characters and the plot twists to my family, all of whom quickly became engrossed too.  I can't remember another book that has swept me up me so quickly and so completely.  Sure, it may have been a bit manipulative for the author to make the protagonists a blind girl and an orphan boy, but I really cared about these characters, and what would happen to them and those around them, pretty much from page 1.  Some other reviewers have criticized the structure of the book, which alternates between different storylines until they fuse near the end, and hops back and forth in time.  But to me, it only heightened the suspense.  But honestly, what made all the difference for me was the writing -- beautiful and complex without at all being pretentious.  There were passages so beautiful I just felt compelled to tug my wife's sleeve and read them aloud to her.  Here's one from the very beginning:<br/>"Not so long ago, the Hotel of Bees was a cheerful address, with bright blue shutters on its facade and oysters on ice in its cafe and Breton waiters in bow ties polishing glasses behind its bar.  It offered twenty-one guest rooms, commanding sea views, and a lobby fireplace as big as a truck.  Parisians on weekend holidays would drink aperitifs here, and before them the occasional emissary from the republic--ministers and vice ministers and abbots and admirals--and in the centuries before them, windburned corsairs: killers, plunderers, raiders, seamen.  Before that, before it was even a hotel at all, five full centuries ago, it was the home of a wealthy privateer who gave up raiding ships to study bees in the pastures outside St. Malo, scribbling in notebooks and eating honey straight from combs  The crests above the door lintels still have bumblebees carved into the oak; the ivy-covered fountain in the courtyard is shaped like a hive.  Werner's favorites are five faded frescoes on the ceilings of the grandest upper rooms, where bees as big as children float against blue backdrop, big lazy drones and workers with diaphanous wings--where, above a hexagonal bathtub, a single nine-foot-long queen, with multiple eyes and a golden-furred abdomen, curls across the ceiling."  The author deftly navigates the complex moral cross-currents of Nazi Germany and occupied France, and creates realistic and multi-dimensional characters.  I just can't recommend the book strongly enough.  That being said, I have to say that I didn't enjoy the final third as much as the first two-thirds.  Whereas the beginning of the book had a languorous flow, heavy on description and atmosphere, the last third was heavily plot-driven, and not entirely satisfying.  It reminded me in many ways of Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch, another beautifully written book loosely about a missing cultural treasure.  That one too left me a little cold at the end -- maybe it's just the sadness of ending a great read.  One of the best books of the decade.
Apparently it took 10 years for Anthony Doerr to complete his epic novel, “All the Light We Cannot See”.  Let’s hope it doesn't take another 10 years for Hollywood to adapt his novel for the silver screen.  This book, although highly readable, in tiny bite sized chapters, perhaps indicative of our shortening attention span in the age of micro-blogging, doesn't stand as an epic achievement in literature.  If fails as a love story, it fails as an historic novel, it fails as a mystery, it fails as a thriller, it simply fails.  Hollywood, in a two hour visually enhanced (ironic) production complete with broad sweeping vistas of both Paris and Saint-Malo France during World War II, and with close attention to a soundtrack which would include classical pieces, such as Clair de loon, as well as the static of early radio transmissions, and the bone quaking vibrations from aerial bombardment, is sure to please and no doubt win cinematic acclaim in multiple categories.<br/><br/>The story itself, could also be corrected to tie up numerous loose ends, culminating in both grand love for the hero and heroine and of visceral hatred for the numerous antagonists, of both character and of circumstance.  This book is destine to be a classic, because the movie will be a classic.  Yet the movie, will undoubtedly be better than the book, unless, for some ridiculous reason, Doerr would win creative rights on the picture and insist the storyline be kept true.  In which case, both would not be worth more time and thought than a best selling paperback that took the author two months to produce...let alone 10 years.  Without historical accuracy it’s not literature.  Without true love it’s not literature.  Without true mystery it’s not literature.  Good prose which Doerr clearly possess an unbounded talent to create does not overcome these serious flaws in his story.<br/><br/>What he gets right.  The love of a father for his daughter.  The mindless machine that drives atrocity. The doubt welling up in the mind of ardent followers of a cause. The hopelessness of a military occupation.  What he gets wrong.  It fails as a love story between the hero and heroine.  It fails as a mystery surrounding the “Sea of Flames” a priceless diamond we are not sure whether to protect of cast into the sea.  If fails as a history lesson, there are too many things simply wrong about WWII.  It fails scientifically...for which Doerr has been given too much credit.<br/><br/>The failures can all be corrected in the screenplay.  I can’t wait for the movie.  3-Stars for the book, 5-Stars for the soon to be movie adaptation, I hope.  This book has all the light, but I do not see it....yet.  4-Stars overall.
I’ve read so many WWII novels and histories I was reluctant to give this one a go in spite of the rave reviews it received when it came out last year.  I’ve also just recently read The Book Thief (which was great) and Sarah’s Key (which was okay) and on the surface All the Light We Cannot See sounded really similar to these novels, so I was doubly reluctant to pick it up.  But boy, I’m glad I did!<br/><br/>This is not classic literature.  It won’t challenge your English Major Chops, nor add to your understanding about human nature or the Second World War in any big way.  But it is a book that totally draws you in with captivating main characters. There’s Marie-Laure, a blind French girl who is as strong as steel in spite of being young and sweet and vulnerable, and Werner, a nice German boy, and a radio genius who gets swept up by the monstrous Nazi machine but never turns into a monster. You will love these kids and root for them.<br/><br/>The plot moves forward on two parallel fronts, following the two protagonists. Marie-Laure lives in Paris with her father, a locksmith for the Museum of Natural History who, initially unbeknownst to Marie-Laure, is given the dangerous task of smuggling out a priceless museum piece – a blue diamond – that Nazi treasure-hunters are determined to locate. As the war heats up, Marie and her father move in with their Uncle Etienne who lives in the remote seacoast city of St. Malo where they join the French resistance and begin transmitting secret radio messages to the Allies from a radio hidden in the attic.<br/><br/>Werner is brought up in an orphanage with his younger sister, Jutta, in a grimy mining town in Germany.  Thanks to his precocious ability to understand all aspects of radio technology, he gets noticed by the Nazi’s and is sent to a nightmarish training school for exceptionally bright up-and-coming Nazi thugs.  During the war he proves himself to be adept at finding, and invariably killing resistance-fighters like Marie-Laure.<br/><br/>From page one you know that these two are destined to cross paths before the war is over.  While it’s easy to surmise how and when their paths will collide, you never know until the end what will happen when they do eventually meet.  Will the collision be tragic, happy or something in between?  These are the simple questions that keep you reading.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is as suspenseful as a sophisticated high-wire spy novel, but way more down to earth. It is as quick moving and entertaining as an action-packed thriller like Raider’s of the Lost Ark, but without the cartoon characters and with much more to think about. It is sweet, but never sentimental, a book with both brains and a lot of heart.
Words cannot describe how beautiful this book is.  Lyrical, intelligent, historically fascinating, psychologically astute in its portrayal of fascism, and suspenseful-- these are but a few words that readily come to mind.  The novel's two main characters are ingeniously counterpoised and sensitively drawn.  The cover shows Saint Malo because much of the action takes place in this French walled city off the northern Brittany coast during the German occupation and eventual Allied bombardment in August, 1944.  The girl's vulnerability due to her blindness adds tremendous drama and pathos to the plot.  To oppose her with a sweet, scientifically gifted German orphaned boy only adds to the characterization's richness.  The paths of the two main characters cross after the boy is sent to be trained at a special Hitler Youth school where he develops and learns to operate a radio system that can track resistance members.  Because the blind girl's uncle operates such a resistance radio in Saint Malo, the two main characters' paths eventually cross.  There is a subplot involving a hidden diamond in the home of the girl's uncle -- a diamond which is being hunted by a German sergeant.  Ultimately the sergeant's search of the uncle's house places the girl in great danger.  Meanwhile, the orphaned boy, now a German soldier, is trapped in the rubble of Saint Malo's main hotel and can hear the girl's calls for help over her uncle's radio.  By alternating the development of the climax and the plot's development, the author heightens the reader's angst with each step in their well-controlled convergence.  There is a short denouement which is sensitively and exquisitely done.  I think it is impossible not to care about the characters in this book.  The setting of Saint Malo is very well drawn, and the reader will probably learn something new about the training and mentality of Hitler's ultra elite training school for boys.  The writing is exquisite.  There are many themes, but the principal one asks whether we are ever free of politics and state to pursue our dreams and interests, and the title, All the Light We Cannot See, has many interpretations, including what we do and don't know about beauty and truth, whether we are sighted or blind.  The author uses several very clever symbolic devices as a natural part of the story to elucidate this theme without hitting the reader over his head with them.  If there was ever a book to share with friends, this is it.
This novel was riveting, the writing, exquisite.  It is a tale of the end of innocence that takes place primarily during World War II in German-occupied France, but sways between pre and post-war times as well, ultimately leading us to the present-day.  Obviously, because of the subject matter, it is distressing; however, I am always pleased to read a book that I learn rich history from.  This novel, in particular, allowed me to further understand the scope and magnitude of Hitler’s bloody reign.  So many young men were dragged into the Reich without realizing the gravity of what lay ahead.  These children found themselves in the middle of inexplicable horror with no way out, attempting to assuage their guilt by telling themselves that it was for the betterment of humanity, as they were sadly brainwashed into believing.<br/><br/>The characters were certainly multi-dimensional, and the author did a spectacular job of showing the capacity in human beings for both good and evil, for both timidity and fearlessness.  I will say that this diverse group of characters did confuse me in the beginning, and I had a difficult time keeping track of who was who.<br/><br/>Another complication in this novel is the split chronology.  Not only did he write about several different stories, but the stories themselves oscillate between time periods as well.  Moving forward and backward in time does require the reader to constantly surmise the location and time period.  This is not necessarily a bad writing technique; it’s just one that requires more consideration.<br/><br/>I must say that it takes tremendous talent to weave such divergent stories together in order to bring them all circuitously back to the central plot; but much like the way Marie-Laure’s father constructs his intricate puzzle boxes, Anthony Doerr interlaces the pieces of his story seamlessly.
The history and settings of this book alone makes it a worthwhile read. The author has a gift for bringing places to life and rendering this time period authentic in both beauty and ugliness. I often dislike historical fiction, finding the writing often stilted and awkward, but this novel combines the history and setting flawlessly into the story line.<br/><br/>This book alternates between two lives of the blind French Marie-Laure and the German Werner Pfennig (although the occasional extra character will get a chapter here and there). The time period of the story starts a few years before WWII and goes through the end of the war, with a few chapters looking even farther into the future (this is not a spoiler as the chapter titles have dates in them.)<br/><br/>I love the language and the detail. Many historical fiction books put in researched detail, but it usually feels forced and obvious. This book doesn’t feel like history at all, yet so much history is in here. The settings, whether it’s a house or a camp or a little tiny room under the rampart, feel immediate and sharp.<br/><br/>The characters are strong, complex, and feel mostly authentic. There are some periods where the characters’ actions and motivations seem a bit stretched, but the novel never gives them easy choices or easy consequences.<br/><br/>One of my favorite quotes from the book is on page 63: “Radio: it ties a million ears to a single mouth. Out of loudspeakers all around Zollverein, the staccato voice of the Reich grows like some imperturbable tree; its subjects lean towards its branches as if towards the lips of God. And when God stops whispering, they become desperate for someone who can put things right.”<br/><br/>The one thing I really didn’t like about the book was the extremely frequent flipping between characters. During every one to three minutes of reading, the book flips characters and scenes. I quite like how the story followed these two very different people, but the changes happened much too fast and much too often. I never had a chance to settle into the scenes. It made it hard to read for long periods of time, and it separated me emotionally from the book, which may or may not have been intentional. This remains a worthwhile book in spite of this problem, but it’s worth a warning to anyone picking it up.<br/><br/>For book groups, this book is average in discussion potential. While I struggled finding good, complex questions, I ended up with enough to give this a recommended status.
This is the story of Marie-Laure and Werner Pfening, a French blind girl and a German boy who cross paths while trying to survive the devastation of WWII.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure lives with a her father, a lock-smith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris.  When she is 6 years old she goes blind.  Her father builds her a perfect miniature model of the neighborhood in which they live.  She memorizes this model to enable her to find her way around.  When she is 12, the Nazi's occupy France.  She and her father flee to the country, a town called Saint-Malo, to live with an "eccentric" uncle.  Unbeknownst to Marie-Laure, her father took with him a treasure from the museum that was perhaps it's most valuable item.  It put them both in extreme danger.<br/><br/>Werner Pfenning & his sister Jutta are orphans in a mining town in Germany.  Werner is fated to work in the same mine that took his father, until he is discovered by a German officer to be extremely talented in the construction and fixing of electronic equipment (radios).  This talent earns him admittance to a savage training academy for HItler youth and then a place in a group that is tracking the resistance.  As he travels through France tracking the resistance, Werner slowly becomes aware of the brutality of this war.<br/><br/>When Werner's group enters Saint-Malo, the two stories (Marie-Laure's & Werner's) come together.<br/><br/>While this book kept me interested, it is another example of an author who needed a good editor.  It seemed a bit long to me and I was on the verge of giving up several times, but I did really want to find out what happened to the main characters.  One thing I especially liked about it was that not only did you find out what what happened to the main characters, but also the lesser characters.  I also liked the realism of the story.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert:<br/>It was not a happy ending for all.  Good may have triumphed over all but it didn't save all.
"All The Light We Cannot See" stirs among the pebbles at the bottom of the sea like the Titanic with a unique sense of inevitability and incidentals.<br/><br/> A little German boy  incidentally saved the life of a little French blind girl and it wasn't the first time..<br/><br/>  Marie-Laure "sees herself walking out of the smoking city, trailing a white pillowcase...She sees him solve the puzzle of the little house. Maybe he drops the diamond into the little pool among the thousands of snails".  Memories of Casa Blanca surface.<br/><br/>  Like the little German boy,  I  am less concerned about the final destination of the diamond.<br/><br/>  "It is cut, polished; for a breath, it passes between the hands of men. Another hour, another day another year. Lump of carbon no larger than a chestnut. Mantled with algae, bedecked with barnacles. Crawled over by snails. It stirs among the pebbles." P. 520<br/><br/>  The Light We Cannot See sheds A New Light On WWII: empathy found in surprising places.<br/><br/>  I began to see that the first country that Hitler invaded was Germany. Little German boys did not have a choice about joining Nazii's youth camps even if they were from wealthy families..<br/><br/>  It was incidental to the story but there was another blind person other than Marie-Laure. Nearly blind Frederick was ejected from Nazzi youth camp and he along with his parents were never mentioned again in the narrative. Maybe they were killed?
‘All the Light We Cannot See’ is a remarkable war story about Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, and her German counterpart, Werner, who grow up in their respective countries prior to and during the Second World War. Being blind, Marie-Laure has a special relationship with sound, but so does Werner, who was raised in an orphanage and developed a love for tinkering on radios and the yearning to be an engineer. The war drives Marie-Laure to her eccentric uncle’s house outside of Paris and Werner to a premier Nazi school for young men, and then onto the Russian Front where he becomes a sought-after radio engineer. Werner and Marie-Laure’s paths eventually cross as the war reaches a climax, and this development feels inevitable since a common connection is nicely foreshadowed during their younger years.<br/><br/>‘All the Light’ is a beautifully written book and I was not sure I would be saying that when I first started it. Told entirely in the present tense--normally a form better suited to the short story--the style works without drawing attention to itself, primarily because the chapters alternate between Marie-Laure and Werner, keeping the momentum high and the story questions at a maximum, with mini cliffhangers trading off against each other. Since both main characters are in love with sound, the sensory details are not always the standard palette of visual ones. The secondary characters are extremely well developed as well, from Marie-Laure’s father to Werner’s military comrades, and could fill a novel all of their own.<br/><br/>There’s a strong sense of story here, not always the case with literary novels. Personally I could have done without the extra plot thread of the mysterious stone, which I actually found somewhat contrived, but I imagine most readers will feel otherwise. I simply didn’t find it necessary: I was drawn to the story of two young people trying to make sense of things during the brutality and insanity of war.<br/><br/>One would have thought every WWII tale had already been told but All the Light We Cannot See is such a fresh story with unique characters that it truly stands out and deserves to be read. I came away with a glimpse into what life might have been like for many ordinary people adapting to war and its aftermath. I look forward to reading more of Anthony Doerr’s work.
Review<br/>When I sat down to write about All the Light We Cannot Not See I struggled with how I wanted to approach a novel that was filled with so many complex themes and storylines.  There were the obvious storylines of the children and how they survived the war:  the German brother and sister and the blind French girl.  Then there was the story of the Light of the World Diamond and the French museum that worked to outwit the Germans and keep them from stealing it, along with the German Sgt. Major who was determined to find it.  Finally there was the story of the short-wave radios and their role before and during the war in Germany and France.<br/>Each one of these stories could have been spun into a novel of great worth.  But Mr. Doerr took the three themes and interwove them and spun them around till they all became one beautiful cohesive story that mesmerized the reader with its’ power.<br/>For each of the characters, the Light was a different source and had a different meaning.  I found that for Werner, the young German youth, the Light was in knowledge. But with time the Light became his soul and his humanity as he saw the adults and authority figures around him working to strip that very thing away.  For Werner’s sister, Jutta, the radio was a symbol of her Light.  It was her symbol of being able to touch hope and know that there was more to life than the dark world they lived in.<br/>Marie-Laure, the young French girl, lost her visual Light source as a young child, but her father was determined to give her the joy of sight back through touch, with his talent with wood.  He worked for years creating a miniature model of the neighborhood where they lived in Paris and then again in Saint-Malo.  Her life and world was limited by what she could read, and touch, plus what she could hear.<br/>The Light of the World introduced a wonderful sub-plot and connecting storyline that created a counterpoint of intrigue to the darkness of despair that the war pressed upon the families.  It was with pure genius that Mr. Doerr brought all the scattered pieces together and created a beautiful symphonic piece that left me wishing for just one more chapter.<br/>The edges become blurred in the question of sides between good and evil.  There are good and evil people on both sides in a war and that is not what this novel is about.  It is about the bigger question of the humanity within each of us and whether we lose it in the winds of war.  I would that all ends well and all lived happily ever after, but war is war and life goes on.<br/>I give this novel my highest recommendations.  It may be read for the story alone, but for those longing for a literary work with depth and complex issues and themes to work out without sacrificing the beauty of the innocence of the subjects of the story, you have found it between the pages of this novel. This is a true FIVE STAR work.<br/>Net Galley provided Shade Tree Book Reviews with a copy of All the Light We Cannot See to read for the purpose of writing a review for publication.
Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See centers on two main plot lines running through the build-up to WWII and the conflict itself that intersect in St. Malo, a Breton City, at the onset of the American attack on the city.  Marie-Laure LeBlanc is a blind Parisian girl who lives with her father.  One of the interesting touches is that he builds a model of her Parisian neighborhood, and later of St. Malo, where they flee after the German occupation of Paris, so she can memorize the local layout.  The father-daughter relationship is well-executed; indeed the family itself, including her WWI-traumatized grand-uncle Etienne and the housekeeper who lives with the uncle is convincingly sketched.<br/>The other main trajectory is the story of Werner Pfenning, an orphan and electronics prodigy whose ultimate job of tracking down radio transmission as a Wehrmacht technician leads to a crisis of conscience as he witnesses the devastation of the German war machine.  Iâ€™m inclined to agree with the New York Times review that found this arc to be less satisfactory.  Pfenning is trained at an academy for future German officers.  The head of the academy is a very stereotypical villain and there is a fellow cadet whose end could almost be predicted as he was sketched as a natural victim.  Unfortunately, much of the resolution of the interaction of those arcs involves an improbable, and unnecessary, coincidence.<br/>There are many elements of the story that it could've done without.  There is a sub-plot involving a diamond that the book that was largely extraneous and the resolution of the intersection of the LeBlanc and Pfenning plot lines could've been resolved without it.  It would also have allowed the excising of the Reinhold von Rumpel character.  There are also parts of the story that seems thrown in at the end just to create plot tension.  We are given a couple of "hints" as to the fate of Etienne and something that happens to Werner's sister, Jutta, near the end of the war.  I almost get the impression that Doerr didn't just his main plot and felt he had to add elements to it to keep the story going.
All the Light We Cannot See<br/><br/>by Anthony Doerr<br/><br/>Another Holocaust book? I really was not in the mood. I have read so many, so many good ones, but they are so intense, too intense. I cannot read them late at night or I suffer nightmares. So I put off reading this book. And then I read it, and I was hooked from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Marie Laure is a 14-year-old French girl, blind since age 6. She lives with her father Daniel LeBlanc, a locksmith for the Museum of Natural History in Paris, a master woodworker in his spare time. He builds a detailed miniature replica of their neighborhood so that Marie Laure can memorize every building, every street, every storm drain and so learn to get around. When the time comes that they must evacuate due to the German occupation, they make their way to the home of Marie Laure’s great uncle, the journey treacherous, onerous, weary. Once there, she must learn anew the details of her environment. Her great uncle, Etienne, is a veteran of WWI. He suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder and agoraphobia. His passion is radio broadcasting and from his home he produces a science program. Brilliant and kind but emotionally crippled, he opens his home to Marie Laure and her father.<br/><br/>Wener is a small-for-his age 16-year-old blond, blue-eyed German orphan. He teaches himself about the workings of a radio and his skills are noticed. Though small and of unknown lineage, he is recruited by Hitler’s Youth.<br/><br/>It is a radio, and specifically that science broadcast, that connects Werner, the avid listener, and Marie Laure, the great niece of the broadcaster. Their lives will cross paths.<br/><br/>Chapters are short and alternate between the two main characters. The hell of war lashes out and the reader’s senses are made raw. Neither the protagonists nor the reader can escape the brutalities, the anguish, the fear. Yet there is tenderness, there is compassion, there is love, there is hope.<br/><br/>This is an amazing book - well written, captivating, and touching in so many ways. There are layers and subplots, all intricately interwoven. All the Light We Cannot See is sure to stand out as the best book of the year.
One of the multi- faceted pleasures of running a bookstore was the reviews . I wrote monthly.<br/><br/> When you finish a loved book, as the final page is turned and the feeling of desire is new ,you feel  that somehow one can express in phrases and sentences the emotional hold the pages and words that captured essences of one's being.<br/><br/>Books are similar to food...some are hungrily devoured , a pleasure similar to eating a bag of empty calories...satisfying yet leaving you empty.<br/><br/>Other books are a 4 star restaurant, a meal that transcends the necessity of survival and elevates one to divine realms .<br/><br/>Such a book was All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr<br/><br/>The sculpture of words , the painting of the sentence of this book is prose that disguises it's nature and is born to poetry.<br/><br/>A blind French girl and a sensitive German young man ...two lives intersected by fate. The rise of Germany and the occupation of France during the war years.<br/><br/>A father who creates miniature replicas of the city so his blind daughter can touch and then know her world.<br/><br/>A young boy saved from a life in the mines, the same mine where his father perished, by his love of vacuum tubes , wires, transistors.<br/><br/>A sensitive young man caught in a world, He learns that is beyond any personal control. A young man who is beaten yet does not allow physical pain to erase his peace.<br/><br/>A great uncle so damaged by war that he cannot leave his home, creating both a safe vestibule and a  tomb.<br/><br/>A diamond greater then any previous, a blessing or a terrible curse.<br/><br/>The main theme of this book as well as our relative lives can be summed up in a single word...<br/>Change...<br/><br/>How we  sit in a familiar room or walk in our neighborhood , Then one morning wake to learn the cruelty of fate.. Waking up to a world that suddenly becomes very unfamiliar<br/><br/>and learn<br/>How easy to be false to oneself,  to become a stranger to one's nature.<br/><br/>My hope is that  you will buy or borrow this wonderful book and fall in love with its written passages.
I have to admit that it took me a long, long time to engage with this novel.  The first half is incredibly slow-moving, and, while I did end up liking the book, it could have had the same effect if it had been about 150 pages shorter.  In addition, while I love stories with multiple narrators, the use of multiple narrators AND switching back and forth in time made it unnecessarily convoluted.  On the basis of comments from LT friends who said the book got much better after the first half or so, I stuck it out to the end.  While I can't say that 'All the Light We Cannot See' will be one of my top reads of the year, on the whole, I was glad that I stayed with it.<br/><br/>The novel's two main characters are Werner, a German orphan with a talent for radio electronics, and Marie-Laure, the blind daughter of a French museum's lock master, both of whom are about 13 years old when the chronological story begins. When Werner's aptitude is uncovered, he is thrilled to have an opportunity better than working in the mines, Werner ignores the twinges of his conscience and follows all orders--even those that ultimately destroy his best friend.<br/><br/>When the Germans invade Paris, Marie-Laure and her father flee to the seaside town of Saint-Malo, where her reclusive great-uncle Etienne lives.  Her father may carry with him the museum's most valuable jewel, a large diamond known as the Sea of Flames--or he may be carrying one of four replicas of the diamond.  For me, the Saint-Malo chapters were the most engaging in the book, mainly because of the well-developed characters and relationships.<br/><br/>Into the mix comes a cancer-ridden German officer charged with finding and bringing back to Berlin the treasures of the France--including the Sea of Flames.<br/><br/>That's all I will say about the plot, aside from the fact that, as one would expect, these characters inevitably come face-to-face with one another.  I might have rated this book a bit higher if my expectations had been a little lower, and if the exposition chapters hadn't been quite so plodding.  Still, 'All the Light We Cannot See' is a worthwhile and at times very moving book.<br/><br/>If Amazon allowed half stars, this book would merit 3.5 from me.
This novel is a graceful masterpiece set in Hitler’s Germany, Paris, and the walled seaside town of Saint-Malo in Brittany during World War II. We meet an orphaned German boy, a visionary blessed with intellectual curiosity, and a blind French girl able to see light only through her imagination. The author wanted to tell a story in a time in history when hearing the voice of a loved one in your home, in your ear, was a magical thing. The focus landed on the role of the radio “when a war was fought in static waves instead of trenches” waging through the air invisibly and the front lines are anywhere.” Thus, the stories of Marie-Laure LeBlanc in France and Werner Pfennig in Germany paralleled the other until their paths collided in occupied France as they both tried to survive the devastation of World War II. She lives with her father in Paris near the Museum of Natural history, where he works as the master of its thousands of locks. At six, she goes blind and her father builds a perfect miniature of their neighborhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home. At twelve, the Nazis occupy Paris and father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo, where Marie-Laure’s reclusive great uncle lives. They carry with them what might be the museum’s most valuable and dangerous jewel, The Sea of Flames. Werner lives in a mining town with his sister, his expertise in building and fixing communication instruments landing him a place in a brutal academy for Hitler Youth, then on to a special assignment to track the resistance traveling through the heart of the war and reaching Saint-Malo. Through it all, their story, against all odds, shows how people try to be good to one another and how “light and grace inextricably bubble up in the midst of banality, deprivation, imbalance, and even downright evil.” The only reason I didn't rate it higher it was difficult to follow at times as it zigzagged through time and setting, but that was the author's intent and it certainly did not detract from hanging on his every word.
Anthony Doerr is a wonderful writer.  It’s not just that he tells a compelling story—and he does that.  It’s that he has an unerring sense of the right word, the perfect metaphor, the rhythm that moves every section of the story at just the right pace and pitch.  I would love to be able to write a single page that works as well as all 530 of these pages work.  He’s just that good.<br/><br/>But all these well-chosen words carry a story.  It’s a story told along two different timelines, with the earlier one eventually catching up with the later one—or does the later one slow down for the earlier one?  Either way, the story is by turns tender, cruel, innocent, tragic, chaotic, tense, and moving.  That’s a lot of emotional balls to juggle, but Doerr does it with skill and depth.  Most of the story takes place in occupied France during World War II.  Though there are other characters, it is essentially the story of two.  Marie-Laure LeBlanc is a French girl whose father is the chief locksmith and keeper of the keys at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, and who goes blind at the age of six.  She is aided in navigating the streets of Paris by a detailed model of their neighborhood made by her father.  Later, he does the same for Saint-Malo, the walled city to which he and Marie-Laure flee after evacuating Paris, carrying with them what may be a priceless jewel held for centuries in the museum.  The other person whose life drives the story is Werner Pfennig, a young German orphan who grows up dirt-poor in a coal-mining town but who has an uncanny knack for understanding radios.  His skills are put in the service of the German war machine, eventually taking him to Saint-Malo, where the two stories converge, in both time and place, during the destruction of the city in 1944.  There are other characters, interesting in themselves, who give structure, poignancy, depth, and sub-motivations to the larger story: Marie-Laurre’s loving father, her devoted and eccentric great-uncle Etienne, the resourceful housekeeper Madame Manec, Werner’s gigantic but soft-hearted schoolmate and comrade-in-arms Volkheimer, his strong-willed sister Jutta, the single-minded gem hunter von Rumpel, and others.  Doerr masterfully maintains momentum and tension over multiple, intersecting story lines.<br/><br/>Yes, the backdrop is World War II, but the story is not so much about the war as it is about people either letting the war reveal the worst in them, or trying to salvage goodness and beauty in spite of it.  This is one of those books that you give to someone with a twinge of both regret and anticipation: regret because you will never again have the experience of reading it for the first time, but anticipation as you await the reaction of someone who has not yet had the pleasure.
I debated whether to give this book one star or five. It is written so well, with a compelling suspense that I was not expecting. It does not, however, leave you satisfied...but perhaps life never does. Thank goodness I have hope beyond the grave.
I felt transported reading this novel & did not want the reading experience to end. It was a book I wished to have held in my hands rather than just have on the Kindle. On a crowded bookcase I would have made room! It is a keeper to be read again.
When it comes to the art of crafting pretty sentences, this book certainly gets all the point. The language has a lovely flow to it, full of evocative figures of speech. It does a great job of painting a picture of an era and makes for a very atmospheric read. However, the story itself was... boring. Maybe it's low-brow of me to think so, but whatever. Most of the time, I just did not care what was going on because frankly, nothing was happening. And since I was listening to the audiobook, I actually zoned out several times. Neither of the main characters has much personality. They're figures rather than actual people, and the author keeps them at arm's length. We're privy to a few of their thoughts, but for the most part, they drift like shadows through the book, memorable only because of what they are, and not who. Werner at least shows some sign of life, with his curiosity and touch of internal conflict. Marie-Laure is a Mary Sue through and through who only does what she's told or expected to do. Maybe her parts would have been more interesting if she'd had more of an opinion about... anything, really.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is one of those book-vegetables that I know objectively is good but that I didn't actively enjoy. But I liked it well enough to finish, and I can appreciate the craft that went into it. I'm just more into books with actual plots, and for this one, many of the scenes had me wondering, "What is the point of you other than to show off how pretty your sentences are?"<br/><br/>Three stars for the pretty sentences, well-researched setting, and evocative language, plus a bonus star for featuring kids who are interested in the sciences (I'm a nerd and have a soft spot for the science-talk) and a sympathetic Nazi. That was actually half the reason I wanted to read the book in the first place - to see how it handled World War II from the point of view of those history has universally demonized. Yes, the Nazis were awful as a group, and many of the individuals were horrible too, but I hate absolutes, and seeing them treated as convenient battle-bot-type villains in so much pop culture has gotten tiresome. So seeing how an innocent orphan boy was pulled into the world of Nazis - not entirely willingly but not kicking and screaming either - was a fascinating twist on a tired tale.
I jumped on the bandwagon and listened to this since it was one of the few historical fiction audiobooks available through my library. While I wasn't as enraptured as the thousands of people who voted it Goodreads best historical fiction book of 2014, it did have some exceptional moments.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/>The author has written a unique WWII story that manages to stand out among the bazzilion WWII novels in existence. He does not include a single Jewish family hiding from the Nazis, but rather strives to demonstrate that some Germans who happen to have hair as white as snow could still become victims.<br/><br/>Relationships are very well developed. Listening to this novel, I could feel the love between Marie-Laure and her father. Her uncle is slowly brought out of his shell of depression that he has been hiding in since the first world war, and he risks all for her during the German occupation of France.<br/><br/>The German boy, Werner, is written in a way that it would be difficult to not like him, even if he is the perfect example of a young, brilliant Aryan. He is the character who will stick with me from this book. Every time a young boy plays at war on a video game, I will envision the white haired boy who had no choice.<br/><br/>Finally, the author's prose is exemplary. I could smell salt in the air and feel fear as the sound of bombers roared across the water due to Doerr's expert descriptions of landscape, feelings, and atmosphere.<br/><br/>What I didn't like:<br/>The diamond. Intertwined within Marie-Laure and Werner's stories is the fable of a diamond that winds up causing some trouble for the French characters because the German's predictably would like to have it. There is too much drivel about the diamond's supposed past and powers. Definitely not my thing and took away from the moving parts of the story.<br/><br/>The ending. A point that I will not mention would have made a fabulous ending of this book. Unfortunately, it carries on long enough to fizzle out. Making the same mistake as JK Rowling with her "19 Years Later" chapter, this author decides to carry the reader into the future. I guess this is supposed to give us closure and help us be more thankful for what we have, but I didn't think it was worth it. Like the diamond subplot, it simply took away from everything that was wonderful about this book.<br/><br/>Overall, I am glad that I read this book, even if it isn't in my top favorites. Fans of WWII novels and literary fiction will like what Doerr has done here.
Many thanks to Netgalley.com for providing me with an advanced digital copy of All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr in exchange for my honest review.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is an engaging WWII survival story. I wouldn't have thought it possible that I could feel empathy for a young orphan boy recruited to be a Nazi, but I did. That is to the credit of the author who is a gifted writer and who told a captivating, thought-provoking story. The author takes his time letting the reader get to know the young, Inquisitive,  inventive Werner and his fear of dying in the mines like his father. This reader was conflicted by this character. His future and options were so limited, but becoming a Nazi just too heinous to accept. I loved Marie Laure who is blind, but has an awe-inspiring strength of character. Her interactions with her father, great uncle and housekeeper touched me.<br/><br/>I had some issues with the book though. The ending was less than satisfying which is always an issue for me. I don't necessarily need the ending to be neatly resolved, but with so much time invested in the story and characters to then have a weak ending is disappointing. Additionally, I suggest that this novel be read as a physical book instead of on a digital book device. There were definite formatting errors that I hope were picked up in a final edit prior to release, but more concerning is that the story jumps around in time which was particularly confusing on my Kindle App. I would have much rather have had a physical book where I could flip back and become more easily adjusted to the differing time periods.<br/><br/>This would have been a five star review for me if the ending was better.
I stayed with it since it’s a Pulitzer Prize winner and thousands of readers have given it 5 stars. My criticisms may be a matter of taste, but I thought the characters were too vague, the times line unnecessarily confusing and the magic jewel did not work for me as a part of the plot.<br/><br/>Of the major characters, we don’t know what makes them tick. Of Marie-Laurie we know that she is blind, loves and is loved by her father and his small family and collects shells. We don’t know her sense of right and wrong, her feelings about the war, her hopes for the future, etc. We understand Werner a bit more. He is sentimental and nostalgic, a talented radio engineer and a reluctant participant in the brutality of his “training”. The most clearly drawn character was Frederick. I’m glad he was there, but he was not central to the plot.<br/><br/>I prefer a linear book, but could accept time switching if it had a role. There seems to be no purpose and the result is that it only confuses. One character is all but introduced by his death, with the reader to later learn that he is a minor character.<br/><br/>Does the plot really need a magic jewel? As events unfold, with some adjustment, any keepsake would work.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the depiction of the Nazi training camp was excellent. On the negative side, the portrayal of the French resistance was vague.<br/><br/>The book reads quickly. It has a higher visual content than most novels so I’m expecting a movie sometime in the next two years or so.  I think the director will have re-write and the film will be mostly chronological, characters will be drawn such that we care about them, the jewel will stay magical and the ending more conclusive.
Absolutely loved this book and the way the character storylines are brought together.  You can imagine yourself in that time and place.  I highly recommend this story for anyone who loves an historical fiction novel or just a great, solid read.
The detailed descriptions of the natural world and of the human characters who inhabit it were so beautifully written. This tragic yet lovely tale set in the most brutal of times captivated me as few other tales have been able in recent years.
The storyline was good and the historical facts were very accurate as substantiated by several friends of mine who survived WWII as children.  Mr. Doerr did his homework there.  The story surrounds two main characters, Marie-Laure, a blind French girl living in Paris with her locksmith father and Werner Pfennig, a German orphan whose natural talent for electronics gets him into an elite academy for the Hitler youth.  The story goes on to describe how the apocalypse of the war changed lives forever.  It was unforgiving and if people were unprepared or unwilling to conform, they were quickly eliminated.  The Third Reich headmasters purposely pitted stronger boys against weaker in a sadistic game of survival.  Pfennig's genius for radios saves him from this fate.  Marie-Laure studies the topography of her town in order to get around quickly and efficiently, counting rain drains, steps and sewer covers.  She hones her senses of smell and hearing and prepares herself to survive no matter what happens.  Doerr goes on to introduce many characters who touch the lives of these two but they come and go.  I didn't like that he often left out critical information, and the reader had to read several chapters ahead in order for past chapters to make sense. That was a bit frustrating because I kept going back thinking I missed something only to encounter it somewhat later on. As expected towards the end of the book, their lives briefly intersect.<br/><br/>I thought at times, there was too much description of landscapes, flora and fauna.  I liked the 2-3 page chapters because they made bedtime reading much easier.  Because I love history, I liked this book very much and would recommend.
This is a best seller.  Not sure why.  I did finish the book and wasn't even sure how it ended. I liked the basic story but was not able to keep the characters straight, which was good and which was evil.  Maybe I should try reading it again.
The story and the characters were richly drawn. You really got to know each character. The beauty and grace of France was as much a part of the story as the people. So many consequences of World War II. A pleasure to read filled with sadness
This a beautifully written novel  which will stay with the reader for some time. The characters are quite memorable and the story profoundly moving.  Being an avid reader I am often asked for recommendations . I will highly recommend this.
This is the best book that I have read in a long time.<br/>I am recommending it to everyone I know.<br/>It is well written, with great characters and a interesting plot.<br/>I felt so immersed in this book, that I didn't want it to end.
I couldn't put this book down and would read through to the early hours of the morning. Beautiful prose, strong character development, and the plot line was captivating. I really felt this was a unique World War novel. Highly recommended.
Others have commented on the plot so I will just offer my take. This is an excellent book and I recommend it. What this book does not contain is almost as interesting as what it does contain. It contains almost nothing about our side of the war and very little about the Nazi leaders. It reveals the other war - the one experienced by ordinary people. There's a lot to learn.<br/>One reads about what it's like to be bombed, as expected. One does not read about Jews being incinerated in concentration camps!  Surprise, but at the time, very few knew. One reads about other Nazi camps where prisoners were German civilians, deserters, low-ranking soldiers and other "little people" who were forced into the Nazi world, judged worthless and tossed. There are no action-figure hero's. There are ordinary people living ordinary lives who find themselves performing heroic. deeds simply because it's the right thing to do.<br/>This was my highlight: If born before the Boomers, one may recognize these lyrics from<br/> Chap. 155 Music #3. "Men cluster to me...Like moths around a flame...And if their wings burn...I know I'm not to blame!"  (From "Falling In Love Again", famously sung by the movie star, Marlene Dietrich). Author Doerr has a Nazi officer character, Von Rumpel, reflecting upon his life in August, 1944, when he faces death in a bombed-out attic. Thoughts of his family come, two small daughters which his wife shows off at child beauty pageants. He disapproves of it all - their skimpy costumes and the singing of taboo words that they can't understand. Who is Von Rumple? The bad guy,of course, who in the end had some moral inclinations after all.
Fascinating!  Writing a book from the viewpoint of a blind child is brilliant.  This provided a totally different perspective on both the German and French sides of WWII, as well as detailed views of the daily life of privation and fear.
This was a wonderful read. Great character development and descriptive reading. I felt as though I was walking along with Marie Lore and Werner. Don't miss this one! The meaning of the title was something different four each character.
Riveting articulate and challenging, this novel winds a tale of young people  challenged by the cruel demands of war, their dreams, coping methods, response to extraordinary demands, and efforts to do the right thing.  Hard to put down.
I loved the different take on a genre already filled with a plethora of great novels. The main characters are well developed and the prose is lovely. The end didn't come as full circle for me as I'd anticipated, but I'd still recommend.
The usual adjectives for describing plot don't work here--some twists? full of surprises.  The plot is meticulously built up.  Doerr's descriptions are masterful, thoughtful, insightful.  The metaphors are beautiful.  A wonderful book.
Anthony Doerr, the author of All the Light We Cannot See, truly has a gift for writing.  He was able to make you feel like you in the story right along with the characters.<br/><br/>The story is told by alternating between two main characters.  The first main character is named Werner.  He is a boy growing up in Germany who proves to have a special gift for making radios and machines work.  When WWII begins, be is selected to go to a special school that raises boys to fight for Hitler's cause. The second main character is a blind girl name Marie-Laure.  She is growing up in France during WWII.  At first their stories seem to be completely seperate.  However, as you continue to read you will marvel at how cleverly Doerr managed to weave their stories together.<br/><br/>The ending was superb.  There was no fairy tale ending where everyone was safe and happened like it should.  The ending depicted what life would really be like after surviving WWII.<br/><br/>There were two parts of the book that seemed to drag on and on.  The first was Marie-Laure's reading of her braile book Tweny thousand leagues under the sea.  I am sure that the author had a reason for telling so much of the story in this book.  I myself did not like that book or movie.  To find full passages in this book from twenty thousand leagues was boring.  Was it supposed to be symbolic of something?  The second thing that I got tired of reading about was the Sea of Flames diamond.  All of the hype of this diamond throughout the book and then the final resting place of the diamond was non-climatic.<br/><br/>This is a great read.  I would highly recommend it.
Set in the second world war, it follows a young German who is something of a radio expert and is taken into the Wehrmacht to trace radio sources, particularly from resistance fighters, and a young blind French girl, whose father takes her from Paris to St Malo soon after the fall of France, and she stays there until the invasion, and the fight. Contrary to what the blurb says, it seemed to me that this was the story of two people, and those around them, caught up in a flood of events that they cannot control. The book is a sequence of very short chapters, almost invariably less than four, and these each paint a picture of a point in time. The descriptions are excellent, but almost by definition, not very much happens because the chapters are not long enough to develop action. Indeed, the book has essentially no plot, and is an exercise in the use of "beautiful writing".<br/><br/>The characters well-drawn but they do not develop, the descriptions are very clear, but in my opinion, all this is spoiled by the author hopping about in time. In principle this is done with Parts, but within these it is not always clear how much time separates chapters, and since very little actually happens, this struck me as a technique to disguise the fact that not much was happening. For me, this is a cheat; it is done to demonstrate writing skill at the expense of thinking of some message to write about.  So, how good this book is depends on what you want; if you want atmosphere, it is definitely five stars; if you want character development based on events or something to think about later, it struggles for three. I have averaged.
This is an exquisite book with a wonderful format---shifting each chapter to the voice and adventures of one or the other of its two protagonists.  And the writing is beyond gorgeous.  The book is mesmerizing---you cannot put it down!
WHY is the PAPERBACK less expensive than the DIGITAL edition?  This is a ripoff. Kindle versions should be *maybe* half the paperback price, which should be maybe half to 3/4 the hardback price.  Who comes up with this absurd pricing?
I would have given the book a 5 star if not for the lame ending.  It seems the author rushed at the end just to get a conclusion.  It leaves you asking yourself so what happened to x or y or z.  To bad I really enjoyed it up to then.
The author skips around from the boy to the girl and backwards and current.  On one chapter two characters went missing and in the next installment they were back with no explanation.  Too much work to keep track of time and scene.
A book with two children and what happened in their life in Europe in the 1930 and1940  very good read .the years jump back and forth which sometimes makes it hard to follow. As a child during the war it made the time come to life.
I had just finished the Nightingale before I read this book; in comparison, I found this book somewhat of a disappointment; I had thought that it was a love story, involving the two main characters-my mistake, but influenced by the promotional literature.The story follows two main characters,a blind teen aged girl, and a bright young German boy who gets the opportunity to attend a specialized school, and pursue his love of science. he young girl lives in Paris with her devoted father; he is a very specialized locksmith at the museum. She spends her younger days with her father at the museum, being taught and befriended by the various scientist at the museum.He has built her a model of the city so that she can learn to travel about on her own.As France is invaded, they are forced to flee Paris, and go to live with a reclusive uncle. Her father is carrying a very valuable package for the museum, which eventually leads to his arrest and imprisonment. as war is ever closer, both the girl and young soldier are forced to make choices and endure suffering; the boy suffers because more and more, he believes the war is wrong. The girl must learn how to care for herself, and help the war effort as she is able. The two eventually meet briefly; I really wish that a supportive relationship could have occurred between the two. The book progresses slowly for the first 2/3. The last section which portrays her later life is almost an afterthought. There are sections of the book that are very tautly written, the author's style is very literate.Perhaps at another time and situation, I would have given it 4 stars.
This story of intertwined lives in Europe's run-up to and experience of World War II is a powerful character study. The plot device of a valuable jewel with the power to protect the owner, but devastate those around the owner, to me symbolized the struggles of all those immersed in war and deluded by the seduction of war as a means to an end. The title reflects the pervasive theme of blindness throughout the books. Virtually all the characters exist in a state of blindness to various aspects of their conditions and beliefs. There is one possible exception, a character referred to as a giant who seems able to see through the façade of propaganda and unreasonable hope of the naïve in order to find an optimal path to, as best as he can, protect himself and those he respects.  The writing is very satisfying and engaging. The pace keeps the reader turning pages. The texture of subplots and secondary characters and antagonists add both realism and interest from start to finish.  A minor quibble was the authors decision to jump around in time. If found this distracting and unnecessary, but tolerable. The fabric of endings among the surviving characters delivers what I regarded as a well-grounded picture of how total war finally plays out, not unlike the way a wave washes toward shore with force and fury, but retreats, having affected every grain of sand in some way, yet leaving the overall pattern of reality not so terribly unlike the way it was before the wave hit.  This is a good read, more character-based than action, but with enough action to provide satisfaction at more than one level.
There is a meditative brilliance that reveals the inner light we all have, which most of us, either ignore, or can not see. I love Anthony Doerr for having written it, and wish that every one would read it. It is a masterpiece !
Beautiful evocative prose.  Hauntingly imagined. A little slow to get into but well worth it for the sheer artistry of this novel.  A story that will touch many, grab hold and never let go.  Images of Marie and Werner linger on.
stunning phrases that invigorated your mind --like-- what did he just say?-- i would read them aloud to my husband for more enjoyment -- a great read with that horrid ww2 background --wonderfully done-- would recommend to anyone
Only reason I cannot give this 5 stars....the ending. I felt the ending was way too vague to carry the emotional weight of the situation. I loved the characters...the style of writing, etc. It will make a great movie, I'm sure!
The problem with getting engrossed in a really good book is that I can’t put it down and life outside the pages of the book comes to a halt. That’s what happened once I got into All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr.<br/><br/>The story is told in short, staccatto-style chapters alternating between the lives of blind French teenager, Marie-Laure and gifted German orphan, Werner Pfennig. When Marie-Laure and her father, who is the chief locksmith at the Paris Museum of Natural History evacuate Paris just ahead of the German occupation, they travel to Saint-Malo, the medieval fortress town located on the northwest coast of France to live with a reclusive uncle suffering from “shell shock” suffered in the First World War. At the same time in Germany, Werner Pfennig is sent to a brutal and sadistic military training school for elite Hitler Youth where he is expands his passion for radios, mathematics and physics for the good of The Feuhrer.<br/><br/>For the first part of the book, I felt like I was reading a story written for the young adult market, much like The Book Thief. Then, the characters begin to really take on a life of their own. They’re no longer going through the motions of children living through a horrendous time in history and we become more involved in their inner thoughts, fears, pleasures and pain. There is a sub-plot about a rare diamond being hidden from Nazi looters, but the real story is the intersection of the lives of ordinary people during extraordinary times, how they react and survive, and the impact of those times that remains today.
This was a book club book and lent itself to a good discussion. I read and listened to this book [Audible.com]. Loved the characters and their development. The plot was not necessarily predictable but hopeful. WWII background.
Really a perfect book. Crafted beautifully, engaging characters, the main stories and sub plots are riveting and real. I loved this book. Loved it. Have never read Doerr before but he is a master writer. Very few in his class.
“All the Light We Cannot See” by Anthony Doerr is the 2015 Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction. The accolade is well-deserved.  The book is enthralling and is unlike any other WWII story you ever read.<br/><br/>Beautifully written, this story by Doerr captures the feeling of war in a very personal way. Most remarkably, he portrays the daily life of the blind French girl so expertly, as to make a reader who is blessed with sight enter directly into the girl’s persona. The boy, a German, is equally persuasive, highly sympathetic.<br/><br/>The story includes a mysterious gemstone, the whereabouts of which constitute the only mystery we encounter. Locating the stone, which has been secreted away by French museum officials, becomes the single-minded obsession of one particular Nazi soldier.<br/><br/>All characters are individually precise with distinct characteristics. The siege of St Malo is terrifying, as the French nationals (including the blind girl) and the occupying German troops (including the German boy) suffer through the American bombardment.<br/><br/>Not everyone in the story survives the horrors of war. I was shocked when one of the primary characters stepped on a land mine and was blown to bits. It’s an unusual and brave author who can kill off one of his principals!<br/><br/>If there is one flaw in the story, it is the somewhat clumsy portrayal of nearly every single German character (except for the boy) in quasi-stereotypical ways, almost all of which are profoundly negative.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this book is a rapturous read. A 5+, no doubt.
A reader can easily become lost in this riveting historical fiction. The author blends the stories of 2 young people who live in different countries during WW2 yet whose lives are intertwined in many ways. Marie-Laure is a French daughter of a museum locksmith forced to flee to the island of St Malo when the Germans invade France. Werner is a German orphan recruited for his gift of understanding electrical components and air wave transmissions.<br/><br/>The detail to historical events and to the town's and streets of France and Germany are amazing. This book again reminds me of what physical and mental assaults the people of countries that are invaded have to endure as well as their tenacity and courage. It highlights a different perspective of some of the "enemy", particularly those indoctrinated as pre-teens and fed a relentless amount of propraganda, fear and abuse. It does not excuse their actions but does make the reader think of how some, as victims, chose the path of the oppressor.<br/><br/>The unrelenting love Marie-Laure's father and guardians show and how they help her become so independent and courageous despite her inability to see is remarkable. The author's descriptions bring to life the senses of sound, smell, and touch which surround Marie-Laure in good times and during the occupation.<br/>The book primarily covers the early 1940's to the 1970's with anecdotes on the characters' lives up to the current technical revolution. It is a story with hope, courage and family ties that extend beyond the worst of times.
So many layers to this story!  Loved how the author used the history of WWII to intertwine the lives of the characters. The author took me inside their heads and inside the experience of being blind. Could not put it down!
Incredible, such a beautiful, tragic, moving, inspiring story. The seemingly unrelated characters make the way to each other step by step, and the way they meet is not a prediction I could have made. An absolute must read.
I loved this book, I was in high school during those war years and this book brought back many memories - some sad, some bittersweet.  At the age of 85 now, that is long way back.  I am really glad I got to read. This book
I felt it was disjointed and dragged at times.  It leaves you with an empty feeling as it never quite answers the questions posed in the book.  I have read many war war two books and feel this one was the least impressive.
Anthony Doerr's "All The Light We Cannot See" is a soul stirring and strangely touching work of historical fiction. Like the radio waves that serve as his principal plot construct, Doerr manages to pierce through concrete walls, mortar shells, rabid nationalism, war atrocities, and alternate histories alike to deliver a static-free song that sings of our universal humanity, irrespective of the absurdities and tragedies that we inherit from our individual histories and societies.<br/><br/>Controversially, Doerr's tale equalizes two disparate individuals - a blind girl from the French civilian resistance and a poor, orphaned boy soldier from the German army - during a historical era in which traditional histories have made it impossible for the latter to be treated as anything but a villain, let alone one half of a touching love story.<br/><br/>Yet, with beautiful and evocative writing and a deft remembrance and honoring of the many victims of German militarism during the 20th century (of which we should remember many millions were Germany's own civilian population), Doerr manages to thoroughly humanize each and every one of his deeply wrought characters, crafting a historical thriller that sweeps across an entire century of European history.<br/><br/>Any reader who wishes to understand the various shades of grey associated with the history of World War II and its profound impact on European society - on both sides of the conflict, both victim and aggressor - should pick up this touching novel and dive into the deep end.
Not just another book about the anger and damages of war . Anthony Doerr introduces lovely characters from several different points of view that intersect at one point or another in their lives before, during or after WWII. My favorite young girl, Marie Lore , a sweet blind French girl and the daughter of the locksmith of the huge museum in San Malo. Marie Lore has a lust for knowledge and she is determined not to allow anything to get in her way of living as normal a life as possible even as a war does go on. Her Father , Great Uncle , and Madame Manec have charge of her care but you would think it was the opposite. Our young Marie Lore is the heroine throughout the whole story which is often led by another group of characters who get caught up in Hitler's propaganda . Phenig , Jutta, Frau Elena and the others who are just caught in bad situations prove that what we know that War is always bad no matter whose side is right or wrong . Nobody wins in War and this is one light that enlightens each well realistic character in this story. This is not the only light that will be discovered which makes this book a beautiful life lesson that impacted my heart and soul immediately. The lyrics in the song , " I saw the light ! " really were ringing in my ears. This was a MASTERPIECE! The book was a bit unrealistic that people everywhere in the midst of such a horrific war were really kept in the dark by trying to just survive. Meanwhile 6,000,000 Jews were were being slaughtered . WWII  was in darkness and in evil. Yet , the light of some kept others going . You must read this book ! It will restore your faith in humanity. Even in the harshest conditions we can survive if we pull together one by one. There was a mystery left , maybe you will figure it out about a myth and a precious gem calledwere the Sea Of Flames . The Stone was never found . The loose ends were not tied. All I can guess is this one hint I suppose this made Phennig a very honorable young man . I really did not like the way the book ended either. It just did not!!! All in all there was always this feeling of hope and possibility that like life, is sometimes a surprising blessing and sometimes a disappointment to start us onto another path. Such is life ... It goes on as fate decides . I still loved this book ... Dawn
I don't know what to say...this was just a wonderful book from beginning to end. The chapters were extremely short, probably from 2 pages to 5 pages each, so the story moved very quickly. The chapters were different character's stories that all end up meshing in the end. I know that sounds like maybe it would be confusing or distracting, but it's not. Never did I feel lost as to what was going on or who I was reading about.<br/><br/>Not only did this story include characters to love, but also characters to hate. Yet somehow you understand where they are all coming from. All of the motivation they have. I truly wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to side with a Nazi character in any book. Anthony Doerr is a genius in helping the reader to sympathize with many of his Nazi characters. And I'm not talking about characters that spend time blatantly thinking "this is wrong" either. I don't want to ruin the story so won't say much more on that. Just know that some of the Nazi characters will get your sympathy.<br/><br/>Werner, our hero, is such a bright boy. All he wants is to be able to learn and build and invent. There is so much innocence to him, even when he reaches adulthood. Where he is innocent and even naïve, our heroine Marie-Laure is wise beyond her years. Even before she is touched by war.<br/><br/>Again, so as not to post any spoilers I cannot say much more. Just know that you must read this book. It was woven together so beautifully and masterfully, I cannot wait to get my hands on another story by this author.
I became so absorbed that I just plowed through it. Doerr's writing is so beautiful and  vivid that I will probably read it again at a later date at my leisure to just enjoy the pictures and emotions that he conjures up.
Read from April 21 to 26, 2015<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what there is left to say about this book. There are so many good reviews and some not so great.<br/><br/>I loved the characters, but at times I felt like the book left me wanting for something. I don't even know what that could be. As one reviewer stated, maybe it was my mood at the time, I'm just not sure.<br/><br/>I fell in love with Marie-Laure and her papa. The sweet little things he did for her while their lives were still normal. I'm not putting any spoilers in this book so the ones who have read it know what I'm talking about. The things he did for her after she became blind.<br/><br/>I liked Werner, Jutta and Frederick. I was appalled at what happened to Frederick but not really surprised. The way humans are to each other and every living thing, it's sad though.<br/><br/>There is a special place in my heart for Marie-Laure's uncle Etienne and Madame Manec. They were such nice people. There are a few different people in the book that are good characters.<br/><br/>The book is sad and does have some happiness. But I could never imagine being Marie-Laure and blind in those times. Everything was bad enough to add that burden.<br/><br/>All in all it was a good book, it wasn't all about the war and stuff, it's about Marie-Laure and Werner growing up during this time and how they reacted and the things they had to go through.<br/>MY REVIEWS:<br/><br/>www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com<br/><br/>https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1121446734
Interesting, well-written and really educational, from mollusks to radio transmitting, from life in St. Malo France during the bombardment and retreat of the Germans to figuring out life's puzzles. This book has it all.
So beautifully and horrifically written. The colors and shapes and smells tossed me  right into the horror of war.<br/>It is such a pleasure to experience through good writing an event of life completely unknown to me.
This was an interesting novel set in the latter months of the Second World War. It followed the lives of two young people - a young German boy who was brought up in an orphanage after death of the father in a mining accident and loss of his mother, and a young girl who lived with her widowed father and became blind in childhood. Their subsequent lives were then described with the young boy, who was fascinated with radios and associated technology which resulted in him being sent to a secondary  boarding school run by the Nazis which was a cold hard existence with vicious pressure on the young boys to be the best and fittest that was possible , with shame and dismissal for those that failed. The boy was fortunate that his skills with radio technology gave him exemption from much of this life and he worked with a technical teacher to perfect radio detection apparatus to be used in the war to detect enemy hiding in towns and villages. The girl was taught by father how to navigate her environment despite her blindness. When the Nazis invaded Paris she moved with her father to an uncles home in the Coast of Brittany. The father returns to Paris thinking it was safe to do so, but disappears. The girls stays on with her great uncle, and the latter part of the novel shows how the lives of these two young people cross and become enmeshed in the town in Brittany. This was a very well written novel, which  really made these dying days of the war, and the conditions of the war and its impact on people, really live in a vivid way.
Excellent book!  Gives real insight into the German mindset as well as how they recruited basically children to fight the atrocious war.  Also makes you feel the danger the Resistance went through.  Highly recommended.
It feels strange writing a second mediocre review about a book that won the year's Pulitzer Prize. Last year I read "The Goldfinch" and was terribly unimpressed with the glowing write-ups about a book that had no core redeeming virtue and rambled unceasingly. While this year's Pulitzer stirs the heart and flows with compassion for a young blind girl, an orphaned German boy, and a reclusive great uncle, the situations and actions of the main characters lack a high degree of believability. Their reactions to their dire circumstances do not ring authentic. It is true that many stories skirt the boundaries of behavior, but, as in the case of the youthful chief protagonist in "The Goldfinch", their conduct and attitudes fall short of reality.<br/><br/>Many cite Doerr's storyline choppy and confusing because of the movement of present and past events. Also, the brevity of each episode seems unnecessary and isolated into single or dual page chapters. However, the writing is crisp and often poetic and metaphoric. The book takes on a mystical quality, and in spite of the horrific and barbaric deeds being perpetrated against innocent people, the nobility of the inner soul sheds the light of hope and redemption.<br/><br/>The book's concluding chapters, to this reviewer, offer the greatest satisfaction and reward. Unfortunately this does not fully compensate for the somewhat disappointing plot line and characterizations. "The Nightingale" of 2015 offers a much more enjoyable and gripping read.
A heartfelt story that takes place between two teens living through World War II, All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr is a teen fiction novel of compassion. Doerr does an amazing job representing real life situations and tragedies in this book. The novel shows how people had to live prior to, during, and after World War II. The main character, Marie-Laure’s life is turned upside down when she becomes blind at the age of eight as a result of an explosion. This imparity clearly takes a toll on her physically, mentally, and psychologically, which Doerr does an excellent job of showing. The reader gets a sense of what life must be like in her shoes. When she overcomes the difficulties of her blindness, she meets Werner, and the connection they have is inevitable. However, the format of All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is set up in a confusing way.  It is composed of ten sections, each taking place in a different period of time. Within those sections are little subsections about a place, person, event, or thing that takes up about a page or two. I think that this format made the book hard to follow. It is difficult to get to know characters and how they interact with others when the topic keeps switching to something new. Also, very rarely do the topics repeat themselves, which contributes to the fact that it is hard to get a feel for traits of characters. If the reader can get past the complicated format, they will see that the set up is what makes the story have an incredible ending.
One of the best books I have read.  Am looking forward to the Diane Rehms' Show interview with Anthony Doerr.  It is a fascinating read in that you get the perspective of a blind person living in a complicated world.
A compelling story told from the viewpoint of several characters. The author narrates among this characters and the plot is both swiftly moving and the characters sympathetic and engaging. I really enjoyed this novel
Patience required as the author flits from character to character then swings through past, present and future for each.  Thoughts, feelings and perceptions in abundance! If you're looking for action, look elsewhere.
Every day the number of survivors from the World War II generation diminishes and their particular stories with them.<br/><br/>It took ten years for Anthony Doerr to complete his World War II set tale.  From this reader's perspective this obvious labor of love was worth the wait.  The chief characters in this meticulously crafted work (Werner and Marie-Laure) are as fully realized as I believe is possible in a novel.  And it takes very few pages before your heart is with them and you begin to feel with them and for them.  And even the secondary characters are memorable - whether it is the "giant" Volkheimer, poor, crushed Frederick or Marie's (eventually) brave Great Uncle Etienne.<br/>Was it all a bit fantastical (sea of flame) or coincidental (certain radio broadcasts from France reaching young Werner) - yes, and indeed.  But these elements were essential to the plot and in no way detracted from my enjoyment of what is, after all, a story.<br/><br/>Mr Doerr not only has a way with his human characters, but with the other great feature of this novel - which are the sights and sounds and smells of the places he takes the reader - whether it is Paris and St-Malo in France or the bleak coal mining towns of German or the killing fields of the Ukraine - each are vividly recreated.  War-time Europe lives again.<br/><br/>As with most of the books of this caliber that I read, I had to start to ration my pages halfway through so I could let the enjoyment linger over this truly  amazing tale.
Loved that it was a simple story of two young lives intersecting in beauty, intelligence, and sensitivity amid the horrors of war. Felt like real lives of ordinary people, not an emotionally manipulating soap opera.
I started this book at the recommendation of a friend and got about 25% through it and couldn't stand it. It kept popping up in my recommended reading guide and I saw that over 15,000 people gave it favorable reviews so I figured I would give it another chance. This time I finished it, hoping it would get better as it went, but it never did. This book was moderately entertaining at best.<br/>The characters are wonderful and well developed. I really liked the characters. The story line was interesting. The issue I had with this book was the way it was written. There was far too much description. There is a point where you are creating an experience for your readers and a point when you are droning on, adding filer words and distracting from the story line. I found myself skimming over the over descriptions only to miss something valuable to the story. I had to go back and read parts over and over again because my mind stated to wander when the book went into descriptive mode (which was the majority). There are few books that I have read which I really dislike but this makes the list. I especially hate when so many other people loved it and I feel like I am an outlier. Ironically I have talked to a few other people who have read this book who had the same experience as me so perhaps those who disliked it are not reviewing the book.<br/>Although I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, I would suggest that people read the other more positive reviews for an alternate perspective.
Once you read this book you will never again visit Europe without thinking of these times in WWII.  So many intimate family stores and this one through a blind girls eyes.  You won't be able to put this book down.
Amazingly well written novel.  Hated to have it end. It is my choice next month for my book club.  Very vivid descriptions.  This is a book you actually felt like you were there and lived with the main characters.
This is a difficult book to describe. It presents stories of a handful of very "small" lives which together paint a full and deeply disturbing profile of World War II and its aftermath. In this way, it brilliantly uses a few people to artfully tell a much bigger storry.<br/><br/>Central in the book are two characters -- a motherless blind girl living in occupied France and a German teenage boy who is singled out by the Nazis for his exceptional abilities. Though these two characters don't physically meet until three-quarters of the way through the book, we watch their lives unfold in parallel, showing the war from the viewpoints of both the occupied and occupier. These two and the other supporting characters live lives full of the drama of this war-- parents who disappear, food scarcity, historic towns shelled, quiet resistance work, young girls raped, and Hitler youth taught that brutality is an essential part of serving the Fatherland. It becomes an incredibly suspenseful read, where you may find yourself needing to take a break from time to time.<br/><br/>So, then why am I not awarding 5 stars? Purely because of the writing style. The stream-of-consciousness way in which Doerr describes what ALL his characters are thinking became tiresome to me. Perhaps he intended by this style to give them all a sameness -- but to me the style began to interfere in my enjoyment of the book. I still recommend the book and urge you to finish it -- particularly since the final chapters about the survivors, years after the war, are some of the most poignant.
Sometimes you can appreciate the beauty of a novel but not necessarily look forward to opening it up every day.  That is the feeling I had when reading All the Light We Cannot See. Also, this could have been due to the fact I read this on a beach vacation this summer and that is maybe not the best time to read a book about Hitler Youth a blind girl hiding a very prized possession in a Nazi-occupied France.  It was like, “Kelly do you want another Mai-Tai?” And I’m all, “Wait a second the Hitler youth are beating each other to a pulp in the middle of an ice storm…Sure I’ll take another Mai-Tai.” And now I feel guilty.<br/><br/>Anyway, I appreciated this book; it’s well-written(ness?), the character development, the gorgeously wrought landscape that came to life in my mind (whether it was traumatic or not) and the detailed research the author obviously did to write this novel (I heard it took him ten years). And although I appreciated it, I didn’t love it i.e. I never felt that flow where I didn’t want to put the book down.<br/><br/>The author describes radios in this novel…Many radios, many details of them, all of which I began glossing over towards the end of the book.  The ending also leaves a bit to be desired.  Spoiler Ahead!! (sort of) A certain someone doesn’t find out what happened to a certain someone else and I was like, Whhhhhattttt?!!!! This is probably a realistic ending but left me a little frustrated. I would read more from this author in the future though.
Although at times it was difficult to track, this book is beautifully written. The character development is amazing. There is much to be learned from the strength of the characters and how they helped each other.
All that can be said about this novel has been said - 12,000 reviews have covered all aspects.  There's no point in being repetitious about the beautiful writing, the well-described settings, the fully-developed characters and the intriquing plot.  What detracted from a fabulous reading experience was the constant back and forth - from 1939 to 1944 to 1941 to 1945 and on and on.  It caused me to turn back many times to figure out where we were time-wise.  It might have been helpful to have an outline of the  different parts in the beginning.  I'm no neophyte to the writing style that moves back and forth with parallel lives drawn together at the end - but this one didn't flow for me - and I feel I lost something every time I had to do a reality check.<br/><br/>The ending was the second disappointment.  After carrying one theme through the whole story, it was left, abandoned, as far as I could tell - even after re-reading the the last chapters.  Sometimes a reader feels that someone has given the writer a maximum word count - so the end must be wrapped up with the speed of it lightening.  It read almost like a recitation - this character has done this, that character has done that, and Marie has been taken for a walk by her grandson.  But, who am I to criticize what the world has proclaimed a masterpiece??  Everyone's reading experience is different, and although I enjoyed the author's writing ability and the story, I could  give only four stars for the total experience.
A strange book: full of caring,full of dereliction.  On the one hand, a story of youth: Marie-Laure and Werner, on opposite sides of Europe and in the war, telepathically drawn to one another.  Detailed, brave, authentic.  On the other, a throw-away subplot on which the main appeal of the book hinges: will an evil Nazi discover the whereabouts of a fabulous diamond?  Spolier alert:the answer is no and who cares?  His pursuit of the gem is only a thread to tie together Marie-Laure and Werner's would-be union.  He himself, the evil Nazi, is easily dispatched with one bullet, as easily as Werner himself later on.  The effect is reminiscent of that belonging to "The Lovely Bones," in which the author had her bad guy simply - poof!- disappear when she was finished with him,no payoff,no punishment.  Page after page of gorgeous writing, empathy, struggle. To end with a "splat."  If an author cannot love all his/her characters equally, and treat them as they deserve,why should we?  This is a "Perfect Storm" approach - the author has two lovely stories to play with and seeks a way to tie them together (as opposed to three magazine articles to be united).  In neither case does this really work.  While the writing alone assures Doerr of a long and fruitful career, at the end of that career our bet is that this will be far down on his list of successes.<br/><br/>John Neufeld,author of<br/>Edgar Allan (a Kindle book) and Lisa, Bright and Dark (a Kindle book)
It is a good book, though I expected a bit more.<br/>I felt it was a bit unresolved.<br/>It was also VERY depressing with too many dead/suffering children. (as i suppose one should expect in a book about WWII)
Extremely rich and compelling look at a pivotal time in history from very different perspectives. If you have any interest at all in this time period and love a good story, this is a must read. I love this book.
The publicity around this book stated that it was ten years in the making. That's about how long I have been overwhelmed with work and unable to enjoy reading for pleasure. Now that I'm retired, I've wanted to take up reading again. I preordered this book on my Kindle and eagerly waited for it to come out.<br/><br/>I was immediately hooked.  Each "chapter" is a beautiful vignette--a jewel in its own right--in which I was in the present tense with the character(s).  And in the long tradition of really good French movies, time is a fluid element to be manipulated by the auteur: the book begins in the middle of the story and then goes back to catch the reader up.  Even at the end of the book, time still mesmerizes in its dance.<br/><br/>The characters are incredibly believable in both their strength and their vulnerability. I appreciated so much the incredible detail that flowed effortlessly across the pages. A trained scientist myself, I empathized with the characters and their lines of thought. That did not, however, keep me from predicting an ending that only seemed more and more possible as I read.  I have to believe that was the author's intention.<br/><br/>This is the book that has brought me back into the world of reading for pleasure.  I am going to re-read this book because once was simply not enough.  I rubbed it on my cheek like a child's favorite blanket from the beginning to the end, and I'd love to do it all over again.
An amazing book! I could not get enough of it. The prose is sheer beauty and the story has so many surprising and engaging twists and turns that it left me open-mouthed more than once! Definitely worth reading.
Experiencing this book was like floating on a cloud. The characters were interesting and all so real. I found a way to understand each of them and their plight. I found myself wishing this book would never end.
I truly loved this book.  It is a nicely woven tale of 2 different lives and how they eventually intersect, giving great meaning to one another.  The book provides some history lessons plus the wonderful story.
Both of the main characters make sense of the world through what they touch and hear. Marie –Laure from Paris must navigate her surroundings and articulate its elements sans sight; Werner Pfennig from Germany has an incredible talent of fixing radios to produce the sound they previously lost. Doerr writes so that we readers too, experience their lives with awareness more acute than what the eye alone sees. The prose is beautiful, articulate, detailed.<br/><br/>The Sea of Flames, a stone rumored to give its owner eternal life (at the cost of bad luck to come to those they love) is a nice touch, that despite the trials of life perhaps it doesn’t hurt the soul to believe there is magic left in the world.<br/><br/>Timelines are interwoven to emphasize the development of the characters, and boy do I passionately love well – written character studies. There were characters that made me angry, how it is possible for us to adapt to our uncompassionate surroundings by becoming uncompassionate ourselves. There were moments that made me sad, and I felt a heaviness in my chest that lasted for days as I struggled with the grand unfairness that came upon good people. But this was a story like the coveted treats given to Marie-Laure on her birthday, and I cherished it just the same. Upon its conclusion I felt I had shared in a long journey with Marie Laure and Werner.<br/><br/>Much thanks to Netgalley.com for providing me this book.<br/><br/>Blog:ilovemymani.com
One of the best books I've read in quite some time. Both characters' stories are fascinating and heart wrenching and the author does a wonderful job of weaving then together in a satisfying, unpredictable way.
Excellent story. Highly recommended !! Loved the style of writing- 3rd person, short chapters, could not put the book down. Even though over 500 pages, very fast reading. I will read this author's other works.
While reading this book, I would spend the entire day wishing for evening so that I could continue.  A rare book beautifully written and engrossing - one of those that make the next book one reads seem trivial
Absolutely loved this book. Very real characters and the story line keeps you hooked. Subject material is serious and there were some parts that made me tear up. Look forward to reading more from this author.
I loved this book completely. And for our book club, we brought French foods, including a Salade Nicoise, that were delicious. The discussion was thought-provoking, endearing, heart-felt, and totally engaged.
Loved this book. It was so good that I wanted to reread it immediately just to experience the lovely and descriptive writing again! Ornately detailed, emotional, lyrical, a wonderful read. Highly recommend!
Two distinct stories exist side by side during World War II culminating in an eventual intersection by the end of the book. Folklore is interwoven throughout by way of a precious stone and the power it possesses.<br/><br/>Werner is a young German soldier groomed for his innate intelligence in radio frequencies and all things mechanical. He narrowly escapes both an almost inevitable life working in the mines and the front lines of the war.<br/><br/>Marie Laure is a blind French girl with a strong penchant for books and learning. She lives with her father, a museum locksmith, when they get the order to flee their Paris apartment. They travel to the seaside town of Saint Malo to live with Marie Laure’s eccentric Uncle and his outspoken housekeeper. These two characters become beloved caretakers of Marie Laure after her father is taken prisoner by the Germans.<br/><br/>Present day comprises the end of the war and the stories of Werner and Marie Laure are told primarily in flashbacks. Connections drawn give the reader a sense of precise angles that make up a beautiful whole. The sense of hope and dignity shine consistently and the brutality of war never overshadows these things. Told with a lack of dramatization, each of the main characters endures what they must in order to survive. All the Light We Cannot See is a tribute to the best parts of humanity surviving in spite of the worst conditions and the darkest recesses of evil.
This book jumped around so much chronologically. It was difficult to follow. But the ending was such a disappointment. I bought it because it was so highly recommended, but it was a disappointing read.
Here is a novel that reminds us why fiction and literature are vital to humanity.<br/><br/>"All the Light We Cannot See" is a profound and poignant study of the tests, triumphs, and also the destruction of the human soul under grim persecution perpetrated by the Nazis. Most horrifying is to read how their indifferent brutality was applied alike to their own Aryan children as it was to their French enemies, and (to them) the insignificant Jews. Beneath the cruel heel of the hobnailed boot, Nazis indiscriminately crushed opposition, individuality, and independence real and imagined.<br/><br/>Overriding all, Doerr builds an atmosphere of ratcheting tension and impending doom followed by their inevitable realization that makes the reader want to turn away, avert the eyes. Even though the book is beautifully written, often lyrical, full of artistry when manipulating time and chronology, masterful in how ultra-short chapters are counterpoised against writing that slows down action to its minutest breath, it is primarily an important book that should and must be read.<br/><br/>At the end of the novel, years after the horror of war is over and as she is nearing the end of a long life, Marie-Laure muses while sitting on a Paris park bench next to her 12-year-old grandson. "Every hour, she thinks, someone for whom the war was memory falls out of the world."<br/><br/>Without books, without readers, thus we forget.
Excellent book that details the horrors of WW2 and follows several French and German characters throughout the war.  The author goes back and forth in time throughout the book wrapping up the story nicely.
Having written one of the finest novels I have read, Mr. Doerr has the rare ability to combine historical fact and lyrical fiction. The characters, settings, and events are credible and magically wrought.
It was a well written book overall.  The way the author tied everything together was great.  It was easy book to read.  The only problem was I felt disappointed with the end.  It kind of fell flat for me.
Interesting, very well-written but somehow lacking in gravitas. The author is poetic, but ultimately felt like a book for a younger reader. I was not thrilled, except for the beautiful turns-of-phrase.
What can you say about a pure masterpiece.  I could not put this book down.  Congratulations Mr. Doerr on an outstanding job.  I loved this book and will recommend it to anyone interested in a good read.
Using short chapters alternating the stories of the two protagonists, the author creates a memorable and empathetic tale of young<br/>lives and others trapped by the harsh and dispiriting clutch of Nazism. That era is rendered through the life of a young German male who uses his tech skills to escape the poverty of the coal mines by joining the German war apparatus. Enlightenment comes later. The other protagonist, a young blind girl, is about the same age and endures life in occupied France after fleeing Paris with her father. Resilience is acquired.<br/><br/>Linkage of their stories is foreshadowed. As the stories zip along, the distance between them converges both literally and figuratively. Drama increases.  A coming of age story to be sure.  Will there be a happy ending (not for Germany!) and how will loose ends be resolved and human potential realized?<br/><br/>As with any novel with lofty aspirations, a liberal sprinkling of starkly original metaphors and other literary devices are mandated. They can, as here, become a bit ubiquitous and a distraction.  Self indulgence or award winning writing? Short chapters often end with nuanced, philosophical or rhetorical ruminations designed, I suppose, to instill reflection. That's all part of the package of this highly praised novel. After all, how often does a book of this caliber appear on the NY Times best seller list? Strangely, there's no reader's guide.
I don't hand out many five-star reviews and I gave this novel five stars mainly because I love World War II novels that take place in occupied France and I felt the story was new and different and beautifully written.  The author began by telling the stories of two different main characters, a young blind girl in France, and a young orphaned boy in Germany.  The story was told by jumping forwards and backwards in time, which I found slightly confusing at times, but I was quickly able to regain my time frame by looking back a page or two to note what year the story was currently in.  It helped that I had a cursory knowledge of the main events during World War II and I knew that these two character's paths would eventually cross.  This didn't happen as quickly as I expected, nor would have liked. I found the backstories very interesting though, since I wasn't as well-versed in how life was for civilians in Germany during the war.  While I can't say I was totally thrilled with the ending, upon reflection, I'm not sure how it could have ended differently and still been realistic.  Often times I have questions about how life turned out for one of the secondary characters, but this author took us forward in time enough to see how their lives turned out and tied up all the loose ends.  I would highly recommend this book.  It was beautiful and poignant and provided thought-provoking lessons in human nature and history.
Extraordinary description of Life in war.  The piecing together of the. characters was skillful and fulfilling. It was an absorbing pleasure to read it.<br/>Take a chance on this book, you will be rewarded.
I highly recommend "All the Light We Cannot See."  The author used beautiful language and imagery in order to create a wonderful, gripping story.  The book's use of plot reminded me of Dickens, the way he carefully moves the story line in such a way that the reader remains in the dark.<br/><br/>Little things make this book wonderful.  References to the music of Debussey's Clair de Lune ("moonlight") were swimming in my head as I read the several passages.  As a set up to a scene with Frederick, a secondary character, the author<br/>describes an empty street in Nazi Germany by mentioning that a woman was retching.  The effect was to create a feeling of unease in the use of just a few words.  Brilliant.<br/><br/>Doerr's use of the locksmith who helps to permit a sightless girl to see the world, was fun to observe.  Marie,  in many ways, sees more clearly than a boy who, though, blessed with sight and keen intelligence, learns only to "see" reality when it is too late, and so must pay the ultimate price for his blindness.<br/><br/>Puzzles were a fun theme, as both of the main characters had to grapple with personal and physical limitations to solve them.  I also enjoyed how the protagonists finally meet and the unexpected conclusion.<br/><br/>This book won the 2015 Pulitzer for fiction against some outstanding competition.  The honor was well deserved.  A most enjoyable read.
I really wanted to like this book, I had heard so many great things about it! But it was just so hard for me to get through! I usually finish 2-3 books a week MINIMUM, this book took me over a week to read!<br/><br/>It's slow. So much of it just served no purpose. I didn't love any of the characters. I felt there was a lack of emotion from Marie-Laure. Every time I read her chapters I just imagined such a monotone little girl. The character Von Rumple (I believe that's his name - ridiculous name too!) just irritated me. Why was he so obsessed with the stone that he went into a town that was being BOMBED to try to find it, by himself too? Why did the author have to include all the groin pain? I just found some of the details for him, and his hunt for the diamond, were a little ridiculous sometimes.<br/><br/>I disliked that it jumped back and forth between the years. Sometimes it was hard to keep up because it also had very short chapters jumping between the different characters' lives. And I felt it didn't help build any sort of story.<br/><br/>By the end, I didn't find any closure. In fact, I felt that I just spent a week reading something with no ending. It was so dull. I don't want to give anything away but I just didn't feel any emotion for what happened. I just counted the pages I had left and ran through the thing. I'm happy I finally finished it, but wish I hadn't spent over a week trying to!
sorry! As I have read several other books since that one, I can't recall enough detail to give an adequate review of the book. Unless my memory is refreshed, I'll just have to say I liked it very much.
Interesting story written from two perspectives:  A young French girl who loses her sight at an early age, her wonderful relationship with her father, and later with her great uncle.  Her father is the gem specialist at an important museum.  The German's are about to invade their small town on the north coast of France and he is trusted to be responsible for a 133 Karat diamond so that the German's can't get it.  Her father disappears and her "crazy great uncle" tries to fill his shoes.<br/><br/>The second point of view is that of a young German boy who has a natural penchant for math and electrical engineering.  He is chosen to attend a special school where he will learn to be a leader.  He's chosen not only for his talents but also for is Aryan appearance.  He discovers a method of triangulation that enables the Nazis to locate enemy communication centers that are responsible for blowing up German assets, and he joins a crew that tracks down the locations using his triangularization method which enables his crewmates to destroy them.  As the boy becomes a young man he starts to develop values from observations and from association with friends.  Their crew travels all over the Reich and eventually comes to the village in Brittany where the girl lives.  They make strong impressions upon each other but only get to share a short time together.<br/><br/>Well written.  A real page turner.
"Your problem, Werner" says Frederick "is that you still believe you own your life."<br/><br/>I finished reading this book yesterday and I still cannot figure out how I felt about it. The imagery and beautiful wording in this book makes it a truly memorable one but there were also many things that would stop me from recommending it to a friend.<br/><br/>I rate a book by how invested I am while reading it.... Whether I think about the characters when I'm not reading, whether I make my husband listen while I read my favorite lines out loud to him, and if I'm sad when the book ends that there isn't more to read.<br/><br/>There were times throughout the first 3/4 of the book that I wondered if I could finish it (and I don't think I would if I weren't reading it for a book club) but I'm glad I did. The last quarter was fabulous and I couldn't put it down...I just wish the first parts of the book were as fluid and compelling as the last.<br/><br/>I have read many other books recently (such as The Invention of Wings) that I believe were more successful at combining different characters' lives and different time periods without losing the reader.<br/><br/>Overall I'm glad I read it because it was such beautiful writing and it was a truly genius plot but due to the unnecessary length and many points that I did not feel drawn to pick it back up again- I would only give it 3 stars.
I have wanted to read this book since it first came out and it did not disappoint.  This is the story of two young people during the occupation of France in World War II.  It details the life of Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind girl who lives in Paris with her father.  He is the key master of the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle.  Werner Pfennig is an orphan in Zollverein, Germany.  He and his sister are raised at Children’s House, a poor orphanage outside of a coal-mining complex.  He is brilliant in repairing radios and the Reich realizes his genius and he is thrown into the war at sixteen.  Germany invades France and their lives are on a collision course.<br/><br/>Mr. Doerr is a masterful story teller.  While filling the story with historical data, he weaves an intricate, detailed saga of the occupation and how people, whether conqueror or conquered are changed forever.  My favorite segment in the book is the attic scene near the end.  The author holds you captive as he keeps you on the end of your seat, wondering if Marie will survive.  My only criticism of the story is that it switches from present to past and back again with breakneck speed and this can be very confusing.<br/><br/>If you love a first-rate, suspenseful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, add this book to your reading list.  Be sure you are ready for the challenge; this is definitely not a “light” read!
This is a beautifully written, remarkable story.  It is set in France and Germany during World War 2.  It alternates between an account of a blind French girl who lives in Paris with her father, who works as a locksmith in a national museum & is a very talented constructor of intricate objects. Her father builds an exact replica of the neighborhood in which they live in order to teach his young daughter how to get around.  He also teaches her braille.<br/>The story shifts to an account of an orphaned German boy and his sister.  They live in an orphanage with a number of other children and are cared for by a very kind woman.  The boy is an electrical genius, who teaches himself how to diagnose and repair broken radios. He starts out by building his own receiver, which he and his younger sister use to listen to broadcasts banned by the Nazi regime. Ultimately he is recruited into the German army and has to make choices between his own survival and what he knows to be ethically wrong.<br/>The French girl & the German boy grow up in parallel universes. Courage, kindness, deceit & terrible cruelty abound in both.  This is overlaid with the story of a jewel with a "curse" on it.  There are no trite endings.  The author uses repetition very effectively - the tap, tapping of the girl's cane as she walks, certain phrases repeated over & over again.  All in all it's a masterful piece of work
I'm a fan of historical fiction, but it's unusual for me to find a book so riveting I can't put it down. And just when I thought I couldn't possibly be interested in reading another novel about WWII.
War has many kinds of casualties, both military and civilian.  Some people are killed.  Some people disappear never to be seen again,  Many people are injured, both physically and mentally.  The story starts in St. Malo, France in 1944, just before the bombing that destroyed most of the city.  The story is told mainly by flashbacks that establish the various characters who eventually are brought together by the war.  Add in a jewel that has a curse.  The story is fragmented as it moves from character to character and they have different experiences because of the war.  Not everyone will survive.  It would be difficult to make it into a motion picture.<br/><br/>You won't be sure who to root for in this novel because many people are victims, often by circumstances of their birth.  They cannot always be what they want to be.  You have a blind French girl who has been brought to her great uncle's home in St. Malo as a refugee from Paris.  You have a young German boy with unusual talents who was pressed into special services that will haunt him.  There is the great uncle who has PTSD from World War I.  You will always find a collaborator with the enemy, and neighbors organizing a resistance group.  Then there are the people left behind when someone goes off to war.<br/><br/>Stick with the story as it moves about.  It will all come together.  There is an afterward closer to the present.
I love when a book consumes you....when there is no possible way that you can pay attention to the rest of the world while you are reading. This book is responsible for a dinner trip to Wendy's because I was too caught up (my kids say 'Thanks!)!<br/>It put you on both sides of the war, each from a child coming of age in the terrible time of Nazi Germany and its take-over of France, among other countries. I never before thought about the young boys, the ones who became nazis when they were children, caught up in a crazy man's sick idea and forced to believe a terrible idea or die. Werner and his sister Jutta are doomed from the start. And the terror that Marie-Laure experiences, even more so because she is blind, but how she can see beyond what other's can because of that. Frederick broke my heart.<br/>The bravery that all the characters posses, even the disgusting Von Rumple, how each one is desperate for something and they will do whatever it takes to get what they need and to try to get through this dark and terrifying time that is hard to believe was not that long ago.<br/>I started to get so nervous at a couple points....I could picture everything so clearly in my mind. The writing is so descriptive in the way that makes you engulfed in the lives and surroundings of the characters and I know I will miss them now that I have finished. ....I may have to go back and read it again.
I couldn't put this one down.  I stayed up all night reading just to find out what happens to the characters.  Doerr has an amazing gift for writing and building suspense.  It's an incredible story.
Doerr wove an engaging story about Germany occupation of France in World War II. He used a French blind girl named Marie-Laure LeBlanc and a fair hair German orphan boy named Werner Pfennig. Doerr bounces back and forth between the past and present to tell his story. I especially like this because I like to read the first of a book then the last, and then if I’m intrigued I read the middle. The story weaves these four elements together, Marie-Laure in the past and present, Werner in the past and present. We see them in the bombing of Saint-Malo when they are teens, then we see how they grew to be in this place together but on different sides of the war. Halfway through the story we begin to see Von Rumpel’s story weave into to the story. He is German intelligence looking for the Jewel Marie-Laure’s father smuggles out of Paris. The Sea of Flames is famed to be cursed. The person holding it will live forever at the cost of all they hold dear. Marie-Laure and Werner both lose loved ones and see death all around them.<br/>Doerr does a good job showing both sides of the World War II. We see the Germans in Hitler’s Youth trying to follow the Fuhrer and the ones seeing the bad and trying to fight him. We see the French Underground trying to sabotage the occupation. We saw the French who were too scared to try. Doerr showed them as people doing their best to live in an unstable world.
I'm glad I finished All the Light We Cannot See. I nearly gave up about halfway through its 500+ pages, when the words seem to just pile up with background information, lyrical description and literal description, metaphors, information about minor characters. There are things I would have cut. But he's an artist, and he wanted to include all that in this masterpiece - yes, masterpiece - so who am I to say, remove this, remove that, from your art. What a writer!! I was so transported to that world that it was kind of a shock when I finished the book this morning, and read the back flap, and realized...guy's from Boise, Idaho. Not France or Germany.<br/><br/>My most favorite themes in this book: this ground we're walking on, these walls we're touching, who lived here? Who died here? What happened? And the shifting borders of temporary countries, and how after the war and before the war, we would have been friends, maybe, or family. And how brief life is! And how when I was a dopey high school senior in 1974 -- I was surrounded by people who had lived through World War II and never paid attention to that. People whose brothers died or who hid in basements drinking paint water and wearing dead people's shoes. And how war damages last forever, even if you live through it.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend. My friends were so right who said, hang in there and finish it. It's worth it.
This is one of the best written books I have read this year with many observations about the human condition, vulnerability, grace under pressure, and the ethics of being a human. Exceptional read.
I was so looking forward to reading this book based on the summary and the outstanding five star reviews it got, but I just could not see how so many readers felt this was a great novel!  Although parts of the story are beautifully written, it just drags, and confusingly moves so slowly with its short chapters that keep jumping back and forth between characters and moments in time.  Every time I started a new chapter I had hopes that I would get a chance to absorb more about each character, but then it would abruptly be cut short and I would have to readjust my thinking for another character or situation.  After a while it became so irritating and exhausting having to read this novel in this fashion.  I even had to look back several chapters a few times just to understand where I was in the story.  The main characters of Werner and Marie-Laure never have their worlds come together until the very end of the book which was a such big disappointment.  It was like reading two separate stories that dragged along with so much unnecessary clutter.  I really wanted to just stop reading, but I had hopes it would all come together in the final short, choppy chapters.  Unfortunately, everything just falls so flat and the emotional moments I had my heart set on just left me thinking...that's it???!!  This is what I plowed<br/> through over 500 pages for was THIS??!!!
Poignant, beautifully rendered, historical fiction.  Characters are well developed and writing is gorgeous.  Superb visual and interior details.  Heart renching read.  Ending is a little abrupt.
Immediately involving, intriguing, fascinating and intensely aware of the humanity of its characters, the significance of its purpose. A masterwork for Anthony Doerr; a treasure for his readers.
This book was so beautiful that it made me cry. I read this one directly after reading The Nightingale, another book about German occupation in Europe in WWII. I admit that I did not know a lot about this part of the war so it was a very interesting learning experience for me. It has been awhile since I have read a book that makes such good use of traditional author's craft. There are multiple parallel story lines and beautiful prose and imagery, and an excellent pace to the plot. On top of that I can imagine how many hours of research went into getting the historical details exactly right. Don't take that to mean that it is boring though, because it is very exciting. It starts slow and then builds up to a pace towards the end where you will have trouble putting it down.<br/><br/>The two main characters in the book are a young blind girl in France, and a young orphaned German boy living in an orphanage. Although they live separately until almost the end of the book, their lives are intertwined by a cursed blue diamond and radio waves. Their life stories unfold with rich detail, tragedy and suspense. I am very confident that someone somewhere is preparing a movie script for this wonderful book, as it has such strong imagery, but I hope that it never happens because film could not match how it appears in your own imagination. Just a wonderful book.
In my world, a 3 is a good book. I loved the two main characters. I had a hard time tracking the story back and forth between time period la though. I'm not sure all the switches worked for me.
The plot was outstanding but I found the book cumbersome.<br/>Years flip back and forth as do characters and places.<br/>The plot is interesting but quite unrealistic. Best for beach reading.
Of the 43 books that I read this year, this book made it into the top 3. The details were fascinating, but didn't slow the pace. I'm thrilled that I read this book, and recommend it to anybody.
Undoughtably an excellent read. Wonderful character development & a wonderful perspective from the point of view of 2 young children on opposite sides of World War II.<br/>Highly recommended!
This book is like a maze which is both fascinating and a puzzle at the same time. It is not until you near the end that you are lifted above it all and it's elegance and beauty becomes clear.
I had been looking for a really good book for a long time and this turned out to be it. It's one of those books you can't put down but you never want the end to come. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
A very somber read.  Well written, graphic, suspenseful.  It's an intricate story of the lives of two children during World War II set against the wartime tragedies and atrocities of Hitler.
Themes of light and darkness overlay each chapter of this novel without destroying the beauty of strong characters.  The depth of symbolism is not lost to the reader in Doerr's depiction of one character who is truly blind and others who simply do not see; however, all stretch toward their own source of light.<br/>  The sub-plot, World War II, is well known and well drawn.  What violence is shown uses lights of falling bombs and flashing shells with the darkness of bomb shelters and tunnels to reinforce to isolation of needy characters.  Marie-Laurie is the light who operates in darkness, searching for her father, understanding and peace.  She lets the reader suffer with her as she comes to know fear.  Doerr places her in events where the rest of the world can see, but their metaphorical blindness is as great as her literal disability.  Her foil Werner, a young German conscript, sees the horror of war just as he has seen the tragedy of his early life.  He tells his story with pain of lost family and friends.  His light comes from listening to broadcasts of unknown origin, a brightness made real when he meets Marie-Laurie.  Subordinate characters are worth knowing, even those who represent evil.<br/>  You will enjoy the strength of Doerr's writing, a careful blending of plot and characterization.  Don't wait.  Order now!
I am in the middle of this book now, but wanted to review. The writing is amazing and makes you want to linger on every page. The story is moving along at a perfect pace. Excellent reading!
Great story.  Vivid portrayal of WWII with a love story and a touch of the supernatural.  Best novel I have read in years.  After reading a book that good I am judgemental of my own review.
Wonderful book!!  I have given it to several family members because I think they will be totally involved  with the story and history this book presents. One of the best I have ever read!!
I couldn't stop reading this book...the chapters compelled you to read on.  I really enjoyed the contrasting characters that the author creates in the story, and how their paths are fated.
Wonderful!  To see WWII from both sides is cause to make one think.  The plot is tightly woven and engaging.  I am not surprised that it has been regarded as one of the best books of 2014.
This was a wonderful book with WWII as a background.  The characters were well developed, and the reader grew to care about them.  In the end, the human spirit triumphed over loss and war.
I can't say enough about this book, though there are a few things I know as a fact were not researched enough, as e.g. a German child who would be illiterate even when going to a government run orphanage, totally unheard of.  My grandmother worked in a hospital before the Great War in an orphanage and the hospital in a place near Cologne and near the area where part of the novel takes place, and was astounded that all the children, even then, were literate.  (She was brought up in Utah.) There were other little bits that were exaggerated when the author described scenes in Germany, others were right on, and it stands to reason when dealing with the arch enemy, the Nazi Germans at the time, you have to  bring in these little tidbits to remind the reader of what did go on in certain places.  But still there is for me a false note in these pages, it does not ring true in those places, they seem forced, while the scenes in France speak of the most tender feelings, the deep love of father to daughter and each page is tear provoking, never in a maudlin way.  I have the book in Kindl and loved it, and wanted it in hardback to read and mark certain scenes....pages that are magical and they outweigh my piddly complaints  a thousand fold.  I gave the book 5 stars, I could give it a sky full of them if I could reach them.
All through the reading, I was waiting for the two main characters to meet.  I knew they would, and they did.  The ending was not what I had expected.  However, the journey was wonderous.
Absolutely loved it.  It is written so well, I could relate/understand the characters even though they are on opposite sides. I didn't want to stop reading but sleep eventually does come.
What a well written and riveting book. I have recommended this book to all my friends. It does not matter if you remember the Second World War or not since it deals with war and survival.
I thought the book was highly over rated.  Characters were interesting, but I did not like the way the author switched back and forth with character, time etc.  I struggled to finish it.
A different view of what living through WWII would have been like.  I didn't love the ending.  I know reality is that there is no good ending in a war, but wanted it to end differently.
Amazing book.  Beautifully written.  Great story.  Fully-fleshed out characters that feel real, get under your skin.  Stays with you long after you finish it.<br/><br/>I loved how the story was told and found it compelling and effective:  The book begins at the story's climax, the bombing of an ocean city near the end of WW2.  Subsequent parts alternate between past years and the climax, with the past-year parts in chronological order leading up to the climax.  Following is a 50-page denouement that gives us a bit of info about the surviving characters at a couple different points over the next 70 years.<br/><br/>I loved how the story paints very full pictures of what life was like in Europe, especially occupied France, during the war, how it makes the horrors of war very real and very human.  It puts things into perspective, e.g. making me realize how insignificant most things I worry about in my daily life really are.<br/><br/>I'm a slow reader, and I also don't have a photographic memory.  If you're anything like me, I suggest starting the book when you have a couple hours to devote to it, so you can get some momentum going before you have to set it down.  And try to finish it within a week.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, best book I've read in years.  I'll definitely read it again.
This is a nice little story full of history and a pair of teens whose lives intersect briefly but you hope for that intersection from their difficult beginnings.  The girl, blind perhaps an infant, is lovingly and inventively cared for by her father who builds scale wooden models of most of their part of Paris so that she can learn how to get around in spite of her blindness.  They are forced to flee Paris as the Nazis take the city in 1941 and they find refuge in a town by the Atlantic in Brittany where the father's uncle, a WWI survivor with PTSD, has a home from which the uncle and his brother prior to WWI broadcast amateur radio programs for kids.  The men had assembled a powerful but rogue radio transmitter in the attic of their home and both the blind girl and a German boy, the other half of the star-crossed pair, used to listen in on scrounged radios when they were younger.  The radio's signal, now used by the PTSD uncle and the blind girl to transmit messages for the French Resistance, causes the German boy, now a soldier detailed to find Resistance radio transmitters, to find each other as the Nazis are finally giving up France.  Their struggles to survive and grow through their teens in terrible conditions on both sides of the front are compelling and uplifting.  A very good read.
The descriptive imagery allowed me to see as if Marie Laurie. The reading was eerily exciting with a large degree of sadness for the main characters and anger at the political climate.
Fantastic. Our new book club read. Short chapters make this long book seem to speed by. Both protagonists are sympathetic and the author presents an oft chosen genre is a fresh light.
I didn't expect to like this book. Yet another WW2 story, I thought, but I have a commitment to respect the choices and read the books the other members of my book group select.<br/>I started out listening to it on Audible and realized listening would not do it justice. The story had too much depth. I needed to read the words and feel their impact on my psyche.<br/>Amazing amazing depth from the narrator through all the senses of his characters, who are each unique and exquisitely portrayed.  No cliches. No neatly tied up endings for anyone. All real and touching and powerful.<br/>Crazy non-sequencial chronology used to present a crazy mixed up time in history in a way that showed me how it must feel have one's life upended and redirected by the ravages of war, and helped me feel deeply about the characters, as the author  wove a fascinating and realisitic story of several lives into a beautiful tapestry that touched inner chords of my being.  Doerr is a master story teller who was able to put this reader into the shoes of his characters, and experience what they saw, felt, heard, thought, feared, loved as my own.<br/>There is a philosophical line that runs through the story but its subtle, sometimes cynical. depressing, distrubing, yet ultimately hopeful as regards humanity.
There's much to savor in Anthony Doerr's novel set in France during the Nazi invasion and subsequent occupation.  The two protagonists, young blind teen Marie-Laure who lives with her doting father in Paris and orphan teen boy Werner, growing up in a group home with his younger sister in Germany have their lives gradually converge (albeit briefly).  The book is the journey it takes for these two to grow up in very different settings.  When the invasion begins Marie-Laure and her father flee to the coastal town of Saint Malo to live with an eccentric uncle in his large home.  Werner is selected for his academic abilities for an elite Nazi academy run by a sadistic commandant.  There's also a back story about a famous diamond kept at the museum where Marie-Laure's father works that serves as the "maguffin" in this piece.  Doerr's prose in beautiful and as meticulously constructed as the intricate wooden models Marie-Laure's father crafts for her.  All is not perfect; Doerr likes hopping around chronologically and back and forth between the two main characters and at times this device becomes fatiguing. The book is a bit on the long side and the ending is far from satisfying.  Overall if you're a fan of literature and historical fiction you may enjoy this wartime tale.
Nearly a perfect novel.  I love historic fiction and this is one of the best I have ever read.  Told primarily in first person by two children, a blind French girl and a orphaned German electronic/math prodigy, caught up in WWII. It spans the pre-war build up, through the war and then a brief synopsis up to the present. Most novels I have read about this period fall into the trap of making one side all good and the other all bad.  I think this one gets it right.  It presents some of the reasons behind Germany's embracing of the Nazi message and even those who do horrible things are portrayed with some sympathy.  War, after all, is horrific for both sides and many are simply caught up in it by their circumstances. This novel succeeds in making the characters, including those other than the main protagonists, real and sympathetic without being maudlin.  I can't help compare it to The Book Thief and Sarah's Key, both of which I felt manipulated the characters to evoke feelings that did not feel true, to me. (I am willing to admit that mine is a minority view on those books.) I savored this book to the point of putting off finishing it because I did not want it to end.  It is not all "happy endings" which is as it should be as it mirrors life.  Highly recommended.
One of my all time favorite books. What I enjoyed the most was the complexity of the characters and the sub-plots. I'll have to read it again soon so that I can appreciate it again.
It was a good read. But flipping back and forth made me feel a bit distracted. I respect all favorable comments but in my view  this is one of the most overrated books of the year.
This is a magnificent novel, written almost poetically. The language is so beautiful, with each word crafted with great thought. I read it in just a few days and hated for it for end. When I did finish ALL THE LIGHT, I was left in tears.<br/>Doerr's writing is so exquisite and full of metaphors and similes. I read lots of reviews on websites and on Amazon. Some criticized the facts but most wrote just about the story.<br/>I think the writing is what sets this book apart. Consider this line, on page 218: "The sky drops silver threads of sleet. Gray houses run in converging lines to the horizon, bunched as if to find off cold." Or this one,  on page 290: "The sounds of passing cars are like the tines of forks dragged along his nerves."<br/>The symbolism is profound in this novel. Consider this line, repeated several times throughout: "Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever."  Also, what is the meaning of Frederick's obsession with birds and the broader themes of the novel?<br/>This book is the best novel of WWII that I have ever read. I believe there is much to be discussed and much to be learned from reading Doerr's novel. I also believe every middle/high/college school student should read this book.
I chose "Alternating Persons" for the narration because there is no space for omniscient narrator, I guess "alternating" covers it.  The style is a wonderfully lucid and flowing one.  The alternating places of action help to make the final fifty pages come together very neatly, although as the novel progressed I began to figure out pretty much how the end would be, and I was not disappointed.  This is a wonderful novel about love, discovery, filial love, awakenings, suspense, an epiphany, and all with an intriguing WW II background.  There war is always present even when the reader is removed from it, and we alternate between peaceful and homey scenes and those with more violence back in Germany.  I think the last fifty pages are some of the more beautiful examples of prose in literature.  This is a novel which stays with you, and whatever technical errors one may find, they make little difference.  There is a wonderful coming together of two individuals, almost as if they were fated, and how that happens has to be left to new readers.  No spoilers here.  Our English Department thought highly enough of the novel to make it summer reading for "rising juniors."  It is my hope to meet Tony Doerr at some point; we attended rival colleges.
This is one of the very best books I have ever read. Beautiful writing, clear and cogent. I was born with bilateral cataracts, as Marie-Laure was, but at age 6, unlike Marie-Laure,  I was given my eyesight in surgery in 1951 as one of the first pediatric patients for cataract removal. Like her, I was teased by other children for my thick glasses. Like her, I had loving adults in my life to lead me to many discoveries and a lifelong love of nature. Like her, I was able to earn a doctoral degree, despite the early prediction that I would go nowhere in school. The author spent 10 years working on this book, polishing and faceting it like the Sea of Flames.  The short concise chapters were like glimpses, yet full of details about the people, setting, and the world of nature turning despite the horrors of war. Throughout the book I was reminded that the full spectrum includes both sound and light, "it's just numbers," but so much more as the inner workings of the soul are also brought into focus. An entirely new view of WWII, very different from many books I have read on that war, and different from the experience of my father who flew Dauntless dive bombers off carriers in the Pacific. This will be a book to which I will return often. Two words. Read it!
Beautifully written, deeply touching, and strongly reminds me of this quote from Albert Camus "in the midst of winter I found there was, within me, an invincible summer;"
I so thoroughly enjoyed reading this book I was amazed how the author got into both the male and female characters and the relationships that were so carefully woven between them
Usually I tend to devour books I find.  Not the case with this one; it was like I had to read it slower to fully absorb and appreciate the full story.  I loved how it spanned really their whole lives and you really see Marie-Laure come into her own and take charge, which is impressive for any 15 year old girl-let alone a blind one!!!!  And I loved seeing Werner go through the Hitler's Youth Academy just to end up having doubts and wanting to go home because he feels like none of this right.  And the ending, oh man.  I'm usually in bed by 10:30 and I finally looked at the clock one night and it was midnight and I made myself close the book!!!  When both Marie-Laure and Werner are in Saint Malo and she realizes that they're a soldier in the house and that he will probably kill her, oh my god my heart was pounding!!!  And then it was essentially her voice by reading her book over the radio that saved Werner and his friend who had all but resigned themselves to dying in the bombed basement.  Oh I loved it.  Just loved it.  I wished for a slightly different ending, but I think it was fitting and a natural way for things to go.  The best part is that what Marie-Laure's father was hiding, was never discovered because of her quick thinking in the end.
From page 1 to page 482 ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is brilliant and represents everything I love about reading. <br/><br/> From page 482 to 531 ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE made me want to punch Anthony Doerr.  Or at least have him over for dinner so he can explain to me why his ending is better than the one I was planning on.<br/><br/>Seriously, if everyone would just do things my way . . .<br/><br/> It’s a mind-blowingly well written coming-of-age story.  It has a fantastically engaging, detailed, complex plot.  It’s fascinatingly detailed historical fiction that brings to life the human aspects of World War II better than anything else I’ve read.  It has layers upon layers of meaning that I’m way to dense to truly grasp.  It has characters that you feel and cheer for.  And it has an entirely unsatisfying ending.<br/><br/>Basically, I loved it and I hated it.<br/><br/>“But it’s a war book,” you say.  “What did you expect,” you say.<br/><br/>“To not want to kick the dog when I’m finished,” I say.<br/><br/>The Book Thief has the right idea.<br/><br/>So where does that leave me for a recommendation?  I think you should read it. <br/><br/>Just make sure Anthony Doerr and your dog aren’t anywhere near you when you finish.
I found this book interesting but very disjointed and contrived.  While the author enables us to see the cruelty and sadism of the Nazis, he manages to engender sympathy for two members of the Hitler youth who were basically "drafted" into service.  In addition, he describes the terrible treatment of several German young women at the hands of  Russian soldiers at the end of WWII.  Doerr gives examples of American planes accidentally killing some of the French.  By highlighting exceptions, he appears to be making some statement about the equality of human suffering.  Other works of contemporary fiction, including, The Summer of My German Soldier, attempt to understand and even romanticize the German position during WWII.  I think attempts to blur the line between victims and victimizers is a mistake.  I dislike the author's use of the word "Jewess" in several parts of the book.  While the term may be technically acceptable, it is  a dated term and  probably should  not be used because it tends to objectify and separate out Jewish women from mainstream humanity.  All suffering is not equal; attempting to level experience by rationalization and romaticization is an odious error.
All the praise this novel and its author have received are well merited.  Doerr is a masterful writer.  The flaws in this otherwise jewel-like novel are, to this reader, these: that its conclusion seems a bit rushed and a bit too pat; and that its characters, though well-developed in many respects, don't feel quite fully developed.  Perhaps that's a consequence of the book being constructed of brief chapters that alternate almost entirely between the stories of its two principal protagonists.  A novel of a related sort that came to mind as I read this one was Anthony Marra's A Constellation of Vital Phenomena.  Both books are novels of war.  Both are brilliant acts of imagination and superbly crafted.  But Marra's digs deeper into the pain and pathos of its subject matter and lays its characters bare in ways this one did not quite manage to.<br/><br/>I don't hesitate to give the novel in review my strongest recommendation (I could just as well have awarded it 5 stars).  But writing this review, as I am, with a strong comparison in mind, I feel compelled to award a weighted measure.  All the Light We Cannot See is a very fine novel.  A Constellation of Vital Phenomena is a work of art.  I strongly recommend you read them both.
This book - I purchased the audiobook from Audible - is the most moving, wonderful literature I've read in many years.  It is not a romance, it is not a drama, it is not an action story.  It is a building-up of sensations, emotions and ideas that we experience as the two protagonists, Marie-Laure and Werner, learn to navigate (sometimes literally) the increasingly confusing, inexplicable and horrifying worlds they live in during WWII.  Written in chapters that alternate between their two widely disparate lives - sometimes extremely short chapters - we begin to live the lives of these children, sometimes horrifying, sometimes loving, sometimes desperate.  There are villains but they are not always who we expect them to be.  There are good people, also not always who we expect them to be.  And, as in real life, endings are not necessarily tidy or what we plan, expect, and/or hope for.<br/><br/>The writing is nothing short of lyrical - the joys of holding a shell with its living animal still inside; the shock of radio voices opening a window into another world; the connections we make with nature and each other.  The narrator, Zach Appelman, is equally extraordinary.  He made it a joy to listen to the book - and re-listen to it.
This book is incredibly well written and I couldn't put it down. I stayed up very late many nights reading it. Totally worth the time. It's tragic but beautiful. A great read.
The story is nice but did not like the author style . Too many unimportant pages to read that is really boring . The book could be much shorter and possibly more interesting .
This novel is a stirring account of the lives of two young people during World War II, one a blind girl who flees Paris with her father to seek refuge in the home of her great uncle in the French coastal city of Saint-Malo and the other a gifted German orphan who trained in an elite Hitler youth program. Both are ensnared in the horror of war as events unfold for Marie-Laure experiencing the deprivation and fear of German occupied France and Werner who is forced to undergo rigorous and cruel exercises that are designed to turn him into a cold callous Nazi machine. As Warner's unit is called from the Russian front to western France in an attempt to expose members of the French resistance around the time of the D-Day invasion and subsequent bombing continuing along the coast, Marie-Laure is in grave danger because of a valuable gem her father was entrusted to protect for the museum in which he was employed as the principal locksmith. Even though the suspense rises as their paths intertwine towards the end of the novel, I prolonged finishing it because it was such a beautifully told story that I did not want to finish it and have to turn the last page. This is one of those treasured novels that will stay with me for a long time.
I am not usually a fan of World War II novels.  This one sucked me in though.  The story mainly focuses on two children during the occupation of France in alternating chapters.  Marie Laure LeBlanc lived in Paris with her father who worked with locks in a national museum.  She went blind at age 6 and her father built wooden models of their neighborhood so she could feel them and learn her way around.<br/><br/>Werner Pfennig was a German orphan who had a talent for working with electronics and was placed in a training school and then made to work as a soldier even though he was only in his mid-teens.<br/><br/>In the beginning I was a bit disconcerted by the chapters going back and forth in time.  I saw no reason for the chapters not to move forward linearly.  Finally, I bookmarked any chapter that showed the date so I could keep the timeline straight in my mind.  The novel did seem to move forward in a linear manner in the later in the book.<br/><br/>The writing is beautiful and the main characters are well developed.  The book kept me engaged.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the book alternating between Werner and Marie, but the time shifting back and forth did.  It is for this reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.
I finished this book a week ago and the characters still live in my mind. I was given this book to read from a wonderful marketing agent as Simon and Schuster. We meet Marie-Laure and her father who live in Paris. Her father is a keeper of locks at the  Museum of Natural History. Marie has been blind since she was six. Her father builds a model of their neighborhood so she can find her home around it. Then tragically Paris is invaded by Germany. They take a few belongs including something from the museum and flee to the countryside. Ending up at her Uncle's in Saint Malo. We also meet a young German boy (Werner) and is sister who are orphaned. Werner is selected to attend a special school to train boys to be proper Germans. He has a special gift with radios. He ends up in the war also in Saint Malo. What follows are their lives surrounding by a country in the midst of an awful war. Just trying to survive everyday. Since Marie is blind we see and feels things we would not usually see and feel. The author brings to live a world that we sighted people take for granted. I could hear the bombs and feel the wind. Wars do not have happy endings but you must read this book to find out what happens to Marie and Werner. A must read.
This is the novel that everyone is  talking about – Winner of the Pulitzer prize, New York Times Bestseller – and I can see why. It is about the second world war, but told through the perspective of two teenagers: a German orphan boy, and a blind girl. Because we follow the perspective of a blind girl, the war is brought to life through smells, sounds, touch, taste – it’s one of the most vivid books I’ve read in a long time.<br/><br/>The reason it’s a ‘must-read’ is his mastery of language, every other sentence you come across a morsel that you want to savour, and yet it’s written with the pace and plot of a good thriller. The other thing that makes it stand out against the usual war books is that it doesn’t feel sensationalised, despite the subject matter: the real action happens around the two characters, their relationships, and whether or not a priceless diamond will be stolen by the Germans, and it intertwines a love of physics and biology in the midst of a war story.<br/><br/>Like Shadow of the Wind, it felt ‘sweet’ in tone, rather than bitter, and I was gripped. For the last few weeks it’s felt as though I’ve been living in a six-storey house in St Malo as the bombs have come down around me. Highly recommended.
All The Light We Cannot See is a tribute to the enduring ,yet savage beauty of the people and things that make earth  what it is.  Marie-Laurre and her father are blessed with the understanding of the importance of love, in the flowers and the trees and the very soil that makes our world what it is.  The book was a blessing of profound peace for me and was one of my first experiences of understanding that a happy ending can be achieved without happy things happening to the characters I had come to love and to know.  Please read this book.  It will restore your belief in  the intrinsic order of  the universe and what that truly means.  Love is all around us and heroism is sometimes making it through the day without hurting another person. I 'll  re-read it right away.  Thank you for this  beautiful work of fact and fiction.  I have read thousands of books and this one is a favorite.  The message of love is clear and resounding and inspiring.  This world has taken on a new meaning for me.  I am profoundly touched.  This book is one of the rare stories that makes the experience of  World War Two  not a complete tragedy.  Important things,happened that reverberated throughout time to unimportant people who became invaluable.
The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.<br/><br/>The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.<br/><br/>My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax. Personally, I found that climax to be a bit anti-climactic. But overall, that detracted very little from my enjoyment of the novel and would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, WWII, or well-written literature.
A riveting story that twists and turns and transfixes the heart and mind of the reader. Morals, honesty and the tragedy that is the human condition during WWII are laid bare
After flying through a bunch of young adult fiction books, which tend to be plot-driven and move very quickly, it took me a little while to really get going with this book. The writing was beautiful from the start, the descriptions mimicking well the heightened awareness one probably experiences as a person without sight, like one of the protagonists, but I found myself a little impatient, wanting to skip through that and find out what happened next. I'm glad I persevered, though, because he writes beautifully. I learned not to hurry the story, but to allow myself to become absorbed into the world he was painting for me, to slow down and let myself be transported to this other world. Even after turning the last page, I continue to walk the streets of Saint-Malo and Paris in my mind, not quite ready for the book to end, and yet knowing it must. The subject of war is never easy to write about, but this was masterfully done. Without in any way trivializing the horrors of war, Doerr manages to leave us with a sense of the beauty of life and the reminder that there are greater things within the human spirit that triumph over even the greatest tragedies and atrocities. Stick with the book and you won't be disappointed.
The beauty, the sincerity, the heart and importance of this novel have been amply laid out by other reviewers. I wish to turn everyone's attention, instead, to the marvelously high quality of the Kindle edition. Far too many publishers, from amateurs to supposedly serious houses, turn out Kindle editions ranging from merely sloppy to practically unreadable, thus insulting authors, their works, and their readers. Simon and Schuster Digital Editions deserves the highest award available for the care with they so clearly prepared this edition. In this equivalent of 545 printed pages, I found not a single misspelling, no typographical error, punctuation all present and correct. Much of the credit for this, I know from experience, belongs to the author and to the editor of the print edition, but the labor of those dutiful souls too often becomes mangled in digital editions to near destruction. If an award for quality and care of a digital text does not yet exist, it certainly ought to, and the first such presentation should belong among the many other, well-deserved accolades worthily attributed to this phenomenal example of literature.<br/><br/>Thank you, Simon and Schuster, from the entirety of this reader's heart.
I could not put it down between the history and personal themes.  The moved quickly and me up to (and beyond) the last page.  My only disappointment was that it had to end!
I enjoyed reading it, until toward the ending; then everything seemed to be quickly wrapped up. It was a "good read", but fell short of a great piece of literature.
Did I enjoy this book: All the Light We Cannot See grabbed me and kept me reading. Doerr alternates the narratives of Marie-Laure and Werner, children in Europe during World War II. I had to stay with him and see how the stories converged.<br/><br/>This is one of those books that plays with the concept of blindness—Marie-Laure goes blind at a young age, but the memory of colors infuses her thoughts. There are other characters, though, with blind spots much bigger—and more dangerous—than Marie-Laure’s.<br/><br/>Werner has genius in his eyes and fingers. (“What you might have been!” Volkheimer says to Werner over and over again.) The question we wait to have answered is this: Does he have compassion?<br/><br/>And—are curses real? Can a piece of cold mineral—even a piece that has astronomical value—control and damn the lives it touches?<br/><br/>Would I recommend it: If you like a story that is carefully plotted, that marches toward a conclusion, that delivers a twist or two, you’ll enjoy All the Light We Cannot See. On the way, we care about Doerr’s characters, and we have to reflect on life—for ordinary, innocent, “pure” people—during war.<br/><br/>As reviewed by Pam at Every Free Chance Books.
A can only say it was amazing.  The back and forth between each  chapter.  Learning and feeling throughout.  This is a classic book and should go down as great literature.
The character development was wonderfully compelling and quickly drew me in.  The only reason I did not give the 5th star was some lack of satisfaction I felt with ending.
This novel is both a page-turner and an exquisite and well-written novel, something you don't find too often. Throughout its over 500 pages it manages to engage you with its beautiful prose and imagination. It follows the story of Marie-Laure, a French blind girl, and Werner, a German orphan boy who loves gadgets, a story spanning from 1934 until the present, flipping back and forth in each chapter. And as the reader suspects from the beginning, the lives of the two main characters finally cross, and they will find out that in fact their lives had also intertwined in the past through some old radio broadcasts crucial in Werner's life. And although the war is the background for most of the novel, the story focuses in the characters and manages to flesh them out, not only Marie-Laure and Werner, but also quite a few of the characters around them: Marie-Laures' father and great-uncle, the housekeeper, the nazi von Rumpel obsessed with finding a precious diamond...  And I particularly enjoyed the wonderful use of Jules Verne's novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea".<br/>This is the first book I've read by Anthony Doerr, but after the rewarding experience I'm looking forward to reading some more.
This is one of the best books I've read...ever. First, it humanizes the inhumanity of war by reducing it to the lives of people...one at a time. The extra piece it gives us is to unpack the group behaviors which make wartime sacrifices and, on the other side of the coin, atrocities, very personal, more understandable, albeit, as respect cruel group behaviors not forgivable...as each person in the group is shown to have choices. The way the narrative moves back and forth in the lives of two, initially separate, people and their families and surroundings creates a rhythm of its own. When the two narratives intersect, it creates a sense of inevitability which makes one slow one's reading pace to make sure that nothing is missed. The writing style is closer to poetry than to prose. I've re-read the last few pages again and again...with something of a heavy heart. I first read this book on my Kindle and have now bought it in hard cover, so that I can share it with family...as we often do with other books, all of less impact and stature than this wonderful piece of work. I can see this as required reading...and a book which will be remembered by all who have the good fortune to have experienced it.
Among all the wars in history, surely none have so horrifically touched so many people as WWII. As a historian, I have read a great deal of WWII fiction and non-fiction. "All the Light" has a vivid sense of realism sensitively and skillfully told in alternating scenes of two young people's lives.<br/>The author's 10 years of research are evident in the details of the lives of a German boy and a French girl as they come of age in this conflict. Although distance and social standing separate them at the outset, a small circumstance of fate forms a most slender and tenuous tie between them. As a reader I had to wonder if this seemingly inconsequential circumstance, unknown to them, would be enough to bring them together and what would happen between them if it did. I suspect many readers will wonder if the ending is appropriate.<br/>In over 70 years of reading, this ranks among the top ten novels I have read. I am gratified to learn that it has been awarded a Pulitzer Prize.
I read a lot and this is the best work of fiction I've read in quite a while.  It's a great story with fascinating characters, and it's all supported by beautiful prose.
I liked the book and I like the perspective. It's easy to read and the story line sucks you in. It's hard to put the book down although the subject matter is depressing.
I only got 40% into the novel.  I just couldn't finish it.  It was very boring and I honestly don't know why it received so many great reviews.  This book wasn't for me.
If you are interested in beautiful prose and a wonderful story, this is your book.  I have written one review other than this one so that speaks volumes.  This book moved me to comment.<br/><br/>At first the jumping around from one time to another was jarring for me, but I quickly got used to it.  It provided suspense.  Doerr cleverly weaves the stories of several individuals during WWII assuring us in the end that we are all the same - cut from the same cloth - wanting the same things.<br/><br/>This is the first book I've read by Doerr and it won't be my last.  When I finished the book (read on my tablet via Kindle app) I "closed" it and just sighed.  So beautiful and beautifully written.  He made you feel for all of the characters regardless of which side they were on or what their motivations/motives were.  Toward the end I found myself in tears.  When books are able to elicit a plethora of emotions like that it is difficult to write an adequate review.<br/><br/>Moving, stunning, involving, enthralling.<br/><br/>Well-written.  I can't emphasize that enough.  I find too often that authors may tell a good story, but to do so with excellent prose is another matter indeed.
There are books that we read and enjoy--that preoccupy our time when we are bored--and there are BOOKS that not only fill a hole inside ourselves but also change us. They challenge our view of the world and push us to greater heights of appreciation. Those books haunt us for years and reverberate in our dreams. This is one of those books! It allowed me to see the world in a new light. From start to finish, the beauty of this book is stunning. It is an incredible tale that filled me with awe, though at times it was deeply harrowing. Heartbreaking, yet paradoxically enchanting, this novel will live with me for the rest of my life. The author did a fantastic job researching WW2 and the time period before and after. To me, it seemed as though I was reading a book straight out of the 30's and 40's. Anthony Doerr's affectionate description of mollusks allowed me to see these animals in a new light and to appreciate them a lot! It has inspired me to learn so much more--the science and poetic style of this book FLOORED me! It challenges us to look between the lines and see what can't be seen. It makes one ponder all the unknown good deeds that are done. It shows us their light! READ THIS BOOK!
I loved this book, the prose is just so beautifully written. The intertwined stories of the different characters is very clever and the way their lives influence each other is intriguing. I thoroughly enjoyed the inclusion of the sciences and the beautiful way the author wrote about the light and how it affects us all.<br/>I was enthralled by the perspective of the German people who were also caught up in the process of the war that they potentially didn't sign up for but were compelled to be part of. The later chapters of the book when they are older made me think for the first time of how they would have been perceived by the rest of the world and how their lives post WW2 played out.<br/>I think I'll have to read it again, not just for the beautiful prose, but also because I think I read it too fast to find out what was happening next that I missed a few things.<br/>I understand some people who say they found it too hard to read with the time periods flipping back and forward but this didn't bother me too much, it isn't a book to read on holiday though if you're looking for something light and simple. It needs concentration and time, but you'll  be rewarded once you get into it.
This is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. It is incredibly rich in both the way the story is told and the depth of character development of the protagonists.
Obviously came highly recommended, but it was even better than the hype, in my opinion.  The story woven into the war time realities was both endearing and suspenseful.
All the Light We Cannot See, winner of the National Book Award, blew me away. Written in a delicate prose, diverse vocabulary, and a sprinkle of German and French, the novel was not an easy read, but rewarding. Anthony Doerr takes the reader on a brilliant journey and happenstance encounter between a young, blind girl and a boy -- of questionable age -- in the German "wehrmacht." But this isn't a traditional love story whatsoever. The passion and enduring loves are about the study of things, and not necessarily focused on people. The blind woman loves mollusks and sea life, while the young German boy is fascinated by radio, physics, and all things scientific.<br/><br/>As a Millennial, I questioned whether I'd "get" and empathize with the characters, being that I did not live through WWII. Doerr masterfully developed a horrific picture -- enduring poverty, starvation, and death. The suffering was not glamorized and did not seem artificially constructed to pull at your heart; rather, it was expertly crafted to paint a picture that easily lets the reader join the story.<br/><br/>This was such an incredibly impressive story, and I'll likely re-read it again soon!
Under normal circumstances I would not choose a book about WWII, largely because it tends to be an over written subject that requires enormous skill to lift out of the mundane. However, I was persuaded by the glowing reviews and have to confess, I have not been disappointed. As others have written, the short chapters make for easy reading - such a bore when your eyes are drooping and you want to end a chapter but have another 8 pages to go - but you do have to readjust to the style of the alternate stories (of Werner and blind Marie-Laure). Where I came undone was with the dates. This you have to concentrate on because otherwise you will be lost.<br/><br/>Not knowing anything about an author I am always astonished at how quickly in the narrative I learn that he/she is American, not exclusively because of the spelling but telling words used in the narrative. Here it is less obvious that usual and I admire Anthony Doerr's moving and sensitive treatment of Marie-Laure that contrasts so vividly with the cruelty of the Nazi regime Werner has to endure. Not being into radios, the technical bits, of which there are many went above me but the story is balanced and beautifully written.
Good story, interesting to read about the German Youth point of view, but self conscious writing, too many adjectives, and characters didn't come to life for me.
I RARELY read a 500+ page book in three days. I did with All The Light You Cannot See. And I am not a regular consumer of fiction. My reading interests lie nearly 100% in WWII military history as my bookshelves would testify. I decided to give this book a shot after seeing it remain consistently on the top seller lists and because it's background is WWII. Wow, am I ever glad I made that decision or I would have missed out on one of the all time great reads imho. I knew 20 minutes into this book that I had a great one here. I won't go into plot details as that has been covered quite adequately by previous reviewers. I will tell you however  that when I got less than half way through this book I knew I would not put it down until I finished it that very day. I put on a pot of coffee and sat up till 2:00 AM in a marathon non stop read to the end. I'll finish by just saying that if you miss this one, you will miss one of the all time great WWII novels. This book is a masterpiece in so many ways. I'm sure there will be a movie to follow, and I'm sure it will in no way live up to the true majesty of this compelling and spellbinding work. Highly recommended my friends. Don't miss it!
Good story but there are some sexually vulgar parts that weren't necessary.  I don't know why writers feel the need to insert these things.  To me, it ruins the story.
This is one of the better books I've read recently, I would recommend it as a good read with an honest view of war from several sides without being violently graphic.
World War II in Europe was tragic for citizen and soldier alike.  Volume after volume has been written documenting he contagion, the cruelty, the destruction and the foolhardiness of a power crazed germanic leadership trying to create their own national utopia at an unfathomable price to its victims.  This book is different, somehow.  It is intensely personal bringing the pain of ordinary human beings born in those places at that time to be felt through the written word as no other book on the subject has done for me.  It is poetic in the description of sights as color and sound through the blinded eyes of the protagonist. It does not telegraph the conclusion, rather maintains the story to the very end, when, in spite of an emotional drain, the end is unwelcome.  I wanted  the story to continue. It's as if for all of the depth of this tome, only the surface has been scratched and I want more and more to see and feel the experiences of others in the book.  It is a story about the emotion of war.  It debunks any thoughts of war as glory.  Highly recommended for any interested in this period and place to get a different perspective on what it must have really been like.
In the words of Frau Elena, used by Werner to describe Marie-Laure's unseeing eyes, is captured the essence of this book. First beautiful but also ugly. The words, the descriptions, the sentiments of the characters, each of them entwined in a life with very few options but so many choices, were gorgeously portrayed. Much like the song, Clair de Lune, there is a prominent and simple sound, that of the story of two children, which stands above a deep and complicated series of chords, caught on either side of one of the most vicious and shameful  times in human history.<br/>Although I seldom choose something so knowingly heartbreaking, this was a story I couldn't put down. It captured my imagination early on through the eyes of these two, Werner and Marie-Laure and held on by the heart as they are faced with the unthinkable. It brought about more thought than tears and left me with a feeling of slight remorse but greater satisfaction.<br/><br/>He says, "You are very brave."<br/>"...But it is not bravery; I have no choice. I wake up and live my life. Don't you do the same?"<br/>He says, "Not in many years. But today. Today maybe I did."<br/><br/>Loved this book!
These days I have a lot of trouble staying awake when I sit in an easy chair and endeavor to read a book. My age is catching up to me.  However, like chocolate pudding, I could not get enough of All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel. This book is impossible to put down. My wife had to hit me with a stick to tear me away from it. This book is a natural barrier to somulence. I know a lot of words. However, I found myself looking up the definitions of many of the words in this wonderful book just to reassure myself that I was not missing something important. I believe that this book could be read by teenagers, adults, and old folks like me. It transcends generations. I loved the numerous short chapters. I fell in love with the main characters. I got an insider's look into what life was like for the oppressors and the oppressed in wartime.  The descriptions of the various locales were captivating. These places become characters in this novel. This book has the potential to convert a non-reader to an avid reader.  It is perfect for a high school freshman English class. I could go on and on. However, my wife just hit me with a broom handle . . . time to put out the trash.
In literature, it is a very rare work indeed that can assume the moniker of a "classic". A classic is a work that defies genres and tells a tale that can mean something to everyone. Most often, those rare works that are classics are contemporary stories for the writer. We see this with Clemens Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, again with Dickens and Great Expectations (the best novel ever to be written by the way), with Austen or the Bronte sisters, and with Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby and Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. The reason for this is obvious. It is much easier to tell a story one has lived. It is a much greater literary feat to pen a classic, a true classic, based on an era in which the writer could not have personally experienced. Putting fantasy based works such as Tolkien aside, I honesty cannot think of any, with the possible exception of Walter Scott's Ivanhoe. Until today. Today I finished "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr. It will one day rest as one of the greatest novels, to be taught in schools across the globe. Mr. Doerr captured Europe in the 30's and 40's in a way I have never experienced. It is a masterpiece.
Fantastic read...lots of historical research melded with two well developed characters. At times heart warming and at times heart breaking. My favorite book of 2014.
Great writing that I really enjoyed but I wasn't so enamored with the way the story went together or ended.  I'm not a fan of skipping back and forth in time, especially when skipping back and forth between characters' stories as well, but tolerated that because the writing was so good and the individual stories were fascinating.  I would have been far more satisfied though if the two stories had actually been two books because they didn't really come together very well at the end.  I guess for the Pulitzer committee the writing and the character development mattered more and they were both very well done, but I would have liked this book more if it had meshed more at the end.  I came away feeling let down rather.  Art following real life, I guess, which doesn't necessarily resolve in a satisfactory way, especially in and following war.  The thing about literature though is that you have the chance to improve on the vagueness of real life, which we see every day.  I want the ends tied up and some conclusion that makes me feel my reading time was well spent and although the individual characters were interesting and memorable, the story itself wasn't for me.
I loved this book, although I didn't care for the timeline jumping back and forth. What is the point of that?! Regardless, I couldn't wait each night to read more. And then.... I wish I knew.  It reminded me of one of my son's school papers - if the assignment had to have "X" amount of words or "X" amount of paragraphs, he would reach that mark and then would quickly whip out a few mores sentences and DONE!  That's how I felt with this books ending. Did he have a deadline to make? Was he just tired of it and want to be DONE! With 3/4 of the book written with details so vivid I felt like I was watching a movie, it suddenly felt like someone else wrote the end. I'm really sad about it. I really wanted to know MORE about these characters after the war, and instead, it was like a quick wrap up. And I do have to agree with others who criticized the author for his perfunctory handling of a specific subject. (No spoilers from me!) Either do some research or just leave it out of the book. It was if he had a check list of things that had to be included and...'okay, did it, 'check' and DONE!'  But even with all that, I can't give it less than 4 stars.
This is a fabulous book, with well-developed characters, realism. Draws you into the characters. Vivid descriptions, gorgeous writing. Deserved the Pulitzer it won.
An enchanting story told by a great story-teller.  It lives up to the popularity it is enjoying now.  Yet another slant on the WWII in Europe theme.  Terrific read.
I liked the intricacies of the novel, it's connections. However I didn't feel resolution at the end. Perhaps I'm supposed to feel that way, but I'm left unfinished.
Amidst the beautiful writing, the intriguing story, and characters with grand possibilities to be wonderfully captivating I was thoroughly disappointed with the last portion of the book as it did not bring to a sufficient close (in my opinion) all the wonder of what had been written previously.  I felt betrayed at page 529 when I reached the end of a chapter and swiped the electronic page expecting to find another chapter that would wrap things up only to see the word "Acknowledgments" at the top!  What a disappointment.  There were other let-downs in the final chapters of the book, as well--a sense that the author was rushing to fill in details and in one particular chapter the writing changed so dramatically as to make me wonder if another writer had taken over just to get the book finished.  The characters, once alive and multi-dimensional for the majority of the book, were reduced to facts about their lives (or deaths) following the war.  I was left with a sense of "so what."  The ending left me wondering why I bothered investing my time in the book.  Three stars for the story and the characters which should have been a 5-star read.
This book manages to describe the horrors of war without being horrible.  The book is really a spiritual message about the eternality of life, about how we are all conjoined while likewise living separate lives.  It makes a strong statement about how one person's actions affect others.  I feared reading it because war isn't a subject I like to read about, but I was told it was a lyrical book; and it is.  I also very much like the way each section is short, from a 1/2 to perhaps 4 pages.  It bounces back and forth between the 2 main characters mostly, first one then the other, which is fine; but it also jumps back and forth in time.  Still, even if you are a little lost as to what year it is, you can still follow the flow of the story.  You soon find your way.  As to the gist of the book, it's hard to pigeon hole, I feel the author is, above all, seeking to make a statement about eternal life; and that the book is describing a slice out of "all man's vain endeavors" here in life.  Summation: I enjoyed it.  You truly experience what the characters are experiencing, feel as if you are where they are; and that is often a rare reading experience.
It just goes on and on and on. I will take full responsibility for this negative review. I guess I'm not very smart. But I've read thousands of books and always managed to get through even the most detailed, disorganized ones and I usually just keep on reading, hoping the redemption of the message will get through. But I finally had to stop. It is so disjointed and full of disconnected sentences thrown in that are confusing. It's like this writer just thinks of something and throws it in. I felt like I was dealing with a person who had a blaze of conscious thought and just inserted it.<br/><br/>Does this author EVER use connective phrases or  narration? One minute you are reading a story thread, then you are somewhere else in a totally disconnected narration. Good luck figuring out what is going on.<br/><br/>This book would probably be enjoyable for a Harvard or Yale literary major. But I was totally under water through most of it.<br/><br/>As novels go this is for folks who get a charge out of quantum physics and trying to figure out what the heck is going on. For me that was way  too tedious.
Remarkable intertwining of themes in a compelling storyline. I can't wait to discuss this at my book club. I believe each set of eyes will see some thing different
I would give this book 4.5 stars if Amazon would allow me to, this was a great book!  I was a little hesitant to even purchase it at first because it didn't sound like my typical go-to summer read, but it ended up being one of the best books I've read in awhile.  It tells an amazing and (with giving no further details on what happens) heart breaking story from the two main character's perspectives during WW2 in Europe.  Marie Laure, the blind French girl, develops into an extremely clever, brave, and inspiring character.  Werner, the German boy, is equally clever and unlike most around him develops into a caring boy that you just want everything to work out for.  The story is told from their two perspectives and flips around in time a bit which keeps it intriguing rather than linear and flat.<br/><br/>The only qualm I had was that I did feel like the story moved somewhat slow at times, especially from Werner's perspective, and the inner dialogue of the characters' memories dragged on at times which felt unnecessary to the rest of the novel.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd definitely recommend reading this!  It's a great story with historic value too!
Having spent a great deal of time earning a PhD in 20th Century French Literature, a study that thrust me deeply into the politics of World War II France, I have trouble passing up any book that treats that period.  I have met some of my favorite authors that way, Joanne Harris's <i>Five Quarters of the Orange</i> comes to mind.  In <i> All The Light We Cannot See</i>, Anthony Doerr joins the group.  This is a powerful novel, grabbing this reader's attention from the first and holding it all the way through the rather long novel.  Not that it feels like a long novel, but it is a heavy book to hold for hours on end.  The story of two children, a young German orphan and the blind daughter of a Parisian museum employee, travels back and forth across time and space as their individual stories develop, and eventually intertwine.  The horror that was occupied France is fully present in this novel, but Doerr also makes us see that sometimes the Germans were victims as well.  How can a country press its fifteen year old boys into military service?  Heartily recommended to all who are drawn to World War II narratives, and to the awakening of young minds.
What a very different and energizing book! The chapters are short and engage the reader to continue the read. At times a simile will explode out of nowhere and shine in a beautiful array of imagination and words. The characters are extraordinary, perfectly human and determined in that way only heroes' seem to be. A blind girl with powers other than sight: love and a sense of self, sense of duty and a desire for her the things she has lost. A German boy who wants to further himself with inventions and ideas but fights (in his mind) the way he is going about it. He is in the Hitler Youth and must find his way without losing himself; he continues throughout the book to try to atone for his perfidy of his sister. Characters survive joy and loss, hate and injury; they grow with in expected ways, sometimes seeming clichéd. The story is about survival and the way humans try to outrun the future even before it really takes hold, and when it does, they sit and panic or trying to live before they die. A wonderful book that takes anyone through a maze of color and texture, brilliant and necessary to understand the sometimes forgotten (overlooked) past.
Loved this book! I thought I wouldn't like the short choppy chapters but they helped move the book along! Wonderful imagery and beautiful word choice.  Fantastic!
I didn't like the quick wrap up ending, but the rest of the book was an excellent account of the effects of WWII. Great characters sped the movement of the story.
A book which deals with every relationship in a beautiful way.. reading this masterpiece is like a remarkable journey that everyone should definitely bank upon..
An extra ordinary book  deeply touching mirorirng human destiny fate and the invisiblle force behinde<br/>Wonderfully chosen language -  a book you newer forget
Very unsure of my feelings about this book. I really wanted to be awed by it (it did win the Pulitzer after all), and the writing was beautiful. However . . . the best books make it seem as if I were right there living the events with the characters, yet with this one I felt on the outside looking in, watching things unfold from afar. I liked Werner and Marie-Laure, the young protagonists, but there was a certain lacking of warmth in the overall tone of the book. It was like Anthony Doerr wanted you to get close, but not too close, to his creations, and I sometimes got the feeling that he was deliberately trying to craft a Pulitzer winner as opposed to writing from the heart.<br/><br/>Perhaps, for me, Doerr's book just didn't live up to the hype it received, or perhaps I read this one too close on the heels of reading A Constellation of Vital Phenomena, a book I thought was absolutely perfect in every way, and written by another Anthony - Anthony Marra. In any event, I liked, not loved, All the Light We Cannot See, and came away from it slightly underwhelmed. Go read A Constellation of Vital Phenomena or The Book Thief instead.
Brilliant moving stories there's a reason it's been on the best seller list for months.  Very moving and different views to World War II.  It was a joy to read.
Frankly I was somewhat disappointed in the book.  I had heard rave reviews of it so was quite disposed to enjoy it which I did, but there were things about it which were disconcerting and which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story:  (1) the author's device of switching from one character's story to another was confusing and distracting,  especially when the switch was just after one or two paragraphs, barely enough to advance the story.  (2) I was constantly left with a feeling or frustration and disappointment not to have resolved a situation before moving away to some other unfinished situation…(3)  I was impressed with the author's knowledge of the gem industry or its characteristics but there was too much detailened description about diamonds and other precious stones etc.  And the details of the communication para  phernais was impressive.  The details of the cruelty and horrors of torture and suffering (i.e. Freddy's experiences) was a little too graphic.  (4) There was no more mention of Marie Laure's father once he disappeared for what seemed 100 pages  until after the ware ended and prisoners was released (some more info about his time in prison would have been helpful.
Beautiful. The alternate perspectives, the parallel timelines, the descriptions, analogies - the novel is stunning. At one point, I sobbed. Others are right, this one doesn't move quickly. I did not read it in large chunks. It seems like too much to digest and needs to be nibbled, not devoured. I loved everything except the end, which, to me, was slightly disjointed. Slight spoiler here... maybe it was the large leap in the time period. The lyrical, poetic description flows well when you're imaging WWII Europe. But to me, it did not work for the more modern settings, even for the 1974 period. Also felt a bit strange to me to read the characters well into the future. They did not seem like the same characters, though I know they would have grown and changed, but there was so little that seemed to connect them to their early development. Seems like we were told more toward the ends and shown less. It seems to deteriorate a little after Berlin 1945. If it had maintained the same brilliance through that portion and the end, I would have given it 5 stars. Still very beautiful, especially when compared to other recent best sellers.
Best book I have read in years. So well written. Gives insight into what was happening to the average civilian on both sides during WWII. Also very suspenseful
Wow! I went in to this book not really knowing what to expect but for some reason I had some excitement built up because I usually read fantasy and sci-fi. But after the first few pages I honestly couldn't set this book down.<br/><br/>This story is about a blind French girl and an orphan German boy. Two people on opposite sides of a war. This story shows how a young girl grew into a woman and young boy grew into a man. Both dreamers, both wanting to know the secrets of the universe. This story is amazing!<br/><br/>Warner is not your usual nazi monster who hates Jews and kills mercilessly. He's just an everyday guy who got caught up in the way of his times. You will fall in love with both characters and root for both even though they're on opposite sides. The chapters are short but it didn't bother be at all. You'll blow through these pages so fast it won't matter.<br/><br/>I don't really feel I need to go into much more because everybody else has done that already. Suffice it to say that this book is a must read. I'm a 29 year old man and the end of this book almost brought me to tears. This is a beautiful story and it's really one of the best books I've read in a long time! Go get this book... and Kleenex! Lol
From the very opening of the novel to the last sentence this was a book<br/> that utterly captures your heart, imagination and inner feelings. It's a book you think about while at work or you see something during the day that reminds you of a passage you read the night before.  From the deeply moving love of a daughter for her father and his reciprocal adoration to the sadness of a young German boy who is a genius with machines the story builds upon one rich depiction after another against the backdrop of WWII tragedy. The horrors of the Nazi invasion of France are made so very human by the author's remarkable talents of bringing to the reader how a simple meal or moment of kindness in a world gone mad is poignant and unforgettable. That the author also took us forward in  time after the war was a fitting conclusion to a truly singular account of bravery and mass destruction. The reader is led to identify with a heroic blind girl, the besieged French people  and to feel great enmity  to those who waged the needless  slaughter of so many. If you  only have  time to read one book this year,make this the book you read.
I so looked forward to this book. The 4 and 5 star reviews were so encouraging.<br/>However, after only the first few pages I knew this was not going to be the wonderful story I had hoped for.<br/><br/>It is a lot of flowery writing that takes forever to get anywhere. Pretty words are nice, of course, but I need a story. This was pages and pages waiting for something to happen. Details about building radios abound. The characters really unrealistic.<br/><br/>I managed to get through by reading only the first line or two of each paragraph and some of the dialogue.<br/><br/>To structure this story by jumping time lines did nothing to enhance or move it along, only to confuse.<br/>Zero 1944<br/>Part 1 1934<br/>Part 2 1944<br/>Part 3 1940<br/>Part 4 1944<br/>Part 5  1941<br/>Part 6 1944<br/>Part 7 1942<br/>Part 8 1944<br/>Part 9 1944<br/>Part 10 1944<br/>Part 11 1945<br/>Part 12 1974<br/>Part 13 2014<br/><br/>I love historical fiction, but not this.
Not as good as I had expected.  Jumping dates not necessary and confusing.  Wish it had been more interwoven.  Felt like I read a lot but didn't get very far.
Learned both the horrors of the war, and the strength of the human spirit in the midst of it all. Kindness and hope can exist even in the midst of atrocities.
I enjoyed the book greatly and recommend it, especially if the potential reader would enjoy a history lesson along the way.  Written from the perspective of every character at one point or another, it holds your interest . I disagree with reviews that complained the story moved back and forth in a confusing manner, many books do this. It does, however,  require the reader to pay closer attention to the chapters.<br/> I also feel the complaints concerning the ending is unfair. In war, especially this war, the fate of countless individuals remain unknown to this day. I appreciate him acknowledging this by leaving it this way.<br/><br/>My biggest quibble, however, has to do with the cause of Marie-Laure's blindness, which was easily<br/>curable, at least it would be sometime between 1974 and 2014. Living in a country with modern, nationalized health care like France, she would have had the cataracts removed and her vision restored to some degree, if not entirely, by 2014. It is possible she had no interest in doing so,  but the author should have included that to clarify the issue. All in all, it's an excellent story and I wholeheartedly recommend it!
I loved the lyrical writing, and the emerging portraits of the two main characters. Perceptions of WW II through the eyes of these individuals conveyed a texture and depth of understanding of that time period in France/Germany.<br/><br/>A minor complaint: having a familiarity with blindness through my job teaching blind children, there were some things that didn't quite ring true for me in the depiction of Marie-Laure's perceptions.<br/><br/>I became frustrated with the very short chapters and the switching between the two lives at such a rapid rate. Another distraction was the jumping around in time to such an extent. Sometimes the forward momentum of the story was broken by the back-and-forth sequencing. I agree with the tenant that, if authors are going to jump around in time, they need to have a good reason for doing so. A cardinal sin might be committed in creating confusion in the reader, making him check back in the book to remember what was happening.<br/><br/>I've given the book 4 stars because of the beauty of the writing and the (often heartbreaking) story of the lives of children in wartime.
I put off reading this book because th review I read did not sound interesting.  After I started reading, I could not put it down and did not want it to end.
How can the ordinary reader, albeit a lover of fiction, be presumptuous  enough to make judgments on this masterpiece? I just hope he keeps writing classics.
Engaging. Interesting format which is quite cinematic. Rich characters and vivid scenic descriptions. Interesting take on WW II during the French Occupation.
I'm a bit torn about this book and my opinion on it. The craft of the writing was delectable, and his descriptions of the cities and sounds from the POV of the blind girl were impressive, to say the least. The research was top-notch, and the emotions it evoked stayed with me and I was always irritated when I had to stop reading it, it pulled me in so.<br/><br/>However, it feels like the story was going toward this crescendo, all these characters playing their parts surrounding this mysterious diamond, coming together slowly over time toward the bombing of Saint Malo, but then it keeps going, and I can't say I quite understood the point of doing so after this. Saying this, I'm sure if it had stopped right then in the battle-strewn streets of Saint Malo, I would have said "BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENS." So, take that for what it's worth.<br/><br/>Overall I did love reading this book.I love books that live in the gray area between "what is right" and "what is wrong," and the many conflicts that arise from this juxtaposition. I still highly recommend it, for those interested in such a read.
I truly wanted to love this book. After hearing from so many people about how great it was and seeing it front and center at every book store that I walked into, I guess maybe I held my hopes a bit high for it.<br/><br/>That being said, I really did like this book but I can't really say that I loved it.<br/><br/>The best part about this book is the attachment that you feel to the characters. Each of them is endearing in their own way and they each could run off and tell their own story that would be both gratifying and entertaining. It felt like a gift to have all of them in one book and interacting with each other in such passionate ways.<br/><br/>What I was really disappointed in though was the resolution of their stories. While the stories "made sense," I just found myself wanting so much more - to know more about why things happened to them or why they held the beliefs that they did. But I suppose that is simply the plight of the reader, that all books must eventually come to an end.<br/><br/>So despite my lack of love for this book, I would still highly recommend that anyone read it.
This was one of the best books I've read in a while.  Although the book is 500 pages, it only took me a week to read.  The format is a very interesting one.  Not only does the author bounce back and forth in time, but he moves around between characters.  I didn't find the movement between characters at all confusing, but I could have done without the  bouncing around in time, especially at the beginning when I wasn't sure what was happening in the book.  Doerr writes mostly in very short chapters, some of them less than a page, which really kept the book moving forward.<br/><br/>His characters show both the best and the worst of humanity.  The book climaxes when a teenage German soldier during World War II meets a French blind teenage girl.  She reminds him of his younger sister.  He is smitten with her even though they only spend a few hours together.  He is a kind person, but has been forced to turn a blind eye due to the cruelty of war and learning to be a good soldier.  His best friend when he was training was brain injured in a hazing incident, and he could do nothing or face consequences himself.
The book has everything: lovable characters, suspense, strong descriptions of the tragedies of war and how it affects individual lives. Beautifully written.
The fact that is was written from the perspective of children & how the war effected their lives during war time in Germany & Europe makes this a good read.
I was one third through the book and couldn't get into it.  I stuck with it though and am so glad I did.  Then I couldn't put it down.  It was a great book!
Started with a bang but the story went on way too long. I got worn out  as there was too much time spent in the inner worlds of the characters for my taste.
A story that so wonderfully woven that sees the main characters struggle to overcome their handicaps, one, for a young French girl, is the loss of sight and the German boy and his sister, the handicap of poverty of being orphaned and living in the Children's House in the economically depressed post WWI Germany. Their lives hunger not just for food, but for knowledge, for knowing how the world moves around them, for how things are, for what things will become.  In the bleakness of their lives, this need to know about the world around them keeps their heads above the blackness of war, above the darkness in the hearts of men who give into the war's black enticements.<br/>I loved this book.  I could feel the concussions of shells falling, I could hear the constant calling of the sea at Saint- Malo.  I could see the blackness of the coal mining town of Zollverein. I could hear the tip-tapping of Marie-Laure cane as she navigates the cobble streets of Saint-Malo. And I hear the static of a radio as its invisible waves reach out and draws these characters together and gives them light they'd cannot see.
Parallel lives - boy in Nazi Germany, girl in occupied France; the convergence was not compelling. It's a stuff happens kinda tale. Long for little reward.
Awesome book.  It was on high demand at local library--so many waiting to check it out. I had to order it to get it read before our next book club meeting.
This book is interesting because it tells a story about WWII through the perspective of 2 children, who were forced to be grown-up by the circumstances surrounding them.  The story is told at a relaxed pace, given the intensity of the story, and at times I was tempted to skip ahead to find out what was going to happen, but I am glad I didn't.  The premise of a blind girl who uses all her other senses to survive and flourish is nicely juxtaposed against a German boy who has gifts very few others have and he is unable to use them except to cause destruction.  His story is sad, because he was just a boy trying to pursue his dreams.  Their stories briefly touch each other, as ephemeral as the radio broadcasts coming from the attic of her uncle, and the symbolism of the young German boy hearing a private broadcast from France and then years later meeting and saving the girl in the house despite the war raging around them is a nice touch.  I didn't get the complete happy ending I wanted, but what war story ends that way?  A good summer read.
Anthony Doerr writes strikingly beautiful prose, and weaves tales that are deeply grounded in realism and are yet often uncanny --- a difficult combination challenge that few can manage.  His chosen style in this book is unremitting, back-and-forth, short-chapter telling of the stories of his major characters.  This works better than one might imagine, and generates a good deal of momentum, even if it is ---just occasionally--- a bit disruptive.  Of course, that disruption may be at least part of the point.  Criticisms?  Well, his elegant language is sometimes stretched a bit, when something more brisk might serve.  Also, I suspect that not all readers will think that he brings his themes and characters together as effectively he might in the end:  I didn't find his resolutions entirely satisfying, if they were intended to be.  But I mark these as small criticisms in the context of a compelling story, very well told.  Doerr has a talent for engaging his readers from the ealiest pages and easily meets the test of being hard to put down.  A great read and one likely to linger in one's mind.
Excellent book beautifully written. The characters were fully developed so you were so engrossed in their lives and cared about what would happen to them.
It took awhile to get into this book.  Very slow in the beginning.  The Nightingale is a much better book and it's taken place during the same time period
Very well written. Love the way how the story was told - from the perspective of two different characters. Also, love the way it ends. Highly recommended.
This is the book students will be reading in class as one of the finest examples of writing, plot, character, EVERYTHING from this time period.  Stunning.
While this book is a bestseller and already highly rated, I bought it because it was so hard to get via our local library chain. I'm so glad I spent the money, it was more than worth it.<br/><br/>The book is set mostly in France and Germany during World War II. The two main protagonists are a young French girl and a less-young German boy. The book follows the changes in their lives and fortunes over the period of the war with flashbacks to earlier times. One thing I really liked is that the chapters are self-contained and very short (2-6 pages) so I could easily read one or two before falling asleep. Once I got about 200 pages into the book it was SO COMPELLING I completed the rest in one sitting.<br/><br/>I found it captivating, enthralling and informative. I marked it as having some sexual content, it has almost none. The violence is mostly related to fights because of the war itself, though there are some harrowing scenes that aren't directly due to battles.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes a great story and a deep exploration of characters and motives.
Good overall story but a very slow story. Waited forever to feel something catch my interests and it didn't happen until 3/4 of the way through the book.
The writing is too good for such an average story. The introductory pages of this book are so descriptive and beautiful and set the table nicely for the story, which, sadly to me, disappoints. You've got a young French girl who goes blind at a very young age contrasted with the story of a young orphaned German boy whose paths are meant to intersect through the backdrop of WW2 . The descriptions and settings of the characters are laid out well (especially in Werner,the German's case) where you are immersed in his moral conundrums of being raised among the Hitler youth.<br/>The book is very readable with short " da vinci code" style chapters and the writing is incredibly beautiful but the story just felt vanilla. I was never really moved or tense during any of the moments of the book and part of that is the jumping back and forth narrative which didn't really work for me because there wasn't really any needed reveal to disguise. I felt like it was a digestible meal that lacked flavor : good enough to keep eating until the plate is empty, but not good enough to ask for more.
I don't have much time to read for pleasure as I am the sole caretaker of aging parents and I work full-time as well.  When I select a book to read I rely on reviews and look for something on the best sellers list.  this was #13 when I bought it and moved to #1 or #2 by the time I finished it. I went on a 2 week vacation and selected this book from the bookstore at the beach.  I liked the fact it was broken into small chapters so I could put it down to take a nap on the beach or at night when I get tired I could find a stopping point after a few pages. That being said, I didn't want to put it down.  I thought I knew where it was going and had the ending all figured out.  Nope.  I'll leave it at that so I don't spoil anything.  I like books that are in line with history but with fictional characters.  It gives me perspective of what it might have been like during the period it was set in and surrounding the events of the time.  This was written well and easy to read.  Not in a juvenile way but meaning it flowed easily.  It left me wanting to read another book also related to WWII.
This is one of those books that just envelops you - or at least it did me.  There were a few odd details that seemed out of sync with the times or with history, but I can easily overlook those details because the story itself pulled me in.  I could feel the desperation of the French people living under Nazi occupation.  I even felt the pain of the orphan boy sent to the brutal Hitler Youth school; it hurt to watch him give in to the ugliness around him, participating in something he hated, out of an instinct for self-preservation.<br/>Without giving away too much of the plot, I did think the ending was a bit labored, as though the author reached too far in order to tie up loose ends.  However, the real story isn't about facts or details, it's about feelings, and those came shining through for me.  I think it might have been more satisfying if the book had ended about 50 pages earlier, but that's a fairly small quibble.<br/>I got this book from the library, and then switched to the Enci Audio version.  Kudos to the reader - Zach Appleman (if I have the name right) was excellent!
Dazzling. A compelling read from page 1 to 530, ATLWCS bounces quickly from scene to scene. Doerr jumps forward and backward in time, and from story to story with the swiftest of cuts. A few paragraphs about his blind protaganist, a young girl in France, then quickly off to a page or two about her foil the young German boy, growing up in the shadow of the Third Reich. How does she cope with blindness?  How can he not see the evils ushered in by the Nazis? She loses a father, he loses his sister. Horrific events unfold around them both as Europe plunges into war.  And yet the light we cannot see...radio waves fling through the ether and tie these two together. Young Marie-Laure survives by counting steps around her home and town. The German survives by mastering triangulation of radio broadcasts. Doerr draws the triangles of his storyline tighter and tighter to the exciting denouement. Metaphors of good and evil, light and darkness abound. The author's nuance for detail, for pacing, for turn of phrase are rich. In the end, this is a read well worth the investment of a few days.
Beautifully written, amazing metaphors, great characters that remain in your heart. Tears will flow if you relly get into the story, you've been warned.
The story was dark but it is exquisitely written. It was difficult to put down and I was sad when it was finished because it was so beautifully written.
Well written and a good story too. There are thought-proviking themes, such as who is really blind and what does it mean when we say" I see..."?
All the Light We Cannot See may be the best novel I’ve read so far this year.  Both in the storyline and the way Doerr writes his intricate sentences, it is no surprise that this book won the Pulitzer Prize.<br/><br/>This is the story of two children who each fight to survive and make sense of the world in the face of the sweeping tragedies of WWII. Marie-Laure is a blind french girl who lives with her father in Parisnear the Museum of Natural history.  As the Nazis invade Paris, the two are forced to go to her wealthy, eccentric, and reclusive uncle in the seaside town of Saint-Malo.  There they take with them the museum’s prize possession: a very rare and valuable jewel with a legend of its own. Werner is a young German orphan who has an incredible skill in fixing radios.  This skill earns him a place in the brutal Hitler Youth program and later with Nazi intelligence across Europe.  The two children’s lives and the story collide toward the end of the war in Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>The book offers great writing and an intriguing interconnected storyline.  I recommend it.
This is such a well written book. Set in Europe before and during World War II, it follows a young girl and her father living in France as she becomes blind and two orphan children living in Germany, lives that will be changed forever by the rising of the Third Reich. It starts in the middle of the story and jumps back and forth over a ten year period. This is done masterfully by Doerr, so the flow of the story feels natural and easy to follow.  It reminds us of the worst and the best in the range of humanity, through the horrors of war and inner strength of the oppressed. Those reading should know about small pockets of violent deaths and rape, terrible but brief encounters, reminders of the depravities of war.  The story proceeds and characters' lives intertwine in nearly impossible ways. The last of the story brings characters to thirty years later, then one of the characters to present day. I had to re-read the last chapter to see if there was more to it. This was my only complaint of the book. I was looking for something a little more profound for the last chapter.
I loved this book. The writing was beautiful, capturing an image of the world as a blind girl would experience it. The story was intricate and elegant.
Loved this story! The characters were so worthy of our time. Great development! The ending was a bit rushed I felt but otherwise just a wonderful read.
Absolutely wonderful story". It gave me a new understanding of how the French suffered during the invasion of The German army at the start of WWII.
This is an enthralling tale of World War II. While it takes place just before and during he war years in Europe--Germany and France--it is not a war story in the normal sense. Movement of troops, and descriptions of battles are not the focus. The story is about two German children who listen to their home-made radio and are enthralled by what they hear. A voice from France telling them about the secrets of science. The story is about a blind girl who lives with her father, a keeper of keys in the National Museum in Paris. She and her father become refugees with a secret the Nazi occupiers want. The story all comes together in St. Milo in Brittany. Since I enjoy reading stories of the lives of people who were my contemporaries, in a way, during World War II, but I was much younger and far away from danger, I was attracted to this book. The surprise of this book is not the plot, the characters, or the environment (all of which are good), it was the language, the poetic style, the use of phrase, and the construction of sentence. What a lovely book. What a joy to read.
If Michael Doerr were a painter, he’d be Georges Seurat, the 19th century pointillist artist whose dots on canvas somehow added up to an engrossing picture.  Doerr piles on thousands of details in his romantic yet realistic World War II saga, creating a uniquely vivid impression of the converging fates of a blind French girl and a radio-obsessed German boy.  Linked unwittingly by some prewar broadcasts, they stumble toward each other in the maelstrom of German conquest and collapse.  Every step the girl takes is counted so she can navigate the streets of the Breton coastal city of Saint-Malo.  Every movement of the boy’s clandestine radio detection unit on the Eastern front and later in France leads him to the same city, the same street, the same room.  Shadowing the story throughout is a German booty hunter relentlessly seeking a legendary diamond the girl might be concealing.  The fate of the three is settled in the late summer of 1944, when bombardments presage the arrival of the Allies.  A satisfying and poignant postscript carries the story up to the present.
I just finished the book today on the beach in Mexico.  I started reading at about 70% at noon and by four I was done.  I was completely oblivious to my everthing but the book.  I didn't move, I didn't notice the people around me, I have a sunburn on my back from sitting in my chair facing the ocean all afternoon.  I was completely immersed in the beautiful and compelling story of two young people whose lives would connect during one of the most horrific times mankind has suffered through.<br/><br/>The book is literature at its finest.  I was reminded of the way D. H. Lawrence would bring the reader into the fabric of the lives and surroundings of the characters.  All of my senses were firing as I found myself in France during WWII.  I was inside the heads of the main characters as they lost the innocence of childhood far too quickly  and grew into children of war.  I suffered with them as they feared for their lives and the lives of those they loved, and as those lives were extinguished.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and read this book.  You won't regret it.
I loved this book until I got to the end.<br/>The story is about a blind girl in Nazi Germany during the run-up to WW!!.<br/><br/>Everything about her story fascinated me until I got to the end of the book.  I know real life does not always have endings that are neatly tied up.  However, with this book , I felt that the reader was left completely without resolution.<br/><br/>I review this book with a great deal of personal perspective:  My Father served in WWII in the Pacific Theater.  He was shot, he received two Purple Hearts and a Silver Star.<br/><br/>I was very interested to read this book based on the perspective of a normal person in Germany being sucked into the monstrosity of Hitler' Nazi strategy. I think the book did a fabulous job of showing what the Nazi regime did to the normal German population.<br/><br/>I recommend this book but caution that you may not feel satifisfied with the ending.<br/><br/>I would still recommend this book.  I was only disappointed by the end of the book which did not clarify what happened to the main characters.
Beautifully written. I love how it gave insight into how WW II impacted a young girl in France and a young German boy. Everyone should read this book!
A suspenseful and emotionally moving story written in an manner that uses lapses of time to develop the lives of each characters into the main story.
I lived among these characters as though they were real.  I was truly sad to see it end.  But I will keep thinking of this world for long afterwards.
This book is complex and riddled with metaphors and events, but stepping back, I realize that it ultimately is so simple. It is the story of two teenagers, caught during one of the most horrific events of our lifetime.  Adding to and intertwined with their storylines are several other key subplots that are developed over the course of the novel.  The Sea of Flames being the most significant and poignant.<br/><br/>I am giving it 4 stars because as wonderful as the writing, character development and intricacies of this book are - there were moments were I had trouble sticking with it.  It just lost me at certain moments.<br/><br/>As others have said, I did not find the ending to be fulfilling.  But what I will remember is the beautiful moments scattered throughout the book that highlight the humanity, love and complete despair of this period of time.  To me, one phrase sums up thus entire book -- "what you could be."  The thought of how that one proclamation resonates to each of the characters really is the heart and soul of this book for me.
This story of two teens in the midst of WWII is wonderful. The author jumps to different points of view chapter by chapter, and then he moves from one point in time to a few years earlier, then ahead in time. One would think this would be confusing, but it is actually very easy to follow; the different characters have very different points of view, making the transitions clear.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure and Werner become very real as the story progresses. Even though the tie-in with their lives seems so highly improbable, it is completely believable. Even the minor characters become real; the author has done well in bringing them all to life. The details "feel" real; I actually feel like I learned about and experienced a little of the war from both sides.<br/><br/>The only weak point for me would be the Sea of Flames. It only seemed to be the motivation for one character, and it's description at the end was...odd. Maybe there's a depth there I'm failing to grasp.<br/><br/>The novel is worth spending time on, reading slowly and savoring each passage.
Last year, Anthony Doerr’s latest novel, All the Light We Cannot See, fascinated readers and reviewers, and this year he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for the novel. The prize is $10,000 and is awarded “for distinguished fiction by an American author, preferably dealing with American life.”<br/>Funny thing: this novel is not about American life. It’s about a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy during World War II. Then again, it’s not just about them. It’s about all of us, which is presumably why the Pulitzer jury decided to award Mr. Doerr this prize even though the entire novel takes place in Europe, and all of the characters are European.<br/><br/>I had put off reading this story; I figured it was going to be a predictable love story about two teens set in wartime. I was wrong. Of course, there is the continuous threadline that pulls the reader along to find out if they do meet and/or fall in love and/or live happily ever after. But All the Light We Cannot See is about so, so much more than that. And it is by no means a fairy tale.
An incredibly moving, beautifully written, and emotionally compelling book. A  great book for anyone who loves a good read. I could not put it down.
I was sure this book was going to be a strong 5 star until the last 15% when it started to fall apart. The prose and writing is superb. The character develope eat is great. Then all of a sudden it kind of fell apart. I felt there was no real satisfactory closure for the reader. The main characters more or less rapidly disappear and I am left wondering wht the author was trying to tell us. Maybe Marie Loy!s blindness was really light and Wever's sight was darkness or something. Somewhat disapponted with the closure in all the key characters and obsession on the diamond that went no where.<br/>The writing is superb, thus the 4 stars. I don't understand the lack of similar disappointment with those 5 star reviews.<br/>Maybe the author got ill and rushed to finish. I would love his intrepretation of the flight to end the characters after such long developement of them. I will be reluctant read anything else by this author for the feeling of lack of fulfillment after reading so long with anticipation.<br/>Maybe it means there is no meaning to life.
I did not want this novel to end. "All The Light We Cannot See" is the best novel I've read this year. Anthony Doerr's stunning tale is absolutely beautiful and utterly captivating from its first few pages. Marie-Laure is a stunning character who develops with such passion that through her character you witness Doerr's love for this novel set simultaneously in France and Germany during World War II.<br/><br/>Doerr's novel explores the lives of Marie-Laure Blanc, the daughter of a French museum worker, and Werner Pfennig, a German orphan. Starting with the time period prior to World War II and ending with modern day, it takes the reader on a rich journey as Marie-Laure and Werner discover how amid distance and different lives, they are united in an almost "magical" way.<br/><br/>I great such love for both Marie-Laure and Werner that I found myself welling with tears or holding my chest in suspense through a number of chapters. As I closed the book upon reading its final pages, I found myself wanting to read it all over again.
This book. This amazing book.<br/><br/>"All the Light We Cannot See" is one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It is not a page turner, but not because it's boring. It's not a page turner because you have to linger. It is so incredibly beautiful that you want to caress every page, every word, giving every phrase enough attention. You want to go back and reread, making sure you got the full meaning, the sentiment, the thoughtfulness.<br/><br/>The characters are like family, you learn their intricate designs and immense complexity. The rolling happenstance stories, full of mysticism and destiny, become your story, the history of the world.<br/><br/>I think books will be written about this book; movies, documentaries will follow. Writers will site it as inspiration, philosophers will quote it, and ordinary people will become immersed in its pages, unable to let-go at the end.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a classic, it will last forever, your grandchildren and great-grandchildren should read it.
The very best novel I have ever read. Anthony Doerr writes a symphony, turns the reader into a Stradeverius and together they make beautiful music.
This book was one of those that you can't put down and don't want to end.  Beautiful and sad and one who's every character was needed in the story.
I would, and have, recommended this book, repeatedly.  Severe struggles wrapped in exquisite language! I am now in pursuit of other Doerr writings.
All the Light We Cannot See is a phenomenal read!  It immediately holds your interest and pulls you into a very disturbing time in our history which is described in minute detail - exactly everything as it was in this time period in each country - France, Germany, Russia, Europe - and also has great character development - we feel the heavy burden each character faces with the "fear" of the times - and how innocent, young children are quickly brainwashed into the insanity of Adolph Hitler - the theme of good vs. evil permeates throughout - free will over power of the masses - what is insanity and evil can become thought of as "normal" -  Loved the Book!  Also how quickly evil can provocatively permeate a society until it slowly and cunningly attacks and conquers!!  Can one person make a difference?  And also the courage and vitality of the native people in France, and Europe - who courageously try to fight this evil in their own way - helping to send 'signals' - daily risking their own lives as well as their family members -
Like some of the other reviewers here, I found the end of the story placed at the beginning of the novel and the two different series of events (with two different main characters) then continuing chronologically toward the ending that was at the beginning of the novel and also tucked between events surrounding the ending -- well, it was often disconcerting even with the month and year provided to orient the reader. In fact, even putting this complaint into words is hard! Maybe Author Doerr could try it again and proceed chronologically. Good books should not be puzzles. The writing is fabulous, really evocative of  times and places.  The characters are wonderful, clearly drawn and each in his or her own way startling. And of course the theme -- war is hell and screws up and ruins every lovely thing and kills not only people but destroys the goodness and value of those who survive it -- is timeworn but  true. This is a very long novel I will likely read again and again, like "Life and Fate", getting more from it with every reading.
Brilliant! One of the best, most beautiful books I have read in a long while.  This story and all that goes with it will stay with me for a while.
It is a wonderfully written book.  It was a little heavy for me personally, but it is wonderfully written, with good characters, and poetic depth.
Beautifully written, emotionally compelling story of the parallel lives of two innocents and their experience of just trying to get through WW II.
Amazing. One of the best books I've read in a long time! So well written, and the scope of the author's understanding of human beings is humbling.
Just a dozen pages into this wonderful visually intricate portrayal I was dreaming of the settings Mr. Doerr described.  I am savoring every page!
Marie Laure is a blind girl who is forced to leave her home with his father when nazi Germany occupies France during the Second World Warw<br/>Werner is a German orphan who grows up during the rise of nazism in Germany, he is very fond of science and engineering and shows unusual kills to understand and fix radios he ends up attending a prestigious nazi school and enrolled in the Army. One every other chapter their respective lives are followed and we understand that a given point they would intersect<br/>And this is the book about, focusing in both characters how they endure and experience their misfortunes. The story is captivating, concrete, the narrative graphic with carefully chosen words in very short chapters, interesting quotes and moving situations. This book got a Pulitzer Prize, the author accomplished a good work as a how the world is perceived through the blind individual perspective having all the other senses aroma to make up for the lost eyesight. It suits fans of drama/mystery, both adults  and teens
I really thought I was going to love this book.  I read a lot of books from this era so I thought this would be in my lane.  The story started out very interesting but by the end of the book I was skimming.  First of all the book could have been shorter.  It felt as though the author dragged it out.  The story also switches back and forth between different time periods.  I normally like this method of writing but I found it very confusing and annoying because of the way this author did it.  When he would go back in time he would not pick up where he left off.  He would often land somewhere before or after the last time and then he would skip forward when returning to the present era.  It was very distracting and took away from the flow of the story line.  The entire story was about the build up leading to the meeting of the two main characters.  When they finally did meet, it was very rushed and anti-climatic.  I am not sorry I read the book, but I would certainly not rave about it to other potential readers.
This is a complicated book about a complicated time.  The writing is excellent but it is easy to get lost when moving from one time to another.
This book was so beautifully written that it takes you to the time and place and holds you there. I did not want it to end. A real masterpiece.
This was an amazing story!  Its characters were complex and human.  The book was brilliantly written and kept my attention all the way through.
This book is amazing. When I read the summary, I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled and skipped it. I thought it would be an unrealistic story about a French blind girl and a German boy who meet and fall in love during the war. My book club selected and I had to get it. I couldn't have been more wrong about my understanding of the story. It's one of the best books I have read in a long time. 3 nights in a row I went to bed at 1 AM. I just couldn't put it down. Every day, I couldn't wait to pick it up and resume my reading.<br/>This book covers a lot of war subjects. The author manages to talk about very important topics (the French resistance, the occupation, living during war time, why people did what during the war, etc...) quickly but deeply. It was never too graphic which I appreciated. This book also made me think about what people did during War World II to fight the Nazis. Without their courage and sacrifice, I wouldn't be who I am today.<br/>I just loved that book and would urge you to read it too.
This is a highly entertaining read. I will read it again, just as I do with all good books. It's a long story with many short chapters that need to be placed in the chronology line after reading them in order to better understand it. But it takes no effort, as the prose is enjoyable and the characters as well as their situations are touching enough to grab one's attention throughout the book's length.<br/><br/>I experienced no urge to find out what was next in the story, as every setting, every season narrated, every situation has its own self contained taste, providing a pleasant comfort for the reader. It was impossible for me not to stop every now and then to imagine that age in history and consider what people back then thought and felt.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't help reflecting about the indifference with which an unconcerning universe affects the lives of individuals, making it up to each person to elevate their own souls to a level of acceptance and understanding worth wanting to keep living.
Simply amazing.<br/><br/>I would have preferred the story have been wrapped up at the conclusion of the war and not in the modern day.  The transition was jarring and I feel it didn't add anything.  Likewise Jutta's wartime fate didn't seem to add anything, and was a bit disturbing.<br/><br/>The character development was terrific.  I really did try to picture the world that Marie "saw" - and sometimes I wondered how she knew things like where a spider web was (your brain then fills in an interaction of her going to the sink and her hands or face becoming tangled in it).  Werner Pfennig (a pfennig was a German penny, the lowest form of currency, magnetic, and I used them to buy many gumballs as a child in West Germany) was a type of precocious and sensitive that resonated with me.  Von Rumpel was a compelling anti-villain.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, though, and leave yourself with some healthy questions and wonderment by stopping at the beginning of Jutta's appearance at the end of the war.
ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is one of the best books you’ll read this year. On one hand, the title implies the lessons learned by a young German orphan boy about radio waves. On the other hand, as the author describes it, “It’s also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within World War II.” Add in a newly blinded French girl who is forced to leave her familiar surroundings, and you’ll soon find yourself in literary heaven.<br/><br/>The layered meanings run deep in this book. No wonder nearly every advanced review uses the word “intricate” to describe this masterpiece. The German boy and his sister discover an old radio, where they hear science lessons from afar. There are lessons about the brain, sitting inside the darkness of our skull, interpreting light; there are lessons about coal having been plants living millions of years ago, absorbing light, now buried in darkness; lessons about light waves that we cannot see—all applicable as the story ...

This is one of the best fictional books about World War II that I have read in a while. It was captivating. The book is well written, and I really enjoyed the setup, the story following two children, Marie Laure and Werner, who grow up during the years leading up to the war—one in France and one in Germany—and who meet in Saint-Malo in 1944. The chapters alternate between these two people and their past and present.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, I knew that Marie Laure’s and Werner’s path would converge in Saint-Malo, and I raced through the pages to find out how it would happen and what would happen next. Yet at the same time, the prose was so beautiful that I wanted to take my time to savor it. I found the parts that described how Marie Laure perceived the world around her particularly poignant. Being blind, she has to rely on order to find her way, especially when she is outside. At the same time, there’s the chaos of war all around her. It was touching to read how she found solace amid ...

Read it love it enjoy your being wrapped into the pages of this story. Brilliantly written. beautiful almost like poetry. exquisite language.
I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.  In fact, I would give it a 5 star rating.  I almost could not put it down.  I loved the courage and determination of Marie-Laure.  Her father's ability to create miniature houses in a village so his daughter could walk around, even though totally blind, was extra ordinary.  He was such a loving father.<br/><br/> Werner's talents are amazing.  How he became so skilled without any technical education showed how very bright he really was.<br/><br/>I liked the great uncle and how he took to his young blind niece almost immediately.  As the story progressed, I liked him more and more.  I loved that he was eventually able to leave his room and even walk downtown.<br/><br/>It was a well-written novel with lots of twists.  The characters, although very much individual, became intertwined in fascinating ways.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have known what happened to Marie-Laure's father before the story ended.  (Maybe it was told and I missed it.)????
Main characters are blind French teen Marie-Laure and German teen Werner, an self learned expert in electronics.  It takes place in a German military academy, Paris, and on the walled-island San Malo in NW France in WW2 during the German Occupation. Their lives eventually converge in San Malo. This was one story that I loved and 'unloved' at the same time.  The author was a genius in the creation of dramatic and metaphorical prose.  As I read some of the more descriptive sentences and paragraphs I marveled at the talent of the author, Anthony Doeer.  Most were of near genius. With the short chapters (2-4 pages), jumping between times and characters, and the over-describing, many times I just wanted to scream...will you please just tell the story. The story line WAS amazing with so many facets and detailed research of wartime Germany and France, geography, and era radio communication  The conclusion was well-done as all the loose ends finally came to head. I will recommend this book to others.
Intriguing, well-written story set in France during WWII. I enjoyed both the stories of Marie and Werner. I also like the minor characters as well. Heart-wrenching at times, there is much sadness but there is also joy found within the ashes. I loved Fredrick, always loyal and good.<br/><br/>I would have given this book more stars had the book not meandered and lost focus several times, running out of steam. During these times I grew frustrated and just wanted to finish. While I liked how things are wrapped up in the ending, it just went on too much and would have kept my attention more had there been more concise editing.<br/><br/>If you enjoy WWII stories with great characters and don’t mind winding through some unessential pages you will likely love this book.
A boy a girl a stone a war<br/>They all touch one another in a brilliantly told piece that evokes both the horror and beauty of the interplay of Hitler’s Germany and its destructive forces and the soul saving power of love.<br/>Anthony Doerr is a masterful story teller, ten years in the writing on this work which must have required trips to site as well as relentless research on natural history and the absorption of many war time experiences, German and French. He uses the reader’s expectations of what man is capable of, good and evil, to create and resolve tension shifting forward and back through time.<br/>His main protagonists, Werner and Marie-Laure, are deeply intertwined because of a long passed recording of science for children and physically only momentarily but the memory lingers for both. The power of the stone is left to the reader’s inclinations.<br/>Doerr has won many literary awards; you likely will wish to read another of his publications after this skillfully told story.
We enjoyed a Breton dinner at our book club meeting that we appreciated almost as much as this Breton-set book.  All the Light We Cannot See got an average grade from us of A in a band of A- to A+.  We all loved the depth of the characters, who provided a deep sense of, for example, what it's like to live with blindness, and the wrenching ambiguity of pursuing personal goals through the support of something abhorrent.  We explored the theme of light -- both revolving illumination of perspective and the electromagnetism that attracts and repels these characters.  We had some mixed feelings about the magic gem:  throwing in a mystical element took some of us out of an otherwise heavily grounded subject; on the other hand, it was an important element of the themes of light, repulsive allure, and cursed gifts.  Overall, we all liked the story, the characters, the writing, and especially the swirl of an ending.  Thanks and congrats to our member who picked his second Pulitzer winner in advance.
This was a beautiful story. Stunningly told and accessible and relatable, dealing with an ugly part of our shared history in a magical way.
Beautifully written both by words and emotions.  Did not want it to end. Strong characters would teach so many lessons in living with hope.
What a great read! The characters are great and the imagery was excellent. I actually was depressed when I finished it! I totally recommend
Beautiful writing!  Well conceived.  Honest ending... Loved this book and look forward to reading more from this author.  Read it!
I really tried to like this book. I had a few problems with the book, which have been highlighted in other reviews. First, the book is very long. That is great if the character development and plot are well developed. I did not get that connection with either character in the book (the boy or the girl). Their life was spelled out for us (sometimes painfully so) but you never really understood them as people. I also did not like the back and forth with the present, past and current. It became confusing - again, others have said this. This made the book more confusing but more important, it took away (again) from the character development, vs. going from childhood, teens, early adulthood, marriage, etc. The book has been receiving a lot of publicity but be sure to read some of the other reviews. If you are looking for one of the best historical fiction books in the marketplace, read The Invisible Bridge by Julie Orringer. Also a WWII novel but much more interesting and better characters.
A very well crafted epic based on the ultimate albeit brief convergence of a blind French girl and a young German teenager during the course of WWII and the years leading up to it. There is some "time travel" in the book as the cadence shifts between the events surrounding D-Day and the five years leading up to that. The girl's perspective is Paris and then occupied (northwest) France where she survives through a network of family connections; his is a dismal orphanage in a mining town in Germany which promises a bleak future which he escapes by being accepted into the Nazi training program by virtue of his technical acuit despite its harsh brutality. Although it is a well written story, it also provides somewhat remarkable insights into the war from these differing perspectives. It was my father's generation that fought in this war, and I always wondered why they so seldom spoke of it. I think this book will provide a lot of insight into answering that. Highly recommended.
Doerr expresses humanity into every sentence. His descriptive prose and detail had me entranced throughout. I highly recommend this novel.
This superbly-written novel has all the ingredients of a best seller and an Oscar-worthy movie. It drew me in from the beginning and was an intense and great read.<br/><br/>The story begins with parallel stories of two young characters living everyday lives in Europe on the cusp of WW II’s Germany invasion of France. Werner, a German boy, resides in an orphanage and has a brilliant understanding of radios. His valuable skill is recognized by the military, he is recruited and he becomes one of the ‘privileged’. Marie-Laurie, a French blind 6-year old girl lives in Paris with her father, the ‘master of keys’ of a large natural history museum. As the Germans invade France, both of these young lives change forever. Innocence is lost, and ultimately their worlds collide. Werner and Marie-Laurie’s characters were portrayed masterfully by the author. Although they were on opposite sides of the war, I truly cared for each of them; their resiliency, loyalty and bravery were remarkable.
I have just this minute finished the book. I hated for it to end yet I couldn't wait to what came next. This our reading groups choice as a Summer read, I can't wait until we meet. It will be a great discussion.<br/>I have not read a book such as this for quite awhile, I lean to the apocalyptic genre, but what is war but an apocalyptic event that has happened all too often in human history.<br/>The book is simply beautiful though we go through a terrible time with the characters. It is written in a way that I always enjoy, a back and forth from character to character and through time. The characters of the book will stay with you, as though you know them, they are written so fully. Once you start this amazing book you will be hard pressed to put it down, really. Lucky for me I am on vacation, staycation, with a good book.<br/>Read it, you will love it. You may need to call in sick to work once you start!!<br/>I can't wait to read more by this author if this authors work.
I can't get this book out of my mind or heart. The writing is breathtaking. Read other reviews for plotline and analysis. Words fail me.<br/><br/>The essence of the book, the red flame at the heart of the diamond, is found at the end of the last chapter as Marie-Laure hears the wind singing anthems in the hedges, and imagines electromagnetic waves traveling into and out of a cell phone, bending around her, and crisscrossing the air. Torrents of texts, conversations, words, music. "And is it so hard to believe that souls might also travel these paths? That her father and Etienne and Madame Manec and the German boy named Werner Pfenig might harry the sky in flocks like egrets, like terns, like starlings? That great shuttles of souls might fly about, faded but audible if you listen closely enough?" We are all connected -- like it or not -- and we are all immortal. "We rise again in the grass. In the flowers. In songs."<br/><br/>BTW, five stars is not enough.
Great book ! I like the author's style of rotating each chapter back and forth between the two characters. I did not want to put it down.
Interesting story - about the interconnected lives of several families through and beyond ww2.  love the descriptive language. Great read
Almost teared up in multiple spots in the book. Very well done. Beautifully captures pain of the era and the questions of life afterward.
I liked that Doerr touches on topics not often discussed when studying WW II: what it was like to be physically imperfect ( blind) and living under the Nazis, and what it must have been like to be an intelligent little boy thrown in to the Hitler youth movement. The book skips around and there are so many chapters it gets a bit confusing at first, but that's also the beauty of this novel. Doerr goes about revealing just the right amount of information at a time to keep you reading on. He sets the story in a real city in France...I had fun Google earthing it...his descriptions of life in Saint Malo come alive, you can picture uncle Etienne's house, Marie Laure's walk to the bakery and the narrow path to her seasnails spot. Would recommend to teens or adults interested in delving in to not the usual WW II story...but gives the mind new aspects to consider when contemplating life under the Nazis...and how these 2 young people coped. Didn't want the story to end, a fine read.
I can see why it won the Pulitzer prize. The evocative language, the subtlety of  emotions, and world war II setting capture the reader.
I decided to read this book because multiple media sources had it on the top ten books of 2014--one of which even proclaimed "everyone I recommend this book to loves it!" Well, I didn't. I started it and restarted it four times before I could continue past the first few chapters. However, on the fourth time, I did become involved in the book. As others have mentioned, the chapters were a bit fractured going back and forth between the two main characters in 1940 and 1944 and then the author added another character. And, of course, the diamond was the other factor, although I was never able to quite figure out if it was really a curse or not.<br/><br/>The book was interesting and engaging until the last few chapters. He killed a character off in a manner that made no sense. He threw in a rape scene that was unnecessary for the storyline. He did jump forward to the 1970 with a reunion of some of the characters, but that could have been written better I think.
This was our book club selection for November 15, 2015. It had come up before in discussion but was put on hold until now. One main reason for that was because it is a new book and so relatively expensive and not available for everyone in libraries. It turned out to be a great choice and everyone enjoyed the discussion although some did not love the book – it was good, but they did not love it. (A high bar.) Besides the interesting characters and the way the scenes were woven back and forth through not only time but from character to character, I thought it interesting that one could interpret the diamond plot as associated with faith and everything to do with Light as associated with science. So there is a concurrence in the end of faith and reason so to speak. Took me a closer look to figure out what happened to the diamond but that was probably a better way for it to end. Was the ending too much? Some thought so. I liked how it wrapped up all of the loose ends.
What Pat Barker's Regeneration trilogy did to honor the spiritual tragedies suffered by British soldiers in World War I, Anthony Doerr has done for a wider group who survived World War II. Although I always have to watch my step when it comes to hyperbole, at the moment I can't remember reading a novel so exquisitely crafted, like the diamond at the center of the story. And like that diamond, the hearts of Doerr's main characters reveal hidden fires as the author cuts away the dross and polishes the facets with the grit of survival. The elegance and precision of his language, the finely wrought narrative construction, and -- most of all -- the author's own compassion for the men and boys, women and girls he's created puts this novel on a very, very high plane. This work's deep humanity and sweeping scale makes it soar far above the self-absorption and barren inner lives of most characters in contemporary fiction. Doerr has created, in my view, a major work of art.
A mildly entertaining read based on an idea that takes considerable imagination to accept as reasonable let alone as possible.
VERY well written historical novel.  Captivating story of a young French girl & a young German boy, whose stories eventually intersect.
Really excellent read.  On par with The Nightingale.  Although the switches in time were sometimes awkward, overall, I did not mind it.
This was the best read this Spring.  I loved the premise and the plot.  I also learned a lot about WW 2 that I previously did not know.
I read at least a book a week, and this is easily the best I've read in years. Beautifully written, a non-formula totally unique story.
This book has many flaws but it had a good climax.<br/><br/>The flaws are:  inaccurate history and the blind girl to be did not seem to be realistic.  She seemed like a girl out of a Victorian novel with the writer not having the excuse of living in the nineteenth century.  Also I don't see how her father would end up being a locksmith if he came from a rich family.<br/><br/>The story about the German boy is interesting a different because I felt some sympathy for him even though he went to a Nazi school(many of my family were killed by the Nazis) because he had such limited opportunity and he was very young.<br/><br/>This book is somewhat like a movie in that it is enjoyable thought it can be slow in parts and I thought some of the plot made no sense(even though I believe all fiction is FICTION I have found much historical fiction that  tries to be somewhat accurate;usually its the movies that make for big changes in history for the sake of the story).
Compelling and worthwhile story of two young people, a blind French girl and a resourceful German orphan boy, who are drawn into the widening conflict of the German invasion of France in the early stages of WWII.  Doerr pulls us into the interior lives of these two while recounting the social upheaval that war brought, but the reader can see the trajectory of the story long before the denouement.  The back and forth in alternating chapters between the girl and the boy at first is engaging but soon becomes a bit predictable.  Still, Doerr is a clever writer and has an excellent grasp of how to drive the narrative and keep the reader engaged.  The chapters are mostly very short and the novel can be read in short bits (on the subway or bus, before sleep at night, on the run) that seem tailored for readers today with (ahem) shorter attention spans or time.  This novel also seems tailor made for the inevitable film---"soon to be a major motion picture..."
After seeing this book on the top of the best seller list for a year and learning that it won the Pulitzer Prize I decided to read it.  The plot was interesting and different.  The author's prose was poetic...which was probably a factor in the high praise the book received.  Initially, I found it odd reading his prose-style; and so I read it slowly to appreciate it. But I didn't like the ending ....as many other readers have written. Also, one has to be mindful when reading the chapters because he jumps from one year to another...backwards and forward and backwards.  I also didn't like the fact that the author used nouns as non-nouns. (My High School English teacher would not be very pleased with that.) Example: He used '"cataract" incorrectly as a verb on page 11. But what do I know....Doerr received a Pulitzer and was runner-up to the National Book Award with this book.
A haunting, gripping, poignant tale of the lives of two children & their families; one in France & one in Germany; in the years before, during & after World War II. Marie-Laure is growing up in Paris with her father who works as a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. When she loses her site at the age of six, her world changes but with the help of her father's models she learns to manoeuvre around her neighbourhood. In the meantime, Werner is growing up in a small home-like orphanage in a mining town in Germany. He & his sister discover the joy of radio & Werner learns the craft of electronics by experimenting. His skill will propel him into a very different life than that of his father; who died in a mine collapse. When Paris is occupied by the Germans early in the war, Marie-Laure and her father escape to Saint-Malo. There, both Marie-Laure & Werner's lives will meet & change forever. I loved this book & the feelings & thoughts that it provoked.
Enjoyed reading this book so much that I am reading it again. Interesting and well described  locations with poignant details of WWII.
This book is very deserving of its accolades, the Pulitzer Prize and all.  I couldn't put it down, which was fortunate because the author chose to write it in chapters that jumped from year to year and from character to character.  Perhaps this is off-putting to some readers, but I was only nominally disoriented by it.<br/>Mostly, the novel is a fascinating presentation of real life experiences of ordinary people on opposing sides of WWII in France and Germany.  Everything is crafted so well that you are right there with the protagonists and understand how and why the course of events unfolds as it does.<br/>Uniquely, the main characters are children who grow into teenagers over the course of the novel, and we get to see the run-up to war and how war affects them, their families, and towns from their viewpoints.  Over the course of the war the main two characters come closer and closer to intersecting--suspense!  You will be glad you read this book!
I guess I'm the lone dissenter.  I simply can't read this book.  It must be me.  I see how many 5 star reviews it has received, and the critical acclaim, so it must be me.  Finally, on my third try to get into the book, I gave it two solid morning hours, with coffee in hand, feeling fresh and attentive.  I had previously started it as I typically start a book, before bed, but it jumped around too much, so much, my gosh, chapter five ends on page 9 for crying out loud.  The chapters alternate between two characters, so every page or two the author takes us to a completely different story line.  Not only are the chapters too short, the sentences are too short.  Often two words.  Often.  And for me, starting a book or even a newspaper article for that matter, with a bunch of description before I know who or what we're talking about has never worked.  Too bad, because I'm in two book discussion groups and they will both be discussing this book without me.
This book is a little, okay way, outside of my usual fare which runs heavily towards the science fiction and fantasy side of things but on a whim I gave it a try and I'm so glad I did.  I loved the characters, the setting and the plot but I think what really makes this book work is the subtle style of the writing.  Somehow it has a quality to it that reflects the tale it tells.  A little suspense, a little mystery, and a lot of beauty and love as well.  These disparate elements are woven together in a very magical way and for this lover of fantasy this was all the magic that was needed.  It is true that it takes a while for the story to really get cooking but it held my interest throughout and when it things got to the crucial parts of the story I was reading while I held my breath.  So sad it's over, now I'm looking for something new and thankful for whatever it was that got me to read this in the first place.  I highly recommend you do the same.
amazing, intelligent, thoughtful, creative. an incredible work of art, so beautifully written and crafted.  Every chapter: beautiful.
For those who wish to learn of lifestyle in Europe in the years of World War II when a belligerent Nazi Germany went on a rampage and succeeded in occupying much of Europe this is a significant read. It traces the lives of a German male youth , who has electronic skills, but lives in a coal mining town in which industry he is expected to serve but because of his skills he is absorbed and brain-washed into the Nazi youth programme and a blind French girl about the same age whose father is a curator of a museum in Paris, which the Germans captured and occupied early in the War and from which the family fled. The deprivations, misery and futility of war are never better illustrated and the ultimate restoration to a somewhat civilized society in the aftermath of the War is encouraging. The insight into the character of the girl who grows through life blind is heart-warming and one can appreciate the sensitivities of such a person. A great book.
Read with a book club! This book shows how deeply and lasting the effects of war are on everyone it touches, plus, amazing survival.
I loved this book. I really like the way the author tells a story, and the characters are unforgettable. Marie-Laure is my new hero.
Incredible story of the world seen by a blind girl who draws out the adoration and the humanity of a solider in the conquering army.
Mr. Doerr has written something that is unusual, and very engrossing.  Much of the story is told from the perspective of a blind French girl as she relates her experiences during the German occupation of France.  She moves from a safe and warm life to a new different life to a life full of danger and fright.  The other primary narrator, a young German boy, who is selected for a Nazi school for the gifted, moves in the same pattern, from safe to new safe to fright.  A third narrator, a German officer, relates the story of his search for diamonds, jewels, art and collectables for the Party.  How all three they finally connect is a finely and carefully crafted piece of literature.  What was unusual was the use of thoughts, particularly for the girl, to move the plot along.  I first said "Oh, come on" but gradually became totally engrossed and ended up entranced.  I didn't want the book to end but, when it did, I was totally satisfied.
Best read for me this spring. Every chapter was a perfect short story. For a story of the appalling tragedy of war and the fates linked by voices in the ether, this book has a delicacy and detail that makes it strangely gentle. We meet people living on the very edges of their nerves, but they are described in such clarity that we cannot help but feel with every one of them, as they move gradually towards their various fates.<br/>The denouement was almost more moving than the episodes leading to it.<br/>I was moved frequently and was captured and engulfed by this strange story.<br/>In these days of WiFi and cyberspace we have almost forgotten how radio waves began it all and led to the communication forms we have today.<br/>Congratulations to Anthony Doerr! I will now look for more of his work.<br/>MYy only negative comment was that I read it on my kindle, and now miss being able to put the book on a shelf with beside my favourites.
Couldn't put it down. Really liked it. Don't know if it is historically correct, but it was a great book to bring on a long flight.
This is a book that will haunt you long after you have reluctantly finished the last page. Although it did take me little while to get into this book, once it enveloped me, I was captivated. The story follows the lives of two children whose lives are radically changed by the outbreak of world war II. Werner, the German orphan whose talent for fixing radios leads him to the brutal Hitler Youth Academy. Marie-Laure, the blind French girl who, together with her beloved father, are forced to flee when the German army occupies Paris. Both have to face significant physical, emotional and existential challenges as the war invades every aspect of their lives. Ultimately the divergent paths of their lives collide in the last frantic days of the collapse of the German occupation. This is a tale of human spirit, our choice of response, the co-existence of  goodness and brutality in the same space ...  This is book for your 2015 Must Read list!
I read the Kindle version, so not sure if the paper version is any different. My reason for choosing the Kindle version is I can carry it with me everywhere, so I can keep reading including into the restroom, while I'm in line at the grocery store, while at a bar or restaurant that might be too dark for reading actual books, etc.. The Kindle is lightweight and back-lit  so I can read anywhere, even on my front porch.<br/><br/>This is the first book I've read by Doerr, and what an introduction! He puts you right in the heart of the action almost for the get go, developing his characters in a precise manner, and creating scenes so you really feel, smell, and see in your mind's eye where you are from each character's viewpoint. I could barely stand to put it down!<br/><br/>There are so many well written reviews here that I decided not to go any further with mine. Just know that it's been one of the best books I've read this year.
Pulitzer prize...NY Times best seller.  Amazon top seller.<br/>So, how can I NOT rave about this book.<br/>Alas, I cannot.  I really, really wanted to like this book.  It certainly had the setting (WW2), the characters (brilliant orphan boy who loves and protects his little sister;  blind girl who dearly loves her father; WW1 veteran uncle suffering from PTSD, the hulking giant who protects young Werner, poor Frederick - totally living in the wrong place at the wrong time...and more). But, somehow, the story does not come together.  Yes, the boy does "something good" during the barbarity of war.  And the girl does the right thing with the cursed jewel. They persevere, as do most of the other characters. There are other story elements that paint a different picture of war. But, well, perhaps it was because the story seemed to fizzle out at the end.  Closure.  That's it. I was looking for a different closure.  Oh well....
Beautifully written, this book deserves every bit of praise it's received.  This is one of those books I purchased because of all the amazing reviews and then frankly put it aside because I wasn't sure I was ready to read another book about this subject matter.  That was a mistake because it is an entirely unique take on a time period, told with such heartbreaking beauty that I was captured after reading the first chapter.  That's another thing, the format of this book is unique in that each chapter is only a few pages but instead of breaking the flow of the story, this stylistic trick keeps you interested and only heightens the experience.<br/><br/>I loved the characters, I particularly appreciated learning about the perspective of the young German boy and although the outcome was inevitable, the author's ability to bring these people to life and the actual sweetness of the writing, kept me glued to the book to the last page.
The beginning is a little difficult to get through...but, once in...it is compelling and interesting. You root for the characters!
This is an extremely well written book that tells a very poignant story of 2 different children whose lives are shaped by the events leading up to and and culminating with World World 2 in France and Nazi Germany.  The story is brilliantly told from the perspective of each child (a young blind girl in France, and a young German orphan in Germany), and is interwoven through time and dates until the two main characters cross paths.  I found this book very hard to put down even though the subject matter was not easy or light.  I often wondered about how people could be sucked into a belief system that seemed so warped, but this story gives a realistic portrayal of people without choices.  I would highly recommend this book for a discussion group because there were many different levels of this story. The title of the book is a good place to start as "seeing" is more a state of awareness than viewing the physical world.
Highly recommend! I couldn't put down my iPad, I was so stuck on finding out more. This story is well written. Throughly enjoyed!
Beautifully written story. It was a book that you just wanted to keep reading but at the same time you want to put off finishing.
A beautifully written novel about loss, resourcefulness, kindness and courage set against the final days of the Second World War.
Could not leave this alone! Mesmorizing. I could not get anything done until I finished this. I would highly recommend this book!
Amazing writing. I so enjoyed reading this book. The clarity of the descriptions, the compassion you feel for the characters, the intelligent way Doerr uses symbols without overdoing it,  the tense story--there is so much to feed an avid reader here. Doerr uses familiar words in new ways to create vivid descriptions. A shell is "a forest of spikes and caves and textures; it's a kingdom."  A big gun fires, and "the walls of the hotel toll like a struck bell." A girl calls a diamond "a piece of light from the original world. Before it fell." I found myself turning back a page and rereading a passage just to enjoy its beauty. The story gets pretty sad in parts, and I wished for better things for Werner. But that is what Doerr wants us to understand. Werner's is not the only life that fails to achieve its potential because of the war. "What you could be," indeed. I will read this book again.
This is one of the very best novels of 2014.  The story of a blind French girl and a young soldier in the army of the Third Reich should not be missed.  Anthony Doerr alternates his chapters between those dealing with Marie-Laure and her family's support of the French Resistance and those dealing with Werner Pfennig's duties in Hitler's army.  He also--at least early in the book--moves back and forth in time.  These two strategies may be off-putting to some readers, but persevere.  The chapters are short and often superbly-crafted.  There are passages to be pondered on nearly every page, and there is a satisfying sense of fullness and completeness to the story.  My longer review of the novel may be found at https://jlauckhouston1.wordpress.com/2015/02/28/children-of-the-light/, but here I will simply say, buy it, read it, and enjoy it.  A lot of us are going to be talking about it and remembering it for years to come.
Wow! My own memories at the beginning brought whispers of the familiar although I was only a youngster when my father and his brothers were directly involved in World War II. This journey thru the fall of one of the last German bastions along the French sea coast is mesmerising. The characters are clear and engaging. One gets to know and care for them each personally, "enemy" or not. The settings and the developing story centering around a diamond and its legend are close to being genius in the telling. Thanks to the progression of great leaps back and forth through time we find what each central character has meant to the other and to the story. Every thread is woven into the tapestry of history so that all seems to yield a perfect fabric with no stitch out of place. The author begins with a few tantalizing threads and the magic of his research bring the reader to a nonstop "can't put it down" experience. Again, WOW!
I loved it from the beginning to the end and there was a lot of pages. Door kept me engaged throughout the entire book.
The book has won the Pulitzer. Everyone knows a synopsis. My quibbles are: there are times when I think the children use slang and terms somewhat anachronistically. The author tries a little too hard to make us emphathetic towards the Germans, especially the soldiers, despite how young they were. In the end, some very memorable characters are created. It will be very hard to forget Marie Laure's father and his models of Paris and St. Malo. Who could forget Uncle Etienne and his housekeeper?  Etienne's first trip outside?  And of course, the relationship between Werner and Fredrick, though as commonplace in a German WW II school as in a British boarding school was very well developed and poignant, even if a bit trite. And the reading of Jules Verne during the siege?  I think it's a novel of what it means to be curious, to be alive and engaged with the world, and for the very great risk one must take to confront evil.
I don't even know how to begin to express my utter love of this book. If you miss this one, consider it to be a tremendous loss. I re-read the reviews just before writing this review and I actually cannot add a single thing:  all positive reviews expressed every single one of the things I would say. The story itself is mesmerizing. The way the story is told is magical. I highlighted so many of the author's 'passages' that I would be unable to select any for this review. I visualized, I FELT every action, every thought. I loved the back-and-forth chapters from one main character to the other. I wanted to know where this would all end, but at the same time I found myself FORCING myself to go slowly (which was painful) because I did NOT want the story to end. It will take a lot for me to read anything else this author has written because I cannot fathom how any other story could possibly equal let alone surpass this one.
Perceptual clarity dominates the pages of Anthony Doerr’s Award winning novel "All the Light We Cannot See" as Doerr unlocks the barrier of two exceptional characters, Marie- Laure and Werner, whose cultures have separated them. With Saint- Malo portrayed as the final focal point of isolation, Marie-Laure and Werner find themselves during WW II cut off from the world they know and come to discover the world they cannot see. Providing the point of view of two children, who are forced to mature beyond their years due to circumstances, the author guides the reader through the winding roadways of self-discovery. Doerr enables the reader to follow easily the path of the characters as they search through the darkness of war and maintain the compassion needed to survive. His attention to intricate details and his intertwining structure of story-telling provide a light that permeates the darkness of human history.
Enjoyable to read but disappointing ending. I flipped to the last page and couldn't believe that it was over. Seemed unfinished.
I liked this book and appreciated that it was not sugar coated with a totally happy ending.  Instead, it was very reality based.
Doerr writes with a flowing, flowery style, and he is very talented in that his smooth poetic style is consistent from the first page thru the last -- all 500 pages of it.  He has also painted a picture of how war affects the 'little people', the average citizen who is forced to a point in their life where they must kill or be killed.  But the content, the "romantic" story that is at the heart of this tome, is very weak at the end.  We know from the first that the boy will meet the girl.  But at the end -- they spend less than a day together!  Huh?  I slogged thru 400 pages for this?  What a letdown!  Doerr needed a good editor who could have trimmed 100 pages from the middle of the story and built up a more satisfying and romantic conclusion. Also, a much shorter book with greater emotional impact on the effects of war on the average person can be found in the moving 'My Life' by Chin and a US writer.
This is a fable masquerading as an historical novel. There is a fairy Princess (a blind and noble Resistance fighter) and a fairy Prince (a good and noble German soldier) and a fabulous, immortal diamond, complete with curse. And of course an evil Villain who will stop at nothing to obtain the Treasure. Plus a host of supporting characters whose models you can find in any number of tales from the Bros. Grimm, first and foremost a friendly Giant. And all of it cleverly tied together like an intricate puzzle, going back and forth in time, as the pieces are gradually assembled in the reader's mind.<br/><br/>If you are looking for deep character studies and a morally complex narrative, you are looking in the wrong place. But if you want a page-turning roller coaster ride through WW2 on the way to final Victory, something along the lines of War and Peace revisioned by Jean Cocteau, then you won't be disappointed.
Definitely a page turner and hard to put down - so very well written which keeps you enthral led from start to finish.
Spoilers:<br/><br/>I liked it.  I did.  The prose was beautiful.  The way Doerr finds the connections between people on either side of a war.  He doesn't give any side a pass.  There are good and bad to be found.  The war brought out he best in some...the worst in others.  Part of life is just moving us along without feeling like we have a say in anything.  And as the book moves towards the climax...I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  As I could see where the strings were leading and how it was going to tie up, I was fascinated.<br/><br/>And then, call me optimistic, but I wanted them to live.  I wanted them both to live.  I wanted it to MEAN something...all the years and battles and darkness.  Why can't they be together?  I want the version where Werner lives.  He deserved to live.  I know...I know everyone deserves to live, but we read and watch to believe that sometimes people live.  And live well.
Beautiful story. Marie-Laure a blind girl trying to survive as best she could in occupied France when all those around her are slowly disappearing. A parallel story of Werner, an orphan who gets roped into Hitler's Youth. Essentially Werner wasn't a bad person but his knowledge of radios got him his job and he was powerless to stop what was going on around him. There seemed no way out for him. Eventually their paths collide and Werner has a chance to do something good. That's a very simplified summing up of the story! The dates do jump forward and back a lot so keep an eye on them as this can cause confusion. At the end of the war the story jumps forward a few decades and then another few and rather than tying up loose ends I think this just dragged the story out unnecessarily. I'd rather it had ended at the end of the war. Another reader perfectly described this story as light and dark in occupied France.
The novel is luminous - read it yourself.<br/><br/>The Audiobook reader is AWFUL!!! Detracts from the beauty of the language.
I LOVED this book. so beautifully written and the 2 story lines that eventualy interweave are spellbinding. I recommend to all.
All I can say is this - read this book! It is beautiful! I don't usually read a book twice, but this one deserves another read.
Loved the writing style, loved the story.  A human look at the toll of war on all.  An excellent portrayal of the human spirit.
This WWII story looks at both sides of a very controversial issue.  On the one hand we hear from Marie-Laure, a blind girl from Paris who is forced to flee her home when the Nazis invade.  She and her Father seek refuge with her great Uncle Etienne.  Her Father disappears and she is left alone with her Uncle.  They both begin working for the Resistance.  At the same time, Werner, an orphan living in a children's home with his sister, is chosen to be educated in a special German school.  He is groomed to be a radio technician and operator.  As Werner grows up, he becomes very conflicted about his allegiance to Germany and his part in the war.  These two stories are told in a counterpoint fashion, back and forth from the two main characters.  Anyone with an interest in the many sides of World War II and the people who had first hand experience living through it will find this book to be a real page turner.
This is a great book for a couple's club.<br/>It is hard to find a book to appeal to both<br/> men and women.  I plan to suggest it to our group.<br/>  The time is WW2 and the sites are Germany and occupied France.<br/> Werner is a brilliant German boy and Marie-Laure is a<br/>blind, exceptional French girl. We see Werner as<br/>his Nazi youth group is taught to kill and hate.  Meanwhile, in France<br/>Marie-Laure is being reared with gentle love and a deep appreciation of<br/>knowledge.  We have parelle stories, one about Warner and one<br/>about Marie-Laure.  We wonder through most of the book if their<br/> paths will cross. .  Doerr writes well and the timing of this book is good.<br/>  It holds the reader's interest from beginning to end.  The one thing I did<br/>not like was the final closure. Doerr updates all of the main characters to the future.<br/>Some people may like this.  To me it It felt tacked on. There was a good and natural ending.<br/> Just leave it alone.
"All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr grew on me, and then, it became unavoidable. Once this story about WWII drew me in, it would not let me go. Initially, catching on to the alternating narration about the German mechanical whiz-kid and the brilliant Parisian girl nearly exhausted my patience as a reader. In time, the author's storytelling gift persuaded me to persist. I felt increasingly curious about how the life and war stories of Werner and Marie-Lauren might eventually intersect. As their parallel tale of survival approached a collision course, keeping me glued to the book, it did so without resorting to convenient plot devices. Doerr deftly unfolded and molded a suspenseful and uncontrived, romance. He avoided telling his readers how to feel, which has made me toss away other books. Doerr's story is one that will make me think, and then return to thinking about, for some time to come.
This is lovely story both makes you ache for those who endured WWII. Characters are beautifully drawn, with the stories of Werner the young German private with a scientific bent for radios, and Marie the young French girl who is blind but comes from a family with intelligence and wealth, alternating throughout the book until they are brought together at the end. Some reading may not like the alternating stories, but I think it works wonderfully well! These characters are not meant to share any part of their lives until the end, and there, what they share is both sweet, life-changing and heart-breaking. The secondary characters are great, too! The writing is full of sensory details, perhaps partly as a way to express how Marie (who is blind) experiences the world, but also to bring the reader fully into the scenes witnessed by the characters in this very tense time of history. Very glad I read it all!
WWII. France and Germany, but opposing forces. Well, not so much forces, but real people caught in the individual fights for personhood during a conflict that could sink most souls to selfish protectionism. Some sink, but others find relationships that help carry them through the dark hour and the darker hour and the darkest hours.<br/><br/>The hero is incredibly intelligent, and I enjoyed his thrill in physics and electromagnetics. The heroin is very intelligent too, but leaning on others until she has to find herself, if she ever can.<br/><br/>Some parts are too realistic (war in its cruelty). However, the Doer steers clear of blatant, useless carnage and violence. That which he uses is necessary.<br/><br/>The characters are people whom you would really like to get to know, to sit with over coffee and croissant, and learn how their crushing experiences moved them forward for the rest of life.
Sometimes I read a prize-winning book and can't for the life of me figure out what was so special about it. But this book stuck out from early in as easily being one of the best-written things I'd read in years.<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See is a beautifully-written book following the young lives of two people in pre-WWII and WWII. One, a blind French girl, learns to adapt as she escapes Paris with her father to an occupied town by the sea, and another, an orphaned German boy, as he's sent to a brutal nazi military academy and joins the war on the side he doubts is the right one.<br/><br/>A synopsis really doesn't give this novel justice though. It's the vivid writing that was really amazing. Doerr manages to take description from the perspective of the blind girl or discussions of radio waves that really caused me as the reader to feel like I was experiencing the novel in a personal way.
This book jumps through time, space, and perspective, but the reader is never lost or confused.  I thought it was captivating.
I loved this story.  Beautifully written and gave a picture of what life was like for everyday citizens in Europe during WWII.
I was drawn to this book by the setting both historical and geographical.  WWII Normandy is a place in history that is matched by only a few others in this world in its effect on peoples' emotions.  The history of a continent has played out on its shores and its farmland.  Yet it is with two juxtaposed main characters that the author tells a story that is almost a metaphor of that history.  More than that, though is the fact that the story is eloquently developed and the characters are skillfully drawn and they are touching in their own individual ways.  Events unfold for and become apparent to the reader in an easy way that belies the complexity that went into the development of the story's time lines.  In fact, Doerr has done a truly phenomenal job of using time in his novel and one really has to read it to appreciate it.  I can recommend this wonderful book to anyone without any reservation.
Uses the perspectives of different fictional youths in world war 2 to depict war times with legends, solemn, captivating read
Fascinating and intense. The author vividly painted beautiful pictures with his prose but I found the story to drag on a bit.
This is an interestingly different historical novel set before, during, and after WWII in Europe. Characters are captivating, plot development very interesting, narrative very well written. The author is an excellent expositor and makes the reader feel almost a part of the story. It is fun to follow the twists and turns, impossible to guess what's coming next. Often dark but not unexpected, given the known history of the war. Excellent insights to what it was like living there when everything was happening. Only slight negative is the difficulty following the story when the author jumps back and forth across the timeline. After the first few jumps, however, I got used to it and could see what he was doing and kind of liked it, but eventually it got a little difficult to follow the story line. The ending was both expected and completely unexpected! I'll want to read it again in a year or two.
It was wonderful. The characters and plot are so well developed and fascinating. Not at all predictable. I was ill, so I read this constantly and finished it in three days. The chapters switch back and forth between the two protagonists, which I didn't mind at all. It kept the pace of the book exciting. Some readers don't like this, but if you know this from the start, it is only a plus.<br/><br/>The mood is certainly suspenseful, but also, thoughtful, dark and hopeful. I wish we were allowed to check more than one description in this category, especially for such complex works. While the mood was certainly dark -- it's during WWII after all -- I never found it depressing.<br/><br/>After all of this, I thought the ending a bit flat, and was surprised and disappointed by this. It may not bother others.<br/><br/>In any case I highly recommend this book. It won the Pulitzer, by the way.
The Amazon Review states  "Does the world need yet another novel about WWII?"  the answer is of course ... Absolutely !!  Mankinds memory is unfortunately much to short..  George Santayana (December 16, 1863 – September 26, 1952), was a philosopher, essayist, poet, and novelist. He is quoted as saying.. "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it"  Terrorists are wild eyed people who do unspeakable things with hate in their heart... they are easy to spot... Nazis were worst than terrorists.. They were sane intelligent smiling people who loaded people on to trains and transported them to internment camps where they were methodically killed.  They attempted to wipe out a class of people whose ideas were different than theirs.  Their ideology was like a cancer that starts out small and grows until it kills its host.. which in this case is the planet earth.
Excellent novel by Robert Doerr about a blind French girl, Marie-Laure  and a bright German boy, Werner, caught up in the insidious web of World War Two. The book has very short chapters that alternate over time between the lives of the two characters. The girl is fascinated with marine life and the boy is gifted in radio electronics. Their lives are intertwined via the radio from the time they are children- before the war begins. The boy becomes skilled at triangulating radio transmissions and spends the war years ferreting out resistance broadcasters. He finally, inevitably arrives at St. Malo in Brittany and saves the girl's life. She lives on, but he dies in the war. Thirty years later his friend and assistant receives a package of Werner's effects from the United States. He then returns them to Werner's sister, Jutta, who then searches out Marie-Laure bringing the story full-circle.
Magical book.  The style of writing is both complex and accessible.  You will fall in love with and root for the characters.
This book is so descriptive and detailed and just an amazing book to read. It captured my imagination from beginning to end.
Very confusing for me jumping from present to past time periods.  Dragged in a lot of places.  I did not care for this book.
I would give it a 6 if I could.  Beautifully written and draws you into World War I l Europe in a unique and powerful story.
This is an amazing book.  Doerr weaves together the stories of two young people during WWII connected by "things we cannot see:" radio waves, thoughts, what's inside our heads rather than space and time.  A German boy, plucked from an orphanage in a mining town, creates radio triangulated transmissions for the German army that allow them to pinpoint Allied snipers.  A blind girl in a French town in the path of the Normandy invasion, makes her way through her world with the help of miniature towns her father has created for her.  The boy remembers the radio broadcasts of the girl's eccentric uncle.  None of this does justice to the carefully woven plot tied together in chapters alternating between the two protagonists. Doerr's range of knowledge and imagination is staggering. I was glad to see it in Norwegian in a book store in Trondheim.  It deserves an international audience.
We visited Brittany recently and I had no idea when I ordered this book that All the Light We Cannot See is set in Saint Malo. It was an added bonus to this intriguing, well written novel. You know how a reader is always drawn to a novel where the setting is familiar . . .<br/>Peppered with young characters at the start of World War II, the story twists back and forth between a young soldier swept up in Hitler's army and a blind Parisian girl fleeing the German advance with her scientist father. The story is laced with intriguing natural history, the technology of early radio, as well as the Resistance efforts of the older French citizens. Although I believe Doerr did not intend for this to be a young adult novel, I would be quick to put this into the hands of most teens. All the Light We Cannot See also merits strong consideration as a high school class novel.<br/>Such a good read!
I did not want to order this book for my Kindle reader.  I passed it by for months, writing it off as "just another boring war story."  But every time I went on to Amazon to find another book, there it was with its intriguing title.  So I gave in and ordered it, and I am so glad I did.  The writing is so descriptively beautiful that it actually transports you into the story.  I could see, smell, hear, taste pre-WWII France.  It felt like a comforting, wonderful place, even as I was reading about it being torn apart by war.  But not only is the prose of the book engrossing, it also has a really intriguing plot that kept me reading feverishly to find out the conclusion.<br/><br/>If you love to read and really enjoy a story that takes you so deeply into the pages that you have to shake your head and take a moment to resurface when the real world intrudes, this book is for you.
In light of its recent win for the National Book Award, I might be coming late to the party in calling this a masterpiece... but this is a masterpiece. From start to finish, concept to execution, first page to last page, Doerr weaves a narrative whose complexity and elegance is outshone only by the delight and satisfaction one derives from having read it. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The prose is magnificent, the story is beyond compelling, its characters are rich and round, and the pace is agonizingly tantalizing. It's truly a delicious, exquisite, profoundly rewarding novel well worthy of the National Book Award. Easily among the best three books I've read in the past 10 years, All The Light We Cannot See is a must read and worthy of placed alongside Catch-22, The Things They Carried, The Sun Also Rises and so many others in the Pantheon of great literature. Read it.
This was such a wonderful book! The author did a fantastic job of portraying what life was really like for young, German soldiers who joined the Reich back in the 1940's. Also, what it was like for the people who tried to survive just living their daily lives. I love that fact that it was so easy to become emotionally attached to a young soldier who was assigned to a team that regularly killed people first and asked questions later. The village has been totally restored and a person could actually go to France to see it, even though the story is nonfictional. I would recommend this to anyone who loves reading historical events that actually took place, ie, Germany's take over of France and the consequences to those who lived during this time. Also, it covers, in a most beautiful way, the relationships of the people involved and a mystery surrounding a large, blue diamond. Great book!
I adored this book. Like many other reviewers before me, I hesitated to read another book about World War II but couldn't help myself. Maybe it was a the hope implied by the title All The Light We Cannot See. My heart ached (still aches) for Marie-Laure's and Werner's experiences and my brain was dazzled by the sensory descriptions that make me long for the beach and the company of my family. The jumps in time throughout the novel were a little disconcerting only in the sense that I wanted to linger with a particular story thread but the writing was so captivating I found myself enjoying each character's perspective. Anthony Doerr hints at the myriad of stories that wars spur and obscure in chaos. Perspectives that I otherwise would not be privy too were illuminated beautifully and were true to the harsh realities in life that we all must cope with and would be better to understand.
I have so many friends who loved this book that I jumped to buy a copy. I'm not fond of long books written in the present tense, but I thought the book would redeem itself in spite of my bias. Alas, it was not the present tense that put me off, nor was it the fact that the plot hopped between two characters, one in France the other in Germany. Rather, it was the structure of the book itself that was unnecessarily confusing. The book is broken into 13 "parts" titled by date, that are further broken down into "sub" chapters that hop between the two characters. Ok, so far so good. But why, then, were the "parts" out of chronological order? For example, Part Six (8 August 1940 is followed by August 1942). In Part Six the character, Bernd, dies. In Part Seven, two years earlier, he is alive? What's the point of this? A good plot damaged by poor editorial choices.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The author brought his characters to life in a most vivid fashion.  I felt I knew each of them intimately.  I am one to want closure.... in a book and in life.  I am left hanging in the end...wondering how the story really ended because of gaps along the way.  That left me uneasy...but no less uneasy than the characters whose stories were never quite completed .  They were left with many questions and gaps.  The whys and hows were not answered...just a puzzle with a few missing pieces.  What a terror to live in days of war, where so much fear and unknown abounded.  Their entire lives were shaped by that time.<br/>As a side note, i didn't realize until after I had finished the book and read the author's biography, that he lives in Boise....which makes me all the more interested to read his other books since I am from Boise as well ( Eagle, Idaho).
I definitely have written a review re this book in the past....Hats of to your fabulous customer happiness representatives!
I would recommend this book to anyone. Excellent. Told this story from different perspectives than other books i have read.
Just finished this today, 8/10/15 so it's fresh. It is incredibly well written and the amount of research must have been exhausting. So many details of WWII that I never thought of and actually a fresh perspective  - a blind French girl, a young German brother and sister, and those involved with them. I found the amount of detail perfect. I never felt overwhelmed or wished it would just move quicker. If you don't like detail, this book may bore you some. But the author gave you their world and this was reality for many. The pain was fresh and dug into you. I wanted to scream decisions being made but that's when you know the book has you by the heart.<br/><br/>I do wish the ending has been different. The unknown questions were frustrating for me but very realistic, real world. You don't get things wrapped up pretty and part of true war is you never know. I allowed this to be.
A blind girl in Paris and a young and innocent Nazi recruit who is expert at putting radios together come together through a very exciting and intricate set of circumstances. The characters and the environment are depicted deeply enough that you feel comfortable and familiar just before everything gets jostled into another place by the war. And these two main characters get closer and closer to actually making contact in a most interesting way. I especially loved how her grandfather prepared her to navigate in her world, just in case something happened to him. His model of the house they lived in, the neighborhood they lived in, and then the mystery of the water in the bay which had no model to go by were a puzzle to those watching and an interesting contrast in how the senses protect and enable us to survive. I have read lots of WWII based novels. This is one of my favorites.
Well told story of two teenagers in WWII; one a blind girl in Paris and the other a poor but very bright blond German boy.
Can it imagine being blind and alone during a war and her courage and determination<br/>Very good read from  another view
A great story of the tragedies of war. Well written, great vivid word pictures. Fascinating French perspective of the war.
A fantastically written novel. If you liked The Book Thief, you will like this one. Not the same at all, but similar feel.
This one of those rare books that draws you in with the language and holds you there with the plot. Best read of the year.
A very cogent,insightful and emotionally moving novel. I read approximately 40 books annually and this is one that I could not cease reading once begun. My paternal great grandmother was French and my paternal great grandfather was German and my father and father in law both served the United States heroically during the war, so this was especially meaningful to me. Previous reviews(from other readers , NY Times,Washington Post, WSJ. etc) can probably better express the character development, literary and historical value in greater depth - which I thought was superb- but for pure enjoyment of those who love to read and explore/ learn about European lives during WW ll, this is first class all the way....and the only book of 2014 that I have read and taken the time to comment on due to it's excellence.
This is a fascinating story, very enjoyable to read. The ending did not satisfy though. But I highly recommend the book.
Could not put it down.Will look for other books by same author.Reason I chose it  all the five star reviews it received.
This is one of the best books I have ever read!  When I put my first Kindle bookmark in early in the book I knew it was a winner, because I never do this.  I proceeded to put in bookmarks whenever I was struck by beautiful phrasing and images, and I have many.  This author has written an amazing book with compelling characters and and an important story about a war we must not forget.<br/><br/>I normally don't like to read stories about WWII because they are so sad, and I carry that sadness with me for many days after I am done reading the book.  This book is different.  I was left with an appreciation of the love the characters had for each other, the ways they showed it, and the light they carried.<br/><br/>We read this book for our book group and had one of our best discussions so far.  It was fun to see what others found that I hadn't.  Wonderful!
Marvelous work!<br/><br/>I would recommend it especially for writers as the wave of author's creativity will hit your brain cells and pump up creative powers of your own. Abundance of unique language and metaphors made me read some pages over and over again. I even took notes. That's why it was a long and slow read, entirely worthwhile.<br/><br/>Werner's death brought me down and I was quite sad that Marie Laure never sees her father again. Now if I returned  to the part of the book where she sees him for the last time I would certainly cry. While reading I lived in  hopes of happy end but when it comes to war, once the things get bad later they get worse. That's what I overlooked. Author doesn't speak fairy  tales here because there have never been fairy tales about war.<br/><br/>Read the book, let it amaze you, involve you, let your senses erupt.
This book was fabulous.  If ten stars were available I would give it ten stars.  It is so beautifully written.  The reader is left with wonderment and sorrow but it was so true to the subtle evils of that period.  I felt I was there, and experiencing the war torn community that the author introduces us to.  The characters were so real to me, trying to cope with the hideousness of war.  WWII always makes me think of the concentration camps and the millions of Jews, disabled and gay people who were slaughtered.  Or I think of the Pacific zone.  I have read so much about all of WWII.  This book brings reality to us in the every day lives of people who were fortunate enough to survive and live through the hell of war.  We need to remember them also, their hunger, their destitution, their terror and their coping through humor to minimize the fear and anguish.
'All the Light We Cannot See' is one of the top ten most beautiful books that I've ever read (in the company of such works as The Book Thief and Les Misérables). It is not just another war story- even on the most superficial level, its plot is infinitely more complicated than that of most stories set in World War II. Yet on a deeper level, it is an extremely human story, one showing the terrors of war and fighting. I think that (aside from the unforgettable prose) its best element is in the character choice and development- portraying war from the perspective of a young soldier on the side that one normally doesn't see and from the perspective of a blind girl is a stroke of genius. I bought this thinking it would be another well-written love story, but nothing could have been farther from the truth. This is a human story, one that I will not soon forget.
What a beautifully written book. This book is a recommendation for our book group for the upcoming year. What a wonderful read. The story of WWII involving two young individuals. A blind 12 year old girl and a brilliant orphan who becomes a Nazi. Each chapter is devoted to one of the characters. The relationships of the girl with her gentle loving father and the boy with his equally amazing sister were so wonderfully written. You knew these two individual would be tied by some type of connection and you wanted to keep reading to find the connection. Such and intriguing novel. I really became so absorbed in this story. I enjoyed Mr. Doerr'e style of writing. Somewhere I read that it took him 10 years to write this book! A difficult era in history seen through the eyes of children. Amazing! For some reason I  kept thinking of Sarah's Key while I read this.
I don’t usually read historical novels. I try to avoid the ferocity of war if I can. But I read this story and loved it. The tale is told from two sides, Werner, the young German radio “savant” and Marie-Laure, the French girl who is blind but never hindered in her progress through life. Their stories join at the end in a sweet way.<br/>The story is warm even when the descriptions are cold. I loved the characters, even the ones I hated. I can’t wait for the day I read it again.<br/>On the bad side, this story was like a typical relationship. It lures you in, makes you fall in love, and then when you want more, it peters out and leaves you wondering why. Maybe it just ended at the wrong place for me, but I felt as if near the end, after the two meet up, the writer was told “Okay, you have ten minutes to finish up.” But it was beautiful while it lasted.
I really loved reading this book. Skillfully moving the story along by alternating between the perspectives of the two main characters, the author gives us a vision of what living in Europe during World War II did to some of its most helpless victims, in this case, two children. On opposite sides in World War II, by circumstance rather than choice, the children experience different, but equally nightmarish, situations. Especially poignant for me was the author's description of what life was like for the young boy in Nazi Germany, drawn into a horrendous fray not of his own making. Equally poignant, and to me miraculous, was the way the young blind (not a spoiler) girl negotiated her way through the streets first of Paris and then of Saint-Malo. Slowly and steadily, the paths of the children move towards a convergence that left me in awe of the characters themselves and the author who conceived this story and told it so well. I highly recommend this book.
I loved this book! In my opinion it was very well written, multi layered, very creative, and is one of the best historical fiction books about WWII.  This book took the reader through WWII through the perspectives of a young blind French girl and an orphaned German boy. It showed the humanity of each while illustrating the shared casualties of war. Juxtaposed against the Nazi brutality was the love, care, compassion, and commitment that many characters extended to each other. It also made the point that not all Germans were in agreement with the Nazis, that some were plagued with increasing doubt or plagued with continuing guilt. By setting several scenes in the school for young Nazis, the author was able to show how these young boys were usually desensitized. Overall, I found this book to be not only of human nature but of war's effect on human nature.
Mr. Doerr, the author, had to familiarize himself with SO many subjects so he could describe them in the amazing details -- from being temporily entombed with no light to wiring a radio to learning to 'see' Marie Laure's world to the little sea creatures.  The richness of these details is what drew me back to a second read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly both times.  I had sworn off books about WWII, so it took me a while to pick this up.  I hated the violence of the school and their radio-destroying job, but it was an integral part of the story.  It is a book that will stay with me a long time.  However, I have one question/criticism -- the lack of linearity. For my part, I would have preferred having it follow a time sequence, especially since the author is telling the story from multiple viewpoints. It bothered a few of the other book club members too.
EXCELLENT,lovely, captivating, enchanting and horrifying. All of the ways one could describe growing up in France or Germany in 1938-1944. Doerr allows us to experience the innocence and degradation of life for two parallel individuals, coming of age at the pinnacle of WWII.<br/><br/>We share in the difficulties, beauty, discoveries, sorrows, loss and renewal and learn much along the way. Radios and art are not the first two things I think about when I hear the words Nazi Occupation, but they are much more understood now.<br/><br/>The book is written with elegant descriptions, so the reader might experience, not just see the words on the page as if describing for someone who is blind.<br/><br/>The story is at times difficult to follow as the reader is viewing two lives simultaneously, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. I love this story.
excellent....read it many months ago and still think about it everyday.......still on best seller for a good reason....
Very slow moving.  I kept waiting for something spectacular to happen but it never did.  I wouldn't recommend this book
A close up look at WWII - very personal from the lives of teenagers on both sides.  War will never look the same again.
So beautifully written. Doerr expertly weaves together two riveting and engaging stories. Best book I've read all year.
Wonderful novel and wished it wouldn't end. I wish I could give it a  but it deserves a 10. A novel I will not forget..
This is a wonderful book. It has much in common, stylistically, with Kate Atkinson's Life After Life, another five star book, imho. All the Light... offers a masterful and dizzying amount of detail: painstakingly researched and conceived, it is rich beyond normal in offering its story of the intersection of two young lives, by chance, during the second world war. Its point, unlike Atkinson's novel, is to suggest how wonder and innocence have power to connect, mend and endure. Atkinson's book is more a meditation on choices and chance, and what we do about them. These are oddly suitable companion pieces; both are deep and imaginative, asserting narrative structures that fight against any sense of continuity but the one the author wants the reader to see, thus keeping us aware, always but not didactically, of the big questions the authors are exploring.
It was difficult to describe the mood of this novel in one word. It was nostalgic because of the time setting, yet suspenseful, thoughtful and hopeful at the same time. There were dark and light hearted moments, irony and angst as well.  Had "All of the Above" had been a choice, I would have checked that one. It is not a short book nor is it an action novel, but I still could not put it down for long until I finished it. The characters are so well developed and nuanced that they literally jumped off the pages into the room as if I knew them all personally.  One could easily identify with both the good and bad in the characters The steady pace towards an unpredictable denouement is enhanced by the author's skillful use of going forward and backward in time without the reader getting lost,confused or bored. All in all a quality read for anyone.
If you're looking for a novel that will appeal to men and women both and of every age, this latest novel by Doerr is the best thing I've read since CS Lewis’ _Till We Have Faces_. It really is that good. All the Light We Cannot See is about three children growing up during WWII, a brother and sister from Germany who have grave misgivings about Germany waging war, and a blind French girl whose country is of course devastated by it. I read a lot of books and dislike the vast majority of modern novels. This one is truly exceptional. A great story told by what is perhaps the best wordsmith I've ever encountered. In fact, if you're an aspiring writer wanting to learn how to write, forget all those silly how-to books and just read this novel. If you can’t learn how to write, and write well, after reading this book, then give up. There’s no hope for you.
Actually 4.5 stars, pulling it down a bit since I found the 2 page chapters bouncing between characters annoying and distracting and sometimes a time shift would make me lose the flow, but, this is one of the most powerful books I have read this year - solid descriptive writing -lyrical in many places - great characterization and an interesting and powerful story. Tracks WWII and its effects on a brilliant German lad whose life becomes entangled with a blind French girl and ties together their live's tracks together in the present. A rare diamond forms an interesting subplot that in most author's hands would overwhelm the story, but in this one, it seems to rest in the background and dealt with as necessary. Surprised that the girl did not share the boy's actions with his sister which had me scratching my head but other than that, a worthy read.
Anthony Doerr is an excellent writer.  He develops characters so well that leaving them during and after reading is a loss.  He captures feelings that real people must have experienced.  I have a greater understanding of why we call the generation of World War 11 the Greatest Generation.  We are indebted to them for our freedom.<br/>Doerr does not write his story sequentially so it can be confusing and you ocassionally find yourself rereading for better comprehension.  Write the dates down so that when you begin another chapter you have an idea where the character's lives are.  I reread the very beginning as soon as I turned the last page and "got it!"  When you finish the book you understand why he did it this way.<br/>The quality of writing and story make this a definite reread.  It's one of the best books that our book club has read!
It was a great novel, however, there were some quirky underlines that I did not appreciate as part of the entire book.
The most beautifully written, poetic language enveloping a gripping and touching story. I highly recommend this book..
I look forward to reading more of this talented writer's work.  All the characters are now firmly etched in my memory.
I think that this book is one of the best of the century. The author (Mr. Doerr) describes Marie-Laurie (a blind French girl) as a true blind girl. In other words, he shows you what the world feels like from a blind French girl's perspective. Then there'so Werner. You'do expect him to be another "Nazi German boy" with one goal: to rule the world and live as the top class amongst Hitler. Mr. Doerr tells the reader how in Germany, 1937-1945, there was a lot of propaganda about how all the Americans and British would stop at nothing to destroy the "Aryan" race. How during that time, how everyone wanted to survive. Mr. Doerr describes war as it truly is: bombs flying over innocent civilians' heads, guns firing off in the distance, children crying I don't want to give away to much of the book. I would highly recommend this book.
What an amazing novel written about 3 children during World War II.  One is a blind girl in Paris who live with her father who is the key master of a big museum in Paris which has many priceless items.  The others are two orphans in Germany in an orphanage.  Marie, in France, learns to get around the city and helps the resistance party.  Werner and his sister Jutta live in the state run orphanage in which Werner will be sent to the coal mines (where his father perished) when he turns 18.  But Werner has skills, like taking wires and batteries and making radios, etc.  He becomes an important individual for the Reich.  At 16, he's told he is really 18 and is sent to the war front to help locate the people who transmit to the non Nazi forces what is happening.  Very good book.  A just read for anyone interested in the background of World War II.
Begins in Jacques Cartier’s home of Saint-Malo, Brittany, France as the island fortress is about to bombed into oblivion. Having begun near the ending the book retraces its steps to document the lives of people resident on the island at the time. There are two principal characters, blind Marie-Laure, daughter of a museum curator in Paris; and Werner who with his sister Jutta is a German orphan. It seems to be out of fashion to tell a story from beginning to end these days. This one jumps regularly from childhood memories to adulthood and points in between and from place to place. Somehow it is easier to follow than most I’ve read lately. What is most poignantly evident here is the utter futility of war and the unspeakable things people will do to survive. Living or dying is random. The story is well told, the content can be rather harrowing.
A captivating story of two teenagers (3 if you include Jutta, Werner's sister)--a German orphan boy with an extraordinary gift for math, radio waves, and radio components, and a blind French girl with a devoted and detail-oriented craftsman father. The French seaside town of Saint Malo is another major character, sitting high above the Atlantic ocean behind centuries old ramparts. The Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, and its galleries, collections, and one special gem in particular figure prominently and contrast the impulse to share and know the natural world with the Nazi's determination to plunder it. The two young people develop a bond through a love of art, science, and stories that are told through the radio, that allow them to dream and imagine and learn and escape. Beautifully written, with unforgettable characters and suspense.
This is one of the best books I have read. In the last five years I have read about 80 books on my Kindle; this book is easily one of the top five. I absolutely love it. The writing is outstanding yet not overdone. It can be subtle or descriptive and can paint a scene well. Much of the story takes place in Europe between 1939 and 1944 as the war progresses.  Although the reader is introduced to a number of people, two young people stand out: Marie-Laure, a sweet, intelligent young girl who has been totally blind since she was about five; and Werner, a tender-hearted young boy who is very gifted mechanically.  Ironically, I do not like books about war, but although this book happens to involve war, it is really about what choices one might may or not have and what we hope to value. This was one of the few books that I cried when I read it.
The story is so well-written that you feel as if you are there with the characters; experiencing the pain and despair of the children who lived in Germany and France during WWII.  There were times when I didn't  want to continue reading for fear that the next page would describe the inevitable end of one or more of the characters. But, as soon as I had that thought, I knew I had to read on and not abandon them. The lives these children lived weren't just a story, they represented real-life children who survived, or didn't, and just because being confronted with the horrors of war isn't something I want to do, it is something I needed to do.  After all, if they could live through it, I could certainly read their story. And, like the title of the story, if you don't stay with it till the end you will not find "all the light we cannot see ."
What a great book. Please treat yourself and read it. You'll love it. It's a literary masterpiece. A very great read.
One of the best written books I have ever read. I could have highlighted every paragraph. Enlightenment for the soul.
I felt I heard voices from the War years that had never been heard and never be forgotten. Everyone should read this.
Vicariously living through years of war wearing the hearts of children is a profound experience. It is a growth experience.<br/><br/>This is not just a story about a blind girl, although shallow readers may claim so. Others will tire of the gritty demands of wartime survival and never discover that it is truth and goodness left to soldier on.<br/><br/>There is also an oddly reassuring insight into the power of modern communication--if one can wiggle beyond the devilment so often spread by it. The author invokes Joseph Goebbels to remind the reader, "It would not have been possible for us[sic Nazis] to take power or to use it in the ways we have without radio."<br/><br/>The end of the book left me pondering the breadth of today's communications' challenges...praying our children grow wise to its wiley coyote ways.<br/><br/>  Addie
Lots of beautiful imagery used throughout the passages, which made for a powerful read. I enjoyed the way Mr. Doerr wove together the characters, depth & waves of time, light, history and elements of the planet. It gave the book an ethereal quality. I particularly liked the development of certain friendships especially Madame Manec and Maurie, Frederick and Werner, Volkheimer and Werner, Etienne & Maurie, and Werner and Maurie. The book really came together for me in the last 20% or so.  Until then I found it a bit slow and hard to stick with, which is why I only give it 4.5 not 5 stars. I also found the imagery to be a bit over-done at times, yet still skillfully employed. However, this is now one of my favorite WWII novels, so different from others I have read. It is a timeless story, one that will be just as powerful decades from now.
Wow! Reading this book took much longer than most books I have read in the past year.<br/>I had to take a break occasionally to visualize the characters, the scenes, the deprivation and devastation, the violence and the sometimes simple kindnesses.<br/>This was a very different perspective on war, alternately told by a young blind girl who had to leave her home to escape the war with her father and by a young German soldier.<br/>Though the story was somewhat tedious and too wordy, I enjoyed the "growing up" of the characters from naive and sheltered to aware and resilient, Mari-Laure, and  Werner, optimistic and excited to jaded and resigned.<br/>It will take a long time to forget the horrifying images of war as seen through the eyes of a young soldier.<br/>It will be more pleasant to remember the life that Mari -Laure lead.
The quick "summaries" of this book did not do it justice.  I was not drawn to reading it until it showed up on so many "Best Books of the Year" list from so many sources. It convinced me there must be something to it, and there was! It's not just another WW II story, it shares how the Nazis created their soldiers from children, it takes you into the world of a blind child, it has well developed characters, a mystery element, lots of history , and two strong story lines. It's the bouncing across the story lines but more the bouncing back and forth in the time line of the story lines that made this a 4 star for me. At times it confused this reader to the detriment of the flow of the book. My only other complaint is drawing out the ending too long and past when it adds to the story.  Despite those few flaws a great read, highly recommended.
A beautifully composed account of what it had to be like to live inside the horrors of Nazi occupation.  The telling piece to this book is exquisitely detailed along with the imagery and description of living inside a devastating war.  At times I could not put down the book but other ,because of the way the author changed characters, I was confused and had to retrace my reading in order not to loose track.  Each chapter is quite short and switches the story.  It's simple to follow but at times I found  coming into the story from more or less the side door made it confusing.  This is the sort of book that reaches deep inside to cause the reader to FEEL what it must have been like to exist in that sort of time with those sorts of constraints that usually crushed the human spirit.  Many died but a few survived despite the stains of tragedy.
I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  I know it won a Pulitzer and it's extremely well-written, but it's difficult to slog through.  First, I'm a little tired of the alternating chapters device--can authors do anything else any more?  It's to the point of cliche.  In this book the device actually kept me from moving forward.  Because the chapters are very short (3 or 4 minutes each) and each chapter follows a different character or timeline, you don't have time to get involved with a storyline, before you're at the next chapter, which you know won't carry that storyline any further.  So it's very easy to put the book down.  That being said, the book is worth reading.  It's a good and interesting story and as I said before, it's very well-written.  It's just that in this case the author's chosen style worked against the book for me.
Beautifully researched and written. And, it should have been top drawer. What it missed was story "links" Those special joiners that help you move with the story's intentions. It almost fails.There were times when I felt I would give up reading it.<br/>The key people are a little girl...blind, and a young man destined for greatness in the scientific field. Their lives are gradually (very slowly!!!) brought together. But this is WWII and we know that in war, everything is in jeopardy. Both their lives are dragged down into the abyss.  The threads, when imperceptibly pulled in one direction, get, for me anyway, tangled and confused. It's as thought it was more important to make a good job of editing...rather than story telling.  However, I would suggest that if your focus is on exceptional language skills...this will be for you.
I've read some of the other reviews, and all I can add is, this was wonderful.  I've bought books that were highly recommended, got great reviews from the critics, etc., and I thought they were terrible, either obscure or otherwise unreadable.  But not All the Light We Cannot See.  I enjoyed every minute of this book, sad parts, tender parts.  It all hung together so beautifully, like a well designed quilt, all the colors next to the right colors, all the patterns next to the right patterns.  I lived in these characters.  I breathed through them, felt the room temperature through them, felt their hope, joy. and resignation.<br/>This is not a World War II novel.  It is a novel about people that happens to be set in World War Two, which then accentuated their issues.<br/>This was an amazing achievement.  Congratulations, Anthony Doerr.
The world loves this book. Reviewers describe it as both accessible and literary, but they're only right on the first count. Overall, it is so tightly plotted and predictable that it seems manipulative, and the writing is generally just workmanlike. Only in the last few chapters does the book really soar — it could have benefitted from less structure and more daring. This is a book that feels like it was written with one eye on a movie contract, and I suspect that the movie will be more engaging than the book.<br/><br/>If you want an easy, interesting, feel-good read, this is the book for you. But if you want to read a book that explores the darkness and complexity of World War II, with all its accommodations and grays, and that has a historical sweep ranging from the Eastern Front to the English Channel, read The Tin Drum instead.
I almost didn't buy this book because, through the years,  I've read many books regarding WWll and am always saddened by them but, because it was by Anthony Doerr, who is so very gifted in every aspect of writing, I did get it and am so glad. There were, of course, some parts that were very hard to read, I'm thinking mostly of the training that the gifted young man had to endure, but they were an important part of story and necessary. The emphasis is on the story of two young people, the girl is French (and blind) and left alone; the boy is German and unusually gifted with creating or locating and fixing the many mechanical and technical problems with equipment used in the war effort. The chapters alternate between the events in their lives as the war nears its end. I will be recommending this book to my very picky book club members!
I don't want to comment on this book as I think it is more a statement about my own lack of taste and outmoded expectations. I like upbeat books with happy endings. I love to laugh. I hate flash-backs and flash-forwards unless held to a minimum and clearly indicated as out of time sequence. I find alternating chapters about various characters annoying. I like a clear story line. I found little to like in the above things in this book. I did like the way the main characters were painted as their personalities were well drawn, and I was attracted to or repulsed by them as was the author's intent. Description, for me can be overdone, and I begin to skim-read where I find it. There was some of that. It is a long book I think I might have liked better as a Reader's Digest condensed book, perhaps. Many chapters were short - I liked that.
The writing here was just amazing and so beautiful and I truly loved this book!  Although the plot was very intricate, it was easy to read because of the short chapters about alternating characters at different times in the past and present.  As expected, their paths crossed at the end and I loved this style of writing.  Each chapter left you with a beautiful, almost poetic ending to think about and I couldn't wait to turn the page to continue.  The many emotions portrayed in the book were heart wrenching and the characters were developed brilliantly.  It is a depressing and painful book to read but I didn't want the book to end.  It will be a very long while until I read another book as wonderful as this one. I highly recommend reading it!  This book is truly a gem that comes along very rarely just as the gemstone in the story.
Anthony Doerr skillfully weaves the stories of two individuals until they intertwine in a final emotion-filled moment. Although a bit difficult to follow in the beginning because of the time shifts, it was well worth the effort extended to get into the story. By page 100, I was hooked and read well into the night. When Werner and Marie-Laure finally meet, the reader is transported to the culmination of so many building events in the lives of these two separate characters. It was truly a wonderful tale. The author did a fine job of developing the characters and building suspense. He faithfully painted the war, all while presenting loads of information about various things like radios and birds and shells. It was a hauntingly beautiful story which I will happily re-read in the future. Loved it so much, I bought a copy for my parents.
Absolutely wonderful, remarkable, truly a gem. This book deserves a spot on the shelf beside all the other classics.
I would give this book four and a half stars if I could. This is a beautifully written book that is so vivid, it was as if I was there in Saint Malo with Marie-Laure, or beside Werner and his troop of Nazi soldiers. There is no doubt the author is talented and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So why not five stars? Well, because the build up of this book was so grand before I read it from its reviews, I was hoping for a more memorable ending. It was not a bad ending and wrapped up the story nicely, but I kept waiting for something that never came and then the book ended. I don't know what I was expecting, and without giving any of the plot away, the story ends with the characters merely fading away rather than any big bangs or surprises. But don't let that thought get in your way. This is a wonderful book from an incredible writer.
Magical mystery tour of war and hellish circumstance through the "light" of a young heroine filled with modest determination and patience. As a reader I felt pulled into the narrative, that I was a character in the story, that I had purpose in helping or guiding by reaching into the written word as if I too could touch the light that we cannot see. I loved 'everything' about reading this book--the images, the sensations; it was as if the heightened senses brought about by blindness affected me, too...and the closure. The improbable closure was so 'comforting.' In the face of turmoil and unrest, to relax within the completeness of understanding--the bigger picture, the impact, the significances of details seemingly ignored or lost, and then to have them recognized accordingly. Wait. I'm going to read it again, right now...
I am filled with joy when I begin to read a story like this book.  It is such a rare pleasure.<br/>It's the reason why book lovers read.  To find a gem between pages.<br/>The present world retreats and we are drawn back to the horrors of WW11.<br/>However the main characters and their day to day lives weave a path that we want to follow.<br/>Werner and Marie-Laure are children, innocent, caring and wishing to learn what their hearts desire.<br/>Their destinies are intertwined.<br/>I wish to travel to Saint Malo and walk the streets and remember that boys, men, families passed long before us today in that place.<br/>It remembers the innocence of Werner, the German boy with hopes and dreams of all youth.  It mourns with all.<br/>That such sorrow, tragedy strength grew from such horror.<br/>Life is a precious gift.  Enjoy!
Bring them on. I read them all!<br/><br/>It reminded me of “The Book Thief”, but that book is more stylish and ingenious. Not that “All the Light We Cannot See” doesn’t have its merits. Quite the opposite. You can only admire Doerr’s ambitious project to put together this well thought story. Of course it is compelling. Of course his style is engaging. It is suspenseful. It is dramatic. It is depressive and hopeful as is the trend. But eventually it became a little bit too conventional for what I was expecting.<br/><br/>This is a quick reading. Doerr goes straight to the point. The chapters are short. In the first 30 pages, I thought I was reading a collection of short stories.  If Doerr’s objective was to write a great anti-war book that is also enjoyable by anyone (including your readers), he was totally successful.
I could not put this book down, even though some parts of it were heartrending.  I even resorted to skim reading and skipping a few of the most horror filled descriptions, especially the brutalization of the boy soldiers.<br/><br/>I persevered because Doerr created people who are so magnificent in their love and courage that I needed to know their whole story.<br/><br/>I know this is fiction, but as with all really good historical fiction, he uses these fictional characters to speak truths.  Truths such as: love can exist as young Werner shows whilst undergoing the most brutal conditions in the boy soldiers academy ; and even the least powerful people can resist evil, as Etienne whilst still suffering from shell shock of WW1 manages to help the resistance fighters of St. Malo.<br/><br/>Tender hearted descriptions of a parent's love such as Marie-Louise's father bathing her on the night before he leaves St. Malo and her fore the last time, continue to shine inside me as I go about my mundane duties.<br/><br/>The light of these shining spirits illuminates some of the darkest memories of the Nazi crime.
Just finished this book last night and it's still hanging with me.  Unique in many ways.  What else can you say about a 24-hour love story that lasts for decades?  I'm a WWII devotee, so the premise and setting of the book was right in my wheelhouse.  Having said that, I wouldn't characterize this as a war story per se, but more what war exacts and demands from those who are drawn unwillingly into it.  Surprising ending that was not entirely satisfactory in that some important stones (no pun intended) were left unturned.  Wonderful  character development...you care a great deal about the two protagonists and those who orbited about them.  I actually found myself experiencing some genuine emotion as I made my way through the last few chapters of the book.  This is one I'll be thinking about for some time.  Highly recommended.
This is one of the best books I have ever read! I first listened to it on CD (from the library) and was so blown away by the story line, the unique structure of the novel and the beautiful writing that I just had to purchase a hard copy to keep. I will re-read the text soon, as I am sure I missed a lot on my first listen (while driving in my car). The story takes an unusual view of of life in Occupied France during the later years of the Second World War, as well as giving a very personal view of life in Germany.  It does this through the "eyes" of a blind French girl and a young German boy, detailing their parallel lives. experiences and inevitable meeting just before the war ends. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys  a well crafted novel, wonderful writing, and.an unusual look at the second world war.
I adored this book for about the first 80% and was convinced I would give it 5 stars, then recommend it to everyone I know. Given the time in which the book was set, and the circumstances the characters faced, I was by no means expecting a blissfully happy ending and was braced for that possibility.<br/><br/>However, after the death of a main character (and I totally respect the author's right to do that), the remaining chapters and ending just felt scrappy. In addition, the blurb seemed to emphasize the convergence of two very different lives: in fact, this made up only a small amount of the action and I'm not sure it left either of them significantly changed.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it was still a powerful, moving, informative and memorable read. I would love to see this adapted as a movie, ideally with a crisper ending.
Very interesting. gives a different outlook on the situation during WWII<br/>A bit of a letdown towards the end...
This is one of my "top ten" books that I have ever read.  Words cannot describe how wonderful this book is.
My favorite of 2014. Beautifully and tenderly written, a great tribute to love, hope, perseverance, and resilience.
This book was excellent.  The best book I've read in years.  Very well written.  Realistic, compelling, and moving.
This is a complex story detailing the lives of two children growing up on opposite sides of the occupation of France during WWII. Werner is an orphan who has a gift for understanding electronics and Marie-Laurie is a blind child with a fascination for books, snails, and maneuvering her environment. As the children learn to navigate their worlds, often having to do things that are in conflict with their essential natures, we come to understand what it takes to remain whole in a hostile world and what price may have to be paid to hang on to personal integrity in the face of impossible choices. The lives of the children finally converge and we learn what it is to at once save and be saved. All The Light We Cannot See is a powerful story told in vivid detail with characters you utterly believe. I could not put this book down.
This is an extraordinary, beautifully-written book, worthy of the Pulitzer.  The stories of a blind French girl and a gifted, but poor, German boy are told with deeply-felt compassion.  It is the first book I have read that places a sensitive, caring boy into a school that churns out boys for the Hitler Youth.  It is a fascinating perspective as the reader wonders how far Werner will go towards the darkness swirling around his homeland.  He is swept up into the Nazi regime.  Marie-Laure loses her sight as a child and her father does all he can to protect and educate her.  As the war swallows him up, Marie-Laure is forced to burrow deep for the strength she needs to survive in Nazi-occupied France.  The connection between Marie-Laure and Werner wrenches your heart.  Such a wonderful book...can't recommend it highly enough.
This is one of the better books I've read in a long time--really engaging, even enthralling. It interweaves a visceral realism about the experience of war and deprivation with an almost fairy-tale ethereality as the narrative moves rapidly between the stories of two very different characters, each both believable and sympathetic. The short chapters make it a fast read and the writing is truly beautiful, even poetic. I had trouble stopping for breaks: I didn't want to leave the horrific and beautiful world it describes and was compelled to find out what was going to happen. Although written in the third person, the viewpoint is highly personal but also clinically detached and carefully observed. I can understand why it took Doerr a decade to research and write. Truly a well-deserved Pulitzer winner, and highly recommended.
I had read Anthony Doerr's "The Shell Collector" and was amazed at his writing (hard to describe -- you must experience it). HOWEVER, I was not prepared for this novel. The magic begins on page 1 and flawlessly carries the reader from Paris to Germany, in the company of characters you come to consider as friends -- unforgettable friends. Doerr weaves a story beautifully, not to diminish this, but it's in the telling of the story that his sentences work their charm.<br/><br/>I almost didn't read this book. Thought I'd read enough about Nazi Germany, France during WWII. Rising above the conflict and tragedy of war are these wonderful characters who show us about relationships, hope, long-suffering and especially love.<br/><br/>No doubt, Anthony Doerr is a highly gifted writer.<br/><br/>Joyce Norman<br/>Author
To be honest - I had a somewhat hard time getting into this story. The first 50-70 pages made me feel like there was too much going on and too much going back and forth between characters I had no attachment to yet. However, I figured there was a reason so many people have been raving over this book...and they were correct. I tend to be an extremely fast reader but this is the first book I've read in years that made me want to slow down and savor every word and moment of this book.<br/><br/>Anothony Doerr's ability to paint a picture is amazing. His words were almost soothing. The story did move slowly but I felt it built up a pretty strong tension in my gut that most books don't have the ability to do. I was almost dreading the next chapter, dreading the end, in the best way possible. I was pretty sad when I was done.
Another great fictional book of World War Two seen and experienced from two different sides fighting each other. A young girl in Paris going blind but who is taught by her father how to be independent and live and experience life and then they must leave Paris with the Germans coming and escape to the seaside village to live with her great uncle. On the other side is a young German boy who with his sister  lives in an orphanage in a small German town. The boy hasa talent for working with radios to make them work and he and his sister share the experience of listening to distant programs in the night. The twists and turns the story takes for the two young people in the war is cleverly done and  a chance encounter in a seaside village. This book is heart warming, sad and optimistic about the future all in the same story.
What a beautifully written book this was! I don't know why I haven't read it sooner. I really wanted to read slowly to savor the writing but I couldn't put it down. I hated to come to the end.<br/><br/>The author will give you heart breaking feelings for both sides in the war. The characters will touch your heart because you will feel so connected to them. War is not a happy subject and yes, parts of the book are extremely sad. But what a fantastic story this is. I could put myself in the different settings from the great descriptive writing of the author. I could see the sunflower field, hear the music, taste the bread, smell the sea... I seriously loved this book.<br/><br/>This is a story that will forever be in my mind. It is one of the few books that I want to read again. I highly recommend this excellent book!
Two disadvantaged young people, a German boy and French girl, do extraordinary things during WWII without becoming special anywhere but in our hearts. The characters are drawn on the first half of the book and the plot takes off in the second half.  I looked forward to my nighttime reading to see what happened in the story and with the characters.<br/><br/>There is a lot of symbolism in the book for those who like to figure them out.<br/><br/>I would say that the only problem I have with the novel is that sometimes the blind girl didn't act blind.  She wasn't wary enough in strange circumstances.  She didn't struggle enough with obstacles or picking things up without toppling or breaking them.  There was no sense of the unease people would normally feel around her.  It's harder to be blind than the author portrays.
"All the light ......" is an excellent tale woven together through the lives of several people who's stories provide a micro view of the rise of Nazi Germany, it's  invasion, occupation,and ultimate defeat in France during World War Two. These earth shaking events are viewed from the street level, or "street feel" in the case of the blind young girl protagonist Marie-Laure.  Werner, the other main protagonist is a bright German youth whose morally conflicted rise through elite military electronics training finds him hunting down radio transmitters operated by the French resistance in the same French seaside town where Marie-Laure has fled from the Nazi invasion of Paris. The development and convergence of their's and other's stories are skillfully drawn to keep the reader well interested to the end.
Poetic! Absolutely mesmerizing. Couldn't wait to read it every night and sad to see it end. A richly written book.
Subject and body of book poignant, but ending sort of petered out and not very satisfying. Read something else. RT
I really wish I could give this book 4.5 stars, because I really liked it, all the way up to the last few chapters. The writing is beautiful, the language is complex and precise all at once. Doerr creates unique voices for his characters even through minimal dialog. He maintains an exquisite level of tension throughout the story. Incredible.<br/>The only reason I would subtract half a star is because of my personal taste in endings. This whole book was full of fantasy and magic and I would have liked to see it end a few chapters earlier and leave some of the details of the resolution up to my imagination. I know that poetic justice is "right" but sometimes I like to hold a grain of hope for characters who have truly changed.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing.
Honestly, I do not know how to rate this book because I was trying to read it in the beginning with too much concentration but, somehow, it never worked out for me. In the middle, when the conditions around the characters got really gray shaded, still somehow, that element of something worthy will turn up kept me attached to it. than to add it in the ending, Werner's death and certain twist in the story really took me by surprise because I was not really anticipating this sort of ending for it.<br/>I think, this is where the normal readers imagination of happy ever after comes into the equation.<br/>read it, if you have the patience to read such huge works of literature.<br/>my rating : passable read<br/>it is actually a book which you keep wanting to read but on the other hand just cannot wait to finish it off.
Lately I've read several enlightening WW II novels which I enjoyed more than this one, despite some of the fabulous reviews.  It is an inspiring story of different characters humanity and survival under most difficult circumstances.  Chapters are short, which allows a change of character or location throughout the story. It has a great deal of descriptive passages, which I think might have been enhanced with a few illustrations, like a "map" of the city at the opening of the book, or of the replica of the house and city her Father created with secret passages because she was blind; or the grotto or the home near the sea where her uncle lived with secret rooms to hide from the Nazis.  The author definitely has a writing style some will enjoy, others will not, and uses symbolism a lot throughout the story.
Very engrossing with many themes. We had a great book club discussion. Would recommend to book groups in general.
Couldn't put it down until the last page.  Characters that are haunting, that live on after the book is finished.
I had to read slowly and take time away for lighter reading along the way to completing this book.  I'm from the Next Generation following WWII.  My Dad fought as did most of the men, long family Friends.  I've always felt such confusion as to how a Country of People could be so controlled by one Evil Man.  After reading Mr. Doerr's book, where boys were taken from home and Family, and filled with hate and in my view a lot of torture to them as they were treated terribly and led very astray.  The connection between the Blind Marie and the world falling around her, yet her inner strength in a moment in time changed the life of Werner in a brief meeting.  Not a book for the lighthearted but a book I'm glad I did read.  I would recommend reading this book if you are interested in the time of our Second World War.
I found this book to be incredibly rich and beautiful.  The character development was amazing: you literally follow the moral development of the two main characters from a young age until they are almost or just at adulthood.  Anthony Doerr has been truly blessed with the ability to make you feel like you know the characters: there are lots of "Oh!" moments in the book that make you sigh, that make you weep.  The book is one of historical fiction, and Doerr did an excellent job researching Nazi Germany and the French occupation.  Although I've had plenty of college-level history instruction and love historical fiction, I learned that the Nazis essentially brainwashed children from a young age.  I hadn't realized they sent them to youth camps to indoctrinate them, nor was I aware how they were selected.
I loved this book even though it was about World War II. It was beautifully written and her use of imagery was superb.  She knows how to draw her<br/>reader in and weave an intricate tale in which all the pieces fall into place and are intimately connected.  I felt as if I knew all of the characters well<br/>by the end of the book.  I wanted some different outcomes for some of them but realized life doesn't always work out the way one wants it to. Each of her characters were impacted in a different way by the war. She let's you know what their lives became as a result.  The novel gave me an inside picture of what it must have been like to live during WWII.  I ordered the "Shell Collector", a book of short stories, because I liked "All the Light We Cannot See" so much.  It is equally good.
i fought against it tooth and nail but i gave in and read "all the light we cannot see" i admit i'm a nonfiction snob. but it pulled me right in and didn't let go until the very end. the mark of a truly good book is that you want to know more about the characters - the descendants of the original main characters, what happened to them. frederick just tore my heart out and the bravery of marie-laure was inspiring. each character's personality was written large as life - no shrinking violets there. the actions of the soldiers was written in great detail - no question how they felt about it. who was in it because they wanted to be and who was in it because they thought they had to but rebeled in their own little way. it was interesting to read how ordinary citizens were heroes when they needed to be.
Another book set in the second world war, but I thought this one had something a little different to share. The main characters are a blind French girl (Jewish), her devoted father and a gentle and mechanically clever German orphan, whose fate is to be hand picked for an elite Nazi training establishment. The  plot loosely follows the fate of a priceless and possibly magical diamond that the blind girl is to protect for the National museum, but the main interest was really the experience of citizens of an occupied and battered land on the one hand and the numbing assault on morality, arising from Nazi Germany's creed of loyalty to the State and its chilling ruthlessness, on the other. It was a well crafted book, that kept up a good pace and I found it quite moving and sad in parts. Certainly worth a read.
Although many of the aspects of this book truly disappointed me--particularly in the last few chapters--overall I cannot deny that the author is a very talented writer. However, the novel was much longer than it needed to be and I often had to backtrack to figure out what was going on. I'm a pretty bright guy, but I found myself confused in many chapters. Jumping back and forth between characters, locations, and timelines added to my confusion. The reason I gave this book four stars was because I truly felt a connection with the main characters. Events at the end of the story really made me sad. If you're looking for an easy read, this is not the book for you. But if you love lush narratives, masterfully written with vivid descriptions and original metaphors and similes, you'll likely love this book.
A wonderfully imagined book about the stories and quite different experiences of a young blind French girl and young German boy whose electrical engineering talent put him in a special military group for the Nazis.  Their paths are parallel and finally join, however briefly.  Every one on the continent during WWII most likely has or had a dramatic story that could rival this fiction.  But this is a view onto several good, brave, intelligent, sensitive, and remarkable people. The prose is beautiful, and the ending chapters are very special. My only ding is it could have been about 100 pages less. After about 250 pages it seems slow and overly descriptive, until things begin to fall in together, and the final chapters. Well worth reading.  This kind of writing is rare today and it is much appreciated.
The Language is exquisite.  He treats the subject of war with a lyrical bent.  Much depth to plum in this book.
The way Doerr uses language in this book is simply thrilling--I kept thinking how much I'd love to be able to write in such a vivid and lovely way.  He let me hear old radio broadcasts and understand why the scratchy sounds were so dearly important to two young children--and a damaged older man.  Doerr lets us watch as a young boy's interest in all things mechanical and mysterious blossoms into a passion.  He puts us inside the head of a blind girl while not letting us pity her; he lets us see the light that her father shines into her darkness.  Yes, the Nazis we see are not especially well-rounded characters; I needed to have more resolution--one way or another--about Werner's best friend.  But oh, the light in this book shoots from many different directions and every time I saw it, it was magic.
This book has a strange spiritual beauty, mystical and poetic, I'd say. Yet it also has plot, characters, and a historical context that move a reader forward and into the heart of Cosmic Mystery itself. There is no political agenda, it is a war story, and I wept to read just what happened to the young boys who were so pumped up to be trained to serve their fuhrer in WWII. The training was brutal! You could be proud, maybe, but would you survive and come out as a human being?  It was good to feel empathy for such experience, the impact of which I could only guess at. Sometimes Doerr's prose is so rich it has to be taken in small bits. Still, it's like deep dark chocolate and red wine—not to be gorged but sampled slowly for its sheer deliciousness. The chapters are short and strong, which is a gift.
While "All the Light We Cannot See" is beautifully written, with a vivid setting and and intricate amount of detail, its over use of switched narrative perspectives made it confusing and hard to enjoy. The narration switches between Marie-Laure, a French girl, and Werner, a German boy, in one to two page intervals. These quick switches are hard to follow and are jarring for the reader. They kept me from becoming involved in the story as the moment that I was enjoying reading one character's story, it switched to the story of the other. The switching narrative perspective also prevented the kind of deep character development and emotion that I wanted. Beyond the basic emotions of joy, fear, and abandonment that lead to growth, there are little to make the characters feel "real".
I am shocked that this book has 4.5 stars overall.<br/><br/>What I like.... beautiful language, interesting characters, and WWII as a backdrop rather than a character. I'd really like to give it 2.5 stars.<br/><br/>What I didn't like...<br/>-flipflopping back & forth between years. It was distracting and took away from the flow of the story. I actually skipped a big chunk of the middle. Once I got into the groove of 1944, I skipped the years leading up to it. If a book can't hold me enough to read the entire book, I can't give it 3 stars.<br/>- The ending. I kept thinking that there HAD to be a great ending. Good HAD to triumph over evil. Life HAD to triumph over death. Without giving away details, the ending left me cold. When I finished, I wondered why I had wasted my time reading it.
Jumping around between characters and timelines was a little confusing and detracted from pleasure of reading.
I found this just ok. The story was pretty interesting but it jumped around a lot. I didn't like how it ended.
It's very interesting being able to be behind the scenes so to speak as Hitler comes to power. The motivation that drives some of the German boys to join the Hitler's youth and others who are forced to be  help with it as he was a POW.<br/> The  French man who's love for his blind daughter has him taking her to work at the museum of natural history. There the scientists took Marie under their collective wing and taught her about their specialties.<br/>  How many of the characters displayed noble characteristics and others the opposite. Whatever a person does may affect others without one being aware of it.<br/> For me the arrangement of the sequence of events bothered me. I sometimes had to look back to determine the time frame  it was in.  Otherwise I would have given it five stars.
You may not be disappointed in this book, but I was.  The author's mechanics of good writing were poor.  Bad punctuation, lack of parallelism,  bad sentence structure, and unnecessary descriptions upon descriptions made me mad at the book.  Set in WWII, almost incidental to the plot, three phenomenal protagonists held the story together.  The orphaned brother and sister were technological geniuses while the blind girl did not let her sightlessness handicap her.  A key, a diamond, a radio, a hiding place and a three dimensional map, each held by one of the characters, were essential to the plot.  I read believing that some tragedies of war would have never happened if these three had met collectively.  They did meet, but not collectively.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Doerr, for a good read.
It was hard to decide on this novel. If you are a person who wants something new and fresh from a plot then this rehash of Nazi tropes with devilish Nazis and plucky resistance is not for you.  The cast of characters reminded me of a Tarantino movie.<br/><br/>However that is also the story's strength. The setting allows for few surprises and that sets the story free to develop the characters as its main theme.<br/><br/>And what a delightful cast they are from the villains to the heroes they are engaging and well drawn with considerable talent and some artifice.<br/>It is not a true reflection of the time or the society but it is a good read by a talented writer. You will enjoy it.<br/>I think it has something for everybody and is a jolly good story, well worth the time invested.
Beautiful writing.  The author has the ability to make you feel like you are right there in the moment, sharing in the experience with the characters.  There are a lot of nuances to mull over and try to understand how it will fit into the story he is writing.  I am so tired of reading poorly written books that try to exemplify our world today as being drug and alcohol ridden, with no hope of redemption!  You would probably want to reread this book a second time so you do not miss the emphasis of the "gem" and the " key".  I am going to recommend this book for my Study Club because it is perfect for much discussion about different characters and situations.  I would highly recommend it for the individual who is looking for a book that will keep you engrossed to the end!
An awesome read with fascinating character development & a plot woven into the rise of Nazism & days of WWII.
I really like fast moving books.  I found this one to be somewhat slow and boring.  I was disappointed in it.
Such a beautiful story.  The imagery and suspense were riveting!  It kept me on the edge of my seat. Amazing!
I found this book interesting, entertaining and informative.  It draws on the world of the blind with its interpretation of the sounds, perception of the state of the surrounding air, and caution for self protection.  The tension in each person's life living through the occupation of France in WWII will always draw us in with the detail of an individual's world.  At the point of hiding in the attic some facts seeme a bit familiar because it was truthfully so in that time period, and yet some of the tension was familiar to me as a senior reader taking me down a different familiar path than a younger reader might take.  I cared about these people perhaps more as representative characters for all those who sought to survive than as unusually strong individuals. There sadly were so many.
This book lives up to the hype. It is the story of two main characters living through WWII in France and Germany. One is blind and the other is a young German boy who ends up in the same city as the girl at the end. I was really impressed with the way the story is told seemingly without  the usual bias against the Germans. The book lets you see Werner as a young boy who didn't really want to go to war, but it was better than the alternative of staying in an orphanage.  It showed extremely realistic pictures of all the characters, some honorable, some not so much, some strong, some flawed, all trying to make it through the war alive. While I have a hard time with books that go back and forth through time and place, this was well done. I will definitely look for Mr. Doerr's other books
Thank you, so very much for writing this book!  At about the last 80 pages i started to feel sad about how it would end and how I would miss this incredible book when it ended.<br/> I don't like books that skip around, unless the writer is a real master of the craft. I found this book to be so well written, is so dramatic and so poetic in the presentation that I can't imagine it could be written any other way .This is because the book is so intense that  you can only absorb so much emotion at one time. Each new small chapter could start with, "and then in another part of the world..."<br/>When I read the last page I sat quietly and the tears ran down, and they are there now as I write this.<br/>Perhaps this is not really a review. It is a thank you note to Anthony Doerr.
Folio Prize nominated book All The Light We Cannot See brings in a different look at World War II. Captivating and a must-read in history,<br/>  Marie Laure lives with her father near the Museum of Natural History where her father works as the master of locks. Marie is blinded at six so her father built a miniature neighborhood map for her. At twelve, the Nazis took over Paris, they flee to the city of Saint Malo. They carry what might be the museum's most valuable and dangerous jewel. In Germany, a boy named Werner is offered a position in Hitler Youth. He takes it and discovers his intelligence. In Saint Malo, his and Marie Laure's story merges.<br/><br/>View this review also at this link: http://sanfranciscotimes.blogspot.com/2015/08/book-review-all-light-we-cannot-see.html
This is a beautifully written novel. The prose is wonderfully lyrical in places and the author has a sharp eye for the perfect descriptive detail. The plot involves a blind girl from Paris and a German boy who is a mechanical prodigy. They both go through numerous adventures until their lives finally intersect during the shelling of the French town of San Malo during World War II.<br/><br/>Although I enjoyed the book overall, I thought it bogged down on occasion. Sometimes there was too much mechanical detail, sometimes the plot stalled and sometimes too much repetition became tiresome. The novel soars toward the end and throughout delivers a subtle message of the insanity of war. Despite a couple of drawbacks, the book is a worthy and deserving recipient of the Pulitzer prize.
As I was reading this book I was saying to myself, "What a beautiful piece of literature!" The characters were rich and deep and the setting was ...well, WW2, Nazis, the Evil, the Innocent, so very good. All I will say is the book is 99% excellent w/ a really poor ending. The last several chapters I felt as though I was reading a different author. It all of a sudden seemed rushed and very unsatisfying. I said to my daughter who also read it, maybe he was having a hard time coming up w/ an ending and his publisher wanted it asap??? I don't mean I was looking for a happy ending or a sad ending, I just wanted one which gave purpose to those beautifully written characters and it just fell flat. A very good read, minus the last several chapters. Those were actually pointless.
This book ranks among the best I have ever read... and that says a lot.  The characters became my family and I felt I breathed, or held my breath, with them.  The historical vignette is poignant and heart rending.  The closest thing to is it "Diary of Anne Frank", but this one is more varied and rich in depth and scope.  I was torn between racing ahead, feeling that I owed it to the characters to be there for them, to save them... and going back again, to re-read a portion of Doerr's magnificent narrative.  I now understand so much more of that horrific period of time in WWII, when the people of Europe suffered unimaginable horrors and yet reached down into their souls and pulled up courage and dignity in the midst of chaos.  The book is imminently hopeful and beautiful.
This is a beautifully written novel that takes the characters through various trials and tribulations as they try to find light among the darkness of the German occupation of France in WWII.  Allusions to darkness and light appear throughout the story, as the author switches back and forth from the view of those who can see what is happening and those who cannot.  Misplaced hope and dreams collide with the reality of war to produce a story that is compelling from start to finish, drawing the reader deeper into the mindset of the multiple characters.  Were I still teaching English, this would be required reading for every student.  Beautiful language and compelling storytelling about war impacts those both near and far from the battle lines.  The Pulitzer team got this one right.
Having recently read "The Nightingale" by Kristin Hannah (which was incredible) I bought this book in the hopes of reading something similar regarding this era. "All the Light We Cannot See" is so unbelievably boring that I put it aside to read another book. Not wanting to waste a book, I picked it up again and made it to page 102. OMG..this is SO boring I doubt I can stomach finishing it. One reviewer who liked the book wrote that she was in tears by the end of the book. Well I'm in tears only one fifth of my way through this disaster....tears of BOREDOM !!!
This is a very fine book and most enjoyable to read.<br/><br/>I have to say right off however, I cannot recall being so disappointed at an author's killing off of a character as when I read this book.<br/><br/>Beautifully written with interesting technique of placing chapters going back and forth between time to keep you in suspense as to what will happen towards the end. The story concerns a young blind French girl and her loving father who is a locksmith at a natural history museum and a young German boy with a knack for electronics and radios and his younger sister who are orphans in the years just before and during WWII.<br/><br/>Very well written; you won't be disappointed when you read this book, except only perhaps that all the characters do not make it to the end.
Of a blind French girl and a German orphan who will bring WW II into your heart like a multifaceted diamond.
Story line was good however flipping back and forth between the characters and the timeline was frustrating.
I found the story a reflective account of the lives of two young people, one French, one German, in the years just before and during WW II.  I did not find the portrayal of the blind French girl entirely convincing; her accomplishments were to be admired but were they, as told, entirely realistic.  Could she have learned the geography of her environment from her father's carvings?  I don't know. The portrayal of the German boy/young man seemed more real--but was it?  I, for one, know nothing of education in Nazi Germany before the war.  He, too, had great native abilities, as did the French young woman.  In all I thought the writing poetic for the most part but believe in certain chapters overly wordy.  The story made one think of the terrible cost of war, its destruction.
A fascinating story of the lives of two people during WWII, and how they intersect. I especially found the diversity of a blind main character refreshing. Thought provoking, historical insights, interesting characters, and beautiful detailed writing make this a good story. For me, the amount of detail, though well-done, and the length of the book give cause for a little restlessness to get on with the events. By half-way through, I wondered if I would ever get to the part it is building toward. It is worth the perseverance if you have the time. The ending was interesting but didn't wow me. I liked seeing the resolution to the character's lives in the future. The best part of the book was getting a feel for the historical period in a way I hadn't seen previously portrayed.
I cannot say enough good things about this book. Doerr does a phenomenal job of transporting readers back in time to experience the true hardships, horrors, and heartaches of World War II, specifically from the eyes of two young people, Werner and Marie-Laure. The character development in this story was incredibly intense-- despite the fact that I finished this book almost a month ago, I still find myself thinking about the characters and tying back in their lessons into my old life.<br/><br/>Literally every word of this book was beautiful. Doerr spends a great deal of the book on descriptions rather than the plot, and while I usually do not like this in books, he did so in a way that made the two inseparably intertwined. I have so much love in my heart for this story.
Yet another perspective of the horrors of World War II.  This time I learned that even the elite Aryan youth were not immune to the cruelties of the regime.  They were constantly in danger of being found weak and, subsequently, beaten, possibly to death, by their peers with the encouragement of Nazi leadership.  I can't say I enjoyed this book.  It was heavy with prose which made it slow reading, and it was hard to become invested in any of the characters for all had their relentless miseries.  Sort of like they all had a crow on their shoulder and were in constant danger of having an eye pecked out.  The light of the conclusion paled to all of the darkness preceding it.  Well written, but for me at least, reading it felt like work.  I was relieved to finish the book.
It's been quite a while since I bought an actual book because I love reading on my Kindle.  But since this was for our book club and even a tiny bit cheaper  than the electronic version I decided to splurge on a hardback.  And I'm so glad I did.  There are so many reviews that will tell what the book is about so I'll just tell you how enjoyable it was to read.  Anthony Doerr's writing is so lyrical I stopped and flipped back a page several times to reread a passage.  I've never heard of a plane's descent as "shedding altitude" but it was so apt!  And "all the light we cannot see" also describes ultimate, total darkness as experienced by Marie-Laure.  I can't wait for others in my book club to finish reading this masterpiece so that we can discuss it.
It never occurs to us, in the narratives of the evils of Nazism, that among those complacent in the crimes of Hitler, were boys of character, curiosity, and compassion. And then, here is Werner Pfennig, a German orphan with a brilliant mind whose very gifts draw him into the machinery of war. Here is Frederick, small in stature, huge in courage, this boy whose interest consists of the gentle study of birds, swept into the drills of inhumane doctrine, yet refusing to comply. Heartbreaking and heroic, All the Light We Cannot See is one of those narratives that astound. With vivid detail, deeply imagined characters, and a plot that is both suspenseful and poignant. Each page delivers a sigh, a shudder, a tear, or a triumphant cheer. This one sinks in.... Wow. Just wow.
A story through the eyes of the young and the blind makes for a unique story of love and loss.  Fantastic.
Am still thinking about this book...wish I could read it again for the first time. Haunting and exquisite.
This is a very beautiful book. Doerr's style is crafted and poetic without being convoluted and confusing. His characters are mythic and powerful without being unbelievable. Even the plot twists and connections between the lives of the characters, which could have come off as contrived, work together to carry the reader along. I can't say it's a happy book, but there's a beauty in every character's sorrows that pulls you into the story. In essence, this is a novel about a blind French girl, a genius German boy, a magical jewel, and the many events and people that eventually bring them together in a besieged town in France during World War II. It's a long novel, but the chapters are short, so I was always finding myself reading "just one more chapter" before bed. 
It felt like I was actually transported through time into the actual souls of these characters. The father is devoted and kind, his love for the intricate crafts of lock smithing and modeling are used to bring the world alive to his blind daughter. Her resilience and eagerness to absorb life and learning are what kept her alive during the onslaught of the advancing German forces. Always finding beauty in her surroundings, as in her awestruck wonder for all ocean creatures struck a chord with me, tapping into that deep place of joy within. There was also magic interwoven with the realism of war, and the beauty of the enduring human spirit that never dies. Tenderly and thoughtfully crafted, this story settled on my soul like a golden sunset lingering on the sea.
I really enjoyed the author's writing, his use of words , his descriptions and the beautiful story he created were such a joy .<br/>I did not want to put the book down.<br/>I am not a fan of skipping from one time period to another, but I bared with it because of his writing skills and the riveting story he unfolded.<br/>however with that said, I was very displeased with the way the book ended. It was a bit confusing and lacked the drama and intensity that was there throughout the book. I find that this happens with a lot of authors with their endings. They try to wrap it all up . Maybe it's because in real life there is no ending, I don't know.<br/>I think the book is well worth reading . It is so well written . I was just disappointed with the ending.
I'm sure my five stars are superfluous to the pile of excellent reviews already written about this book. However, I feel an obligation to say that I consider it extraordinary. Six stars or more. The way in which the author wove this tale from France and from Germany in short chapters—vignettes sometimes—created a novel that almost shimmers with emotion and intelligence. Clearly, he is a writer to be watched and followed. It's been a long time since I responded to a novel with such powerful feelings. And isn't remarkable that someone who was born long after this  brutal world war was finally over is able to capture the tightening vise of the Reich and the daring of the Resistance with such deft, short strokes? Give yourself some time alone to read this book.
One of the best books I,ve read in a long time.  It was a selected to read from a member of my book club.
I loved to hate this book until the end, but it is a story that changes your life.  I'll never forget it.
I have to say that after all the glowing reviews of this book, I was disappointed.  As I was reading it, I was actually having trouble staying with it.  I didn't find the plot all that compelling and was actually bored for sections of it.  I did end up reading to the end and it wasn't that the writer was a bad writer.  It was well written, but it didn't pull me in and keep me on the edge of my seat....I wasn't all that interested in what happened next.  I don't know if that was because I've read so many other World War II stories or if this story just lacked a compelling plot line.  In the end it was interesting...but not something I will remember and definitely not a book I would highly recommend.  I'm still baffled about all the acclaim it has received.
The lives of two young people intersect in Malo, France, during the occupation of the town by the Germans during WW2.  The French girl, who is blind but helped by memorizing her father's faithful reproduction of their streets with her hands, has her own story to tell.  She and her father endured dangerous situations while escaping Paris to a relative's home in Malo.<br/>Meanwhile, the German lad who is gifted in invention and engineering of spying devices, is sent to an elite school for such boys. Much later he is sent to Malo and manages to find the blind girl who has been eluding the German forces.<br/>There are many other events in both their lives that are separate from their final meeting.<br/>I would recommend this book but with some reservation.
I love books that are so beautifully written with plots that carry me away to another world and another time.  This one certainly did and there were times I wanted to read certain passages to someone I thought would appreciate sentences so beautifully written that I was left in a state of awe.  Books written with what feels like a super intelligence, sensitivity and knowledge are very difficult to come by in my view.  It wasn't a book that lifted me up because it was suspenseful and I grew very concerned with the characters ending up being OK.  The plot was so original, the characters so colorful and memorable that I know this is among a handful of books I have read that will stay with me and I am grateful that my life feels enriched by having read it.
Once I started to read it, I didn't want to put down this book because the characters were so interesting and well-developed. Starting at the preface to WWII, the plot follows the life of a young girl in Paris who is blind (but goes to her father's workplace in a museum where she can touch and learn) and a young orphaned boy growing up in the coal mining region of Germany who is chosen for a special training school. The girl's father carves buildings and constructs a miniature version of town to help her navigate her world. Each child has special gifts that help them survive but at a high emotional price. Although fictional, the depictions of life during the war in France, the deprivation and devastation caused by German occupation, and how German boys were indoctrinated to serve Hitler opened my eyes. The author really impresses how monsters can be molded from innocent young promising minds and bodies.<br/>The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I was occasionally confused by the way the chapters jump around: from present to late past to recent past, and they alternate between the girl and the boy. As time progresses and other characters take on more importance, the chapters also center on their lives as various times as well.
Even if you don't like World War II stories, I guarantee there are sections of this book that make it hard to put down. Anthony Doerr is perfect in the suspense he brings to some chapters. He has created memorable characters that will be burned forever in my memory. He does an outstanding job of describing how war affects children, their parents and the citizens of invaded countries.<br/>If I have anything critical to offer it is the way in which he makes jarring transitions in time throughout the novel. Perhaps I'm too much of a linear thinker but I enjoy a logical progression in the plot.<br/>For a lesser book this might have prompted me to put it down unread. However, for this book, there was no putting it down. I was compelled to read to the end.
What made this book so successful to me was how it differentiated itself from all the other books written about the same time period. I enjoyed the whimsical little town models and puzzles created by Marie Laure’s father and the magical realism of the rare diamond hunted by the Nazi's. I believe it was these aspects that helped soften the edges of the stark realities of living through the pain and suffering of WW2 and furthermore gave it a slightly different twist on a very familiar story. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because the passages focusing on Werner’s radio transmissions and triangulation theories bored me somewhat since I have little interest in mathematics and science. Those sections got a little too technical for my taste.
As with all WWII stories it is heartbreaking. But I liked the perspective and the verbiage was beautiful
It's been a long time since I've come across a book I could not put down. Loved every word - worthwhile!
I really loved this book. I find it really odd and amazing that the author could write about the worst of man, wartime, in such a quiet and beautiful fashion. As told from the point of views of a young German orphan and an equally young blind French girl, they live through the bad of war, but the good of life. The relationships of the girl with her fantastic father and the boy with his equally amazing sister were so wonderfully written that you wanted to know them more-and you do with each alternating chapter. I hated to put the book down, but closed it after I turned the last page with a sigh and sad smile. I didn't know how each of the characters would end up, but it was a very good and reasonable ending. I've recommended it to many of my friends.
Really I give this 4 and a half stars!<br/>What is it about?  What is the light we cannot see?  Is it a story about a diamond?  Or a blind girl who sees more than sighted people?  Is it the story of a boy with a talent for radios or a girl who understands snails?  Is it about a boy who loves birds or a giant who sees the love and the talent of a puny classmate?<br/>It is a story of the way different people cope during the horrors of war.  A German boy and a French girl.  What is their connection?  How does it all become connected?<br/>It is a novel of both excrutiating beauty and agonising awfulness. It tells of abject bruality redeemed only by utmost gentleness.  I can only recommend it if you can be prepared for the shocking sadness of it all.
I found it a little difficult to follow initially as the author went back and forth between characters and I kept waiting to see when they would overlap.  It took quite a while....but was worth it.  It approached WW II from a different perspective.  A young orphan boy in the late 1930's in Germany who had a talent for working with electronics, a skill that put him in a special school set up to train the Nazi elite.  A blind young girl in Paris who's father worked in a museum and, when the war reached Paris he was entrusted with a replica of one of a museum's treasurers and had to flee the city with his daughter.  It provided an interesting view of what it was to live at that time when you were neither a Nazi or a Jew.  I would recommend it highly.
The author has a unique writing style - consisting of short chapters which capture snippets of the main characters' lives and which alternate back and forth.  It's almost like snapshots taken at different times. At first this is a bit disorienting - but it comes together when the lives of the young French blind girl and the young German Wehrmacht engineer suddenly converge--to a climax which is both poignant and unexpected.  The writing is incredibly descriptive - almost prose-like.  You really identify with the characters and their situations.  It's a quick and engaging read.  Highly recommended.  I imagine this would make a great movie with a powerful message about the futility of war and what it does to those who are innocently caught up in it.
I'm not a fan of novels written in the present tense - it all seems a bit modish to me - but Doerr would have pulled it off had it not been for all the jumping about in time between bits of the story. Wouldn't it have made more sense to have had the 1944 parts in the fashionable present, the earlier parts in the past tense, and completely ditched the more contemporary chapters at the end?<br/><br/>Also, (I have to get this off my chest, as it is just prejudice on my part, I admit )  the Americanisms kept on reminding me that we wen't really in France. Every time someone sat on the Davenport I wanted to scream.<br/><br/>But I did like the characters and their stories, and St Malo did come alive as a real place at that appalling time in history.
There are so many things I like about this book, but because of the volume of previous reviews I will limit my comments to one theme.<br/><br/>I did not expect "yet another" book about the WWII experience to grab me as this one did.  In large part I attribute that to the story playing out  through the eyes of children.  Each has a different point of view, each is shaped by a different circumstance.  Their lives, while totally distinct, are ultimately, unknowingly, connected.  As they struggle to survive and evolve through crisis they remind the reader how relative right and wrong can be.<br/><br/>The story is artfully told.  Excellent detail provides authenticity.  Tension and empathy keep the pages turning.  This is a very good book.
SETTLE IN for a long read. . . . because the chapters can be very short but the story captures you from the first! You may think you will be able to stop because a blind girl and her father in Paris are not of great interest to you and you don't really care about a sister and brother in an orphan's home but YOU WILL want to see where life takes them and what kind of people they become!<br/><br/>It is early in the twentieth century but much of life has been formed by events that preceded the first World War. Who is correct and whose life can you identify with? How does a young person find a way to survive the craziness that is going on around them and when are they safe? Wonderfully written by an excellent author, this book is not to be missed!
This book had beautiful, lyric writing and parts of it were very moving.  I was not always involved with the story, though.  I never believed in the cursed diamond--just never cared who had it or who found it.  The blind girl did not really come alive for me as a character--I felt I was supposed to care about her more than I did.  I cared mainly about Werner who did come alive as a fleshed out human being with both flaws and virtues.  His travails in a Nazi training academy were, for me, the best part of the book, as he struggled with real moral conflicts.  A kindhearted young man gets made a tool of evil, at least for a time--that was wonderfully rendered.  But I found myself skimming other parts.  I expected more given the fantastic reviews.
Really enjoyed this story.  However, I felt that the ending left me hanging, somewhat looking for more.
I was about halfway through this book when it won the Pulitzer Prize, and it surprised me a little. I'd tried turning friends on to Doerr's short fiction several times in the past, and it never seemed to work. I'm happy this one is getting recognition. The two main plot threads blend together in unexpected and beautiful ways. As always, his writing is excellent, and characterization rides that line with sentimentality without quite crossing over. There's a weird quality to his fiction, where if you were to describe the events to someone it would sound like a much wilder, almost magical realism kind of story. But when reading, it feels very real. We live in a world of signals and Doerr is the radio, turning those signals into voices and music.
This novel is a series of episodes, somewhat lacking in coherence, chronologically and geographically. Nevertheless it portrays a powerful picture of the social stresses in World War II, with the appalling inhumanities of Nazi extremists and the simultaneous persistence of love and loyalty. The culmination is an unexpected rapport between a German soldier who is a technological genius, and a blind French girl who displays exceptional fortitude. The narrative lapses frequently into mysticism, and rotates around a supernatural diamond that endows its possessor with immortality and misfortune. (Recollecting the Ring of the Nibelungen!)). The writing style is a particular pleasure, with clever choice of words, and painting vivid verbal images.
One of the most intelligent books I have read. This is a TOP 10 list maker for sure. Highly recommend.
Mr Doerr, is one of best author currently being published. The quality of writing, I'm sure, was a team effort between his story and his editor's inclination of perfection. There were several areas that French or German was used and I wish a footnote  or an insert of interpretation would have been included. As a reader, I either had to take the time to look up several words to understand or skip it. However, in many instances the interpretation was not necessary because the author "showed us" not "told us" in the previous paragraph or sentence. I am a entry level writer and I learned so much from Mr. Doerr" Syntax. The story although was good and spellbinding, it was the writing that made this an award wining novel.
I enjoyed the book more from a historical perspective than a story. The writer wrote in such a way that the story was vivid in my mind. I am not that much of a history buff, so it was very enlightening to get an account of what happened during World War II from the lives of the characters in this book. The storyline involves the life of a young girl who was blind at age 6. The author did a very good job of describing her life without sight, to where I felt I had a reasonable idea of what she went through on a daily basis.<br/><br/>The story seemed lengthy at times, with much description and not as much action as I am used to, but was an interesting story of the time period and the interwoven lives of those who lived during that time.
Lately my life feels like work, work and more work, and I am tired. Today, I sat on the sunny patio and read a book I wanted to read that didn't have anything to do with anyone I know or the business of publishing or anything. And this was that book.<br/>So beautiful. God, the details in this book are just incredible. And the language - wow. But what I especially loved, and needed right now, was the reminder of how good humanity can be, even in the darkest of times. That's not to say there weren't some painful, sad moments in this book, because there were. But the moments filled with light will definitely stand out over the dark ones in my mind.<br/>And now, I have that wonderful glow after reading a book I loved. *deep, happy sigh*
This is one of the best novels I have read in years.  The plot develops from two directions,  one following the life of a displaced blind French girl, and the other of a German orphan boy who is accepted into the Reich's elite ideological academy.  It traces both of their lives from before World War II through the war and to the events that lead to their eventual encounter, as well as their lives afterwards.  The prose Doerr uses is always forceful and at times poetic.  The descriptions of landscapes as well as personalities raise this novel to the level of artwork.  The progression of the novel is well paced and never forced.  The principal characters have great depth and complexity.  I most highly recommend this work as a must read.
Posting this on behalf of my mother, as I haven't actually read it myself yet (it's beside my bed in the 'queue'). It's set in St Malo, which is just 20 miles from where I grew up in Jersey and I've been there many, many times. My mother, who's Jersey born with French heritage, read it while she was visiting Sydney last year. She enjoyed the story, but she hated the use of US English spelling, particularly 'gray' instead of grey, etc. At first she thought they were typos, then I explained it was US English. She grumbled about it all the way through! I appreciate the author is American, but I thought given the setting of the story, it might have been localised into at least UK spelling if not Australian spelling for the non-US market.
The writing in this book is spectacular.  Considering how many World War Two stories are out there, you would think that this topic was completely over-used and exhausted.  Well, this book proves that notion wrong.  It is truly beautiful in many many ways.  The story line is perfection, the lyrical writing (it was almost like hearing music!) the powerful resolution, the characters.  I think I may just go back and read this one over to re-experience the ride.  This is an epic tale of humanity with all it's shades of color from bright and hopeful to dark and scary and everything in between sprinkled with a bit of magic, all of this in the middle of hideous times.  It is inspiration.  It is power.  It is beauty.  It is glory.  Read it.
Given To Me For An Honest Review<br/><br/>All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel by Anthony Doerr is a must read. Once you open the book it will grab you and hold you down tightly and you'll just watch those pages turn and turn and turn some more until the final page. This book is really hard to put down. As you read it it will make you feel as though you are part of the story. It has great character development. It has you travel from German mines to the life of a museum worker in Paris. This is a brief love story and an account of German occupation of France during World War II. I loved it. It is one of the best books that I have read. I highly recommend it to everyone. I look for more of these fantastic books from Anthony Doerr.
I recently ordered ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE from Amazon and did, in fact, just finish reading it.  It was one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  The author takes you into the hearts and souls of those surviving through World War II in Europe (the Germans and the French") The two primary characters are beautifully written and the author weaves their stories throughout the book.  Also, I loved that the chapters were brief, none more than two or three pages.  It made the reading so much more fluid.  I found it hard to put down.  I totally recommend this book to those who love historical novels, or basically just great stories.  Anthony Doerr, the author, truly deserved winning the Pulitzer Prize for this book.
A wonderful story about a young blind girl whose father has had built her the city where she lived in miniature so she could find her way.  He is arrested one day and she lives with her uncle who has not left his home in many years.  He has a secret radio hidden in the attic of his home.  It's also the story of a young German boy who is an expert with radio repairs and operation.  He is taken into the service while a young boy to operate and fix their radios.  While tracking down communication devices he hears the young girl's story and music.  They finally meet.  There is so much more to novel that I can't write here without giving the story away.  It is one of the best books I have read in a longtime.  Wonderful,memorable story.
This WWII novel set in occupied France tells a compelling story from three points of view: a blind French girl isolated in a crumbling house in a village bombarded by the Allies; a German soldier, an orphan with amazing abilities with electronics trapped in the basement of a bombed building in the girl's village; and a dying German officer searching a priceless, but possibly cursed jewel. The story traces the history of each, narrating the events that bring them inexorably together. Problems--the realistic language and concerns of the German soldiers, and a brutal rape scene late in the novel, probably realistic, but awful (though told tastefully though explicitly--less sophisticated readers may not even realize what is going on).
Several of my friends really loved this book and couldn't put it down. For some reason it didn't engage me. I did like the descriptions of Werner growing up and learning radios; his time in the orphanage with his feisty sister and the relationship between Marie-Laure and her father. Each  touched me however I found the story not compelling and I had to force myself to keep going back to it and reading on. Some of the scenes are really wonderful taken on their own such as Marie-Laure reading in the night over the radio, slouching around in the tide pools, bringing the bread home; Werner with his friend looking at the Audubon water colors. All in all I think the reader should try it and see how they respond to it. It's worth a try.
Well written. The author puts you right in the middle of France and Germany during the 30's and 40's.
This is an enjoyable piece of fiction. As most reviewers point out you'll fall in love with the characters. Anthony Doerr has chosen to write about remarkable people forced to live unremarkable lives; good people in very bad situations.<br/><br/>There are moments that make you cringe and moments that make your heart ache. I don't remember ever laughing out loud but I did smile a number of times. And the writing never threw me off the page. It's a well constructed book.<br/><br/>However, ultimately I'm only giving it a three because it's not a book that left me with much. Despite how much I loved the characters they didn't inspire me to see the world differently.<br/><br/>Still, this makes a great beach or commuter read.
Loved this story.  I found it a little annoying that the book is not written chronologically, however, I think it is due to this writing style we get to know these characters so well. Not only does this book tell a wonderful story, it has multiple characters that you actually like and admire. I think by going back and forth in time, I found myself "understanding" how a good, kind boy can be part of the German Army. Even now, I don't want to call one of the main characters a Nazi. Also, the author did a great job of tying together the characters via a radio, and the role the radio played in WWII; which I also learned in "War Brides."  After reading this story, I want to go back to France and visit Saint-Malo.
Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Loved every minute.  A beautiful and sad story.  Fabulous writing.
I would recommend this book to any book club. I am anxious to discuss this book at length with mine.
An intricate but simple story of love and loss. Ordinary people with extraordinary gifts try their best to live according to a set of principles as they experience the horrors of war. The characters are beautifully drawn, so much so that we don't want their stories to end.<br/>The author shows us their intellectual gifts by providing a level of detail in their thoughts and actions  not usually found in fiction. He weaves other writings into the narrative to expand our appreciation of the characters, yet he leaves no loose ends.<br/>Not sure I liked the time compression at the end though. It breaks the mood for me.<br/>I recommend it to anyone who loves well told stories with historical settings that raise moral issues.
I have not even finished reading this book yet. In some ways I don't want to finish it. The writing is so beautiful. If I were to underline passages that especially touch me, I'd be underlining over half the book. I love that there are just a few main characters, and we get to know them so well. Of course it is familiar terrain since it's WW2, but I never tire of stories that focus on everyday people who were so personally affected by it. I would even say average people, except that no one is really average here. Marie-Laure is 15 and blind. Uncle Etienne is an eccentric hermit. Marie's father is a very clever artisan & devoted single parent. Werner is a conflicted orphan. Von Rumpel is an obsessed enemy. Read this book!
This book is about the survival of a blind girl associated with the French resistance during World War II and a young German soldier who watched himself on the slippery slope of honor vs being a good Nazi soldier. The former used radios to disseminate information.  The latter was a "radio genius" who developed triangulation to locate resistance transmitters.  This is certainly not the first book on either topic, but these characters were so alive and consistent throughout the entire book.  The facts about radio technology were correct. The action was exciting and plausible.  The ending was a bit of a surprise, but still incredibly suspenseful.  I was very sad to finish this book and will definitely read it again.
Probably one of the strangest and best reading experiences I've ever had. Story takes place in France during the second world war and the author has that unique ability to put you into the story specifically and almost eerily through the eyes of a very young French blind girl during WWII. That girl is but one of the characters that are able to hold your attention. Rather than go into much detail about the story, suffice to say you will live the novel as those characters in the book. Personally, I find myself reading very slowly not wanting to miss any of the detail and at times reading the same sentences, paragraphs and pages a second time. Great novel, no wonder it was on the NY Times Best Seller List for so very long.
Another publisher churns out another World War 2 novel. Here, we follow the fates of two children, an orphaned German boy and a blind French girl, through the build-up to war and into its consequences.<br/><br/>If I had to name my favourite novel about occupied France, it would probably be The Blood of Others by Simone de Beauvois. Let me be clear: this is not de Beauvois. But it is a cracking story, told with a kind of unflinching compassion. Major characters are not immune to death or disappearance. It touches gently on themes of courage and beauty, but then also has a line of plot about an international Nazi jewel hunter. Something to grab you, something to hold onto. Recommended for those who want to read a Story.
I am astonished at the rave reviews.  The book was a tedious exercise in overwritten, overblown and sentimental lyricism. Worst of all, the plot fell apart in the end.  The parallel development of the lives of the two main characters seems to be leading to a climactic encounter in which they will presumably fall in love or at least develop a powerful bond.  Instead, their eventual encounter falls flat. Additionally, all the excitement about the magical blue diamond, so heavily emphasized is the beginning of the novel, goes nowhere. I understood the author took 10 years to write the book. He should've gone back to the beginning to remember what he was originally going to do. Three stars is honestly a generous rating.
This was a great story.  It was actually three stories that all weaved together.  A young French girl who is blind has to flee her home and ends up living with her great uncle.  A young orphan who is an expert with radios who ends up in the German army.  A army officer who is after this diamond the supposedly can make you live forever.  I found that although the three lives were ultimately separate, how the author brought them all together was very interesting.  I really give the book 4.5 stars.  I found the end to be kind of slow, but still it was interesting.  Once I reached what I thought was a good ending point I think I was mentally done with the book.  But, the author dud a good job tying up all the lose ends.
I'll admit, when someone recommended this "WWII novel" I pictured one more story of atrocities, hardships, lost dreams.  I was more than surprised at how rapidly I got sucked into the story and how difficult it was to put down.  Both the story and the author's style of writing were excellent.<br/><br/>I loved the frequent use of metaphors and similes.  The descriptions of people/places/things were beautiful and realistic.  I really came to know the primary characters, and was sorry to see the book end.  I'd be delighted to hear if this ever becomes a jumping-off point for another book on the same subject by Anthony Doerr.<br/><br/>I've been recommending this to friends/relatives since I opened the book!
When you were little, did you ever put on a coat that was too big for you? A old, woolen coat that had many pockets to explore? A heavy coat that had once belonged to someone else? A coat that is the colors of snow, and ash, and snail shells, and jewels? It smells of the sea. "All the Light We Cannot See", is such a coat. Its pockets are the characters, their individual secrets deep and inviting. The threads are woven from the settings; occupied Paris, Zollverein's smoke stacks, and the exquisite jewel that is Saint-Malo. It is larger than you could ever fit into. When you wear this coat you wrap up tight in the plot wrinkles and folds.. When you take it off, you can still feel its weight on your shoulders.
The reviews on this book are excellent.  Maybe, I just didn’t get it.  The story jumped from one character to another (primarily between Werner and Marie-Laure). This was distracting.  Some episodes and time periods were covered rather rapidly.  In the chapters about Marie-Laure, there was a lot of sense description, as she is blind.  Parts of the novel were interesting, others sections moved slowly.  In the end, there are number of questions that go unanswered.  One theme was the brutality of totalitarian dictatorships, another the random events of war, a third the devastation (both physical and mental) wrought by armed conflict.  The novel was okay, but I can’t say it ranks with the better literature I have read.
My sister recommended this book, so I read it for my book club. It's a very interesting book, following 2 people: Werner and Marie-Laure through the latter part of WW2 in St. Malo France. Marie-Laure is blind, and Werner is a German orphan with a knack for understanding radios.  The book follows their separate stories, bringing them together at the end. It is not your typical Holocaust book, and it would be good reading for both adults and young adults/teens. At first I was put off by the style of writing, but the story grabbed me and I couldn't put it down. It's rare that everyone in the book club likes a book, and this one pleased even our most critical readers.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this book.
I have to agree with those who have given this book two stars or less. I am halfway through it and find that I totally forget about it until I have time to sit down and read and then its "oh yeah, that book". It is ponderous, the characters are just barely engaging, and its so long that I just want to quit. It is a good story idea, but really, hasn't the 'little blind girl' character been a bit overdone already?  And the 'confused young man' as well?<br/>Obviously I am in the minority on this one, but, I am not alone here. Just too formulaic to hold one's interest, and almost no momentum to pull the reader along. I do not understand how it won a Pulitzer. It's no To Kill a Mockingbird or Grapes of Wrath.
Oh what you could be....". Every time I hear that line I will tear up. I adored this book. I have a new book heroine to add to my favorite's list, Marie-Laure LeBlanc. Such courage in such a young girl, I am in awe. The symbolism throughout this book is so thought provoking - it deserves Cliff Notes! My heart aches for sweet, smart Werner Pfennig. My pitiful thoughts do not do this justice. I feel privileged to have been able to read this perfect, thought provoking book. My favorite book themes are kindness and redemption. If ever a book held those themes precious, this is it. I cannot recommend this book enough, simply beautiful. 4/2015 happy to report this beautiful book won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction
Perhaps I shouldn't write a review since I haven't finished the book, but I'm 3/4 of the way through and my comments mainly have to do with the book's structure. To begin with, each chapter is two to three pages long, which makes for over 200 chapters. That's ok, but each chapter alternates between the stories of the two protagonists - Werner and Marie -- so that you have to keep close track of where the previous story left off. In addition, the time frame keeps changing so you have to keep track of where you are in the narrative: the mid-thirties, the beginning of WWII, the middle years of the war or in 1944. If you can manage this jumping around for 500 pages, your concentration skill are laudable. Good luck.
Wonderfully written story about a blind French girl and a German boy whose lives intertwine briefly during World War II. The author is a gifted storyteller who weaves an endearing tale about Marie-Laure whose father teaches her to live a full life in spite of her blindness. In addition, the story is about Werner Pfennig who grows up in an orphanage with his sister. Werner discovers the magic of radiowaves which entertains he and his sister Jutta. Their life in the orphanage is anything but glorious. Werner's talent for electronics saves him from a life of hard labor when he is selected to work for the German army. Anthony Doerr's talent for sensational storytelling will keep readers' attention to the very end!
I selected this book because a newspaper reviewer called it the best piece of fiction he has read for years, but it didn't surpass the classics.  I can't agree with the rave review.  The book had good points.  The author's description of everyday life in France and Germany during World War II was outstanding.  I have never read how the ordinary people lived before.  He also had a remarkable turn of phrase in his descriptions of people and places.  He chose to jump back and forth from year to year which tended to be confusing at the beginning of the book.  I had to keep notes on who, what and where, but at the end it all came together.  The ending will just make the reader shake their head.  A worthwhile read.
I have to say that I wasn't crazy about this novel.  It was fascinating "visually", great descriptive writing of contexts and places, but character development was very superficial.  Half way through the book I stopped caring what happened because of that.  The characters were not fully developed; the author seemed satisfied to present them more as characters in a fable (not fully human but instead symbolic in some way).  That is a problem in such a long novel, or any novel andis a serious flaw.  There are problems with the plot that others have pointed out.  Certainly that added to the weakness of the work.  But the unbelievable and superficial characterizations were to my mind the most serious flaw.
Radio waves radiate out and form the warp of a tapestry.  As an orphan German boy and a blind French girl slowly find their way to their inevitable encounter we travel on these waves and witness scenes of unbelievable beauty and stark darkness.  How interesting that the blind girl can "see" more light than others and that greed and corruptness blind others to the beauty and perfection that they seek.  This is a very ambitious novel written with insight about the happenings surrounding WWII. I followed the weaving of the story line faithfully, but have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by the turn of events.  Instead of a tapestry at the end I was left with a coarse cloth full of missed stitches.
It's a story set in World War II, told from the perspective of two children who come of age during Hitler's rise to power. One of the children is a blind girl from Paris who fled with her father to St. Malo as her father was on a secret mission, the other is an orphaned German boy who is an incredibly talented radio engineer. Their lives intertwine once, and by the time the two characters do meet, the reader is invested in them emotionally as individuals.<br/>But there are times the author jumps around and it's difficult to keep track. Other times there is almost too much detail in his scenes. Towards the end, there's a plot twist that seems like it was just hurried along.<br/>So, overall--"meh."
I read this book in one sitting, I could not stop reading it.  Beautifully written novel about a horrible time in our history.  My one and only complaint is with the sequence of events - I usually don't mind it when authors play around with the time sequence in a story, but this one was a tad confusing and made me go back and reread sections to make sure I knew where/when I was. But it didn't stop me from loving the character development and the unfolding story. The ending might have been a little too pat and and perhaps  a little too coincidental, but I didn't care - I continued thinking of the events and connections in this story long after I finished.  I look forward to reading more books by this author
What an absolutely amazing book. It only took a chapter for me to realize this book would be one for my "forever" list. It was so engaging. He developed his characters so well and let us into their world's so we could experience their lives as they were living them. We could cheer their triumphs and weep for their failures.  We were able to feel both happy and sad for the choices they made. It was a terrible time to be alive and terrible choices were made.  You learned what a blind person copes with when everything's changing around them. But having sight doesn't necessarily make life any easier. Choices for good and choices for evil. We all have to make them. Sometimes we win, sometimes we don't.
The author has a wonderful command of language with beautiful descriptions.  He makes the characters alive enough that you can see them and almost think they are real people.  My main complaint about the book is that often there were odds jumps back and forth in chronology that I could not figure out the reason for.  I have no trouble usually with flashbacks, but these just seemed to be random shifts in the time sequence--confusing and serving no purpose that I could see.  I also found the ending somewhat drawn out with tying up all of the loose ends which didn't really need to be tied up.  I read this on my tablet which I find to be a very tedious way of reading so I might be letting that color my view.
An exquisite piece of work that reminds us of the horrors of war without the graphic, gory details; pointing out that both the soldiers and their victims are often kids just trying to survive a perilous plight. The author's telling of the story by bouncing back and forth from 1940 to 1944 intensified the suspense. Although the end is bittersweet, it affirms that people are basically good at heart, and that the human spirit can survive the most awful of circumstances. It gives me pause once more to stop and reflect on the youth of the quickly diminishing "greatest generation" and the challenges that they faced in those perilous times. This is a book for the ages...the best WW II novel I have read.
My daughter recommended the book to me.  It was a very good read and I would recommend to others.
A very original plot but some of the storey seemed quite illogical to me.  Not the greatest read.
The character sketches in this book are good, but the time periods switch around and it is hard to follow sometimes. The historical background of this novel tie in with a young man growing up in Hitler's Germany prior to WWII. The young woman is blind, her father is the locksmith at a museum in Paris. All is fine in her world until the German's invade Paris. She and her father escape Paris and flee to family in the French countryside.The common thread that unites these two characters is through the radio that the young woman and her uncle use to inform the French resistance.  The boy, now a German Soldier detects their illegal transmittion..  I enjoyed the historic content of the book, but was disappointed with it's structure .
Well deserving of any prize it has or will win.  A masterpiece of character and story development, lyrically descriptive prose, and symbolism that will keep the scholars busy for decades.  But it's also a thoroughly enjoyable and engrossing read, one of those rare books that our children will read in future literature classes and, dare I say, enjoy it.  I cared deeply for the main characters and felt their experiences through the words on the page. A few months ago I read The Nightingale, and now All the Light We Cannot See - both about occupied France, both literary masterpieces, and both evidence that truly great fiction is alive and well on the reading planet.  You can't go wrong with this book.
Perhaps once every three or four years comes a novel that, once you've read it, will forever resonate in your mind, in your heart and in your soul. Anthony Doerr has written this novel.  All the Light We Cannot See is a novel you must read, yes, but so much more than that. It is a miracle of literature.  I feel I must re-read this novel again simply to absorb its beauty, its sorrow, its hope.  I cannot believe that I will ever encounter another novel of such magnificence.  If you read nothing else this summer, read this novel. To say anything more is not necessary; read this novel and you will understand history and life in a new way. Thank you, Anthony Doerr, for giving us this gift of literature.
I spent a week in San Malo a few years ago but was oblivious to any WWII activity as described here in Doerr' s very good book. The story was well thought out, convincing, with beautiful imagery of the French cities of Paris and San Malo as well as life in war-torn Nazi Germany. I will check out the city's experience during the war soon. Though the last half of the book was read in a short week, the first half did not engage me at all.  I did not find the story's foundation (in the book's first half) very compelling and almost gave up on it; fortunately I persevered. What I really enjoyed was the updates on the characters many years after the war. Resilience of the human spirit. Good job Mr. Doerr!
A quietly powerful book, lyrical and beautifully written, that slowly builds and builds to heart-wrenching fates for the main characters, all of whom you come to care deeply about.  Its perspective on the effect of World War Two on populations across Europe is unique as well.  While there are familiar elements, not a bad thing by any means, the focus is on I would guess unknown smaller places, and on the war's effect on a number of children who are not old enough to have control over their fate or their beliefs at first, not young enough to be confused or oblivious to what is happening to their lives, but just the right age to be truly involved in ways that forever change them.  Highly recommended.
An exquisitely written book.  Would that more current authors had Doerr's skills and ability to set a scene and place the reader there: physically and emotionally.  The reader not only "sees" what is happening, s/he smells the odors, feels the cold and damp, hears the footfalls, experiences the anxiety of the characters.  The characters are well-drawn and well-developed; one comes to know and care about them.  The storyline is logically developed and brought to what seems to be an appropriate close.  Doerr did not feel compelled to take shortcuts; nor did he "milk" a scene for its shock or emotional value. Nor did he add extraneous characters or chapters. He is a master storyteller.
I watched the paper clip story on HBO.  All three of my children had teachers in school who just would not let them read anything if it wasn't stories on concentration camps.  When I saw this book, I asked myself...do I want to read another WW II book?<br/><br/>I wish I could tell you all the amazing things this book is.  But, the words I could write wouldn't do it justice.  If you read it, and you truly get it, you'll know at the end that the only way to describe it is to say that this boom is about all the light we cannot see.  And ,when you're done, you'll set about living consciously, trying to see more and more of the light.  Trying to be the light.<br/><br/>Read it.  You won't regret it.
One of the best books I have ever read.<br/>A wonderfully written, sensitive story that is often very sad, but I was most sad when I realized I was approaching its end.<br/>The story interweaves two main non heroes with a few other main characters that are all wonderfully described in this excellent fiction.<br/>It's not the plot that makes it great, but rather the wonderful characters and extraordinary setting in which this story takes place and how all of the difference aspects of it mold into a holistic picture.<br/>The book requires a bit of an effort to read, especially in the beginning, until chronology and characters fall into place, but it all becomes part of a magnificent work of art.
The words. I would recommend to everyone, it is one of the best books I have read, and I am old.
One of the best books I have ever read it! I plan to read more from this author. I recommend it.
There must be something wrong with me to differ from so many of the admiring readers.  I was so looking forward to reading this book.  It sounded quite intriguing, being centered around a fascinating time and place with unusual circumstances and human conditions.  This book is well-written and Kudso to Doerr for his imagination, but two things distracted me.<br/><br/>It was slow moving and the subject-switching was too often.  Every chapter.  Instead of adding suspense, to me, it became annoying.  Rather than not being able to put the book down I had to force myself to pick it up.<br/><br/>Secondly the characters don't meet up until late in the book and only briefly.  I was expecting more.
The words jump off the page...this story is the best of the best...from the beginning.. you will feel that you are part of their journey.  A sprawling epic story that enhances the characters voices with poetic vocabulary .....and descriptions that leave u believing that you are right their in the museum,  the orpanage, the house..or walking the streets....you are rooting for the spirit in the characters doing what is right within an unimaginable situation, and fighting within themselves to be moral and forced to make decisions due to no control of their life's circumstances... weaving together the history of war, art, health, math, physics, morals and desire for a better life..  I am going to read it again like the character reads her beloved book over and over again...enjoy this gem.  I leave the details out because it's for the reader that loves books...it's a gift to read and discover them for yourself...
This was a book I actually put down for a while because it started slowly, but when I picked it up again I was captivated and finished it quickly.  It gives yet another insight, although a very different one, on the days when Germany was falling under the influence of Hitler, the indoctrination of and activities of members of the Reich and how residents of a small town in France are affected.  The main character is blind and it was somewhat amazing how well she is able to get around and live a full life.<br/>The ending was a little confusing to me since, without giving anything away, I wasn't sure of just what happened with respect to something that had been mentioned throughout the story.
I am not a history person, but I picked up this book because of all the great reviews and I do love a story with two parallel characters. It delivered and much more. I found myself googling the places mentioned and thinking that perhaps they were there running around the streets. Really well researched and written, I felt like I was there. It makes you think of all the real stories during the war. Millions of people affected and each of them with their own struggle and hopes. Its full of mystery until the last page and you are left wondering what happened and what could have happened. This book stuck with me for a long time and I sometimes think about the characters whenever I hear of WWII.
I never was able to really feel that I knew the characters.  I know what they did and how they reacted, but that is all.  Another problem in retrospect was my expectations - I had understood (rightly or wrongly) that this was a story about a relationship between two people.  I kept waiting for them to meet.  And the actual story was about two parallel lives and they only came together for a few minutes at the end of the book.  So without knowing that I was doing this - I kept waiting for them to meet and thinking to myself "but I am halfway through the book (or almost finished the book) and this hasn't happened.  I did not find the story itself enough to distract me from my expectations.
I know it has received many glowing reviews and been on the NYTimes best book of the year list, but the book just didn't make me want to sit down and read it for hours. In fact, I've been reading it for over a month. Thought it was just me who felt this way but as more people in my book club are reading it, many of them feel the same, but not all. Some love it.<br/>Some of it I felt was just too unbelievable, particularly Marie Laure's activity in the attic after her uncle's arrest. Also could not accept Von Rumpel's search of the house with him having end stage cancer.However, man's quest for fortune certainly was evident especially in the later chapters that von Rumpel was involved in.
This book captivated me... beautiful construction....and I cared deeply about the characters...
Wow! This novel absolutely blew me away. I had been looking for a good book for a while that breaks out of the norm, because so many popular books these days are teen romance or dystopian, etc. I'm so glad I found this! It's very accurate historical fiction with tons of detail, and the imagery and way things are described is stunning and unlike any book I've ever read. It is a beautifully written book (and definitely sad at some points) and I 100% recommend it for ages 16 and up. It is very eye-opening, informative, entertaining and interesting, and really hard to put down! Definitely my new favorite I will be recommending to everyone.<br/>Please do yourself a favor and read this book!!
Another novel set in Europe during WWII? What else can there be left to write about? For anyone wondering, there is apparently still so much more as read through the eyes of Doerr's characters. A wartime chronicle mixed with mystery and with no trace of political bias. Doerr's writing is unique and demands that the reader be able to traverse across years that leap and reverse and travel back and forth across occupied territory. If you are looking for a novel in which the plot unfolds in a neat, linear fashion, All the Light We Cannot See, is not the choice you want. However, I simply loved it and devoured each word in one seating. I look forward to reading Doerr's other works, as well.
Gorgeous language. Stunning descriptions of war and internal dialogue. Wonderful storytelling.
Very deep book about WWII and just how it affected real people in many countries in Europe. The book was hard to read at first, and the author loves big fancy words not often used to describe things, so not just a "sit on the beach" kind of reading without looking up a few words to make sure you clearly get the meaning.  The writing style was one with flash forwards and flash backs with two different stories/people through most of the novel.  I don't mind flash backs, but don't care for switching back and forth between tenses in such a complicated story.  Overall I learned something from the book which is why I read and it did get me to think and ponder certain situations.
I had high expectations going into reading this and I was still fully expecting to rate this a 5 star book until about two-thirds of the way through.  The two main characters finally meet so far into the book that I started to have a sinking feeling about how things were going to wrap up, there just wasn't enough pages left.  Werner was my favorite character in the book and I really hoped to see how his experiences would shape him as an adult (or at least a young adult) so I was very disappointed in how he pretty much just disappeared from the book.  It also bothered me when it seemed like Marie-Laure so easily forgot about him.  I feel like Werner got short-changed and so did I.
I absolutely loved this book and have recommended it to many friends. I'm even contemplating reading it again because I was sorry when it ended. It took me a little while to get into it because the prose style in the beginning seemed somewhat clipped, though it was composed of beautiful words and images. In fact, the writing throughout is so fluid and evocative that it somewhat mutes the sense of horror that usually pervades stories set in this time period. The characters are wonderfully developed, and the way in which the two stories eventually merge is brilliant. I also think it's incredibly cinematic and would make a terrific film (with the right director and cast, of course).
WWII is not often told from the occupied/occupiers point of view.  Marie-Laure perhaps paints the scene better than those who are sighted.  One feels that they are walking with her cane, listening with her ears, smelling, counting steps and sewer drains and profoundly alone after the Allied attack on St. Malo.  Likewise geekish and terrified Werner relays his fears, his questioning of what he does/doesn't do.  You identify with both.  The villains are not painted quite so well, their role is but to cause the reactions of our two protagonists.  It is a very interesting view of WWII from  still another view.  The story, the story telling is quite good.  I'd like a different ending.
A blind girl from Paris, and a radio genius boy from Germany intersect like unexpected harmony during World War Two. This does not sound like much of a plot. My summary is like saying, it's a book about a guy chasing a whale. A book about a rich lady who had an affair in Russia. While there is indeed a rather complex plot in All the Light, the plot is surpassed and then overrun by sumptuous language and glorious sympathy for little details. Glowing humanity seeps out of sordid images of the war and its casualties and survivors. Although many readers may fear the horrors of yet another war novel, I would say, get over it. Jump in. The harshness is ultimately trumped by quiet joy.
I could scarcely believe it when the Kindle store listed how many reviews this guy's book has gotten.  I was having trouble falling asleep - I assumed I'd read the sample and never even think about the book again...but four hours later, I was still reading!  I was riveted. It's one of those books you think about during the day.  I found myself wondering what would happen to poor Frederick, and Jutta, and of course Werner.  And what really happened to Etienne to make him the way he is?  A fiction author's greatest accomplishment - if you ask me - is if the reader has to make an effort to distinguish the characters from the real world. This was such a book.  Masterful!  Riveting!
The book is a bit drab for my taste, well-written of course, and I love the short chapters, because with such a tome I felt as if I was making good progress! Intriguing story. I guess it was just a bit long for me. And of course all the electronic business meant nothing to someone who knows simply how to turn on a light. There probably were rich implications there that I could not appreciate. I did appreciate the courage of Werner and the girl. Too tragic that he was killed. But all in all I'm glad I made it through ... it's rather like Moby Dick, but instead of telling me more than I wanted to know about whales, it told me a bit more than I could understand about electricity.
This book is so beautifully written! the language is poetic, the characters are rich and deep, the world in<br/>which the story takes place is so well drawn.  Doerr takes his time, letting you feel the experiences of each<br/>character, slowly weaving their journeys, until he finally pulls them together.  I absolutely loved reading this!<br/>It's one of those books that I'll probably have to read a second time, now that I'm pasts the "What's going to happen?!"<br/>phase  - so that I can really savor the language.  He's made every detail so vivid that I can see the story as if I'd been<br/>inside it.  In a dark time and place, his characters are filled with light.
Hard to find the words to describe this wonderful book. First it takes us to a place in WWII where perhaps we have not been, describing the story of a French refugee from Paris and a German soldier. Their worlds, the young girl blind, the boy an orphan, are made so clear to us that we walk through the story together with them. Aside the fact that the reader always wants to know more about them and their situations which makes the book a "page turner", the language is rich and poetic. Despite the tragedy that any book about this period cannot avoid, there is a powerful optimism that comes through. I didn't want to finish this book,from the pure pleasure of reading it.
I kept resisting this book, in spite of the great reviews.  Although I generally enjoy historical fiction set during and between the World Wars, I wasn't sure I could relate to the principal characters in this book.  So I kept buying and reading other books instead.  But then I would see references to this book, and keep going back to the reviews.  I am so glad that I finally succumbed to the temptation and bought this book!  Unusual and outstanding story-telling, beautiful writing, and very easy to relate to, it is one of the two or three best books I've read in the last few years.  It deserves the acclaim that it has received, and I strongly recommend this remarkable book.
I found this book difficult to get into. Not easy reading if that is what one is looking for.
Perhaps I'm just sick of World War 2 novels, but this seemed too long.  The title enticed me.
This book is fantastic. It tells the story of two souls entwined in World War II through the eyes of a blind girl and an unwilling young man who becomes a soldier. My favorite part of the story is the fact that the stories of these individuals are told and they don't meet until the end of the book- and that meeting is only a few pages long. You get to see their intensity, their fears, their hearts- throughout the whole novel and you spend that time waiting for them to meet. It's a fantastic book. As World War II is one of my favorite historical periods to study, I love finding books/stories that tell it from a different perspective and this book is definitely a special one.
I know this is a huge best seller and I think my expectations were too high for this book.  The main selling point was all about this German boy and the French blind girl together being the main event in the story but that is not true.  We have to read almost the entire book for them to meet and then it was over in a matter of hours.  I also found it frustrating to have the chapters skipping all around to different time periods.  I did not find it to be an easy read.  Perhaps the fault is mine in that I am busy and could not just sit down and read the book cover to cover and had to read it over a longer time period.  The writing was excellent but the format was not as good.
It was difficult to read this book and think of the horrible effects of war on good people. The imagination of the author in weaving the story lines of the young French girl and young German boy exposed the hardships of those who had no choice in war. Each were victims of a quest for power in which they showed extraordinary courage and strength. The writing was wonderfully descriptive of the events and one could picture the times and places in the book. I have visited St Malo many times and shuddered to think of that beautiful city destroyed.  In the end it was rebuilt as did the lives of Marie Laure and others affected.  Sad that Werner's great mind and heart were stilled.
This was an okay read. The character was all over the place. I couldn't keep track of the sequence of time. She rambled on about so many things back and forth, back and forth. One minute she was actually attempting to get back into the Exclusion Zone, the next she was back in the shelter or back taking care of Alex. The character even states at one point herself that her thoughts were all jumbled and one day she'll put things in order.<br/>I could never keep track of how much time was passing, days, months, or years. I just gave in and contributed the helter-skelter jumping around of thoughts to radioactive poisoning. I really can't see how this was Pulitzer Prize winner.
The various meanings of "light"in the title and through the story offer a hope of light from within--not unlike the precious diamond. Marie L's loving father taught her to be inquisitive, careful, curious, confident, appreciative of the detail and variety in life; especially the natural world and sea creatures. Our heroine though blind from an early age lived her life in light. She was brave though not without fear. Understanding her vulnerabilities, Marie L lived her life day by day amid vivid images.<br/>I found the story compelling, the imagery detailed beautifully. I cared about the characters and felt a completion in the author's follow-up long after the war.
Connecting the dots -in a vast universe that occupied a large portion of history- was the most thrilling aspects of this novel. How brilliant of Doerr to envelop the story within a piece of paper, "a folded print of two birds in full color. Aquatic Wood Wagtail..." It is easy to see how the skillful way in which he weaved a plot where the real and the fantastic mix, similar to Latin American Magic Realism, as well as his careful choice of language, attracts dverse audiences.  While he placed his main characters in a historic context that has impacted humanity as a whole, Doerr did a superb job at tapping into the power of the personal story. -ClaudiaSamantha Dugan
One of the most achingly beautiful books I've read this year.<br/>It's long, but I raced through it.<br/>Plot weaves back and forth between a German orphan, an electronics genius, reluctantly forced into serving the Nazi cause by homing in on illegal radio transmissions...and a blind French girl who operates one of those illegal radios.<br/>Set in St. Malo on the north coast of France and, of course, in Germany.<br/>There were times during my reading that the sheer beauty of the language brought tears to my eyes, and I let the book in my lap, stared into the distance and wondered, Just how does the author DO that?<br/>As a writer myself, I am jealous of his ability.
What an incredible read!  A haunting account of two young people at opposite ends of WWII, both geographically, and culturally, who ultimately connect through a recorded broadcast of classical music.  They do not meet until near the end of the book, and so the author keeps you thinking, "When are these two going to meet?  And how?"  Actually, any description that I try to write will no way compare to the elegance of the writing of this story.  Emotionally, I was so caught up in the drama that I had trouble sleeping!!  Perhaps this occurred because that period of history is so heartwrenching.  Kudos, however, to Anthony Doerr.  I will read everything he publishes!
One of the best novels I've read in many years. A compelling plot line in an important historical context (WWII, the Nazi occupation of France, and the Allied invasion of Normandy), and deeply rendered characters.  All presented with beautiful, lyrical writing. The book does start very slowly, taking its time to set up the plot and develop the main characters, and it does constantly jump back and forth in time, but the author seamlessly pulls everything together in the last 100 pages. I could not put it down and had to know what would happen (which was not a given in this book), but did not want it to end. Deserves the Pulitzer it won. Just a fantastic piece of writing.
Not so much for its treatment of wartime, or for its delicate bread crumbing of plot elements to a satisfying conclusion, but rather for its style. The style itself becomes an element to be loved. Like authors of old who had a wonderful knack for turns of phrases, for imagery and metaphor, and for analogy, Doerr "has it."<br/><br/>As a reader, I felt appreciated in every chapter. The jumping back and forth between different times perhaps is the only forced element of the story, contrived to add suspense to an otherwise relaxed and enjoyable experience with the English language. The contrivance did work in the end, just like all the other elements put together.
There are so many positive reviews already so it's difficult to come with something new. I enjoyed reading this book from start to finish. It tells a beautiful, moving story of primarily two young people's contrasting and separate paths through WWII; the brief moment these paths meet; and the effects of losses endured, which mark the lives of the main characters in the ensuing years. I did not want the story to end and dragged out the last chapters to savour the final pages. This book deserves the critical praise it has already received. I strongly recommend this to anyone wanting to be entertained and moved whilst enjoying quality cliche-free writing. Excellent book.
Such a beautifully written story, actually parallel stories of a blind girl in German occupied France, and a german boy and his journey to becoming a nazi soldier.  The story of Werner is from a point of view not often seen..that of growing up in Nazi germany and going through Hitler youth, then an elite war college and then serving in the Nazi army.  The story of the blind girl growing up in Nazi france is equally compelling..Doerr, so beautifully describes her everyday life, through her point of view, using all her senses except her missing sight.<br/>eventually, their paths cross, and the suspense builds as they move closer to each other.  I could not put it down!
Wish I could give this 4.5 stars.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 is because the writing style was a little too straightforward for me.  The quick chapters were fine.  I guess I'm too used to reading Neil Gaiman, where the story is off-the-wall.  In any case, this book really got hold of me even though I expected it wouldn't after the first 40 pages or so.  And I grew so close to the main characters that I really felt for them.  And, generally, I love period pieces.  By the end this book really tugged at my heartstrings hard.  Not a book I'll forget.<br/><br/>Edit: And by the way, I'm not naming any characters or scenes because I want this to be a spoiler-free review.
Beautifully written! This would be a great book club read. There is so much to talk about...
I loved this book so much! I finished the last page and then started over again immediately.
Nice story. Could have been a better story. Crumby, non-ending. WAY TOO LONG. WAY TOO OVERWRITTEN... very hard to follow all the timeline jumping back and forth. The writing is ornate and creative to a fault. If you are looking for a lot of imaginative metaphors overly describing a mediocre plot line that barely resolves, you will like it. If you're looking for a book that makes you WANT to continue reading, this is not it. This book requires nearly as much work to read it as it did to write it. I feel deceived by the awards and positive reviews... the book did not live up to all the hype.
This book is so luxuriously written -- sustaining the characters throughout. The detail of the characters, the settings, all rich and vibrant. I listened to the audiobook, but now I will go back and read the book -- as I feel like I don't want to miss any nuance of the story. Heartbreaking at times. One would think that the story of insane Hitler has been told and told enough, but this book focuses a light on an aspect of his madness that involved young boys, trained and used for his war machine.<br/><br/>I was so compelled by the story that I had to listen in the wee hours and didn't want to do anything else than listen to the audiobook.<br/><br/>Just fantastic.
There is much about this story to like.  Great language and word pictures.  Intelligent and descriptive.  It grabs the brutality of war and inhumanity and shoves it against our senses.  However, the author takes a great story, which might be followed and appreciated, orderly cards of chapters, and drops them, then picks them up in random order, expecting the reader to find a story among them.  This literary trick that has become popular of late leaves us dizzy from jumping back and forth from one character and location to the next in a crazy zig zag.  I would not really recommend this book to anyone who has read great literature and found a cohesive story enjoyable.
This novel offers a poignant, life-affirming story against the background of WWII.  The two main characters, a little blind French girl and a very young German soldier, are exquisitely drawn as they struggle to survive in dangerous circumstances caused by the war. Through the dramatic narration of the story, Doerr captures the myriad wonders of life, even as death stalks at every turn. We witness brutality and raw evil; but the larger experience is one of love, caring, and connectedness. Last but not least, Doerr's use of language is brilliant and a pleasure in itself to relish as the story unfolds.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature.
All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr is one of the most powerful novels I have read about World War Two.  So many of such books focus on the military and political leaders of the time, and this one gives the reader a true feel of what it was like to be an innocent, blind young French civilian, and another teen, this one a German, who became a reluctant fighter for a regime he didn't believe in.  The two are examples of what it was like to be growing up in a world out of control, surrounded by danger and dogged by the hunger and deprivation caused by the war.  And yet both had hope for a better future for the world, in the midst of chaos they could not stop.
The Author does a good job of describing the life of the main characters from each one's perspective. The book tells the story of a young German orphan boy (and his sister) who's talent with radio devices brings him to the attention of the Hitler Youth movement and into the occupation of France along with the young Blind French girl who is affected deeply by the occupation of the Germans. Both people are victims of the Nazi Germans.  This is also a story of hope, love, family and courage.  I felt the Author did a very good job of intertwining the characters along with a mystery of a missing jewel. I have not read any other books by Anthony Doerr, but may do so now.
I thought I couldn't read another book about the Nazis but this book tells the stories of two young people--Werner, who is saved from a grinding existence in the mines, by his extraordinary ability to build and use radios and transmitters, and Marie Louise, a blind girl, whose father builds models of her city that allows her live a near normal life. The father also is a curator at the local museum, who has hidden a jewel, said to be endowed with both the power to save the owner while destroying others around that person. Beautifully written, the story uses the war as a framework rather than the central theme. Well worth the effort to connect the many story points.
I found All The Light We Cannot See to be a wonderfully moving reading experience.  The characters are alive in my mind even now that I have finished the book.  Their lives are real, no fairly tale endings.  I took immense satisfaction in that reality, because it is written with love and hope, though neither are often mentioned.  If you find satisfaction and meaning in life, imperfect and often painful as it may be, this is a book for you.  If you want to be comforted by the reminder that everyone in your life, alive or gone, will always be part of you, you will find that comfort here.
I really can't express how much I liked this novel. I wanted more when it ended. The characters were so well developed and easy to invest in.  So many new angles to view WWII from. The human essence was captured so well for all characters no matter what side of the war they were on.<br/>I am adding this to my favorites list.  It just easily nudged its way to the top three spots. I read it on on my Kindle but this is a book I need to own in print. I'm sure I will read it again at some point.<br/>I highly recommend this for anyone who loves an engaging story and with interests in history or WWII. it deserved the Pulitzer Prize in historical fiction in my opinion.
This book was chosen by two different book groups to which I belong.  I had heard positive comments about it from a variety of readers and thought that it would be hard to any book for measure up to all of this praise.........well it does measure up, it's a wonderful book.  I will need to re-read it a second time before the meeting where we will discuss it and I am actually looking forward to that.  I felt like I really got to know all of the characters and could understand their actions and reactions.  It is sad, tender, romantic and I read it with awe and wonder.<br/><br/>I wasn't looking forward to yet another WWII book, but am so glad I read it.  Highly recommend it.
An interesting story that shows what life was like for a young blind girl from France and a gifted German boy. The book shows how each was affected by  World War 11. The young girl was blind and when her father was picked up and put into a concentration camp she was left with a priceless  gem. The young boy became disillusioned with  the Germans. Both  of the young people have difficulties for which it is hard to see any resolution.<br/>The why how and why the two finally meet is fascinating and long awaited by  the reader. It was a book that was hard to put down even it was a long book, it seemed one had to keep reading in order to find out the fate of the two.
Beautifully written.  The relationships between the characters were what made this book.  The plot was a tiny bit over the top and almost edged into an overblown historical mystery/action adventure.  However, the writing itself and the author's crafting of bonds between the primary characters was subtle and spare, which were a powerful combination.  I'd love to see this author create a more intimate piece with the same attention to fine detail.  Given that Mr. Doerr managed such intimacy within the framework of this "sweeping epic," I think a smaller, tighter plot might highlight his skills even better.  I'd recommend this to friends, well worth the read.
In thinking what to write for my review, the word "Powerful" kept coming to mind.  For me, a book that can make me cry, laugh out loud or smile is a pretty good book.  This book made me both cry and smile.  I think the most powerful thing for me in reading this book was that Mr. Doerr was so successful in humanizing all of the characters in this book, both good and bad.  I would be almost holding my breath at times as I read because I was so in the moment.  This was a book I was anxious to get back to each time I left it.  The writing flowed very well, the characters are great and the ending was well thought out.  Overall an excellent book in my opinion.
What a strange experience. The writing was beautiful. Descriptions eloquent. Masterful use of language. Too many BIG words to look up and annoying use of a few "favorite words" (How many times can one use the word 'rampart'?!).<br/><br/>The second biggest problem for me was the pace. It plodded along so slowly, I had to force myself to be patient, waiting to be rewarded for my patience at the end. No such reward ever came. Key loose ends were never tied up. The two main characters scarcely got to know each other. The ending left me disappointed and unsatisfied.<br/><br/>The author is clearly mega-talented, but failed to deliver when it mattered most.
It was a very good book. The characters were very human and I felt an emotional tie with them. The history was incredibly written. I didn't think I would like a book written about any war, but I liked this book a lot. I could feel and see what Marie-Laure wasn't seeing, but feeling. I could see the cities the way her father saw and made them. I saw the soldiers walking and the radio transmissions they heard. The writing was really very descriptive and pulled you into the timeline and made you see everything that was happening to all these characters. I haven't read any of this writer's previous novels. I think I will probably change that after reading this one.
I loved the book but not the ending.  I felt they had written enough so they just ended it!
I found this book to be captivating throughout most of it, and I still would recommend it, but I sure was disappointed with how it ended  [SPOILER ALERT] especially with the death of a major character. I'm question why? Why did this character have to die? It actually would have been much more interesting if said person had survived and one life continued to intertwine with the life of the other character. I thought the last third of the book was rather rushed. But I do enjoy very much the author's fluid, poetic style of writing. Overall this story is depressing, not as "uplifting" or "full of hope" as I thought it would be from the description.
As a historian of World War II with a website that follows the events that proceeded it, took place during the war, and events that took place after the war as it related to the conflict (e.g., Nuremberg and Tokyo war crime tribunals), I found the author's coloring of what combatants and noncombatant faced to be basically authentic. I did have to check whether anyone in wartime France would have used a ballpoint pen, and it confirmed my suspicions that it was very unlikely to have been used. It took me a while to get used to chapters being a page long, but three quarters of the way through the novel (which is where I am now) I became comfortable with the device.
I loved the book All the Light we cannot see. I had just gotten back from Stuttgart Germany, Strasbourg in Alsace France, Paris and Caen France. I went to Omaha Beach, the American Cemetery and through Cherbourg France two weeks before reading the book looking for ancestors both French and German.. I didn't really know what is was about other than set in World War II era. I was happily surprised and I felt like I was right there with the characters all through the book. I didn't want it to end. I understand how Jutta felt Standing by the plaques in Saint Malo. Cried for the French and American youth and armies. But also for all those German youths and lives...
I loved this book. It has everything you want - fascinating characters, thrilling story line, heart wrenching moments. I felt as if I was there with Marie-Laure in her attic; or in the small house with Werner when he discovers the woman and child have been killed. You feel their pain; even that of minor characters such as delicate, little Frederick or him-of-few-words, Volkheimer. I loved everything about this book and although I was hoping for a happier, albeit, unrealistic ending, I am thoroughly satisfied and will probably read it again. It is killing me not knowing what exactly happened to Marie's father.<br/><br/>Read this; you will not be disappointed.
This is an absolutely marvelous novel.  Back-and-forth chronological structure challenged the reader, while story that eventually emerged was riveting.  WWII historical background rendered magnificently.  Plot was suspenseful and character development masterful (Werner!).  Beautiful prose, if sometimes self-consciously poetic.  I am interested in what others think about 1974 and 2014 postscripts; I am inclined to think it would have been better to have ended on page 483 (for those who haven't read it, I don't want to give away climax).  Congratulations to Anthony Doerr.  This is a superb novel.  (His memoir about living in Rome for a year is also delightful.)
This book was a gift and I hesitated to start it but once I did I could not stand for it to end. In every novel I try to identify with the protagonist, and find the empathetic qualities with the characters. This novel has such a unique voice and perspective that it made me actually change a lifetimes worth of assumtions about the young German chidren forced into Hitler's heinous regime. Every layered sentence is so beautifully written that you keep appreciating the quality of the work while the story unfolds.  Doerr's writing stands alone. It is very hard to put down. I will never give away my copy. It's a treasure. Possibly the best book I've read this year.
I loved, loved, loved this book! I am a huge history buff and very versed on the events of WWII. I particularly loved this book because it brought together two very different perspectives and experiences of the war, and even how people are still effected. I am an American and especially appreciated the point of view of the German boy.  Most of the documentaries I have watched and research I have done comes from the American's POV and all of the victim's experiences. While those should never be discounted, it was interesting to read something form a German solider's POV, even if it was a fictional writing. It still is enough to give you another perspective.
This is a wonderful book and I am not surprised that it won the 2015 Pulitzer for literature.  It is a new perspective on WWII, tracing ten years in the lives of a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy.  It goes back and forth in time, starting with 1944 and going back to 1934.  This adds to the suspense, because you know from the beginning that the two main characters will interact, but how remains a mystery. The writing is beautiful, and oftentimes philosophical.  It deals with war, both physical and emotional handicaps, horror, courage, and kindness.  It is not a fast read, but I heartily recommend it for anyone interested in the history of WWII.
There were parts of this book that I absolutely loved.  The characters had interesting back stories and had major potential for development.  One problem I had with this book is that this book could have been about 100 pages shorter.  There were pages of description that didn't add to the story line or their characters.  It bogged down the story line rather than helping it to progress.  There were scenes that could have been entirely deleted and the reader would not have missed them.  Granted, some of the imagery was beautiful.  It just wasn't necessary to add so much.  I enjoyed reading this book, but I'm glad I'm done.  It's not a book I would re-read.
A beautiful, lyrically written tale that expounds the ultimate good in mankind. The story is predictable as it alternates between the separate lives of two children as they grow into their teens before and during and WWII, and it is  understood  by the reader from the very beginning that they are fated to meet and that this meeting will be something positive. So as predicted, this meeting eventually transpires and it is a force for good. The author cleverly includes several chapters at the end that follow the characters into maturity and even old age, where events and encounters transpire that were not predictable and this adds greatly to the story line.
This book was very enjoyable especially since it dealt with a section of the war that I didn't know much about, the French coast south of Normandy. The details about events that led up to the end was very moving. I felt like I could really feel or see what was happening at that moment in time.It also shared experiences and thoughts from many different perspectives on both sides of the war and from many different age ranges. We learned about brain washing of the young men in Germany and the innocence and silent resistance of the people living in the small coastal town. I've read many WWII books but this one brought the realities of the war to life for me.
Already recommended this to several friends and all my family members. This book, from the beginning, takes your breath away.  The<br/>language he uses is so fresh and exact that the worlds each of the two main character experience come into high relief for you.  As episodes<br/>of the novel change back and forth between the two characters, you find yourself instantly into the character you left back sixty pages ago,<br/>for instance. A young blind French girl living in St Malo and a young German boy in training for military service begin to seem as if their<br/>perceptions can embrace the whole world.  Read it and you will see I do not exaggerate.
I could not help feeling for the characters, both empathy and apathy. One of the main characters is Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind girl, who is a heroine, and will tug at your heart. And then we have the orphan German boy who was more or less forced to attend Hitler’s military academy to learn brutal military skills because of his exceptional talent.<br/>All the Light We Cannot See shows the complexities of life and war.<br/>I liked the fact it had short chapters. Behind every locked door was another locked door with each door getting smaller.<br/>Jeannie Walker (Award-Winning Author) "I Saw the Light" - A True Story of a Near-Death Experience
This book is beautifully written with evocative and lyrical prose.  The parallel lives of the two protagonists as they approach and go through the rigors of WWII is excellent.  The only problem I had with it was that after following the lives of the main characters for most of the book the author snuffs one of them out without remorse.  Boom gone.  The book wanders around a bit after that before it ends.  I realize that such things happen frequently in war time.  Perhaps the seemingly random elimination of one of the protagonists was meant to underscore the fact that war is random and that individuals don't amount to a fig.  Still it was disappointing.
The story is well written.  The chapters, although short, are complete and alternate between the Werner, the German radio expert, and Marie-Lauren, the French blind girl.  The time is WWII, and the lives of the two protagonists are exposed.  The plot also involves magical realism with a legend behind a stone.  Eventually Werner and Marie-Laure's lives will intersect.  I found the book was both compelling yet poignant.  The questions posed are what would you do in time of war?  How do you defend someone who knows will be destroyed by the very system he/she believes in?  Finally, does anyone have the courage to stand up to tyranny in spite of great odds?
Poetically written, All the Light We Cannot See, presents a world-view that supports the preeminence of human spirit over materialism, good over evil, love over hate, courage over fear, light over darkness, and hope over despair. The crucible of World War ll is where two German orphans and a blind French girl grow into young adults, and find themselves assaulted by the insanity and brutality of war. Epic is proportion, this novel not only is a terrific read, but it raises genuine philosophical questions about what society owes its best and brightest children. Will it exploit, manipulate and destroy them, or permit then to realize their full potential?
I think the author put a lot into the story, and many parts were very descriptive and interesting. However, I felt there was an over use of metaphors and was hoping for an upbeat happy ending. Felt like the end just kind of hung there with no final conclusion with the characters.<br/><br/>Also, I was looking for more tension and plot, but maybe this wasn't the kind of book for me. Was some good ratings on it, therefore, thought I'd check it out. This may of been more of a female read to be truthful.<br/><br/>Book was unique though in the way the author described various scenes etc. Hope I'm not being too harsh, but I was looking for more suspense.
While visiting my daughter I read the book because it was the pick for the book club meeting at her house is a few days. Thank goodness I'm a fast reader because of the length of the story. There were many things I enjoyed about the book. My father was in WWII and flew bombing missions over Europe, so it’s possible he was in one of the planes dropping bombs in the area. I felt like the town was almost a character in the book with its architecture and the many unique people who populated the small city. I prefer stories that are more linear and less complex, but in this case it worked for me, even though none of the characters had a truly happy ending.
This is a remarkable book in many ways.  First, it is extremely well-written.  The scenes are finely drawn and very evocative.  The characters are full-blown and varied in both their own personalities as well as in relationship to other characters.  The separate strains that link them are so finely woven that when they do combine, it is both surprising and anticipated.  Hard to beat that.  Mr. Doerr also depicts WW II in a very different fashion, mostly by focusing on non-combat issues and gives a surprisingly deep insight into the psyche of "ordinary" Germans.  A very strong and compelling book, it is easy to see why it won a Pulitzer Prize.
It has been a while since I read a book that stays with me long after reading the last page. Too often, lately, the books listed on the top 10 reader lists have been well written but morally bankrupt. Anthony Doerr spent ten years writing this book and it shows. We become emotionally invested in what happens here and some of the characters are people with whom I would love to share a cup of tea and a long chat. We learn the hard lesson: that possessing moral courage in the midst of hell on Earth is every bit as important as physical courage, only more difficult. That this book has been listed on the top ten readers list restores my faith in humanity.
How many more WWII novels can be written and hold our attention? This beautiful work shows us that at least one more. I appreciated that a major theme was not the Holocaust; but the powerful bonds of a father and daughter, brother and sister made the more beautiful against the backdrop of Germany's evil. The book is rich in plot and sub plots, secondary characters and an intriguing mystery threaded throughout. The ending surpasses a pat Hollywood construction and provides the kind of bittersweet closure most often found in real life--those that can be transformed into the profoundly beautiful by the humility, grace and forgiveness of the human heart.
Devastating. Beautiful. Epic. Innocence. Redemption. Tragic. These big concepts are the foundation of this truly incredible novel. But its intricacies are what will make it an unforgettable hallmark not only in its genre but also in the hearts of readers. The story finds its way into your heart, and it doesn't let go lightly. It's a story of loss and misanthropy-- but it is a testament to hope, redemption, sacrifice, and love. I highly recommend this book- not just as an incredible stand out in the WWII genre but as a tale about humanity in all it's glory and devastation.
If you finished The Book Thief & longed for another work similar to it, look no further than this wonderful & tragic novel.  As a longtime fan of Mark Helprin, I was reminded of his writing style here: poetic prose, heart-wrenching emotion, plunging grief, soaring joy, and ultimately, the triumph of good over evil.  Your moral compass will be recalibrated as you vicariously experience the recruitment of orphans by the Nazis. And the depiction of the brave villagers in the French Resistance will remind you of the best of the BBC/PBS series depicting the same events. I would rate this my favorite book of 2015 so far, sure to become a literary classic.
I read this book because of all the rave reviews.  I was very disappointed in it.  I never became engaged in either of the main characters or in the story itself.  The writing is beautiful, but I felt I only knew what the characters did, not who they were.  He never described their thoughts or feeling to any great extent.  This was not helped by the author's writing one short chapter on Marie-Laure and the next short chapter on Werner, so you never really get into either one before switching to the other.  This is compounded by switching frequently to different points in time.  Eventually I realized I was totally not invested and stopped reading it.
Every sentence in this novel is a work of art. Anthony created characters worth cheering for, he showed me a part of history I never saw and lives that felt so real, lives that mattered. He moved me to tears and made me wonder who walked before me on the soil I stepped, whose memories were forgotten, who sacrificed their lives for me years ago and what they had to endure.<br/>Anthony, you made me a better writer. You showed me, "What a mouse must feel like as it steps from its hole into the open blades of a meadow." You showed me art.<br/>This novel is one of my top all five favorite books. Ever.<br/>Thank you for this gift of literature.
Extremely well written and so compellingly interesting that it was difficult to lay the book aside to get my work done.  The story had two main characters supported by a number of auxillary characters, some of whom had roles throughout the book and others who were more minor but still important to the story's plot and resolution.  While it was a fictional story about the years just before and during WWII, it was very believable, especially because, as in real war situations, everything didn't turn out well for all of the characters. The story showed both the brutality and compassion that resides in people and is definitely a story I will read again.
You will not know what you have missed if you do not read this book: so I will tell you.  You will have not read one of great books of the 21st century. You will have deprived yourself of one of the most engaging stories ever written about WWII, told in unforgettable fashion by one of America's great young novelists--a novelist who won the Pulitzer Prize for this book. So, don't wait, read the book that took ten years to write--a book that will at once connect you in a vulnerable new way to the war--a war that will introduce to you characters you cannot conceive and will likely never forget. Enjoy the journey--as you will return a different person.
The only negative thing I will say about this book is that it ends! Truly such an inspirational story that you want them to write between all the lines and tell you more... A beautiful story of all the struggles (both physical and emotional) that come with war. And a reminder that in war, everyone loses, the "bad" guys and the "good" guys alike. The innocent children politicians and war mongers  send off to manifest their greed and ego is ever present in war. Both a lovely, heartwarming story of a father's love for his daughter, and heart wrenching as you learn more about those struggling to keep hope and stay alive during wartime.
Everything about this book is a delight: the story line, the research, the development of the characters, the suspense, the writing. Quality books like these make it very difficult to find another book to read right away. The emotion it elicited toward the end was so strong that I had to put the book down for a short while. This was during a train trip in Italy and I found myself with eyes full of tears hoping no one in the compartment would notice. The turns of phrases are so beautiful. Examples: "She had maroon aprons under the eyes" or "Pushing the hood of grief..."  Bravo Mr. Doerr. And thank you for writing such a masterpiece.
One of the most absorbing novels about World War Two that I've read.  And i've read many.
I was looking for a good read before vacation.  I downloaded the kindle edition just before we walked out the door two weeks ago, and loved it!  I only had time to read in the evenings, but during the day found myself trying to sneak in extra reading time. The characters were great, unpredictable story, I really enjoyed having this story as a part of my vacation.  I finished the book in the last night at our hotel, in Boise, before our final push home.  At the end of the book, I read he author lived in Boise (!), so it really was the right place for me to end the tale.
The 2015  Pullitzer Prize for fiction went to Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See--and its easy to see why.  The plot is compelling, the characters, intriguing, and the prose, superb.  World War II continues to provide the setting and the impetus for great literature.  Added to the more familiar elements of the time are a blind protagonist, a mythic artifact, and the impact of radio frequency and triangulation on the war effort. For this work of literature, I broke one of my own "rules" of literature:  I did not wait for the availability of the paperback edition. And I'm so glad.  This is the best writing I've come across in ages.
I was generous in giving this book three stars because it was recommended to me by my daughter who "thought it to be one of the best books she had ever read"!  But I did not enjoy it because of the unstructured pace.  It was hard for me to keep up with what was going on, and I had to go back and reread pages again and again because I got lost in the jumping around in time and in  the plot and in the use of incomplete sentences!  For example: the chapter entitled "1944" came before the chapter entitled "1942" with no explanation. I finished the book, but I still have no earthly idea what the title has to do with the story!
Excellent book with a significant point to be made.  Basically it's about what the victims of WWII had to do to survive and build a life after the war.  The perpetrators, namely, the Nazis are humanized and not exculpated from the crimes and violence they caused.  If they showed any doubts or resisted, there was retribution.  Since eventually the war ends and victims and their enemies continue to inhabit the same world, they have to come to an accommodation.  It is a great story, well told, full of actions, suspense and suffering.  But some come out at the end to move forward in the aftermath of the senseless destruction of people and property.
I love historical fiction. This is an incredibly well written book. Fascinating story containing<br/>characters with depth. I loved the parallel stories of a young blind Marie- Laure in France and orphan Werner in Germany during WW2. Such a different perspective on so much of what we have already read and heard of that time in our history. Done with beautiful prose and description. I truly did not want to ever stop reading about the magnificent characters in this story. So many fascinating angles of that time in history that are all intertwined and interesting. Incredibly well researched. I will likely read it again and I do not do that often.
What I liked.  The development of the characters and the overall story.  I do agree with other reviewers that Doerr really developed each of the characters and the many plots; there was much suspense built up and filled with great detail.  What I really didn't like was too much character back and forth in terms of time.  Character events in 1942 could go back to 1940 and then back to 1934 only to jump forward to 1943-44. Due to this shifting, I just didn't feel it in the way of a good plot momentum.  The Jewel chase could have been much more impactful but was not.
I liked mostly the way it was written. The title as I thought, was quite thought provoking. The light that could not be seen to me was, not only the lack of Marie- Laure's sight but, the darkness of war itself. No light on the horizon of a terrible conflict. The way the radio of prewar Paris and Germany was weaved throughout the story, the children who listen to the broadcast from Paris showing what a wonder this technology was to them while at the same time, how a radio could be a lifeline on one hand and a possession that would cost you your life in other circumstances. Very well written as it goes back and forth between the main characters.
This is a rare story, the kind that will change you, suitable for ages from high school to grave. It is told in a quick to read but beautiful style,it paints pictures in your mind and drama in your heart. It will make a magnificent movie, like The Book Thief, and you will never judge people or how they lead their lives as you did before. Once you start reading you cannot stop. The author weaves two main yarns together, going back and forth in tme from pre world war 2 till the present day. One yarn is a bright German orphan, the other a motherless blind French girl, and the tapestry is completed by all the people around them,friends, relatives, neighbors and and strangers, the good and the bad, and how people can fall into both categories. That is why I say you will never judge people or their actions the same again. the tapestry is woven together in segments, forward and backward in time, going from the lives of the German boy to the French girl, until they are al woven together.<br/><br/>I like books that read quickly and easily, and if the author can combine this with superb writing of a story that keeps gaining momentum, you will have a book that can't be put down. If you read one book this year, I suggest this one. And like me, you will be anxiously awaiting the movie version.
I had a difficult time getting into this book. It jumps back and forth between characters and the writing is very detailed which can be overwhelming. However, I kept with it and I'm glad I did. The story is captivating  and unique plus there are a lot of great characters.<br/>I rated the book 4 stars not only because of the slow start but also I found the ending to be a little odd. I am glad that the author addressed most of the characters so that we know what happened to them but it still felt unsatisfying. When I turned the page and saw the book was over, I was just frustrated.  I was hoping for more.<br/>Still, it's a book worth reading.
Beautifully written. Tthe author has taken, from the perspective of a seeing person, a wonderful story and told it through the "eyes" of someone stricken with an unimaginable disability. The end result is a journey back 70 years to a time of great stress and sorrow for the people of France and all of Europe. The descriptions and backgrounds are as vivid to me as if I was there and yet the wonderful and courageous heroine describing them is blind. It will touch you and at least in a small way allow you to understand just how brave someone with this affliction overcomes the daily struggles of just getting through life.  BRAVO Mr. Doerr.
Wow! Surprised by how deep this was. Not sure what I expected: a blind girl, a german boy...sounds uber contrived.  But was pleasantly surprised by the depth of this story and the insights into both the French psyche during the occupation, and a fresh insight into what may have been a very typical German experience for those too young to have held strong political leanings.  Nothing sugar coated, but no gratuitous violence we sometimes expect when the word "Nazi" is tossed into the mix. Ugly realities, but again, nothing just for the shock value, simply to move the plot and deepen our understanding of the characters. Highly recommend.
Amazingly insightful complex characters before and thought WW2.  Located in both Germany and France the story gave due reverence to both sides of the people in the conflict, and while there were some humorous moments, overall the novel had a serious and sad stories that unfolded.  Beautifully written  I don't give 5 stars often but this book absolutely deserves it and more.<br/>I am so taken with the author's style of writing that  I have purchased more books and if this is the first time you hear of this author well I hope you read more of his work, they are different subject matter eg th Memory Wall - wow its going to be a 5 strat as well
Ive always been interested in war background stories thus this book is right down my alley. Powerful narrative of details, no shirking of description that sometimes vividly picture unsavory violent scenes of the tragedy of war, no matter where one stands for. The alternating venues and plots of the two central characters attract more interest and provide additional suspense.  A hint of romantic involvement sustains the level of curiosity and expectation.  At times, something lyrical creeps in and one hopes of its continued presence.  The story spans from the onset of Nazi power , rising in crescendo  till the denouement, at the end. Awesome.
This was beautifully written, with absolutely beautiful sentence construction. I especially liked the way that the author used a lot of sensory descriptions to relate the point of view of Marie-Laure, who is blind. The story is very engaging, tragic at times (it is set during WWII), and I thought the character development was excellent.<br/>My only dislike is that the time line of the story skips around a lot because a lot of the story is told in a series of flashbacks. This makes it a little onerous to follow the plot line. The chapters are told in point of view from alternating characters, and sometimes the POV jump is a little confusing.
All The Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr is an incredible book.  It has won a few awards including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  It is well deserved.  The author has created a story that describes life in France under the occupation of the German Nazis in such a realistic way.  His characters are so believable and the reader can see why people acted and reacted to the war in the many ways they did.  Each character shows a different style of personality and how people could either stand up to the tyrannical leaders that were demanding allegiance to the war effort or were caught up in the war machine and did not know how to break free.
The intricacies of this story are amazing.  After this, I'm going to read everything Anthony Doerr has written.<br/>This story wraps the reader in what it is like to be affected by war without being ideologically connected to it in any way.  The manner of relating the story is very effective, because life is made up of small incidents that shape our futures!!  Here are two young people who, above all, never lose their humanity.<br/>The language is beautiful, and I found myself re reading sentences and paragraphs just because they were so well crafted and moving.<br/>Wow - I just can't say enough, but over all, read this and read it soon!!
The Light WE Can Not See was a well written fictional novel which told the horrors of the German Occupation of a little town in France and the cruel drafting of young boys In Germany and the cruelty of the boys against each other if they did not meet up to expected standards of the Nazis. One of the main characters was a young blind girl and how she coped with her blindness and how brave she was working with the resistance. The book was very depressing but I could not put it down. It followed the characters until the Nazis surrendered and their lives resumed and moved forward with all the bad times never forgotten. It is a book of survival.
This book was inspirational and memorable.  One of the best novels I have read in years.
Wonderful book truly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.  It is elegantly crafted and superbly written.  The book is an amazing journey, and it is hard to put down once you pick it up.  The book explores the effects of WWII on the lives of people in France, but the book never sinks into hopelessness or despair.  it is a book of hope and optimism, and yet it truly portrays much of the sadness of war without drifting into maudlin.  The varied viewpoints of the characters help one to examine the extent of war's effects.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend this book to my friends.  It was recommended to me, and I appreciate that recommendation.
If I could give this book 6 stars, I would.  It is so beautifully written.  And the story is so powerful and poignant.  The prose is sparse, but seemingly perfect.  The author offers up two different worlds, both populated by simple but extraordinary people in horrifying conditions, and he blends them in such a way that you don't realize that the two main characters actually spend only moments together.  I'm no literary critic, I'm just a reader.  But this book touched my heart.  It will remain with me for a long time and will be a book by which I judge others.
This story is about two lives during the occupation by the Nazis, in France. Suffice it to say, if you like Historical fiction, this is "a MUST read." Like the diary of Anne Frank, The Book Theif, Sarah's Key,, these books tell a very sensitive story, All the !ight We Cannot See is such a compelling read,I couldn't wait to turn the page! When the book was finished, I felt as though I had lost a friend! Not only do I recommend this book, I can tell you it is now among those that I remember as one of those books I will never forget and it is among MY FAVORITE READS! You will love this book, don't miss this compelling wonderful book!
Considering that mr. Doerr did not experience the horrors of war his description of Marie Laure imagining<br/>The destruction thru sounds and smells is more than amazing, I was her age and I had my eye sight and the fear in crowded Bunkers often in the dark was mainly fueled by  the sounds of falling bombs and explosions.<br/>It was not always an easy read it was to close to home, but my admiration for Anthony Doerr is boundless I can't<br/>Remember a book that touched me more on every level, his knowledge, his imagination and attention to detail<br/>And last not least the sense of the soul of a child and what it is to be human. BRAVO
Anthony Doerr does a good job of creating suspense and anticipation in this novel. But what he ultimately delivers is unsatisfying. Given that, the technique he uses for the book--short, alternating glimpses of the two protagonists--comes to seem strained. Some of his imagery is similarly forced and lacking in resonance. Author William T. Vollman said it best in a review in the New York Times, "All the Light We Cannot See is more than a thriller and less than great literature. As such, it is what the English would call “a good read.” Maybe Doerr could write great literature if he really tried. I would be happy if he did." Me, too.
I thought this book touched on many issues we face as we experience the world. Questions that we Poe as children sometimes remain unsolved even as we age. We witness horrible things and try to find answers behind man's cruelty to one another.<br/>The characters came to life as well as the feelings of despair that come over us during times of war or strife. The bravery of the main characters and even minor characters contrasting with the cowardice and sadism of others makes the book very difficult to put down!<br/>I would recommend this book to others very highly. I think it makes us think about how we would behave in similar situations.
This novel has received so many positive reviews one must wonder if it is as good as all the hype. And of course if you have read it, you know that it is and more. Five stars doesn't quite do it justice. These characters are so engaging and so well-written, they take on a reality. You want to run to the archives to look up more about them, but then you can't because this is fiction. It portrays WWII as well as any novel I've read. Writing that borders on poetry often detracts from the story, but in this case it adds to it. The images are crisp and startling generates exactly the right atmosphere. I could not recommend a book more highly.
I thought of war as something distant,someplace far away where we sent our men and women  to protect us.  This book brings you the experience of the war from the perspective of an average citizen whose town is taken over by the "enemy".What is it like to live hidden away,without food,security,fresh air, community.  This book takes you to a community where the people find a way to fight back.  But it also let's you experience the other side.  The killing, the inhumanity,the barbarity of war and how people find themselves caught up in a life they never would have dreamed of living. I was engrossed in the storytelling from beginning to end.
This story may be the best noveI I have read in several years. he story has so much depth an emotion I needed to stop at regular intervals and digest what I just read. Another reason for pausing was to extend the time I could spend with Marie-Laure and Werner. To say the story involves the lives of two young teenagers caught in the strive of WW II in Europe would e misleading but it is the environment which Doerr describes intimately. There are so many layers one needs to catch one's breath often and shake their head at the beauty of the language.There may be those who do not like this novel, but most will wish they could write as well.
Even though this book started out a little slow and hard to follow with chapters dedicated to different characters who seldom crossed paths in the story, it began to climax in interest and became more emotionally engaging toward the second half.  The title seems appropriate because in this novel, you learn that what you cannot see, either visually, or in your life, can be the most valuable to you.  Also, what a sad commentary about all those survivors of WWII who lost members of their family while separated and who never found answers to where or how they died.  Doerr is an artist with his prose and makes this a a novel worth exploring.
I cannot finish this.  The parallel narratives aren't a bad plotting device, and they did hold my attention for awhile.  But the book reads more like a screenplay than the literary novel I assume the author was intending.  I was at first mildly annoyed and then ultimately distracted by the overblown prose.  Is this what passes for fine writing these days?  Mr. Doerr is a metaphor machine--but to no apparent purpose.  The often intrusive figurative language doesn't illuminate the story, and often seems offered up as simply a novel way of seeing things.  For me, it was pretentious clutter.  Too bad, because the stories seemed promising.
This is just magnificent. The writing is so beautiful that when reading you feel like you are gently pulled into each experience,<br/>Seeing what the characters are seeing and even feeling what they are feeling. The characters are so interesting and their lives so full. Written against the back drop of WW II the book could have been just another in a long line of wartime novels, but it is definitely not. Because the descriptions are so richly painted in such memorable prose, the reader will not soon forget any of the places or people. I will read this book again and maybe enjoy it even more the second time.<br/>Bravo Anthony Doerr!!
Outstanding story of two people whose lives intersect just once-at the very end of WW2 in France.  Most of the book is about the lives of the two leading up to their encounter.  He is a young communications intelligence genius working for the German Wehrmacht, she is a very young, blind French girl who is in the French resistance, sending communications to help the Allied forces.  Their stories leading up to their meeting are a light into growing up in a world going mad as Hitler tries to take over Europe and Russia and then loses it all.  As a reader, I was transported into this world and couldn't get out.  An incredible experience.
This book is absolutely amazing. The prose is poetic, full of beauty and verve, and the story is so deeply moving, tears frequently swam in my eyes or slipped down my cheeks. When I tell people how much I love this novel, I can't stop my residual waterworks. It's highly embarrassing, but a testament to how heartwrenching and pure this book is. I'm SO glad 'All the Light We Cannot See' won the Pulitzer Prize. This novel is breathtaking, beautifully written and incredibly powerful. One of those books that has left an indelible stamp on my heart muscle, a novel I can't wait to read again in the future, on and on for the rest of my life.
I wasn't sure about reading another book set in World War II era after recently reading "Unbroken." But this book had me hooked from the beginning and held my interest all the way through. Doerr takes you through the inner struggles and imagination of a blind girl, as she struggles to survive in a war torn France. The other character the novel follows is a young German boy, whose remarkable ability to repair radios takes him to the front lines of the war.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this author's style of writing. The novel is organized in short vignettes that shift back and forth between the characters and different places in time.
It was a great, well written, book.  I have just ordered another book by Anthony Doerr.
The characters in this book are unforgettable. Marie-Luce  had amazing determination and curiosity. Her father built a wooden replica of the town so she could find her way around much easier.  She was surrounded by an amazing amount of love from her uncle to Mme. Manic. They were part of the French under ground helping by sending messages to The allies. But the real story is Werner Frederick and also the giant. How difficult it was for a moral person to be a young boy under Hitler. The large diamond just adds mystery to the story  it is a story of good versus evil. It is a story about our longing for love and beauty. Very well done.
I do not usually read books with war as the subject. However, this book came very highly recommended to me, so I decided to give it a try. And I am so glad I did. The book was divided into short chapters, which I prefer. Each chapter brought the characters alive, and I could sense they were connected, but had no idea how. I knew it could not end well for everyone....war is like that! It made me keenly aware of the things I have and take for granted every day that would have been luxurious to these characters. History, life, death, romance, mystery and the resiliency of the human spirit were all brought to light in this epic novel.
When I can't wait to pick up a book and continue reading then to me it is a winner.  I loved the pace of this book as it had two stories going on and each one was truly great.  I actually could see the struggle the boy had with his own sense of integrity and the nazi way of life.  He was so torn and felt there was no real choice for him yet he did make a final choice and took a stand for what he knew to be right.  The young blind girl in this novel was equally absorbing and i found myself enamored by her grit and how she was able to stay alive and vital in such impossible circumstances... well written and quite incredible to read!
It was nice to see and alternative perspective in the war. The book was well written, I just don't particularly like the flashback style of writing that was used since I am only able to read a little at a time when I'm at work. It makes it hard to follow. The detail in this story is spectacular. I think it shows a very human side to the ones we label as "bad guys" in WW2. It made me believe that there were many people trapped in something they did not inherently want to be a part of. I learned so many things about blindness reading this book. Overall a great book, just wish it flowed more smoothly from chapter to chapter.
If WW II novels interest you, you'll dive headlong into this one, which focuses on a blind French girl and a German boy from a military academy.  This story drew me in immediately and kept me living in the time period, along with the development and discoveries of these two powerful characters.  Although the protagonists are both teenagers, this is not a teen romance, thank goodness, but an extremely well-crafted tale of two people caught in the grip of conflict.  Eventually their paths intersect, though not in an expected way.  The writing is sophisticated, and the intellectual gifts of the principal characters leave one in awe.
This is a fantastic read with an intricate plot, dynamic characters, and stunning prose.  Set during World War II, the narrative alternates between the stories of Marie-Laure LeBlanc, a blind French girl, and Werner Phennig, a German orphan. The juxtaposition of their tales does not confuse the reader; rather it adds to the suspense of what will unfold next in their disparate lives. The supporting characters are vividly portrayed, adding depth to a storyline that involves a key to a secret grotto and the search for a rare blue diamond. As Doerr pronounces, "War is a bazaar where lives are traded like any other commodity."
A beautifully written book; a joy to read especially for the language and structure and a page-turner for the well-wrought plot and excellent character development. While I selected "full of surprises" for the plot, there were plenty of twists. And while I selected "thoughtful" for the mood, it was also suspenseful and hopeful. Because of the juggled time frame, I was kept in suspense about what happened to the characters. The multi-sensory detail, the present-tense, the brevity of chapters, the shifting of settings, all contributed to the overall success of the book and made it fly by despite its 500-plus pages.
I loved this book.  It is so beautifully written and an eloquent, sensitive depiction of the horrors of war and how it affects ordinary people on both sides. It is also a wonderful portrayal of heroism, but shows how difficult it can be to be a hero in the face of evil. The descriptions of the technical aspects of radio communication during the war are  convincing  as is the author's writing of molluscs and things geological.  The structure of the book, going backwards and forwards in time can be a challenge but this builds the suspense so effectively. The blind heroine is so brave that I was moved to tears. Highly recommended.
Two characters, a girl and a boy have their lives intertwined during WWII, brought together, improbably by the thread of a mysterious diamond, and radio waves.  The author writes deftly, concisely and yet paints a rich and subtle portrait of these and other characters through the course of several years and beyond.  Its prose is accessible, its plot evident -- neither a dense or intricate read.  The book is a reflection on the war, told through images of beauty and tenderness, intermingled with cruelty and horror. It is satisfying on many levels, and sublime on many more that I am sure I'll discover on my second or third reads.
A powerful story, depicting two young people, that tells an emotional story of two very different lives lived during war. The writer shared the insight of what happens to children who lack parental guidance and are drawn in by disastrous leadership philosophy of tyrannical government and contrasted with a very loved child, though handicapped with blindness, who is able to persevere. Mr. Doerr is masterful as a story teller who weaves lives into his story of adversity. This is a read for anyone who appreciates the sensitivity of the human spirit. His command of vocabulary and foreign language is exceedingly skillful. What a book!
I was born just about the time this book started and felt some shared experiences with the two young characters. Of course, their hardships far outweighed mine, but still, for children, living through WWII was a formative experience. The author flexed his muscles in presenting character development and plot movement. At first, I had difficulty adjusting to the book's organization. But I learned to love the it and found the experience of reading it just a simple but profound joy..Somewhere in the middle of the book, the characters became people I knew and worried about, and I was really sad to finish the book. Sad but satisfied.
This is the story of a blind French girl and a young, naive German boy who through the course of WWII endure hardships, grow up, and eventually meet. There are many sub-plots which are well-developed. This isn't a story of WWII, per say, the war is only the background to the story. The book is very well written and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'm not an easy one to impress, but this author did it. The characters are beautifully developed. This is one of the books that "haunts" you. I can see why it was a Pulitzer Prize winner. The reader comes away from the book with the lesson that there are no victors in war.
I loved it. I can't stop thinking about it. I'm recommending it to all readers I know.
Wonderful story of two children during the War and how their lives endure difficulties
I agree with the Pulitzer committee. It is a page turner. It is a puzzle, and a thriller. Set during the  terrible World War, where a whole population of human beings were degraded and dispensed and destroyed and an entire continent  was torn apart. That is the darkness. The light is the humanity, the resilience and the intellect  of the main characters,the boy named Werner but mostly Marie- Laure and her family. Intricate plotting, well rounded characters, we are seeing from the point of view of outsiders who are dragged into the war, but who never belong there.It is much more than I expected which is why I rated it 5 stars.
For some reason, it took me a while to get into this novel, though I always recognized how well it is written, how clear and visual the language is, and how well developed the characters are. Eventually, I became fully immersed and found myself completely in the anxious worlds that he creates.  Perhaps it is the multiple timelines and plot lines that he weaves in and out of so frequently that made it a slow progression for me, but in the end, it is a wonderful, full and rich world that Anthony Doerr creates. One that is complex, and full of the sad contradictions of life. And one that stays with you long after the story ends.
It has been many years since I read a book I could not put down. A book I wanted to pass along to every avid reader I know.  A book I want to re-read soon.  All The Light We Cannot See is that book.  The writing is poetry.  The characters are complex and three dimensional.  The plot keeps the reader on his/her toes with it's daringly constructed flashbacks and flash-forwards.  To me, that provided a sense of memory.  Isn't that exactly the way our memory behaves--flitting from long ago to yesterday and back?  Anthony Doerr was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his creation, and it's well deserved.  A beautiful, beautiful novel.
I did enjoy "All The Light", despite not being a big fan of novels. The writing style put me off for a lot of the book, but I think I eventually got used to it. Way too many short, choppy sentences, 5-6 words each. Does that make it a “youth” book? Please, I think our "youth" can handle longer sentences.  The characters came to life quickly and it became a book I couldn’t put down. I think it was very well-researched and creatively assembled. Time line switches (easy to follow) were rampant. I could see that it left lots of open questions, good for a book club or classroom discussions.  I recommend it highly.
World War II and set in France and Germany.  The story of a young blind girl and a young German orphan and how they experience wartime in their countries and eventually come to meet each other.  Marie's father and uncle Etienne are exceptional characters in this story.  It is difficult to tell more without allowing the reader the have this exceptional story unfold for them as they read. But possible one of the best stories I have ever read and I will read it again to really enjoy the writing.  The descriptions of Marie's world as she "sees" it is so descriptive and she fully captures her world without sight. Read it!
I was just so overwhelmed and taken by "The Book Thief" that any other book in this space, no matter how creative, how unique, even if it is a different story (but in the same time period), takes 2nd place to that book.  However, all that being said, on it's own the book is wonderfully written and has terrific characters.  <br/><br/>The one thing that made the book less wonderful to me, was that the ending seemed to be "drawn out", that the book well, lasted too long. Not that I would change the ending, but I think the author could have made better and more memorable book had the ending been more succinct.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is perhaps because it was too long; I found the same hesitation when rating "The Goldfinch." Also, there were points when Doerr's lyrical descriptions left me breathless, and others that just dragged along a little bit. This was a love story about radio, the power of music, the life-giving metaphors of snails, and unlikely companionship. I couldn't help comparing Marie Laure's "release" to the scene from "Titanic" where the old lady heroine drops the Hope Diamond off the ship. Also I wanted more about Frederick. Still, a sweeping beauty of a read.
The author has woven a very powerful story.  Mr. Doerr, surprisingly, could have been more original when on page 162 he writes that a German soldier, Reiner Schicker said something amazing.  He said, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country”.  It is generally acknowledged that it was Nathan Hale who spoke those works before he was hung by the British on September 22, 1776. Anyone not familiar with Nathan Hale would be led to believe that it was Mr. Doerr who created the wording of that sentence.  The manner in which Mr. Doerr uses the sentence credited to Nathan Hale, diminishes  Mr. Doerr’s writing.
The story of children really -- who meet in very different worlds as near adults. Naturally friends -- but enemies by nationality. So glad Doerr allowed their childhoods to over rule the insanity of war for a brief moment. I found myself wondering and amazed at what it must have been like to be blind in that era. And what it must have been like to have a parent who toiled mightily to provide independence. A remarkable story of love in the time of hate, courage in the time of cowardice, compassion in the time of injustice, and wonder in the time of war. It's a testament of humanity in inhumane<br/> times. Beautiful story.
All the Light We Cannot See was an intriguing novel highlighting little-known real events in History as well as delving into the minds of geniuses and the melding of all the senses--a full spectrum--revealing things we cannot see when certain factors are absent.  Absolutely mind-boggling questions that cannot be answered were brought forward, but enlightening ones' imagination-- taking the reader beyond into a new dimension.  The very short chapters revealing different characters and the "back-into-the-future" aspects became a little confusing at times.  Wholly intriguing novel and mind-bending, but worth reading.
Just a fantastic book.  Deeply drawn characters that the author makes you understand and care about deeply -- a moving portrait of a terrible time.  Makes me appreciate the cushy life I have lived.  Very skillfully written.  Just the right amount of sentimentality -- not overdone, something that could have quite easily occurred given the subject matter.  Also, the right amount of description -- not overdone as so many authors who research the era provide.  I think the ending would have been particularly challenging -- moving forward in time by 60 years -- but Doerr does a remarkable job with it and ties things up nicely.
A great read, the story of a blind girl and a young man in the Hitler Youth Corp and the wonderful relationship between the blind girl and her father makes for a heart warming story along with the eye opening of the young man.. The Museum and the miniature houses used by the girl are so impressive and shows the dedication of the father to his little girl.  Complex, wonderful plot and the characters come to life and the story of the courage of the girl and the bravery of the young man portray hope for some of the humanity of the people in the war.  All in all, a "keeper" in terms of an excellent story...Enjoy it!
RIght up there with To Kill A Mockingbird as one of the best books I have ever read!!
I do wish there was a bit more to the ending, but other than that it was a great read
I was in Paris, writing about my mother, when this book was brought to my attention. I didn't read it until recently and it helped fill in the holes left out of my mother's story. She lived under Nazi occupation in Paris for 4 years and refuses to talk about it. I wish I'd read this book first because I would have known what questions to try and squeeze out of her.<br/><br/>I didn't want this book to end and to say Doerr is a gifted writer is an understatement. I read that he took 10 years to finish it and it shows. That it won the Pulitzer Prize last year is hardly a surprise. I'll be reading this one over and over.
I can understand why this book won the Pulitzer; the prose is absolutely beautiful, the characters are complex, and the setting/time feels very real and present. I found the structure of the story line to be a bit confusing, especially when listening to the audio version, and I'm not a fan of the time skips in the last few chapters. I also had a hard time getting into the mystery of the gem; I felt it didn't add much to the story as a whole.<br/><br/>I listened to the audio version and I thought Zach Appelman did an okay job. I wasn't overly impressed with his pauses and pacing, but he has a good voice for narrating.
I rarely rave about a novel, but this one is exceptional in all ways.  The writing is beautiful.  No words are wasted or used to call attention to the author's cleverness; every word served only to tell the story, took me into the lives of the characters, compelled me to keep turning the page.  This is a very close view of war, with a different sensibility, because the principle characters are children and experience things as children, and because one of them must use senses besides sight to negotiate her experiences.  A really good novel changes the reader in some way.  This has made me wiser and more compassionate.
I really enjoyed all the symbolism in this book. I also enjoyed the writing style- going back and forth between characters and time keeps me interested trying to realize where, who, how. However, it could have ended about 100 pages earlier. I usually enjoy long books but the last 100 pages were gratuitous. Not necessary. Especially the scene with the Russian soldiers. It must be difficult to write an historical fiction book about the holocaust without writing about Jews. There was one small allusion but never drawn out. While this book, and the writing style, deserves the literary awards, the story was lacking for me.
Anthony Doerr wrote this book in the present tense and gave us such pertinent and unusual details that we cannot help being drawn into the story. The story itself shows us the nature of human suffering in wars, for perpetrators and victims alike. And yet it's all from such unusual perspectives that the actual experience of living through such fear and chaos penetrates our emotional shields. OMG, to be living through that without sight. We readers get to explore our own fears, assumptions, dissociations. We also get to explore our own courage and resourcefulness. Doerr surely deserved the Pulitzer Prize for this book.
Where do I even begin with this magical piece of literature.<br/><br/>The way the author beautifully describes the scenery, the emotions of the characters, and the horrors of war blew me away. I loved the language describing the radio frequencies,repeating passages calling back to each other through time, and the little ways different unrelated narratives wove together and formed this captivating story. The perseverance of a blind girl, the terrible machine of Hitler's Youth, and the dark horrors of war for all involved came alive so vividly that by the end I was in tears.<br/><br/>Pulitzer Prize well deserved.
This is a compelling story of the hardships of WWII especially through the eyes of a young blind girl and an unrelated German boy.  The human interest side of how people fought back in small but meaningful ways was very interesting. The story of how the Nazis chose young boys to indoctrinate is compelling and chilling.  Even more so in light of how children are often used to fight today in return for food and/or feelings if self worth.<br/>  This is a worthy book to read but not a feel good story.  Hard to realize those atrocities that were committed did not inspire the human race to become better in many places.
It took a long time... Many chapters... and finally it grabbed me. Novels written from the viewpoint of two or more protagonists, switching from one time frame back to another, seem the be rather common lately. This one is even a tad more confusing than others I've read recently. But the story is so worth the concentration. The characters are so worth the sometimes excessively detailed and flowery descriptions and metaphors. A beautiful story about a time and place and events we must never forget. All the Light We Cannot See-- difficult to put down after the first 150 pages. Keep reading... You will be rewarded.
I know it may sound strange, but I enjoy reading books about World War Two. Night and The Hiding Place are two of my most favorite books, now I add this book to my list. Anthony Doerr is a very talented storyteller and does a great job developing the characters. You want to both laugh and cry at various points, sometimes within the same chapter. I also enjoyed the weaving of past, present, and future of each character throughout the book. It really kept me "on my toes" as a reader and I appreciate having to think. Overall, a great book. I hope that you will read it and not want to put it down like I did.
This author used an interesting style of writing going back and forward in time as well as getting into everyone's head. I found it a good read as well as one that gave me compassion for all sides of this conflict. Taking place in France and Germany during Hitler's reign, one could see the struggles of the people in Germany as well as those in occupied countries trying to survive. To be blind at that time put one at greater risk than others. of course I wanted "everything" and "everyone" to come out fine, but for this to be historically accurate that was not possible. Good insight by this author.
I can well understand why this book won a Pulitzer.  Fluid, lyrical writing - sometimes almost too many great metaphors, similes, etc.  What an incredible imagination Doerr has, although I've learned that some of the stories that I assumed were imaginative are based on his very thorough research into his story.  He didn't want to present anything that wasn't fit to the times and circumstances.  Therefore, it is a tale with parts that you might say could only happen in novel, but actually happened in real life.  A tender story, a realistic story, a moving story and reflection on war's effects on everyday people.
I feel inundated by the World War II novels, but am amazed at the millions of facets, the variety of lives this one time produced; it is so easy to see it two dimensionally.<br/><br/>This book gives short tastes of life inside one gear in the German machine. You can see the damage done internally to the German psyche as well as the horrors perpetrated on the rest of the world, a view not often explored or treated with much sympathy.<br/><br/>The French side of the book was more lyrical and as filled with loss as you would expect, without recounting every slight and cut the French endured during occupation.
An exquisite use of language, interwoven with historical events and personal history, making it as rich as any book I've read for a long, long time. The manner in which the characters are developed is by way of history, both personal and international. Certain scenes are described with such precision and clarity that they resonate, as if the reader had lived through them herself. The writing is cutting edge and original, yet full of literary references that weave the story together with a golden thread, with a sense of rhythm that keeps the book going like a symphony with its highs and lows, pianos and fortes.
This book is exquisitely written with richly detailed descriptions of places, things, and people.. It takes place during the second world war in France and Germany, telling about the lives of a blind French girl living in Paris and a German boy living in an orphanage with his sister in a mining town in Germany. It takes them through adulthood, and shows their feelings, thoughts, and questions about what is going on around them. It gave me great insight into the lives of ordinary people during the war.<br/>It is a long novel, but I couldn't put it down until i finished it. Now I want to read it all over again.
The writing is superb.  I was reading another book at the same time -- a NY Times Best Seller.  Although the latter was a good read, with fully developed characters, the depth and artistry of both content and characters in "All The Light...." is far superior.  It was difficult choosing  between "Hopeful" and "Dark" as the mood for this novel, as the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany are always dark. However, the power and strength of hope shown by the people in doing whatever they could to oppose the forces of evil even in the face of grave danger to themselves, to me, seemed to transcend the mood of darkness.
This was truly a beautiful novel, written with such detail that I felt like my own senses were heightened and I could imagine what it would be like to be blind. This book is unique in that, while it is a WWII book, it tells about the war from very different perspectives than most books - that of a young, blind, French girl, and that of an orphan German boy recruited to join the Nazis. The author goes beyond the intriciacies of the war, discussing the technology behind radios and their uses and bans throughout wartime, and the curiosity of a girl fascinated with sea creatures she cannot see. Truly great novel.
This book deserves the accolades it has received and Anthony Doerr's  readers throughout the world  await further novels by this extraordinary man and his articulate penmanship.<br/>This was my first Doerr book and within pages I knew I was about to enter a world shattered by the evils of war and hatred yet lifted to extremes of love and happiness by the introductions of the remarkable characters.<br/>The weaving together of the 2 main plots is superb  and you will laugh and cry as you realise that the two main characters must and will meet or at least pass within a heartbeat of each other.<br/>A rare gem.
This is a jewel of a book, the language, the story line , the amount of research that went into it...I couldn't put it down. In fact I forced myself in the last chapters to stop reading every once in a while, as I didn't want it to end. Plus I was crying non stop.<br/>I loved the fact that the chapters are short, although in the beginning it took me a while to figure out the dates and I had to go back to the table of contents several times, just to focus myself. Once I got into the book though everything fell in place-I am amazed at the author's  grasp of details and how everything tied together in the end.
This book was long and not an enjoyable read most of the time.  It wasn't until almost 3/4 of the way into the book that I was mildly interested.  I never felt really connected to the characters.<br/><br/>The back and forth through time is unnecessary.  I was telling a friend what the book was about (in chronological order) and the stories were actually interesting but the order in which things are presented in the book makes it confusing.<br/><br/>This book is extremely wordy and descriptive.  It is just too much.<br/><br/>I've read several other WW2 fiction pieces and this is the least enjoyable one.
This is one of the best books I have ever read. I could hardly put it down and did not want it to end. It takes place during WWII and tells the stories of two children affected by the war, one in Germany and one in France. The tragedy and devastations of the war are seen through the stories of the two main characters, who are children when the war began. Their very different experiences are alternately revealed through their experiences as the war goes on and on. Although they did not know each other and led very different lives, their paths quite accidentally crossed in the end with unexpected consequences.
As I was nearing the end of the book I learned that it had won the Pulitzer for literature.  I can definitely understand why.  First heard about it listening to NPR.  Very interesting story line dealing with the implications of the Nazi takeover of Germany.  Each chapter is very short...sometimes as short as two pages, maybe as long as five.  I found that after each chapter I had to pause and reflect on what I had read. Particularly insightful was the story line about Werner, a curious nerd-type who gets selected for an exclusive Nazi training program, and somehow manages to maintain his humanity to the end.
She lives in a gentle world of darkness, trying to make sense of the unseen brutality that explodes around her. The sounds and shocks of battle have ripped her simple parochial life apart. Werner enlists in the army as a way out of crushing poverty but the career path has turned dark and twisting. Each senseless death leads him closer to a realization of the absurdity of it all. The world will never be the same and Marie-Laure and Werner are icons for all that went wrong and all that might survive and prosper. The journey is twisting and intricate and the reader is in good hands as Mr. Doerr guides the way.
"All the Light We Cannot See" is a beautifully written, compelling story of two people who go through World War II and experience its horrors, and have a great effect on each others' lives, even though they do not meet until the very end of the war. Anthony Doerr delineates the characters in a way that illuminates their inner doubts and motivations as they move through situations in which their actions sometimes do and sometimes do not reflect moral courage. This is  one of the books I have read this year that I can recommend heartily. Everyone will enjoy the poetic quality of Anthony Doerr's prose.
Particularly liked the way the author made the war real for the German and French people.  As a child during that period and well involved in the war effort through rationing of most things, gathering money for donuts and delivering sandwich bags to the neighbors by bicycle to feed the soldiers riding the troop trains through our town toward embarcation points I never really thought about the civilian populations.<br/><br/>Appreciated the authors skill in depicting the events and the mind changes of the characters.  Excellent book, wish I had purchased the paper book so I could offer it to others to read.
A parallel story of a gifted blind girl living in Paris with her father who is the lock smith of the historical and natural museum. An orphan pair sister and brother living in Essen Germany during WW2.the boy equally gifted in science get swallowed by the maelstrom of the Hitler regime. Their stories collide when the war is coming to an end in a small coastal town in France. It is a lovely wrought tale about ordinary people caught in the misery and atrocity only war can bring. The story could have been told about any war in recent history, about greed, about forgiveness  and the eternal struggle for grace.
There are seven women in my book club. We almost fought over who would get the ultimate chance of selecting this book. March won out. We are all of an age that our fathers would have been or were soldiers in WWII. After reading this book, I wish I had been more aware of history to sit my dad down and have him talk to me and my children of his time in Burma. We read a lot of books but this is one of the best we have ever read. The prose is wonderful!  So much can be learned of not just history but the emotional and psychological elements of the time. I can not wait to go back to France and visit Saint Malo.
One of the most beautifully written books I've read in a while, complete with descriptions that are special in their lyricism and precision.  Somewhat epic in its spand of time, covering a torn continent through the eyes and experiences of two young people left at significant disadvantage in life.  While their worlds are painful, they are a pleasure to get to know in this subtle coming-of-age story.  The book itself feels just as unassuming, making the exhilaration it provides an unexpected one.  You almost want to stop and read everything twice, just to make sure you gave it all the attention it deserves.
I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  It was a fresh approach to World War II in Europe.  The author keeps you glued to the story by shifting back and forth between characters and story lines, a young German orphan who is recruited by the Nazis because of outstanding self-taught understanding of electronics to attend an exclusive youth training center, and a young blind French girl whose father works for an art museum, and who is entrusted with a valuable diamond-or its duplicate-as he and his daughter escape the Nazi invasion of Paris.  I've chosen this book to share with my book club, I couldn't put it down!
Beautifully written with human insight. Warm, sad without false sentiments.  A gem.
I sit here, half hour after I finished this, crying. This is one fantastic book! It feels like anything I might say would break the spell it casts over you. And I read it in two days....and I am ready to read it again!<br/><br/>Holy Cow! These characters, the setting, the subtly of the storyline. I can see how Doerr worked over each character, each setting, the nuances, the history.<br/><br/>I am not getting into the story. However, this is now my fourth favorite book of all time after Homer's Odyssey, Gone with the Wind and The Blue Castle by Lucy Maude Montgomery.<br/><br/>Please....Read this book
Read for a book club which discusses books with theological meat on their bones, and this book held up very well for that type of discussion.  Many aspects of the book will remain in my mind for future ruminations, not least of which is that even our enemies in one of the most heinous wars in recent past, the Holocaust, were often fairly decent, innocent people who got caught up in the machine.  Soldiers on both sides of many conflicts are equally the victims of those who mastermind organized murder.  It's a tough concept to swallow.  All who seem heroes are not.  All who seem devils might not be, either.
it was well written--the history beautifully presented of a time we should always be aware of and hope never repeated!!  The lack of<br/>vision and the coping of the limitations was skillfully composed.  The back and forth between the German outlook and the life and<br/>citizens of France and their views was facinating. Being blind almost made the young girl more sensitive and keen to be a part of<br/>the survival of her part of France. The descriptions of the streets and the sea and everything she remembered from childhood and<br/>then what she could feel and smell and hear when blind were wonderful.
I am not a war fanatic, and I rarely watch war movies or the books they were based on because I don't like the violence.  There is so much more to this book and the images of war are few.  Rather, this is a study of characters from varying backgrounds who find themselves thrown together through circumstances not of their choosing. These characters have to decide what their moral compasses are, and what they are fighting for or against.  I tried to read through the book quickly because my to-be-read list is so long, but I kept getting pulled back into the characters lives.  I thoroughly enjoyed the novel.
I really enjoyed the first of this book. It was well crafted with beautiful characters. Marie-Laure and Werner made for an intriguing tale of two young people growing up in the years before and during the WWII.<br/><br/>I was totally engrossed in their stories. I loved every page. The pace quickened until they both found themselves in St Malo during the allied bombardment.<br/><br/>Then came the conclusion.<br/><br/>I didn’t much care for that.<br/><br/>Regardless, reading this book has left me with two memorable characters that I truly love. I would recommend it for the beginning if not the end.
The story grabs you right away, especially if you have traveled to France or Germany, or are interested in personal dramas of WWII.  But its the way the author puts his words together that makes me recommend this book.  He is so emotionally descriptive and lyrical, I found myself going right back and re-reading whole paragraphs just for the pleasure of hearing the words and experiencing the sights, sounds and emotions he depicts.  I kept saying to myself, "I wish I had written that passage".  I think you will look for other works by Anthony Doerr when you finish this book, if you haven't already.
Absolutely beautiful prose, a fascinating unique interwoven tale of two intelligent and precocious adolescents--a French girl and a German boy--subject to the uncertainties and hardships of WWII, infused with deep insights into the nature of human existence in the natural world.<br/>Endearing protagonists, exquisitely descriptive--almost magical--phrasing, surprising plot turns, and accurate vivid historical backgrounds make this a very thought-provoking and riveting tale that is difficult to set down. Highly recommended for those wishing to experience WWII history through the deeply personal insights of these two very finely crafted characters!
I absolutely loved this book. I did not want it to end.  Our book club, The Finches...read it for this month and I am looking forward to discussing it next week at our month meeting. I have read many World War II books, but none came close to the suspense and wonderful characters in this story. The author had the ability to take you back to that time and have you feel the horror and sadness that the characters would go through. I found myself slowing down while reading this book as I did not want to miss the beautiful writing and I wanted to absorb the story completely. Sad, hopeful and wonderful story.
This book was recommended to me by another reader and I had not heard of it or the auther previously.  I was between books in other series I am reading so decided to take a chance on it with no expectations.  It had me hooked from the beginning and I loved the pace of the story.  The characters are extremely well written and it puts a new spin on a very well told time in history.  It is similar to a Ken Follett from the standpoint of being historical fiction so if you like that type of book, this would be an excellent read for you.  Even if you don't, the characters are so rich, you would still enjoy it.
The title gives little indication of what this book is about.  It gives the picture of two individuals as they survive the horrors of war from two different points of view.  The blind girl uses the resources taught to her by her father to live in France through World War II and the  German orphan boy who uses his talents with radios to survive through his view of the war.  They both learn much from their experiences and even meet  near the story's end.  The development of characters was excellent and the story moved back and forth between the two as time passed.  Then the title starts to mean something.
This book was a little difficult for me to get into, especially with the alternating main characters and the times jumps.  But the prose was so unbelievably beautiful - literally every sentence was stunning - and the story so heartbreaking and deeply imagined, that I can honestly say it is one of the greatest books I've read.  I'm onto another award-winning book now and it is such a let-down after this book.  I feel as if the main characters are still living in my imagination, at times I catch images of the scenes from this book in my mind as it was so vivid and intimate.  I highly recommend this book.
Anthony Doerr brings very human faces to the Nazi occupation of France on both sides of the equation.  This is a spellbinding novel that spans lifetimes in a style that is so succinctly beautiful it makes it possible to experience it all in a few elegant sentences.  I love the narrative perspective of the blind Marie-Laure.  Doerr lets us experience her world using only the senses she possesses; it is a remarkable feat of description from a truly gifted author.  Why only four stars?  I wanted a bit more fleshing out in the end where I felt the story waned.  Maybe it was meant to and I missed that point.
Best book I've read in years! I found myself actually having to tamp away tears so as to continue reading many sections - not because they were so sad but because they were so beautiful. It seems that it has become more difficult as the years pile up (69) for me to be beguiled into the world of a novel to the extent that I find myself looking forward to entering my bed early evening and indulging myself! This one did the trick - to such an extent that I was actually plagued by a sense of loss when I finished it. Why this was not trumpeted as the Book of the Year, Decade and beyond is, well, beyond me!
What we don't see do not become obstacles<br/> What we imagine is there can shed light on the obstacles. Fascinating story of two characters who are blinded thou differently, who find the truth of existence.<br/>Sound is the language of connection for one and of survival for the other. Set in World War II in the occupied regions of France created the background of perilous existence and blind obedience.<br/>Well written, interesting interplay of past tense and pluperfect tenses gives the reader the suspense yet knowing of what is to come.  You have to read it to appreciate how well it was written.
From the opening sentence, I wanted to be alone with this book.  No music, no distractions.  The writing in this book is so masterful and beautiful, I wished I could memorize it all as I read, so I could access the amazing words any time I want to.  Marie,Etienne, Papa, Werner and all the other characters remained with me when I wasn't reading because they were so elegantly and perfectly developed and presented.  Some books deserve to be read on actual physical pages instead of an e-reader.  This was one.  I read it on my kindle, but when used copies begin to appear, I'm going to own the book itself.
Fantastic read. Very interesting look into two lives during WWII. I fell into the story and didn't want to leave. It is one of the first stories I have read that combined the view of opposing lives as one.<br/><br/>If you ever wanted to see inside the life of a German Soldier during WWII, this is a nice start. Of course the read is fictional but I feel it is not completely off the mark. I also enjoyed see inside the life of someone feeling the occupation of the Germans. So many interwoven lives.<br/><br/>This is not a factual historical read but still enjoyable to let your mind go to that place.
I enjoyed the book, but the ending seemed disjointed after such detail all through the book it was rushed.  That and the fact that you never know what happened to a character that was such an integral source of inspiration - it felt unfinished.  I know that in real life families didn't know what happened, but fiction which focuses so much on a person should resolve it.  I didn't care much for the boy and thought the friendship with the giant was a distraction.  Overall though, I had strong visualization of the town, the house, the bread, the field, the voices at night over the radio.  Worth reading
This is a CLSC Book club book selection.  (CLSC = Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle)  I am pleased to read a historic novel that is fast paced, page turning, an insight into the setting and era.  The language of the writer is thoughtfully descriptive;  we can see the scenes and well as hear, smell, sense them based on the blind child's point of view.<br/><br/>A word to writers and publishers: I do not miss sexual content in well written novels.  This book is a page turner, a New York TImes best seller--plenty of other readers agree.  I can recommend this to my friends without disclaimer.
I found this a compelling story, though there were times where the seams were too visible and where the story lagged and I turned the pages quickly.  Unlike so many others, I was not in love with Doerr's writing, which seems overdone at times, though there were moments when his compilations of details really worked.  But I found the main characters--and even some of the minor ones--quite engaging, and I thought the author did an amazing job of conveying how might live in the world without sight.  And I loved the idea of how connections made via radio waves across long distances can be so powerful.
This is one of the best books I have ever read.  It is beautifully written and Anthony Doerr is pure genius, an artist with words.  I am so spoiled after reading his books that I want this quality every time; and there aren't that many that attain his level of artistry.  I loved the story of the little french girl, her loving father preparing her to adjust to her impending blindness, the historical aspect of the war, and the dangers she faced.  There is beauty in simple things and excitement around every corner.  A delightful book that I will read again!<br/>I am waiting for more from Mr. Doerr!
The author tells the story of a young girl and a young boy during World War II.  She is French and he is German.  Each is uncommonly wonderful, even heroic, in their own way, although they are not the kind of people you would necessarily notice in a crowd.  The details depicting the bombing and the chaos of war are incredibly vivid and chilling.  The stories of loss are heartbreaking. At the same time, against this horrific backdrop, there is such tenderness and sweetness.  But for me, the ending was disappointing.  Maybe that was the point?  But don't go by me.  I think it's well worth the read.
I love that the chapters are short. That made it very easy to read a little at a time. It did jump around a bit, which was a bit confusing at times. The first half seemed very descriptive and really painted the characters well. Halfway through it finally started to get interesting! Then, just when magical, unexpected, thought provoking events could have taken place, the author hurried through the ending. It was lackluster and disappointing! I like books that really come together in the end and make you wish you weren't finished reading. This, I'm sorry to say, will not be recommended to friends.
The gentle patient prose created the slow enduring pattern of the book. Each alternating chapter was from the viewpoint of either the female or male hero/heroine, with a few exceptions. The amount of research that went into early radios and the complicated instruments they became was fascinating. The horrors of war and the horror of Werner's school, the French resistance, food shortages, and shortages of everything was well portrayed. My only disappointment came with the books ending; Werner's death was the most difficult.  Marie-Laure working at the museum and her life into old age felt hollow.
This is a gem of  novel that shines a light on the darkness, saddens and gladdens our hearts, with its crystalline prose and indelible characters--a blind French girl who struggles to survive in a world that is crumbling around her in Occupied France in WWII and a brilliant orphan German boy who struggles between the love of his country and the horrific things that it is doing.  It is also the story of a series of  radio broadcasts that brings the two together and a diamond that according to legend makes the owner immortal and kills everyone around him or her.  Magical in every send of the word.
I am not a big fan of this book. My wife loved it, her friend loved it, people in the airport loved it, but not me. Here is why. Too too many distracting similes that last a paragraph, are out of place in a novel like this, and do not work. I would get into one of these paragraphs and start thinking blah blah blah blah. The story is excellent and that saves the book. I am not alone in my opinion of the overuse of similes. I recall one of Elmore Leonard's rules of writing that says "if it sounds like writing, rewrite it." So much of this book sounds like writing and is way out of place.
Fascinating look back at the German occupation from the human side.  My parents lived through this time and were reluctant to talk about things.  We've all seen the movies of the battles and heard of the huge human loss.  What this book examines is the effect on the children, those taken in by the "cause" and those unwilling participants.  It examines what is was like to have a handicap in those unsettled times.  This is a book I will re-read.  Not because it is light-hearted but because I see more nuances each time I read it.  It is intense and made me cry but I couldn't put it down.
I feel like I'm the only person who didn't like this novel.  The plot is full of holes:  hardships are hardships until they don't suit the plot any more, at which point they are easily overcome.  The diamond subplot was absurd.  It's oddly sentimental for a WWII story, and the characters never came alive for me.  I was bored and wouldn't have finished it except that I kept thinking I must be missing something.  I never did get it.  For context, I usually look for prize-winning books and books from best-of lists, and I almost always enjoy them, but I just don't understand the acclaim for this.
Children have such clear, untainted vision, they see the world and people, and the light for what they are. This story centers on one of the worst times in humanity, with the entire world at war and how the war effects the lives of two children, a little blind girl in France and a mentally gifted boy pulled into the Nazi youth organization.<br/>Their two lives are pulled together by the war and an anciant stone with a frightening and yet enticing curse.<br/>Doerr is a gifted writer with great descriptions and fascinating characters.<br/>I enjoyed the read but was disappointed in the ending
I am not a writer, and as such my review is not going to do this book justice.  I read a lot of books, but rarely leave a review for them unless I am so impressed with a story that I feel compelled to recommend it to others.  This is one such story.  It left me spellbound from the beginning of the book until the very end.  The way this very gifted author described France made me feel as if I was actually there.  The characters so life-like and relate able that when I reached the end of the story, I felt like I had to say good-bye to good friends.  Fantastic book that I would highly recommend!
Difficult to follow to begin with but very intense, powerful, moving, surprising.
As good as everyone says.  Deserving of the NY Times recognition as best of 2014.
Very well done. The first I have read by this author but I WILL be back for more!
Prior reviews suggested this is one of the best books you'll read this year. I agree. Beautifully written. Takes you inside the mind and heart of a lovely blind girl as she endures heart break and devastation of the latter years of WWII. I have been on a role with WWII era books, including Boys in the Boat, Citizens of London and A Higher Calling ~ all nonfiction. This intriguing novel is above them all, stylistically. The author has written a book of short stories and his short chapters here move from one period to the next, and is an easy read which sometimes feels like short story essays.
I have a short list of favorite books, and this is going on it. I consider it a masterpiece. I loved it so much I bought it twice: once on Kindle, then again on paper to have for easier reference.  It has a bit of a confusing start, but the writing is so beautifully engaging that this is of minor mention.  I recommended it for my book club's selection last month and, after persevering through the bumpy beginning, everyone enjoyed it.  It's a book that I will always think about and look forward to reading again and again.<br/><br/>The author did a phenomenal job with this work.  Thank you!
Just when I thought that maybe I had lost my love of reading because of a series of duds ( I talking to you Gone GIrl), along comes this wonderful magical book. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Anthony Doerr for restoring my faith. This book is beautifully written and tells a spellbinding story. A novel that takes place in World War II in France and Germany - who would have thought there was still original stories to tell? I highly recommend it, and the only thing I am just sorry for is that I have finished it. Boy I hope someone in Hollywood is watching - this would make a wonderful movie.
This novel, like many other WWII novels, presents the lives of those affected by the war. Unlike those other novels, this book takes us inside the lives of of the character as the war approaches, through the preparations, the brainwashing propaganda, the drilling and training, the shameless exploitation of young bodies and minds, through to the adult lives of those who survive.<br/><br/>The structure of this book is like the tide, flowing in for a time and out for a time, whirling and churning through the turmoil of war, hope, fear,  promises kept, promises not kept, love, and sacrifice.
Excellent book.  I just returned from a trip to the D-day beaches in France and this book makes the whole experience more alive. It gives an insight into the war from so many levels, including the Germans who were sacrificed as children and brainwashed in the process.<br/>While visiting the picturesque towns in Brittany, I wondered how the residents who had been under German occupation dealt with the allies invasion.  Such a hard choice to be free from domination but watch your homes turned to rubble.  This book gives some insight into that while spinning a wonderful and suspenseful tale.
All the Light We Cannot See falls into the category I refer to as "fine dining literature."  You'll want to take  your time and really savor the different colors, flavors, textures and all of the intricate nuances of the author's voice.  The stories in the fine dining category aren't just quick pops of flavor when you're hungry and in a rush - they are an experience.<br/><br/>It's been some months since I read this book and I still don't feel I can properly give it the worthy review it deserves.  It was, perhaps, the most beautiful book of the year.  The story unfolded with such delicate detail and beauty, that I frequently had to stop, read the words again, and close my eyes to soak it all in.<br/><br/>There are some books that are incredibly fine stories.  Then there are some books, like All the Light We Cannot See, which are works of art.  Anthony Doerr shot to the top of my favorites list early in the book and cemented his place there at the end.  Bravo.
The author uses strong active verbs and powerful descriptive language to help us understand the sadness and emotion of WWII in Germany and France. In the midst of war, human emotions remain alive for good and bad as those involved struggle to survive and live out their lives. At times the story is bleak, somewhat depressing, but at other times uplifting when compassion and kindness for others wins out over the desire to further ones on advantage. I would recommend this book for anyone looking to understand how it might have felt to live in Germany and France during those tumultuous years.
The structure of the book is an immense number of chapters, each a vignette, and most regarding a young blind French girl and a young orphaned German boy shortly before and during the second world war.  Each paints a picture of a poignant event in the person's development.<br/><br/>One Amazon reviewer felt more character development would have been better.  I disagree.  I felt the power of the work was describing how experiences during an extraordinary time would shape a person.  It allows the reader to use their imagination to ponder how they might have acted in similar circumstances.
Although some chapters in the book were hard to read because of the brutality they described in enough detail that I could not escape their harshness, there were other chapters that were sublime in their description of bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. The characterizations were stunningly original and consistent.  The story was hopeful on an individual level, with a key character growing in his ability to be compassionate, although at great cost.  Some details were wonderfully imaginative, while others were painfully cruel. This is a finely crafted book and utterly fascinating.
Beautifully crafted novel that portrays through the characters the tenuous grasp of comforts and life as we know it that can be snatched away in a heartbeat. The sad reality of war is seen from both sides brought down to individual emotional and ethical conflicts in the lives of youth manipulated into perilous roles of familiar human tragedy. It is so true politicians make war and press their deadly projects on ordinary people to provide their ego satisfaction. I can't say the ending was satisfying, but that is the nature and uncertainty of war. In the end there is loss to all humanity.
cannot believe this won a pulitzer. full of lame tacky, trite lines: e.g. Open your eyes and see light before they close forever! nothing ever happens in the entire book.<br/><br/>and SPOILER WARNING:<br/><br/>the girl nearly dies, protecting a diamond from going into German hands, and then no less than two hours later, she just dumps it into the ocean. Why? she may as well have given it to the German. there is absolutely no plot to the book.<br/><br/>the most boring prosaic writing you will ever read.
The pages are filled with characters we care about.  It is a World War II period piece that takes us back to what it was like to try to exist through that horror.  With characters that rise above the terror and do meaningful brave things that endear them to us.  There are also reminders of how low other people can sink through petty acts that can destroy others to being part of a mindless mob that revels in cruelty.<br/>Mostly it is a story of a blind French girl, Marie Laure and a German orphan Werner, young people forced to grow up too soon.  They will win you over.  Enjoy the read.
Best book I've read in a long time. I'm really impressed with the research in so many different and unconnected areas that Doerr had to do for this book. It truly stands out when you realize that it isn't a love story between a man and a woman but it still is a love story. The setting is during WWII but you aren't weighed down with the issues of the Holocaust. In that alone, it makes a statement that everybody suffered. It took two days after I finished it before I could pick up another book to read and at that I really didn't enjoy the next book - or the next for that matter - at all!
This was a good book but certainly not the best I've ever read.  It's very long.
This may seem contradictory, I liked it...BUT.....it was frequently laboriously slow. The "Flash Forward, Flash back, Flash around and around" usage was unnecessarily complicating and destructive  to an otherwise good (not great) story. The short and inconclusive "Chapters" destroyed all continuity or the development of any logical story line and flow. I would not recommend this to others, despite enjoying it enough to finish it, because I doubt that all those who start it finish it. I can see how one could lose interest and just put it down...I almost did a few times.
My favorite stories are where people are living separate lives in various locations, and fate, or kismet, or destiny brings them together.  Anthony Doerr gives us such a story.  It is war in Europe and we see the effects on Werner, a German orphan, and Marie Laure, a blind French girl who is being brought up by her father.  Their paths cross in a realistic way and we hold our breath while they extricate themselves from danger.<br/>The only technique that I found disconcerting was the trips back and forth in time between the parallel stories.  However, I found the journey worthwhile.
This was so different from most recent novels--it took great organization  to keep several stories developing in different locations and in different<br/>situations in wartime and to merge them so gracefully  and wondrously.  I especially was awakened to the importance of radio  both  to help save<br/>the war threatened  populations and to preserve  the optimism and hope and love of life in those able to listen.  They  took on  significant risk to so.<br/> It was that important.  The role of the miniature cardboard village  is whimsical but unlikely--so what, tt's a great story 1
I’ll start with, I love France (I speak French). I enjoy period and historical fictions. I like strong female protagonists and unsuspecting heroes. In theory, this book has everything I like, however, I did not like this book. The author’s use of time jumping is more of a nuisance than storytelling component. The symbolism throughout is too blatant to actually be thought provoking. There is also an entire subplot that seems to be irrelevant. Additionally, the author’s long winded descriptions at times seem like he’s trying too hard. I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn’t.
I have read many books a 2nd and even a 3rd or 4th time, but this is only the second time that I have finished a book and then immediately went back to page one to read again. This is now my ALL-TIME FAVORITE BOOK!!!<br/><br/>It is as if somehow Anthony Doerr lived the life of a young girl who could see, but then was blinded at a young age and lived everything she would have had to live through as she became a teenager and then memorized all that information and then became his normal, adult male self. I can't believe he would have so much knowledge of the situation any other way.
This is an amazing book!  I listened to to it on my Kindle (while I knit) and the narration is excellent.  I love reading about WWII.  Most of the books I've read are from the Jewish/Holocaust perspective.  This is not.  Many suffered from the Hitler regime...not only the Jews.  To write a book using first person of a blind girl in France and an orphan boy from Germany is unique.  The author's attention to detail creates realistic and vivid imagery in a way that few books capture.  Did I mention I'm listening to it a second time?  That's how good it is...don't want to miss anything!
By life's karma, a few days after finishing this wonderful novel, I happened upon a TV cooking show with an episode filmed in St.Malo.  What a delight to see this amazing seaside town restored to glory after the bombing of 1944.  I found that my interest and attention were always captured by this story, enjoying the feelings and perspective from both sides during that terrible time in history. I was completely immersed in the lives of the two main characters and although one hopes for a happy ending to a tale of such drama, I felt the poignant and realistic ending was perfect.
Beautifully executed with exquisite descriptions that took into account all of the senses.  The plot was captivating, intricately juxtaposing  times, countries, characters and subplots.  The story was so believable, with characters that remained true and seemed to mimic real life.  I found myself with tears, often, while feeling as though I was actually in France and Germany, accompanying these characters on their journey through life.  Putting down the book, after completing it, was difficult, not wanting to leave this world of "All the Light We Cannot See" behind forever.
This book was fantastic and all the members of our new book club felt the same way. We loved the detail and especially the characters, but we did not love the ending. Still, we concluded, World Wars do not always have endings we like. Anthony Doerr is a wonderful author, and from this book, I think he is a gifted researcher. I look forward to reading more of his titles. This is the first full-length novel I have read on my Kindle. The experience was enjoyable and using the tools on the device added to the experience so that I didn't miss not having an actual paper book in my hands.
I am not going to give a synopsis of this story since other reviewers have done that effectively. I fell in love with book because the beautiful prose took me inside the lives and minds of the two protagonists. I loved the constant switching between characters, their interactions with those around them. Let me address the complaint of historical inaccuracies: yes, they exist, but this does not purport to be a historical novel. The places and events are secondary to the characters themselves. As a historian, I'm careful to distinguish between the two in my expectations. Loved this!
At first I was reading exquisite prose, where I felt like each sentence was crafted to perfection. The writing is beautiful, but the story was bogging down. I was having trouble sorting the characters and flipping back and forth in time. I was blinded.  I may have put the book down at about 35% into the story. It was however, our monthly read for book club.  Then suddenly at 36%, perseverance paid off, I was hooked and accustomed to Doerr's style of writing. Read this book all the way until the end. It is a great story and a fabulous read which will stick with you for a long time.
A wonderfully written story of WWII. The characters were so real to me as I was reading the book. It is so easy to forget the horrors  of war and how easily a person or a nation can become taken in by a cause that is foisted upon them. The young people of Germany had no idea what they were signing up for and how devastating the end would be for each of them. I was about the age of Marie Laure at the beginning of the war and her strength amazed me. I was so happy that her life became so meaningful after the war. She offered us all what we can become if we but believe in ourselves.
I really enjoyed this book, but this review is difficult to write. The writing in this book is almost poetic. Maybe musical is a better definition. It's beautiful. Contrasting this is a diamond hard story. Even when the writing becomes simple, and I believe intentionally so, the story is painful. It is a side of WWII not explored often. There are good and bad people here, but mostly it is a story of decent people led to do evil, and also reluctant people deciding to do good. There is triumph and sadness; destruction and resurrection. I won't forget this story and how it is told.
Very interesting read that touches on many aspects of WWII that are not often the focus of historical fiction from that era.  Marie-Laure, the main character, is very well developed and provides many insights into the experiences of the blind.  The running imagery of the ocean throughout the book is vivid and beautiful.  Lives up to the hype and is well worth reading.  The first chapters are hard to get in to, but it gets hard to put the book down about a quarter of the way through.  My one complaint- not enough insight into the secondary characters of Volkheimer and Mme. Manec.
I suppose that I delayed reading this novel precisely because of all the hype about it, as well as the quick description of its plot as concerning the intersecting lives of a French girl and a German boy in the WWII Era...ho hum...Been there, read that.  Well, I've been wrong before, but not usually quite this wrong.  This is a beautifully written, compelling story of so much more.  I can add nothing to the many other s-star reviews posted here, except to urge that you other skeptics out there  surrender and read this complex, thought-provoking, deeply involving literary work.
Easily my favorite book of 2014.  Fully realized characters who were beautifully interwoven into the plot.  As for the plot, I don't believe I've ever read a book that delved into the lives of adolescents - both German and French - growing up during the occupation of France during WW II.  The author brings us into a world where the children grow up in a world consumed with war and hate, but somehow hold onto the shreds of their humanity.  The disparate threads of the plot are all brought together at the end of the book in a way that felt truly organic to the story.  A must read,
I am a fan of literary novels, and this one did not, all in all, disappoint. The overlong descriptions are part of the genre but would not be welcome in others. The present tense was a bit off-putting at the beginning but I got used to it. It became only noticeable when I went back to the book after a period (No. It's not a read that you cannot put down). I found the story itself most interesting, though the jumping around in time caused a bit of head-scratching. But even that turned acceptable because the prose is so strong. I definitely recommend this to literary fans.
This book takes the reader in a less obvious direction than most others in that you meet Individuals from all walks of life. You see how their lives touch each other over distance, chance, and the many circumstances that color their hopes fears and dreams.<br/> I found it a refreshing look at a tragic war as it touched each person rather than once again visit the greater horror of the masses. It stirs the emotions and leaves the reader with a better understanding of those who carried on<br/> I recommend this book to anyone interested in history or the human condition.
Doerr writes gorgeously. That's the first thing. Once you get past that, you'll find that this book have wonderfully sympathetic characters and an intricate story line that is a mix of history and a bit of fantasy.<br/><br/>The alternating point of view and jumps in the timeline can be a bit confusing, but Doerr does his best to help readers keep up. Also, I found the ending a bit abrupt, but that could just be because I didn't want to leave the atmosphere of Doerr's war tale.<br/><br/>This has become one of my favorite books and I definitely recommend it to all.
I have a hard time explaining why I rate a book the way I do. It's more a gut feeling. But I will try. At first, the jumping forward and backward in time bothered me but I got used to it. I loved the story, loved the characters, loved the plot and historical accuracy. I don't like the few foul words thrown in to prove it's an adult story. I appreciate the restraint during the rape scene. It's bad enough to know these things happened: I don't like reading it in detail. Still I would recommend this book. It was a lovely and poignant and at times even tense love story.
I liked most of the book, but as it went on, I felt it was losing steam and interest. Then the last 70 pages or so became unrelievably dark and depressing.  Finally, I felt a lack of closure at the end. Maybe that was what the author intended. I don't know.  I have always found the use of multiple narrators/lead characters distracting. I was not bothered by that here. But after all the build up in the characters, they were together a very brief time and they seemed more like bumper cars than anything else. I found the last 100 pages disappointing. I expected better.
An excellent read. Although I did not live thru WWII, it's stories have rippled throughout my life, firstly because both my grandfathers were veterans, but mostly because it has provided the backdrop for SO many stories and movies. It would be easy as a new writer on this topic to fall into clichés, but Anthony Doerr has produced something original and gripping with "All The Light We Cannot See". I had trouble putting it down so that I could deal with my real life! I recommend this book to anyone who thinks they've heard all about WWII that there is to hear.
Illuminating novel that brings you into the WWII world of the citizens of the little village in Brittany and the lives and strengths of a young blind girl, her WWI survivor uncle and the young, brilliant German soldier.  The author brings you back to a world at war and how that war affected the lives, courage and endurance of its participants.  Those of us who have never experienced the personal horrors of war will come away with a temporary experience of how war affects everyone involved and leads us to hope that we never have to find out the reality for ourselves.
This was one of my book club books and definitely falls in that pattern.  It was good, but for some reason the books that get 14,0000 five star reviews never seem to completely deliver on the hype for me.  The characters seemed wooden.  I was interested to see what happened to them, but I wasn't emotionally involved in their lives.  The endings met by the two main characters didn't make me particularly happy or sad because during the entire book I felt as thought I was seeing their stories unfold from a distance.  Six months from now I won't remember much about it.
Another great story of France during the occupation by the Nazis -- loved it.
Great storyline ,but jumping from past to present takes some getting used to.
If it is meaningful at all to compare novels, as different as they can be, I have to say this is one of the 2 or 3 best I have ever read (I'm nearly 85 and read all the time).  The conception of the design of the story-telling, the knowledge at the very beginning that the two protagonists have to meet but no knowledge of exactly how it will happen until the very end, the unsparing hideousness of life for some of those who endured W W 2, on both sides of the conflict, all work together to create a work that one can hardly put down.  Kudos in spades to Mr. Doerr.
All I can say about this book is that it reveals to us all the light WE cannot see.  Although one of the main characters is blind, light is used metaphorically in numerous ways.<br/>  But that isn't even half of it.  The historical research that encompasses this writing is both informative and personal.  It gives the reader a chance to reflect on war, it's consequences, and how it affects the lives of "real" people.<br/>  The day I finished this book, I heard on NPR that Mr. Doerr has been awarded the Pulitzer prize in literature. His is a well deserved honor!
For once we see the second world war from the eyes of young German boys pulled in to become soldiers and men far too young. We also see through the eyes of young German girls and French girls and French boys. The ugliness of the war fades in the wonderful imagery of the writing.<br/><br/>A story of WWII that asks us to look at humanity and our own evolution, to see while the instruments may change, the driving force behind their creation, invention and destruction remain amazingly alike. Ironically we learn to "see" much of this from young, blind Marie-Laure.
This was one of the most beautifully articulated stories that I have ever read - I perfect study of human motivation, relationship, and what happens when your inner self is tested beyond its limits. Empathy builds slowly for each of the characters, until by the end somehow you've come to believe that they are your brother, your sister, your mother... and somehow their thoughts and their action have begun a part of you.<br/><br/>A must read for anyone who loves stories, science, or history. And for anyone who doesn't, because by the end of the novel, you will.
Beautiful writing. Slow-paced, every word meaningful and perfect. Great description, but not overdone. Vivid characterization - one feels the characters are old friends by the end of the book. The plot is nicely rounded and complete; the book ends with both a sense of closure and a feeling of hope for the characters who live on. The exploration of things "we cannot see" is a powerful theme.On a more practical note, the importance of radio during the second world war is emphasized in the book, an interesting and thought-provoking aspect to the narrative.
Maybe it was the fact that there was too much French & German to deal with. Had it not been for all that I think I would've breezed through it without a problem. But I got stuck trying to remember who was who with all the French & German character names & places. Places were not as big a problem because of History classes. Names were troublesome. Aside of that, it would've been a 5 star rating. Thoroughly enjoyed the novel and storyline. The thought of having to go through a war as a blind person never had crossed my mind...much less a blind child! Great read!
Anthony Doerr creates a story that will seduce and shock the reader. His skill in creating an intimately felt appreciation for the characters and their experiences makes this book for me both compelling and real. As a period piece set in France and Germany in the latter part of World War II, the story both lifted me up and then covered me in the darkness of those times. This is a book that I devoured. It affirmed my belief in the human spirit while it created a killing ground where madness and evil ruled. This is a great read that will not easily be forgotten.
This is a powerful war story that is told from 2 opposite sides of World War II, with 2 very different voices and perspectives. In some ways it reminds me of my favorite war story (if 1 can really say that), All Quiet on the Western Front, but All the Light is less gory and more subtly brutal. The 2 main protagonists--young French girl and young German soldier--are well-developed and engaging as are their supporting characters. Though there are foretelling signs that their paths will cross, how their stories intersect is still a surprise. Well worth reading!
This is a story of war so of course there is violence. It offers an intimate look at the German school boys sent into the war as well as the French around whom the story revolves. Seeing through the eyes of a blind child and her odd little family as they experience life in war time and protect a secret stone is exciting and painful.<br/><br/>Some of the story around a particularly corrupt Nazi officer (is that a non-sequitur?) and some of the Nazi school boys as the story goes on were too long and repetitious for me. But the writing is exquisite and alive.
Great story and exceptional writing.  Every sentence is written beautifully.
No wonder it won the Pulitzer Prize. A beautiful, memorable and moving novel
Interesting book, too much detail however. The book could have been shorter.
The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars was because I didn't like the ending.
I am always interested in WW11 stories.  This was personalized, and a Novel, but pretty true as to the days for young Germans.  The way the war affected the French people was also pretty true to the way French people re-acted also.  ie, the Natives, trying to fight the Germans...doing small things, like info in bread loaves.  And short wave radio contacts.  It is known that very young males were used by the Germans at the last of losing the war to we Americans (Russians, & England.). Both the French and Germans are humanized, showing emotions in this story.
A page-turner from beginning to end! The characters literally leap off the pages and carry you through the story. It made me appreciate the stories my father told us of his experiences as a soldier during the 2nd World War. He said he would never forget the resilience of the French people and the horrors of war in your own backyard. I recommend this wonderful novel for all who love historical works that provide a window into how the actions of a few effect the lives of many. This book was an illumination of those tragic times and the heroic people involved.
The best book I have read in several years. It is a true feast to read Mr. Doerr. And since I grew up in France during  WWII, I can really appreciate his description of life in Paris and St. Malo. I am not a literary critic so I will not try to deconstruct the book. I could not do it justice. Let me say it is so touching, poetic and so incredibly detailed whether he talks about Werner and his radio, Marie-Laure and her shells, the life in Hitler's youth camp, etc. etc. As you read the book, you are there. It should be required reading in all high schools.
I was captured by the writing, the descriptions of San Malo and Paris of that time, the juxtaposition of the French and German<br/>youths' perspective, the myth of the diamond. I opened a google map of Paris and San Malo so I could follow Marie-Laure's footsteps.<br/>I remained captivated all the way to the end. In 1976-77 I spent five months in Germany, a month in Paris and three months in London. This book made me realize that 30 years later there were still two generations that lived through the Great War and carried that experience in their psyches.
One of the best stories I have read on WWII recently. The story focuses on two individuals, one on the Allied side, the other caught up on the side of the Axis. We meet these individuals when they are young and follow them throughout the war.<br/><br/>The story is beautifully written which draws the reader into the story, almost as if you are there observing all that is going on. This was heart breaking at times since I wanted to step in to stop things. And at other times I wanted to extend the time. The reader cannot be a casual observer in this story.
The best thing I can say about this book is "WOW."  This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.  It was easy to read in that the chapters were short, so if you have to pick it up and put it down regularly, that is not a problem.  This book brought many tears to my eyes.  The characters were well developed and easy to picture in my mind.  Some parts were so beautiful and heartfelt that I had to re-read them immediately before moving on.  I hadn't read any of Doerr's previous works, but I will be reading the rest of them now.
This was my favorite novel of the summer (and I read a lot).  Anthony Doerr interweaves the lives of several people who are separated throughout Europe, but connected by the invention of the radio.  Although their lives do not seem to be connected, the radio provides a medium for their connection in the same way that Hitler used radio broadcasts to appeal to reach the people of Germany.  A well written, surprising novel with full characters.  I have read extensively about World War II in fiction and nonfiction and I learned something new from this novel.
Doerr, using grace and insight, has written a tale both simplistic yet complicated.  Written in a backward/forward, present to past style, he weaves the historical, WW II, into something not only deeply intellectual but also ontological, as is demonstrated on page 419:  “The very life of any creature is a quick-fading spark in fathomless darkness.”  There are many sides to war, villains and victims galore.  Sometimes the villains are themselves victims.  This was an excellent choice for my book club and worthy of a permanent spot in my personal library.
Wonderful writing. Great story line.Well developed characters. I have read many books revolving around WWII and this one had a different and interesting slant. You saw glimpses two sides, German and French. I was tempted in the middle of the book to start skimming, there is much detail and a lot of the technical stuff re Werner did not interest me, but I was rewarded in the end by a well thought out story. I did not like the skipping around time wise, I had to keep reorienting myself which I find annoying but all in all, a great book. Well worth reading
This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. The depiction of the effects of war on the citizenry of each country in the story was realistic. Good things, bad things, random occurrences and convergences were probable. Doerr has created the feel of the circumstances. His characters are individuals, rather than stock characters. His tidbits of magical realism interspersed in the novel, as well as interspersals of science, created a sense of endless time, and made the reader feel as if he, or she, was  in the exact time.<br/><br/>I left the book as I completed it, but it hasn't left me.
For a long time I was not interested in reading this novel. The title put me off. It seemed a little too precious. Then a friend recommended it, then a brother, then a sister. I had a long flight ahead of me, so I picked up a copy and took it along. I am glad that I did, as I think the author did a magnificent job of describing ordinary people in a time of war, people who would otherwise have no quarrel but for their leaders. How war affects the average person is described to perfection.. Ultimately, this is a sad novel, but one I am glad to have read.
A great piece of writing that transported me to another time and place.  The author, Anthony Doerr allows us in to the fragile worlds of a young, blind French girl and German orphan boy as they navigate their difficult lives through the build up to and the horrors of World War Two. We see two nations ripped apart through their eyes.  Doerr allows us to understand the resilience of children living in the toughest of circumstances and see how some managed to survive, but all were touched deeply for the remainder of their lives.  This is an amazing story.
It is a captivating story of a French blind girl living in Paris and a German boy that is caught up in the occupation  of France by the Germans. With the love and help of her father the girl overcomes many of the problems of being blind. The young boy was destined to be a coal miner like his father, but he was fascinated with radios and displayed a talent for fixing them. A German Officer recognized his talent and had him accepted into the German Youth group. The story follows the boy and the girl through the war years until a crisis put them together.
This wonderful book revisits WWII and explores both some Allies' and some German characters with thoughtful treatmeant during a horrendous timet. A French father teaches his blind daughter to visualize the world of beauty and danger by carving city streets and houses. This becomes her salvation, when the Germans invade her land. Some German civilians and drafted military personnel were forced into roles that they might never have selected unless forced with the threat of losing liberty and lives. I liked the even handed approach of looking at history.
It took me longer than it should have to read this book only because I had heard a literary critique describing it as a love story during the Second World War between a blind girl..... It did not have a chance with me. But then, I saw the number of people who had read it and their comments and I thought it is worth a try. This is such a beautifully written book, with so many dimensions, breaking the mold in so many ways. I enjoyed it more than I have enjoyed a book since reading the Goldfinch. Yes, I definitely recommend this book. It is a masterpiece
A poignant story, superbly told. One of the best books I've read this year.
Loved it, a little like Anne Frank, something that we should never forget!!
A book I looked forward to picking up each day.  Thoroughly enjoyable read.
I'd give it 4.5 if I could. Beautifully written, but I wanted a little more
Eclipses Kate Atkinson's "Life After Life", unbelievable as that may sound!
All The Light We Cannot See is gripping. I set everything else aside one weekend just to read it - and it's amazing. Made me feel like I was there in Saint Malo during WW II. It jumps back and forth among time frames and experiences, which is a pretty unique approach, and which works well to compare life before the horrors of war and during the horrors. The gentle love in the family of the French  blind girl contrasted with the development of the Nazi schooling of German soldiers is wonderful. Vivid descriptions held me anxious for the next chapters.
Beautiful story with an unexpected presentation shifting from the perspective of two main characters as well as a third, and from their past, present and to their future. I took my time with it, the often dreamlike passages a marvel. There is nothing maudlin about this account of what so much has been written already. We know the outcome, yet this unique telling has made me understand more deeply what those who experienced the the Nazi occupation had to endure -- some far more unique than others. I will read the passages I highlighted for years to come.
For those who aren't fans of WWII literature, please know that I am one of you. And yet, this novel so far exceeded my expectations that I have told everyone I know it's one of my favorite books of 2014 and perhaps even makes my top 10 list of contemporary fiction. No, not maybe. It definitely does. The characters are unforgettable...the plot carefully crafted...and, it is such a rarity that Germans are handled as anything but evil Nazis...not in this book! So, on many fronts, thank you, Anthony Doerr, for such a beautiful, moving and touching novel.
4-1/2 stars. Fascinating. I always dread reading WWII novels because I know they'll be depressing. This was a special one and more eye-opening than depressing. The way the author crafted the story was ingenious--beautifully done. I enjoyed watching the two separate lives play out and intersect (in multiple ways). I could truly picture the environments described. I knew the main characters intimately. The writing was clear and purposeful. The story was surprising as it unraveled. Even the secondary characters were wonderful. I really enjoyed this one!
Quite possibly, one of the most well written books I have ever read.  I could literally see the colors swirl around me as Doerr writes of Marie Laure's visions and descriptions.  Your heart breaks as you continue to read of Werner's choices and thought processes.  This book opens your mind to the possibility of some Germans (especially children) ultimately not having a say in their participation of Naziism.  Personally, I felt the book could have done without the last few chapters, but overall, a book I will encourage everyone I come across to read.
This book contains some of the most beautiful prose I have ever read. The author puts you right in the middle of everything and allows you to truly feel what his characters are feeling. The characterizations are rich with feeling and multi-dimensional, not stereotypical. It was in fact so well-written that I would have to take breaks from it occasionally because it got to be too painful.But if you want to get a glimpse of WWII where there is no monstrous demon, but rather human beings dealing with tragic circumstances, then this is the book for you.
A marvelous writer.  An extremely unusual plot.  Centers around a young blind French girl and a young German boy during World War II.  Of course, their lives in the book begin in completely different circumstances.  The author portrays their development as they change from childhood to older youth - and as they experience the war's devastation.  The German youth's development is rarely portrayed in novels.  Also, important throughout the novel are wireless radios, birds' picture, and a valuable jewel.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.
I enjoyed this read very much. I had heard it discussed among friends and on the MPR book talk. My only reason for denying the last "star" is that I find myself increasingly less patient with the narrative that jumps forward and backward in time for reasons that I cannot see. Especially when reading on Kindle (which I did with this book), I try to "go back" to track a detail, thinking that maybe I missed something. When the book was done, all the loose ends had been tied, but I found myself doubting my own reading several times.
It is beautifully written about the Nazi occupation of France near the close of WWII.  A young blind French girl and a young German boy are<br/>the lead characters, although not necessarily together. The story makes the title of the book clearer as it points out  the average person's bravery and courage to act  to defend their country (in this case, France) from the Nazis despite the daily dangers of getting caught.<br/>  This book centers on secret radio transmissions hidden in French homes to give the Allies information regarding the Nazis.
I could not put this book down. Engrossing view of psychology and history.
Coulding get into it at the beginning, but when I did I really enjoyed it.
All The Light We Cannot see is a book that will stay with you Forever.<br/>It is smart and touching and of value, a book that everyone I know has So loved,<br/>it is a book for every age, no one could be dissapoited with it, it is a gift for us all,<br/>You might want to keep one for yourself, as it will be a classic,, but Do send it as a gift<br/>It will be a book that long after you read it and put it in your bookcase and then look up to it<br/>you might say, wow, that book was So great, I could read it Again!!<br/>Best,<br/>L stewart
Wow!  A fantastic read - absolutely loved this book.  The story unfolds at a nice pace and the author keeps you guessing moving back and forth along the course of the characters lives.  The descriptions were at times haunting and made the story all the more compelling.<br/><br/>The descriptions that surround Marie and her blindness are incredible.  This book reads a bit like a thriller with it's short pointed chapters, but it is oh so much more.  One of those books you can't put down.  When it is done you feel like you are missing something.
Some books rock you to your core. This books does that, and also sustains an emotional vice grip over your heart for about the final 50 pages or so. The writing is brilliant. Superb word choice and the way the story is told, out of time but so in rhythm with the flow of the dramatic art, is simply astounding. I never thought that I could care so deeply for a Nazi, but I love Werner so much from the first time I meet him. All the characters are so well done. Yes, it's another book about WWII, but it's not like any WWII book you've read before.
Beautifully written with poetic overtones. Rich descriptions—many almost tactile in nature. As a reader, I felt enveloped in the sights and sounds of the story's setting(s) and was close to actually feeling the characters' emotions. The book gives new insights not only into what it is like to be blind and navigate various settings, but what it was like to be a young German soldier during WW II. I especially liked the many analogies to the lights we cannot see; they make one think about ordinary things—coal, for example—in very different ways.
While I said hopeful, it is also kind of dark.  It's about war ... and gives pictures of some of the non-killing horrors of war, such as the thievery of people's property, hunger and thirst, rape.  It's very hard to imagine these horrors, let alone the violence that was so prevalent during WWII ... but it was a good story, filled with history, and, there was always the hope that everyone would make it ok.  There were a few surprises, a few sadnesses, a great deal of discomfort ... but over all a book that was hard to put down.  Great writing.
I cannot begin to conceive how to write a book about the senses and thoughts of a blind youth.  I do not feel I enjoyed the imagery to the extent that this author wrote. It did however educate me further about the atrocities that the Germans perpetrated on many of their youth.  I am of German ancestry and I have trouble faulting the many people that had no options but to follow the path of this inhumane society.  I can't point a finger of blame because of my biased ancestry. My hope is that we have seen the last of this tragic concept of life
This is a most remarkable book. One of the best I've read in a long time. Friends have said it was hard to get into but I have urged them to stick with it and see how it unfolds.<br/><br/>The characters are finely drawn and the story telling, which switches among times and places and points of view, is exquisite. I read it on my Kindle so was unaware of the length of the book until about half way through when I noticed that there was still a lot to go! And then, as the end approached, I did not want to say goodbye to any of the characters.
I have a really difficult time finding books and authors that I enjoy reading - so many have predictable plots and totally flat characters. So, when my niece recommended "All the Light We Cannot See" saying that it is the best book she's ever read, I was intrigued and downloaded it to my Kindle right away. Suffice to say, that I am in total agreement with her - it is definitely on my list of top 5 books of all time. Beautiful illustrative prose, believable and lovely characters, and painfully poignant beyond belief.<br/>A must read!
This story is so heavy with description and full of complex characters that immediately after its conclusion I feel compelled to read it again. The smells, textures and tragedies of war come streaming through a French blind girl, her father and great uncle, as well as two orphaned German siblings, all of whom are entangled through war and time. Don't start this novel if you have deadlines or are pressed for time. You will want the world to stop so you can be saturated with the simple beauties and persevering spirits that live in these pages.
Not my usual choice of reading material, but my book club wanted to read it. I can honestly say I'm glad I went along with the crowd. Not everything turned out the way I'd have liked, but it was worth my attention. The characters were fascinating and well-drawn. I found myself rooting for most—but not all—of them. Descriptive paragraphs were lyrical and often haunting, from Werner's depiction of the mines he longed to escape to Marie-Laure's exploration of the shells. A real think piece. I'll remember this novel long after I've finished it.
There are many books set during World War II that are told from different perspectives.  This one, with shared narrations by young people, was unique, compelling, and touching.  Told from the point of view of a blind French girl and a reluctant young German soldier, with the narrations moving back and forth in time, give the characters depth, a backstory, and the reader really cares about these people and those closest to them.  It's well written and certainly at the top of my list of favorite books.  No wonder it's on the best seller list.
This is a detailed and fascinating look at the lives of two young people in Europe during WWII.<br/>Each step of the way the author digs deeper into the lives of the two central characters. In doing so we learn more about the people who surround them and what motivates their actions. It is a powerful and suspenseful look back on a tragic time in world history. There were parts that made me shudder and parts that made me question how we respond to our enemies.<br/>This is not a quick, light read. It was a commitment. It did not disappoint.
A very interesting story of two sides of the war & take over of France.  The young blind girl who was taken from her home in Paris to live in a small town in France.  The take over by the Germans.<br/>The other side was the story of a young German orphan taken from the orphanage to be in the war at the young age of 14.  His story in his experience with transmitters & his horror side of the war.<br/>The book was divided by every other chapter being her story & the next would be his story.<br/>Another insightful look at the horrors of war.
I very good read.  I gave the author's writing a "good" but really wanted to use "Very Good" but it was not an option and "Excellent" I reserve for the truly outstanding.  There is "some violence" but there has to be since this is a WW II story including Nazis.  But it is not gross or disturbing violence.  I found the story telling to be unique and quite effective.  I especially liked the way the author jumped around between characters and locations in a way that kept a sense of continuity despite the jumps.
It was a long book but a fast read.  So interesting, wanting to get to the end kept me striving to reach that last page. At times, the writer would go back and forth in the years, I don't think it was necessary, just confusing.  Two young people that are strangers during this war, and wondering if and how will they meet.  It did not disappoint<br/><br/> our book club has read many books set in a war zone.  This is no different and we talked about that, do we want to read one more book involved in a war. The answer is YES, well worth it.
I read this book for a ladies' book club and really enjoyed it.  It is told from the perspective of a handful of different characters, and you get a German boy's point of view during WWII, which I don't think is a common thing in most WWII literature.  It really makes you see that many of the young men of that generation were victims as well.  The plot of this book is complex, but still easy to follow, with lots of small surprises and heartfelt moments.  Everyone in my book club enjoyed it.  It will really make you want to visit St. Malo!
Impossibly beautiful and poetic. The tale weaves in and out of the main characters lives and pulls you in at such an intimate level that you no longer feel you are reading the story, but you are there in the story observing. And understanding. The Germans of WWII become human. The French of the time are not weak, but courageous. And the children are victims but with every tragedy, comes a lesson. And the meaning of love at so many levels is painfully clear. A must read and one of the best I have had the pleasure to have discovered.
Anthony Doerr is a highly skilled storyteller with a great knowledge of many subject areas.  As difficult a subject as World War II is, Doerr weaves a fascinating story through a key corps of engaging characters.  I have always wanted to know more about the French Resistance effort and I was not disappointed.  Today's internet was their radio, transmitting so much more than the day;s news and weather.  This is an expertly constructed epic, alternately painful and inspiring. The story;s title is so rich in the work's many metaphors.
It's been years since I've read a book as engrossing as this one (and I read about two books a week year-round).  I don't remember from which "person's" view it's written, but it was all in present tense regardless of the time setting (which jumps around).  Superficially it's about two young folks--a French girl and a German boy--who's lives during WWII intersect.  the author effectively conveys the settings and mood without using long complicated sentences.  It's like being there.  Read this book at your first opportunity.
The plot of the book is good, embedded in wartime history of Germany and France. However, there are a number of things, which are implausable and could and did not happen.<br/>Examples: At these nazi education facilities, there were no prayers; the troops responsible for radio emitters, did not move from Russia to Austria, to France, they belonged to their wehrmacht unit. In Austria, which was part of the Reich, the Gestapo was responsible for illegal transmitters, troopers were not allowed to kill people  in the Reich area, ....
I am a great fan of historic fiction and this book did not disappoint. Anthony Doerr introduces each character separately and alternates between them. He also moves between the past and the present for each character, yet I never lost track of where I was. I got to know Werner and Marie-Laure so well that they became almost real to me. Doerr is a master of character development.<br/>I would recommend this book for anyone who is a student of World War II Europe, where this book is set, and enjoys fiction about this period as well.
This very well-written, and satisfyingly long, book was a perfect beach companion. I enjoy a book that is so well-developed that I can't run right through to the end in a short amount of time. As a beach book, I got tired of reading before I actually wanted to stop reading (if that makes sense), letting me feel that I got my money's worth with this book. My only complaint is that I wish that the museum-keeper's wife would have been fleshed out a bit, but she has hardly anything to do with the story, so that's just me being nosy :p
A richly written, compelling story of a young blind girl in France during World War !! and a young German orphan boy who is fascinated with science and small electronics.  The chapters alternate between the experiences of the young girl and her father, keeper of gems and artifacts at the French Natural HIstory Museum and the young German boy.  As the war progresses, their paths cross in surprising ways as their spirits seek truth and sanctuary in the midst of devastation. Beautifully detailed and evocative -- a novel for all time.
The best book I've read in a long time. The creative detail in the writing is amazing. The storyline is suspenseful and keeps you engaged throughout the entire novel. Other reviews have complained about the way the story line shifts back and forth in time, this was not an issue for me. In fact it helped build suspense and keeps the reader engaged to the very last page. I found it very hard to put the book down once I started reading it. It is much different than other WWII novels. A must read if you liked "The Book Thief".
Deeply moving account of two children's experiences during World War II in Europe...one French, one German...really brought the war home on a human basis and how it affected the civilian population.  So many books are written about the war and the soldiers who fought, but so few about individual people and how the war impacted their lives.  Many moral questions asked... and it makes you wonder how many thousands of other stories like this truly happened during that turmoil. I enjoyed this well-written, insightful book very much...
A beautifully crafted story that is captivating and moving. A must read!
One of the most intriguing books I've read in years.  Story arc was fab!
A very absorbing and interesting book, albeit rather depressing and sad.
Loved this book and wanted it to continue on.  I was conflicted between wanting to read it fast to see what would happen and wanting to read it slowly so it would not end.  In the end I read it pretty quickly.  It is particularly interesting to have a blind character, Marie Laure as her description of the world is from a completely different point of view, everything is touch and sound and memory.  The story of the two main characters was really truly delightful.  This is the favorite book I have read this year and I have read 6.
This was our February book club book.  The character development was very well done.  The way the author wove the two main character's lives together was also very well done.  However, it was one of the saddest books I have ever read.  No one came out of this story feeling good or even remotely happy. One of the reviewers had said that this was not just another book about WW II and Nazi Germany.  He would be very wrong, in my opinion. So, why did I give it 4 stars? At the end of the day, it is masterfully and beautifully written.
The worst part of this book was that it ended. Initially, I was not engaged in the work. Gradually, I found myself drawn deeply into the lives of the characters. The story has several layers of meaning through symbols and parallel  events. There is careful attention to detail and the author constructs outlines which flow together smoothly. This is great read justifying its popular position in the NY Times best-seller listing. Each of us possesses an ability to search within for life's meaning which is otherwise absent from view.
This is a beautiful story of hope and determination, loss and sorrow, set in France during the 2nd World War.  We follow a young blind French girl as she navigates through a world, once gentle and comfortably predictable into a tumble of unanticipated turmoil.  Intersected within this same timeframe a German orphan boy is recruited into the Nazi youth education school and witnesses horrors only war can make common.  Through circumstances these two young lives find a moment of shared space in time, and a candle of hope is lit.
I tried to come up with an applicable review, all kinds of adjectives popping into my head (amazing, beautiful, haunting, unique, soul-changing...)...but there are no words that I know to do it justice.  They all seem too shallow and empty to describe this masterpiece.<br/>I have never come across so many totally unique, beautiful, accurate metaphors in my life...I highlight and read them over and over sometimes, wallowing and relishing in them.<br/>This will be one I'll read many times...and definitely want the paper copy.
This is a well written story weaving together two lives during the gray days of  WW II.  It has suspense that keeps you glued to the narrative while it also offers observations on the human condition. The story raises questions about war and it's specific effect on the individual.  The author is able to describe what is happening to his characters and how they are being changed in response to surviving in grim conditions.  Beautifully told with emotion, candor and a deep appreciation for how we acknowledge and grasp reality.
A gut-wrenching novel so wonderfully written you don't want to stop reading.  The lives of a French girl and German boy are followed during World War II.  Because of the time during which the story takes place, the overall outcomes are known and this novel does NOT break from those realities.  But, it does give the reader a view into the impacts caused by those who followed fanatical Nazi beliefs had on the lives of the two main characters and the people around them.  Please, read this novel.  It is too well written to miss.
Held my interest. Human story in adverse situation. Warm and enjoyable.
Jaw dropping prose, imaginative, great story telling await all readers.
Good read, slow to get into but certainly a book I keep thinking about.
It’s hard to put down this tender, suspenseful, nicely crafted novel, set in WWII Europe. On the other hand, Pulitzer Prize winner? There’s the brave, clever blind girl, who’s part of the French resistance; the oversized German killer who loves classical music and has a streak of goodness; and so on. They’ll pull at your heartstrings, yes, but they verge on caricature. The sentence-by-sentence writing is lovely, the plot compelling… but I’m not sure it rises above a better-than-average, page-turning, heartfelt summer read.
Doerr uses language so well the reader easily imagines the grates in the sidewalk, the smell of cancer, the salt air; and senses the smug satisfaction of the residents of the besieged town set up a network of resistance. The constant use of numbers became a bit tedious. The switching back and forth in time was slightly confusing. The story came full circle and tied up all the ends leaving us wondering where is the flame? Doerr's language is sophisticated but not troublesome. A good book to have on your winter reading list.
I couldn't put this book down. I normally don't write reviews, but this book was so good I had to this time. It has interesting perspectives of WWII, while still including the information we all know about WWII without it being the main point (although, still very important to the book). The characters stories are very complex and well thought out, which made me enjoy the book more. I really enjoy that you find out what happened to (almost) everyone, mostly because I don't particularly enjoy books that end too open-ended.
I think the author is a very good writer.  It was very interesting how he captured the world from a blind person's view.  Of course, the historical period always offers a new perspective as to each individual's particular predicament.  It was of some consolation that Marie-Laurie  survived the war.  But, I felt a morose mood from the rest of the ending.  Especially,  the  demise of Werner.  I suppose the value of reading this story was in the broadening view  of this horrific war that caused so much suffering and killing.
This was a story that was less about the Holocaust and more about two different people growing up during this time, how they survived and endured and how the little things could make such an impact. It was a bit longer than I thought it needed to be and slow at times, but overall, I enjoyed the story. I liked that there were multiple pov's and that we went back and forth between past and present. I can't imagine have to live during this time and how I would have made it, but this was a story of survival, if nothing else.
The characters were deep and interesting and I liked the way it moved from the young boy to the young girls situations.  Of course the subject matter is dire, but to me I find great strength and hope when I see how strong, courageous, and brave these people were.  I was also very interested in the objects in the museum and the information about transmitters and science.  Also it was very interesting to see how the father taught his daughter to get around and be self sufficient.  I'm going to have my husband read it next.
A disappointment. It is often the case that ones expectations have been built up by reading reviews. This was probably the case in this book. Some of the prose is well written but the novel is over-constructed. Reads to me like one the editors had too strong a hand in. The movement through time adds little and may actually have ruined a potentially good novel. With the main character a blind girl - colour in the seeing sense are used far too much to convey the world she lives in. It is not a novel that I will return to.
The book was predictable only in that it was set in WWII, which has been done thoroughly in many venues.  However, although there were some parts that were quite graphic, it was restrained in its violence, and the characterizations and story plot were intriguingly interwoven.  It was not a book to enjoy, but to enlighten and inform, and in that respect it was quite fascinating.  I would not want to read too many books as dark as this one; however, it was well worth the time it took to absorb all the nuances of the plot.
The book is beautifully written.  The two main characters, Werner and Marie-Laure, found their way into my mind and heart almost immediately.  The author presents a contrast between the lives of the boy in Germany and the girl in France and how those lives were upended by the second world war.  I wondered what they could have been had it not been for the war.  Neither of them were political -- they just wanted to live their lives.  How true that is today of those who are caught in war zones.  Highly recommended reading!
I  cannot describe the many feelings I experienced reading this book. AND, reading it was like looking at beautiful watercolor paintings! I recommend this book with all my heart.<br/>The plot is of two children, one in France and one in Germany, their lives interrupted by WWII. The story follows them all the way through, and into their futures. I learned so much about life there at that time, and this book should be required reading for highschool students. History and lives so incredibly portrayed.<br/>Elaine Creaden
Sorry to say, but this book was a huge disappointment.  I stuck with it through the end....barely, as I wanted so badly to enjoy what should have been a compelling and interesting story.  Unfortunately, Doerr's writing style is high on exposition, and downright boring!  Frankly, I'm at a loss as to why the book was so highly reviewed.  "Sleeper Hit" might be the correct term, but for the wrong reason.  I could barely keep my eyes open
I hesitated to read this book...mainly because I didn't have the time to devote to the subject. But, once I got started, it pulled me in and refused to let go. I could visualize every step, good and bad, of Werner, Marie-Laure, Etienne, and the rest. I discovered new things about this awful war that I'd never heard nor thought of before. I read and read until it was over, anxiously flipping from page to page, slowly taking in each word. I highly recommend this book, and hope that others find it just as lovely as I did.
The first 165 chapters of this book are perfect writing.  The story is compelling with flashbacks that make the reader more and more eager.  Definitely Putlizer winner.  To my mind the book would have been even more extraordinary if it had ended with chapter 165.  All that came after was anti-climatic and unnecessary. Let the reader imagine what happens next.  Don't tie the whole thing up into a tight package that leaves no room for imagination.  Even so this is a MUST READ for everyone who enjoys writing at its best!
Touching and heart-written!! I want the blind girl, Marie-Laure, to be able to see; I wanted that throughout the whole book and of course, she is blind, so no...It's so very brave what she does with that seawall...I love the adventure in this young girl! And the love her father has for her is told in such a touching way...quietly but nevertheless, felt deeply.<br/> The young German boy, Werner...he is brave and heroic and you feel as if you know someone just like him in your own life.<br/>This is just a great book.
This is one of the best books I've read and definitely the best in several years.  It confused me a little at first because the timeline skips around, but that keeps the reader on his toes and added to the meaning behind the story.  The author's words are like a wonderful painting you want to stay and enjoy.  The sentences flowed into paragraphs which flowed into chapters I couldn't put down.  A very good story of different individuals which comes together in the end, and a delightful painting of two sides in WWII..
I enjoyed the book but the ending left it feeling a little unfinished.
The best book I've read in AGES! Truly wonderful.<br/>Just...READ IT.
A very slow start - it took me halfway through to get into it. I almost put it down for good a number of times, but the intricate character development is what kept me going. Doerr's development of the two main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner created incredible familiarity. He even had me connecting with the town of Saint Malo and researching it online. Although pleasingly unpredictable, the climax of the book was just that - the climax of the book. The ending was just slightly less disappointing than the start.
Was so disappointed in this book.  I was looking forward to reading it but the longer I read the more disappointed I became.  The book is not what the descripting led me to believe it was to be.  I thought the story would revolve around the blind girl and the German boy and their adventures together at the end of WWII.  The two characters barely meet for a few chapters.  I found the story disappointing on so many levels.  I gave it three stars but was leaning towards two.  Found it to be a sad and depressing story.
I enjoyed this book tremendously, very well written and moving.  Set primarily in Germany and occupied France during WWII, it centers on Marie-Laure, a young, blind French girl; and Werner, a German orphan in a poor mining town with prodigious engineering talent  which results in his recruitment to a brutal Hitler Youth academy.  At times depressing, as it gives an intimate look at the human toll of war (to both sides), but it also shows how good can persist even in an environment of such evil.  Highly recommended.
This book was riveting. The story moved back and forth in time and alternated points of view. It told the stories of two young people during WWII....one a boy in Germany and another a blind girl living on the coast of France. Despite the changing perspectives, it flowed well and never seemed disjointed.<br/>The characterizations of the major players make the reader understand and empathize with them. I felt immersed in both the harsh life of a German soldier and a vulnerable girl in the ancient city of Saint-Malo.
The most profound and beautifully written story I've read in ages.  The very best novels that are situated in human history enable you to "see" something ("Germans", the war, and a very special civilian) in a way that you couldn't before.  "All the Light We Cannot See" is among there very, very best in this regard.  It shows us that even in times of unspeakable violence and cruelty some people manage to sustain their humanity toward others, even "enemies", despite the circumstances.
This is one of the best novels I have ever read. It gives the reader a chilling personal insight  into the Nazi occupation of France, through the story of the young German electronic genius and the blind French heroine, her father, uncle and housekeeper. All of the characters are unique and beutifully developed. I do not usually read fiction - generally preferring non-fiction. I dowloaded this book on the recommendation of several flovers of good novels, and was grabbed from the first page on. This is a must read.
This is a lovely book.  Once I started reading I didn't want to stop.  Yet, the writing is so good I didn't want to skim over a single word.  Doerr is a master story teller so I allocated time when I could savor every word and linger over every scene.  This is a book worthy of a slow read.  I stayed up late many night just enjoying the story and writing.  What a pleasure!<br/><br/>By the way, I'm a naturalist and found all the nature accurate.  What a pleasure to find a writer who gets the natural history right!
A great book full of magics, the sort you won't quit reading until you've turned the last page. Old streets at Saint Malo... the alleys of the Jardin des Plantes in Paris...  forever inhabited by the presence of a blind girl and a German soldier boy, both linked beyond space and time by the thin thread of music and the mystery of coincidences. You'll be left there, missing them and lonely. And you'll seek their elusive touch on the stones of the marine city ramparts, the glass cases of the natural sciences museum.
I'm only 30% of the way through. And already know it will become a most favorite I will read multiple times. It's stunningly beautiful. I've gasped and said oh wow several times already. It's simply gorgeous. The short chapters make it for a great night time read, yet also make it tempting to read just one more before closing my eyes. I can't wait to keep soaking it in but am afraid of the sadness I will feel when it ends. I will be beginning it again as soon as I finish. Wonderful. Will go down as a masterpiece
The story lines in this novel were fascinating, the character development was excellent, but I found it hard to know exactly where in time the story was happening as it shifted throughout the book.  I'm used to time travel in historical fiction where the stories shift in time, but I have to say that this author lost me several times, for a short while within the text.  The ending was memorable - one that will stay with me for a long while.  If you like descriptive details in the writing, you will love this book!
Simply one of the best books I read all year...our book club selected it and we talked about the book for nearly ninety minutes...without exception every book club member LOVED the book.  One of our book club members, going to Paris, booked a train trip to Saint Malo for the day, just to be in the place so important in the book and see the town completely restored after the war.  I suggested he take a wet suit and go for a swim.  If you read the book, you'll know why!!!  Can't recommend this book highly enough.
This a beautifully written book, which I found full of expression and colour. I must confess that It was a little difficult to read in some parts but one had to continue because the story is so strong and the characters so well described. There is a bit of everything in this book for those that enjoy stories of the heart. The story of love, courage and determination of a young French girl growing up in war torn France is beautifully balanced by the hard life of a young German boy trying to find his way in life.
Since I have a propensity for delving into wars, especially WWII, I definitely enjoyed this book.  Author's writing, plot and historical authenticity were most definitely enhancing attributes.  What I did not like was a lack of intense scrutiny of main characters' authenticity, thinking, especially along the lines of values…e.g., why didn't "they" go to the aid of their friends and others who shared their feelings, thereby letting these people suffer because of the inaction that was evident in the book.
"All The Light We Cannot See" was a wonderful piece of historical fiction. The author clearly put an immense amount of detail into creating vivid imagery, and there was thorough research done about the history and geography of France during the war. I loved the alternating story lines and the jumps back and forth in time. My only true reason for giving it 4 rather than 5 stars was that I felt several of the key climactic plot points at the end seemed to be underdeveloped (or really just underwhelming).
Short chapters with alternating viewpoint seem to be the literary convention du jour, mimicking the changing scenes of a movie. While this can serve as a useful device for suspense, it can also interrupt the flow of the story, and I felt this to be the case at times. Because the exceptional writing was so dense and flamboyant, it almost got in the way of itself on a few occasions. The ending was a bit drawn out, too. That all said, the novel was a masterpiece in originality, poignant description, and research.
Other than for the history tidbits, I did not enjoy this book at all.<br/>From the beginning, I thought the idea of the young boy (was he 7 years old or so at the time?) teaching himself and understanding all the math was far fetched at best. I found the story contrived to make it work and forced to go full circle. I also did not like the writing style (I agree with another reviewer that said it was list, upon, list upon list...)<br/><br/>Maybe I've been reading too much non-fiction to appreciate fiction?
If I could give it more stars I would.  It has joined my top 10 list!
wonderful, poetic and very different insight into the frights of wwII
Great book until the end. Terrible conclusion and very disappointing.
I enjoyed the story development but felt that the end was too abrupt.
Best book I've read in ages! Doerr writes as a first-class wordsmith.
incredible!  Hard to believe what the world went through during WWII.
An intriguing tale of two young people whose lives are slowly drawn together for a few hours at the end of WW II by forces that seem to emanate from the radio transmissions that connect them  across the years,  In the end it is their families and friends that endure, and survive the horrors of war, and . the temptations of possessing things never intended for mankind.  You will be left with a renewed faith in the underlying goodness of people, and the importance of small acts of bravery to give life meaning.
What a wonderful book! The point of view was different from most WWII novels which concentrate on well known personalities or the horrors of the Holocaust. Doerr chooses to tell the story using people who are trying to survive the war. He also does a great job of using the light imagery without overdoing it. Some reviewers have complained about the book's length, but the war was lengthy. Although the ending was not tied up in a pretty bow, it was satisfying and believable. Best book I've read in a long time.
I enjoyed this book very much. The characters were wonderful. I learned a lot of history about the war, but it didn't feel like I was learning. In the beginning it seems a little confusing because the author goes back and forth between characters and time periods; however, it all starts coming together very nicely - so be patient with it. You get different views of the war and understand how people on both sides of the war felt. We read this book for our book club and every member enjoyed the book very much.
It seems the author has at one time been blind as well; how else could he possibly know the exquisite ability to hear what Marie Laure or any blind person hears that most sighted persons cannot.<br/><br/>I find this book one which holds me in the author's ability to bring out the nuances of thoughts and feelings of each of the characters.  He skillfully brings them all together in unexpected ways that show the vagaries of life and it's many twists and turns.  Shouldn't we all be open to such possibilities?
A novel that takes the reader to Germany and France during the ugliest of times through imperfect characters doing everything within their ability to persevere the atrocities of human bigotry and war.  You can't avoid being pulled into the creative artistry of the author "Anthony Doerr" as he details the scenes, the inhumanity and the love that the characters display in an attempt to survive from one day to the next.  I personally hoped it had a different ending... but fantasy escapes a great authors mind...
This is the first book I have reviewed and the first online review I have submitted.  I loved All the Light We Cannot See.  I might have given 5 stars but as I have not reviewed before and only recently turned back to reading fiction, I wanted to leave some room.  I could not out the hook down. The author's knack for interweaving stories of characters and time periods in their respective lives (set against the backdrop of the lead-up and aftermath of WW II Europe) is masterful and kept me engaged constantly.
This is one of the best-written and most interesting books I've ever read. I was extremely disappointed when this book was not included in my Amazon Unlimited subscription (it cost as much as a months subscription fee), but I'm glad I paid the extra money. The characters are extremely well-developed and the author is one of the most descriptive writers I have encountered. The word choices are extremely creative and stimulate all of the senses. If there were a six star rating, this book would get it from me.
I love historical fiction and this did a great job following two very different time lines of a young girl from france and a young boy from germany about life before, during, and after WWII and their roles throughout. i loved how each chapter went back and forth between their timelines and was very easy to follow from past and present. i definitely learned a lot more of what life was like during the war for everyday citizens as well as soldiers. i highly recommend it! great read! couldnt put the book down!
Reading  All the Light We Cannot See was difficult book to put down until I was finished it Doer's approach is very engaging alternating his narrative between settings surrounding two primary characters. What I found most fulfilling is his excellent character development, and narrative that paints vivid pictures. Using WWII as the setting he introduces numerous themes, and a story that gradually builds. While it is historical fiction, much of the book reads like a mystery. This book will no disappoint you.
What a wonderful book! This is the story of Marie-Laure, a blind girl living in Paris and Werner, an orphan living in a coal mining town in Germany. They live separate lives at the beginning of World War II who wouldn't in normal circumstances ever connect. The story tells about their lives leading to a fateful day during the war and the choices made. The descriptions of the characters, the people they know  the settings all weave to form a beautiful tale. This is a story I'd recommend and will read again.
This novel combines many great elements.  The writing is fantastic.  The narrative is unique--telling the story of war from the perspective of two young people who grow up through the process.  The metaphors of light, blindness, and ideology are artfully crafted.  My only criticism might be that the stories of the two main characters are not tied together until very late in the novel and the reader keeps waiting for the characters to come together, only to find that part of the story pretty anti-climactic.
Good: The novel actually succeeded in being a literary work.  The author managed to make me fall in love with the characters. I truly enjoyed reading.<br/>The Struggle:  The writing style in the beginning was stiff--but did improve as the pages turned. Pacing was also uneven.<br/>The Disappointing: The story arch was broken. Reaching the end, I mourned the lost opportunities to make the meaning greater.  I can't give this a five.  The author fumbled in the end. Though, it seems that this was the intent.
So it's a great story overall and I really like how the story continues well into the 21st century to follow these people's lives. The author is gifted with his ability to tell a complex story and weave the complexity of varying personalities, cultures, history, etc... Great detail and analogy throughout the book. I won't throw a spoiler in at this point...however, I have a problem with how one of the situation turns out...nothing graphic or horrible just a disappointment to me. Pick it up you'll like it!
I was torn between a 3 star and a 4 star. Normally if I can't get into a book in the first chapter I give up on it. My daughter recommend this book and when I told her I just couldn't get into it she said "honestly it gets better. Keep with it" so I slugged through 2 short " profile" chapters and she was right it did get better and better. The book is about WW ll. normally I don't read stories about WWl or ll, BUT the way this is written it's a whole new slant from a child's point of view.
This book left me wanting more, I could not put it down. I think I burned through it in about a week and the whole time I was holding out hope that everything would turn out for these two beautiful characters. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story full of struggles and growth. I was so raptured by the book and characters that my boyfriend was so tired hearing about them as if they were my friends. I've read it twice now and it is a great story the second time around as well.
The story was fascinating.  Alternate chapters covered the lives of two young teenagers -- a blind French girl and a German orphan boy -- as World War Two begins, and continuing as their stories become connected.  Touching narrative about families and about war, and the tragedy of children powerless to determine their own destiny.  There's mystery too, as Nazis hunt for French treasures to be sent to the Fatherland, and Marie-Laure becomes a target of a Nazi soldier determined to locate a priceless gem.
A different view of WW II.  Personal stories of individuals and how young and old survived this terrible time in history.  Somewhat difficult, especially at first, to follow the individual lives of the characters involved.  Switching each chapter sometimes left the reader trying to follow the story line.  But sticking with it, the reader became involved with the lives of the individuals and found it to be intriguing and anxious to turn the page to discover what was going to happen.  A interesting story.
this is the book that you might wanna stay up till 3:00 am in the morning as you are getting closer to finishing it.<br/><br/>This is one of the best books I have read in a while, I usually like to stay away from war topics novels but this book was an exception.<br/>Each page is full of beautiful, detailed and rich images.<br/><br/>The story is beautiful. One can connect with the story and be reminded of appreciating weaknesses and strengths in others, how to forgive and overcome the circumstances.
This was an excellent read. The author uses precise vocabulary allowing one to "see" the story, the characters, the city of Paris, the village of St. Malo with clear and active participation in the war and those involved in this narrative. I fell I know these people, could pick them out in a crowd. The story itself comes close to being the perfect novel; a serious story of war tempered by touching humanity. This book is SO worth reading. I shall read it again and again. Thank you, Anthony Doerr!
This was a book club pick.  I would not have voluntarily chosen this book, but it has shed light on aspects of WWII I had never been exposed to.  This book was enlightening, chapters short, characters clearly painted.  Only negative I found was some back and forth time periods that I found hard to follow on my Kindle.  If reading a book I could have flipped back to other chapters to refresh myself on the dates and locales.  On the whole, an intense book about the humanity of war and the different sides.
Doerr's writing is beautiful--lyrical, and the story is compelling. It is a bit difficult to go back and forth--not just from POV, but also from time period--on a constant basis. It tends to make the novel somewhat choppy at times.<br/><br/>That said, there is a lot to love about this novel. The two protagonists are very likable, and one does care what happens, not only to the two of them, but also to the secondary characters, as well. Beautifully crafted and the visuality of the language is amazing.
An interesting book.  An unusual story., well written, difficult to put down,<br/>It makes you realize once again, how strong the brain washing effect on  people  can be..<br/>Something that is happening in to-days world.<br/>At the same time a touching story of love and care of a father for his blind daughter.<br/>In the end the two stories come together, not in a cheap "happy ending" but makes you realize<br/>how good in people can  be stronger than bad.not withstanding all brainwashing.
This book broke my heart in several ways, not least of which was the elegant prose that seemed to lift you up above what was often difficult subject matter. I was amazed by the story's structure, and how effective and moving such short chapters could be. I think the description of the assault on the girls hiding in the attic shall be used as a benchmark for how to handle such a difficult passage with sensitivity, grace and hope. The humanity of the characters shall remain with me for a very long time.
Really great story that while it has it's sad moments, is overall not sad. Two things keep me from giving it 5 stars. One ongoing thread of the book was not really resolved, and while that makes it more mysterious, I just would've preferred something else. The main reason for holding back a star was the jumping back in forth in time chronologically.  Between that and the different character perspectives (which I personally really liked), it made it somewhat confusing to track. Still, a wonderful read.
One of the best books I have read. I have enjoyed reading this aptly titled book three times. You are able to see events as well as the hopes and dreams of the characters in the story. As with "The Book Thief", you see the lives of those on the other side in world war two. The author enables us to see that even soldiers who fought for the enemy, could possess purity and goodness. You get a feel for the humanity of the families on the other side.  Some  good, and some bad. I highly recommend this book.
I have been reading books about WW2 in Europe and the Pacific for many years (my father is a veteran of the Pacific War).  This book, while a novel, managed to bring the experience of that war home, not so much by exposing you directly to the horrors on a grand scale, but by alluding to the much bigger horror that was happening around ordinary people caught up in an insane global event.  It also managed to humanize the German people, while showing the collective psychopathology of the Nazi government.
Anthony Doerr has a delightful writing style. He uses adjectives and adverbs to great advantage. His descriptions are very vivid. The two contrasts between the blind girl and the Nazi youth are very interesting. I was very absorbed in the first part of the book. However I found the last part of the book somewhat slow and I had to prod myself to keep reading. I was disappointed in the ending. I will not spoil it for anyone, but after all that I wish it had ended differently with what they were seeking.
With every little turn I thought, aha this is where it's going. Not a moment to be bored. Time moved forward, backward and forward again. There was not a character in whom I wasn't interested. The author's knowledge of France radiated through the book -- and I appreciated every moment of it. He could take us from Alsace to Paris to Saint Malo and Normandy. What a trip.<br/><br/>The relationships grew and grew even after a character had died. Even Frederick's Jewish neighbor returned in her own way.
All the Light We Cannot See is the best book I have read in a very long time.  Not only is the story compelling but the writing spare and vivid.  I can picture the bombers, hear their sound.  I can "see" the little houses that the blind girl Marie-Laure can only feel.  And though Werner Pfennig is a Nazi, his story is compelling too and I ended up pulling for him hoping he survives the war and meets Marie-Laure.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know and some I've met along the way.
This book was very compelling and overall a great read.  I was disappointed in some of what happened just as the war was ending, but won't divulge too much as it would spoil it for others.  I will say, though, that what happened at the end of the war to one main character just felt like the author was trying to find a way to end things quickly and without explanation, where so much of the book did an excellent job of exploring the characters' feelings and thought processes -- this just seemed abrupt.
This is the most beautifully written book I have read in twenty years.  The plot is wonderful and shows the deep conflict humans face during perilous times.  I am not a person who reads a book more than one time, but I have already read this book twice.  The imagery is so powerful I wanted to remember it forever, yet the writer still gives the reader ample opportunity for interpretation.  Not seen in many books today. This is a moving story without explicit sex on every page. How refreshing is that?
It was an interesting story of the lives of two young people during the war and really opened my eyes to how people learned to cope with the circumstances.  I read it on my Kindle and found the author's year-flipping from chapter to chapter difficult to follow. I don't have a problem when a storyline reflects back to previous times, however, Doerr's switching back and forth in the early forties didn't really seem to improve the story.  Maybe it was just me . . . after all this book is a best seller.
Despite the often over used setting of World War II as a back drop to this story, the greed, insensitivity and lust for power not only responsible for wars, but times of financial crisis and other day to day failures, should stand as a lesson to all from each of the lives highlighted in this book: treat others as you wish to be treated, be kind, share what may be important to others to have and to know, and love with much sincerity. It will make a beautiful movie so long as the entire story is told.
The story line in this book is good, but I found it very difficult to follow because it kept jumping from one year back to another and forward to yet another year.  Also, one chapter was about one of the characters then the next was about a different characters, etc, etc.  I had to read it in small segments just to process what I had read.  I read a lot and sometimes can finish a book in just one or two sittings.  It would have been much easier to read if it just went through the years in sequence.
A delightful book, with a charming story.  Although very well written, it was a little hard to initially get into because the author skips back and forth not only between the 2 main characters, but also in the time-line, so, at first the story felt a little disconnected.  However, I would encourage the readers to stick with the book, because the second half is fascinating.  It provides a unique perspective into the lives of a young German orphan and a blind French girl in the 30's and through WWII.
I often find Pulitzer prize winners too heady and heavy for my liking but this book was perfect. It is beautifully written and the characters, particularly everyone including the two biggies, are fascinating. The intertwining of everyone's lives, combined with the desperate search inherent in each person's development is extremely well done. A very unique and refreshing story if you enjoy WWII historical fiction. Brought back the same feeling I had from reading Ursula Hegi's Stones From the River.
I can't recommend this book highly enough. I read it on a whim; it was available and I was bored. I generally dislike modern historical fiction, especially set in WWII so there was a lot not to like going in to it. But from the very first few pages I was captivated. Turned on Debussy's Clair de Lune for the last few pages, and yup, there came the tears. This has joined Neil Gaiman's "Ocean at the End of the Lane" on my list of books I obnoxiously shove at other people and demand they read
I started reading this book with no preconceived notions about whether it would be good or bad....had read no reviews.  After numerous chapters (they are very short), I realized that I needed to start again and focus on every precious word of it.  Two random, exceptional lives meet in the most surprising way this book. So much magic here with the radio, the diamond, the mollusks.  The writing is exquisite, the characters are almost mythical, and the story is almost epic.  I will never forget it.
I can see why this is a Pulitzer Prize Winner. The story is pretty slow but it is really interesting to hear the different perspectives of World War II. This is the first time I have read about a Nazi or German during World War II.<br/><br/>I like the parts where Marie-Laure reads other books and I love how "20,000 leagues under the Sea" was used throughout this book. I also love the story about the diamond and the curse that goes along with it.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book.
Beautifully written story about two children, both growing up with difficult circumstances. Doerr writes in such a way that the reader can almost imagine being blind and navigating cities by touch and sound. Although one character grows up and is trained to work in the Nazi army, the reader can't help but feel pity for Werner and appreciate his humanity. This was one of the best books I've read this year.<br/><br/>This book may contain triggers for some people, but instances are short and few.
I'm  not a fan of the writing. Story is two different stories at the same time - alternating chapter to chapter. However - it's been done successfully by so may other authors. Sometimes there is too much explanation and to many descriptions that the imagery interferes with the story and is difficult to follow.  I was finally getting into the story itself after three fourths of the way through..... little late for me.<br/>  Suggestion.... tell the story first  - then start describing everything.
This book just doesn't do it for me. It drags on and on. After reading almost half of the book, I find it so boring and monotonous that I just can't continue reading it. And, the premise of a blind girl surviving a war-torn France seems a little too far-fetched to me. It just keeps jumping all over the place which I find very confusing and I read for enjoyment and not frustration. I may try to read it again sometime in the future but for now, I will search for something I can enjoy a little more
This was a fascinating story, kept me on the edge all the way thru.
Exquisite! Written with an economy that only magnifies it's impact.
Very long; we're only half-way through but it's a compelling story.
It was riveting in sections.  At the start, I had difficultly following between characters and time periods and had to reread the first few chapters.  This is not a book you can put down for a day and then just pick up where you left off.  I also thought the stories could have been better edited - some of the scenes were unnecessarily long, duplicative, and did not add to the suspense or depth of the stories being told.  Yet, I did really enjoy it overall and its haunting tales stay with you. .
Well written! It really gave a much deeper perspective than you would normally read about two very different children who grow up on two sides of WWII in their teens to age 18 and the follow up is rich on how they got to where their lives intersected in the war.  Really well done plot twists about characters in their adult lives at the end.  It was beautiful, tragic, and told the story well of the brutality of war, hope, redemption, loss, brief moments where there is a spark of love and light.
I finished the book and enjoyed the story. Some of the descriptions were pretty gruesome, though very true of war. I especially liked the way I could get such good visual pictures from his eloquent wording. I greatly disliked the way events were presented out of order. Although it was sometimes cool to get a glimpse of the future, I consistently had to get my head out of the book to figure out how the scene related to the rest of what was happening. I could never immerse myself into the story.
This book offered true overview of politics, power, its influence, good and bad as well as all the gray in between! For nothing is black and white there are always shades of gray and Charles has an eloquent ability to inform, educate and back up his theories with tangible data. I would strongly recommend this book to all generations and especially to the new 18+ young adult voters. Freedom isn't Free and voters need to take heed when choosing a leader, of the most powerful nation in the world!
Of course it would not have earned the Pulitzer if it were not well written.  I really enjoyed the book. It has a couple of different levels.  One is the story itself. Incorporated in the story is a puzzle of sorts, required to be broken down to get to the center.  I think the book is also written as a puzzle.  The story twists back and forth as the puzzle does leading to the end. It is long but reads quickly and is one that if you wake in the night you reach for to just read one more chapter.
For me this was a book club book and I started it with some trepidation. However, I was quickly was taken in by the book and read it in three days, fast for me to read a 500 page book. I have an interest in WWII and this book certainly fed into that interest. I am also very much opposed to violence, and this book showed how violence is often random and disconnected from real world events. I encourage anyone to read this book and I hope they enjoy it as much as I did.<br/>Joe Stephenson, Albuquerque
A story that highlights the inner soul of humanity. This sad but beautifully told story is a cautionary tale about what can happen when we allow conformance to overpower one's sense of right and wrong. The characters are compelling, and the reader gets a glimpse into the complex emotions that can unite or divide us as human beings. This book is worthy of several reads. There are things we can learn from the choices and experiences of so many of the characters in this beautifully written novel.
The story was spellbinding and informative.  Much of it was seen through the eyes of a French blind girl, which kept us more in touch with deep feelings and made comparisons that sighted people might have missed.  The story alternated with another character who was a German orphan. He  gave us special insight into the personalities of those serving under Hitler, some vicious and others compassionate.I wished for a different conclusion to the story, but perhaps that would have been too unreal.
This was one of the most wonderfully written books I have read.  I felt fully immersed in the time period and the struggles of each character.  By keeping each of the main character's worlds so small and intense; I was able to more fully understand the horrific historical events that unfolded and impacted them.  The research the author did must have been significant in order to paint such a fully rendered image of the place, the people and the time.  Definitely in my top 10 of favorite books.
This novel successfully combines a lyric voice; World War II history; and time-shifting narrative to produce a compelling and touching story. The lives of two star-crossed soulmates -- the girl French, the boy German -- circle and entwine through the shattering history of Europe in the '30s and '40s, leading up to the climactic last-stand of Germany at the Norman/Breton city of St. Malo. The novel is full of fascinating historical and scientific detail, combined with beautiful human insights.
There were times the story jumped back and forth in time and I found that confusing.  overall I enjoyed the book and found the depth of the character development for each one made the story profound.  I recommend it to others who like historically based novels.<br/><br/>I would have underlined two passages that are in italic print rather than the ones highlighted that other readers had underlined.  I felt that other readers missed the point of the title and the significance of Marie Laure.
A reminder that the scars from one war lead to the horrors of the next one.  An even stronger illustration of how each person is constantly transmitting messages (in this case the radio is the recurring medium) to audiences  both known and unknown, intentional and unintentional.  Those messages ,travel in waves that have important consequences for those who receive them.  It pays to mold the message thoughtfully even if there is risk involved because there may be life and death consequences.
Absolutely one of the finest novels I have read in twenty years....the horror of mundane, institutionalized human cruelty we call wars, and the enormity of small kindnesses that redeem us. World War II never looked so surreal and real at the same time. A masterpiece of beautifully written prose, a riveting story line, that digs into the entrails of war torn Brittany and Germany.  This novel cuts to the quick of what it means to be human.  If you don't read another book for a year, read this one.
A long and twisting story graphically and incredibly descriptive written. Some chapters so hard to imagine humans endured such violent, turbulent times in the civilized world . The hardships lived out by a handful of characters during World War II in France and Germany. A bright young German boy and his sister, a blind French girl and her father and great uncle and all the people that touched their lives and some lived on to tell the tales of the effects of that horrible war on their lives.
I had very high expectations because the novel has been so well received.  It is clever and original. The blind girl's struggles were interesting to sort out, literally and metaphorically. I was less enthralled with the very sympathetic treatment of the young boy who becomes a German soldier responsible for the deaths of many Europeans.  He recognizes the need for human mercy early on, but remains largely ineffective.  Sadly, in war stories, there are always needless killings and suffering.
This is definitely a tale that moves slowly toward its climax. While I was fully absorbed in the intricate details (this is an exceptionally well written story), I did find myself yearning for the paths of the main characters to cross.<br/>When that inevitably occurs, I found myself fully invested in the characters and the events. This is a good read that uses terrific imagery (peppered with expertly placed vocabulary words) to unfold an interesting, emotional, personal story from the war.
I wrote that this book is hopeful, even though it takes place during the darkest days of the Nazis and occupied France during WWII.  The two main characters are wonderfully developed and the secondary characters are too.  The idea for the story and the perspective of this book is amazingly different and complex which adds a lot to the suspense of the novel.  I don't want to give anything away.....I highly recommend reading this book!  I'll definitely be reading other books by Anthony Doerr.
The story unfolded with happenings in the "present" and then flashbacks.  It kept the reader on edge as to how all the characters would be drawn together, and the main characters were developed in a well rounded fashion.  The ending did draw loose ends together quickly into the true present day, but in a satisfying way, not a fairy tale style.  The book was well written and focused on the lives of characters not generally portrayed in war stories.  It was enjoyable and well crafted.
really interesting story with a different angle than most WWII stories, I was particularly interested in how youth were brainwashed into the Nazi way of thinking and the way empathy was knocked out of the youth in those children's schools and camps.  Very interesting and believable and very sad.  First time I have really felt sad for Nazi youth!!  The other character in the book from an entirely different situation and surviving through the war is quite interesting also.  Unique viewpoints.
I am  attracted to  the genre of historical fiction  and this book was one of the most captivating I've ever read.  The story is about two children and their experiences during World War II. Marie  is blind and lives in France. Werner is orphaned and lives in Germany. The story shows how  the lives of both are greatly affected by the  indiscriminate  cruelties of war.  It is a perspective of war not often seen in war novels. The book is overall a captivating story that is hard to put down.
Very sensitively written. The author captures the life of a blind person & the terror of being stalked by a ruthless Nazi officer. I anticipated that Marie-LaURE's and Werner's paths would cross under the chaotic circumstances that accompany war but I din't know how it would end.The account of Werner's upbringin and training to become a Wermacht officer was fascinating in that they were children who were subject to the surviving based on being weak or strong. Thankfully he had a protector.
All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel, is not as intricate as it may seem. Although characters are well developed, the storyline is predictable.<br/>I found myself skimming over passages that revisit the horrors of war and the degeneration of humanity. I did like the main character. Marie Laure and her counterpart, Werner. For people who need a reminder about the history of the war in Europe during WW2, or to learn about it for the first time, this would be a good a good book to recommend.
Our church book-club has been reading this book.  It is a gripping tale, which really pulled me (and others) into the story-line and gave me a much more personal sense of what is it like to be in a war with conflicting values, emotions, and reactions.  My only direct exposure to war has been in Honolulu when Pearl Harbor was attacked;  I FELT Doerr's story as he ably describes the interactions between people caught up in conflict. It mak ponder, in a very personal way, the horrors of war!
The author is way to wordy. Hemingway would cringe.  But I took offense to a particular passage.  He describes a building on fire as being a holocaust. To me, that word only describes the mass murder by Nazis during World War 2. To use that word out of context in a story that takes place during World War 2 I found offensive. I know he was trying to describe the horrible fire.  But don't inadvertently make less of the horrible mass murder during that period by misusing that important word!
This is a very nuanced and engaging book. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
Wow! One of the best fiction books I've read on WWII. A must read!
Very intricate weaving of characters and events.  Beautifully written and I loved the short chapters changing from character to character.  The characters were developed so well that I felt that I understood each of them.  Had a hard time keeping up with dates at first but it all came together and understanding the exact date really didn't matter.  The setting inspired me to do a little research and therefore I learned something the same time I was reading for pure enjoyment of the book.  Thank you, Anthony Doerr, for tying up the loose ends.  So many books leave me hanging and this definitely did not.  And lastly, this book was a snapshot of the horrors of war and what human beings can do to one another.  It is good to be reminded.
Reading all the outstanding reviews, I was looking forward to loving this book. It gave an interesting and thought-provoking insider's look into the horrors of war experienced by two innocent teenagers.  While I enjoyed reading their alternating stories, I was frustrated by the endless descriptions of stars, heavens, skies, radio waves, etc.  Though I was very involved with the lives of the characters, these descriptions took away from my enjoyment. I am reluctant to recommend this book.
One of the children, a French girl, is blind but she sees as much or more of the pointlessness of war's hatred and waste. The others are German children: boys who become soldiers but never grow up because death destroys their bodies or war's horrors imprison them in an endless remorseless childhood, and girls who survive but never forget what they too have lost . All the Light We Cannot See is the beauty of a world without war, a world where innocence and love can thrive. Unforgettable.
Firstly, Doerr is a wonderful writer.  The story captures and holds the attention from beginning to end....there are no boring or slow sections to push through...a feat in itself. I loved this story which brings an originality to a world war 2 novel that is exceptional.  The characters were well developed, the historical foundations were informative, and the exploration of the internal motivations and dynamics of each major character quite satisfying .  All the makings for a great read.
I'm awarding four stars because I love any historical novel about World War II. This one has many merits, but also disappointed. The characters are well fleshed out and one is completed caught up in the story of the young orphan turned soldier and the blind girl. But their stories do no overlap enough, which I believe is the downfall of this novel. Having said all that, read this book. It is a page-turner and provides a lot of interesting background to yet another facet of World War II.
This book will take you on a journey well traveled through the historical events of WW II in a way that you have not experienced before.  Anthony Doerr's beautiful prose will enable you to feel the action, smell the scents and view the landscape that he sets before you as he leads you through the journey of two young lives who intersect in a variety of ways.  This is a great book to curl up with and enjoy your journey through the European countryside during WWII.  You will not be sorry.
Read this book after I read, The Nightingale... do not read these books in that order. The Nightingale was an amazing book based in WWII, I thought I would enjoy more WWII historical fiction. All the light wasn't as good of a read to me as The Nightingale. It didn't flow as nicely, it bounced around way to much and didn't make any sense at times. Based on the amount of reviews and highly rated reviews I thought this would have been just as good. For me and my reading likes it wasn't.
Set during WW2 and seen through the perspectives of a young German soldier and a young blind French girl.  While growing up and then fighting in the German army, the soldier is faced with moral decisions and the consequences of those decisions on friends and strangers.  When his life intersects with that of the blind girl, he faces the biggest test of his life.  Interesting plot with unexpected turns.  I was glued to the book for most of the 500+ pages.  I would definitely recommend.
This is a beautifully written book that explores the horrors of the Second World War in a unique way. I enjoyed how the author built from the childhood experiences of the characters, bringing it forward relentlessly until each are engulfed by the madness of war. A book like this offers something to those of us who wish to remember and honor the past for what it can teach us, those of us who will never ever endure anything akin to the terrors of that time. Surprising right to the end!
An interesting and enjoyable story that includes sympathetic and horrific characterizations on both the German and French sides during WW2, while not minimizing the horror of war nor the evil that was Nazi Germany.  My one very minor "beef" was that the source of the female  protagonist's blindness at age 5 should have been surgically correctible by at least the 1960s...but it was a page-turner that kept me up until 3:00 AM to finish the story, so fully deserving of 5 stars.
Refreshing to have a war story which is not a gore story per se.<br/>Even so, tension is maintained in an individual style; not least when we are brought into the literally dark world of  Marie-Laure, blind since a child.<br/>Pursuit of her father by the Nazi's ratchets the tension and yet the psychological tension is, for me, the more rewarding element of this book, despite the intrigue over the priceless diamond which helps to drive the plot while the characters are fleshed out.
This is a very enjoyable story but it is difficult to follow.  Most of the story line is composed of short chapters that jump between a French girl and a German boy caught in the grip of World War II.  Unfortunately the time line also jumps back and forth - 1944, '34, '44, '40, '44, ...  If you have to put the book down and pick it up another day, you can become easily confused. The book is very similar to "The Book Thief" - if you enjoyed that book you will probably enjoy this one.
Beautifully written and I will read it again, for there is more here than on the surface - the characters, the meaning of character development, the many metaphors that require thinking.  The plot keeps you waiting for the next development and the characters will never be forgotten.  Themes of war and its effects, poverty, hardship and how it can make or break a person, love that can save and enhance a person loved as well as the lover, courage to overcome the pressure of the crowd.
Anthony Doerr's account of a blind French girl and a German boy set on intersecting paths during the run up to World War II and through the war itself is a the same time one of the most engaging and wrenching books I have read in a while, but the ending redeems what could have been a hopeless tragedy. Lyrically written with convincing detail, the book builds to a sad climax that I wished didn't have to happen, but stories like this were repeated time and time again during the war..
Exceptionally vivid writing - the emotions it evokes are amazing.
WW II - the real one, as seen and suffered by simple people on both sides. Doerr presents rich and endearing characters who manage to be heroic in their strife to survive and help others, including their supposedly enemies. and whose flaws can be turned into strengths.  Though it spans from 1934 to 2004, it goes beyond the historical period to embrace the hearts and minds of its characters and readers.  Definitely, a must-read if one wishes to aprehend all the light we cannot see.
This book was a poignant reminder that we are all human, that politics and war and economy and class are but constructs we have created to separate us and, in the end, we are all the same. Pointed yet gentle, grueling yet tender, Anthony Doerr manages to make the background of an atrocious war the simple reflection of our own yearning for love, understanding, and significance.  This novel is actually uplifting, offering hope and promise when we question our very ability to endure.
This book just received the Pulitzer prize, and it is well deserved.  The story is compelling and informative.  The research makes the story come alive.  The plot goes back and forth between the characters and I kept wondering how/when they would intersect.  I have talked about this book more than any other I have recently read.  Fantastic story, characters, and narrative with a gripping plot. This is a great book prior to a trip to France or a terrific beach read.  Don't miss it!
Our Book club selected this beautifully written book. Such a lyrical quality to the descriptions, vivid, textural and such painfully poignant characters (hope that doesn't sound too corny or cliched).  I did have a bit of trouble keep up with the non-chronological sequence of the storytelling.  that pulled me out of the story at times, trying to regain my focus and engagement.  It became a late night page turner (or rather listen as I downloaded it in audible).<br/><br/>Big wow.
A beautifully written book, told in alternating characters as they are caught up in WWII. All of the characters are deeply explored and the lyrical writing makes this a rapid read, for a long and somewhat complicated plot. Initially, I wondered if the lovely writing obscured the horrors of the time, but ultimately, I believe it allows us to experience the human response to a time of unfathomable cruelties. Great writing, great characters. A book that made me think and experience.
Suffice it to say that the author transports you into the worlds of two people form different countries and on opposite sides placed in the same town at a time of war and heartbreak. The story is developed in a way that is totally believable, from the childhoods of both protagonists through the time of their meeting...it is the kind of book that once you pick it up you cannot put it down. I won't say more because anything stated about the plot will only mess it up for the reader.
This is a well-narrated story of the human strength of spirit to survive the Nazi occupation of France.  We see young boys survive the harsh conditions of the SS training schools.  A blind young Parisian girl hides in her uncle's home in the devastated city of San Malo while her father's life is in danger because of his knowledge.  The story builds slowly but becomes gripping as the the realities of WWII close in.  The descriptive details create a vivid experience for the reader.
I'm not really sure what to say about this book. I thought it was beautifully written. I thought the flow of the story was solid, and I enjoyed going back and forth between Marie & Werner. The character development was very well done. There are many books about World War II, but maybe I enjoyed this one because there's not an American in sight. I loved reading the different perspectives, French and German, and how the whole experience was different. I highly recommend this book.
This emotional story about a blind girl is gripping in such a way that I could feel my heartbeat quicken.  Any author who can deliver a story like this is a star in my opinion.  As I read this type of book I always worry that my questions about the outcome won't be answered.  That was not true here, although there was one item (like Hitchcock's McGuffin?) that remained mysterious at the conclusion.  This is a book I will reread as soon as I catch up on my other unread favorites.
This is a book that follows two young people, one male & one female who navigate the changes in the world during WWII. The young lady is a blind teenager whose father works at a natural history museum iin Paris. She & er dad escape to a coastal town in France. The young man is an electronics genius who escapes from his orphanage in a German coal mining town o help with the war effort with his brilliance with radios. Twp wonderful resourceful kids that I was happy to get to know.
A young blind girl & a Hitler youth. Two completely separate lives eventually become entwined to the latter days of WWII by a transmitter, an electrophone, a phonograph record,  an antenna, and a voice... One helping with the Resistance and the other believing in the Cause and the Fuhrer.  Their stories slowly unfold and evolves as they grow into adulthood in just a few short years.<br/>I was quite enthralled by both their stories and the many years that followed after the war.
An amazing story of courage and love. The details made me feel like I could actually hold the miniature cities in my hands and find my way through the cities. The way the author entwined the lives of the characters and brought them together was entriguing and captivating. I couldn't put the book down. Someone on my flight to Hawawii recommended this read to me and I immediately downloaded it to my tablet. Thank you to the author. I have just downloaded another one of his books.
This book is better than most, if not all, WWII fiction not because of the beautiful writing or the developed characters, but because it's honest. I see a lot of reviews that complain of a bad or unresolved ending.  The reality of war is that very few stories are ever resolved.  The fate of loved ones must often be assumed. People that would have made a magical pairing, meet only once, for a single day.  This book was masterful. It will be on my mind for weeks, possibly months.
The chapters alternate between two characters; one a young, precocious orpaned boy in Germany who is trained in the super-elite academy for Nazi youth, and the other is a young girl in Paris who becomes totally blind at the age of six.  Her father is the master locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. There are other secondary characters that add much interest and intrigue to the story. Lots of scientific information interspersed with gripping emotional plot development.
This is a very well told story and one that defies the "happy ending" syndrome in favor of more realism.  Set during the years leading up to and during WWII, it focuses on and interweaves the stories of two young people who have to grow up as the Nazis rise to power and occupy France.  It moves around from place to place and through time in character centered chapters so it is not a straightforward narrative.  It is great story telling in simple but evocative prose.
A unique perspective on World War II story. cleverly told through the two young people with such different experiences. It is unusual to try to sympathize with the Germans in any war story but like Stones From the River, Doerr has found a way to humanize the situation. It really shows how many civilians in Germany had little choice but to fall in line with the Reich's movement. The French resistance was a lovely foil. Sometimes it's a bit confusing but overall a great read.
I think the thing I loved most about this book is how rich and how well the words, stories, and characters flowed together. While reading it I enjoyed taking my time and just absorbing it all. The characters are compelling and their story is told in such a way that i never wanted to put the book down. Its a dark story but it is definitely laced with light and is one that, after finishing, made me sit and just reflect on life. Its beautifully told and I highly recommend it.
The writing was good but, I felt that there were places where the scenes were not resolved and it became confusing because of information not given. Werner's character was trapped in a collapsed building and later he was outside tracking radio signals. I would also like to have known what happened to the father at the end. I just felt that I had read better books on the war such as "The Nightingale" by Kristin Hannah and "To Find a Mountain" by Dani  Amore.
This book was an amazing historical fiction novel that greatly deserves a solid 4 stars because of its amazing storyline and incredible vocabulary. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves stories that take place during world war two and would like to read a variety of experiences ( that were even tragic at times ) that seemed that they could actually have been from once real people. Overall it was a very good book that kept me interested until the last sentence.
By the time I got to the end of this book, I really liked it, but for about the first 3/4 of it, I was wondering why all the high marks. It was frustrating that you would just get going on one character's story, and then jump to another character or time frame. All was brought together in the end, but not happily. The representation of the war was compelling, horrifying and dark; a look at an aspect of WW2 that tends to get lost in the focus on Jewish concentration camps.
This is such an engaging story -- full of great characters - plots that you imagine coming together so well that when they do you are truly sorry to see the book end. Having two fresh main characters allow us to experience the sensory world of a blind girl and a boy with a gift for radios. One French and one German, the war that defined a generation is suddenly new again. I am very happy to recommend this book for its writing and characters and human scale. It's a winner.
I was hooked by the 20th page. By the time there were only a few pages left I was torn between wanting to see how it ended and wanting it to never end. I wanted to stay with the characters, in the story, in Saint-Malo. I felt like I experienced the events myself, and that nothing could be normal again, like nothing else could measure up as significant or meaningful. This is one of the most impactful books I have ever read. I think it will haunt me for a long time to come.
All The Light We Cannot See takes place during World War II and from the perspective of two youth living in Germany and France facing the horrors of war and loss of home, family and humanity . The little girl Is also blind and "sees" the world with more clarity than most seeing people.The boy becomes a survivor but not sure what there is to survive for. Lives cross. Those surviving do so with tremendous hope but wounds that will never heal. But they still live on.
I downloaded this from iTunes as an audio book and the wife and I listened to it on our 17 hour each-way driving vacation last week. Listening to this book made the hours just fly by.<br/><br/>From the first pages or ten minutes of audio reading, we were captivated. As others have commented, Doerr's command of the English language and his descriptions of people and places isamazing. I look forward to listening to other books he's written, my new favorite way to read :)
Intrigue, suspense, horror, and many more emotions.  Doerr writes events through the eyes of children as if it is an easy thing to accomplish. I felt every emotion these characters experienced. I would hate to think what the runner up story was to the Pulitzer prize. I recommend reading the actual paper book than on the kindle. I got lost in the beginning with the back and forth timeline. It's harder on the kindle to flip backwards to remember where I am in the timeline.
Enjoyed this book overall...great historical fiction. It did become a bit slow for me mid-way through the book, however, and I felt the ending lingered on and on – giving follow-ups to minor characters that seemed unnecessary and brief connections between characters that did little for the storyline. Felt like the book kind of lost steam at the end.
One of the best books I have ever read, and deserving of the awards and accolades it has achieved.  Beautifully written, with some of most dynamically developed characters I've encountered in fiction.  Doerr reveals both the kind and savage acts that come from war, and spares no detail in revealing the desperation and hope that the French experience during Nazi occupation.  I read this slowly, savoring the lyrical narrative and the suspenseful plot. Well worth reading.
This is a fantastic read.  Several times I got so caught up in the story that I had to put the book down so I could remember that I was in AZ.<br/>Several times I also had to stop reading so that I could realize that I was not tired, I just felt that way because “I live in the story.” This story was fascinating because I realized I was seeing a world from a blind person’s perspective.  How does that happen?  Sounds, feelings, senses come alive and make the story real.
Beautiful, poetically written and almost perfectly constructed unique WWII drama. Time shifts back and forth, eventually converges at one place in the bombed city of Saint-Malo, where intelligent blind girl meets her saviour - smart and sensitive German boy who learned how to build transceivers and use Sine/Cosine Laws to search for hidden radio operators. The novel is dark and  paints  the climate of rising Nazism in Germany, war's effect on citizens in France and much more.
The author has a wonderful skill with words. Some description were lovely. The story was exhausting with its constant flash backs and switches between the two main characters. Everything is resolved at the end, but as in war not necessarily a happy ending. The boys school events were like tame scenes from The Lord if the Flies. I also did not appreciate the present tense telling a d how it was applied. For a better read, check out Niall Ferguson's Four Letters of Love.
So much has been written and filmed about the war: it's battles, the holocaust, and the bad Germans. But this book takes the reader into the soul and souls of war. The characters are so alive and their experiences over a five year period so very real as they attempt to understand what is happening and their places in the turmoil. I understood how this war touched people in a way I never have before. A beautiful book. A joy to read in all its ugliness, death, and drama.  The only reason I gave it a four is because the ending seemed somewhat rushed. Or maybe I was just sorry it was ending.
I read this book and also listened to this book over the course of one week.  Unbelievably great book.  I will re-read this book again and again in the future.  If I could rate this as 6 or 10, I would.  With over 13,000 reviews, I don't need to be more specific about the book.  Great writing, I underlined many passages, beautiful writing, great main characters and great secondary characters, great timing and very emotional.  Everything that a great novel should have.
The language in the book is wonderful and the plot captivating.
Chronological flip-flopping was confusing and annoying.  Even the author seemed to be confused in that he depicted the girl under her bed in the beginning of the story, but, at the end -- when re-visiting that same moment in time -- she was sheltered in the basement after hiding in the attic for five days.  No bed in either place.  The ending was a huge disappointment after waiting for nearly the entire book for the two lives to intersect.  I would not recommend it.
Expert character development One cannot help but feel empathy and compassion for the blind girl and the Hitler youth. An exceptional insight into the world of the blind as well as a brilliant portrayal of life in France and Germany during WWII.At times the writer goes back in time it becomes a little incoherent but I adjusted to that quickly. This is an extremely well written novel that I would recommend especially to serious readers and those interested in the war.
I read a lot of historical fiction and this one will go into my top 10 list. It's a slow story - not a fast paced Hollywood story. The characters develop and mature with the progress of the book. I had read many reviews about this book before deciding to go with the written version or the audio version. Given the jumping between years, characters and locations, I'm happy with my choice to read the book (rather than the audio version).  All in all, I LOVED this book.
Several days after completing the novel, I am still processing it.  I am truly deeply moved.  I thought the characters were extremely well drawn, real, and believable.  This is a great story and well written.  I continue to be amazed at the stories that still come from the horror and chaos of World War II.  If you're a novel reader, please read this book.  If you like World War II books, please read this book.  I will continue to savor this story for many more days.
I almost quit reading about a third of the way into the story because the jumps in time made it difficult to keep track of where we were in the lives of the protagonists. Also, the author's figurative language and description were very good, but there was simply too much of it many times. It was like adding a large amount of a tasty spice into the stew; it overpowers the flavor. I'm glad I finished the book, even though the ending wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.
The story is very interesting and thought provoking.  It focuses on the individual lives of several characters living in France and Germany during World War II.  One of the main characters is blind yet her visions of the world around her are quite bright and colorful. Each character lives a distinctive life far apart from one another.  Yet, at different points in the story they all become connected by a variety of events including technology and a mysterious jewel.
This book is a joy to read. The story moves along on the beautifully crafted descriptions and nicely phrased metaphors.  "she can hear snowflakes tick and patter through the trees."  There are glimpses of brutality and kindness courage and cowardice. The blind see the world through touch and sensation. And Doerr is able to give this experience to the reader in his writing. This is not summer reading.  It's reading to take to bed with you on an early night.
What a wonderful story, told in such clean, effortless prose.  The characters are rich, and full of life, and their path leading up to and through what we call World War II makes for great reading. It is the type of story that is so engrossing, I find myself stopping to tell someone about some special anecdote from my life that relates to whatever we're discussing, only to realize that it really comes from this book.  Clearly, I've surrendered fully to its charms.
You can read a million reviews on the book better than mine, but in a nutshell I really enjoyed the poetic nature of the writing, the beautiful descriptive language, the character development, and seeing WW2 through a German's eyes as well.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a more "fairy tale" ending than I got, but then again the ending is more true to real war and real life so I can't complain.  I've already recommended the book to several family and friends.
I bought this book because I like reading the NY Times Bestsellers. I usually like reading books on vacation during the plane, train, bus, or taxi and never finish more than four chapters but while on vacation to France I decided to take this book. During my one week vacation in France I finished the book and was excited to visit all the places Doerr mentions in the book, especially imagining how Marie navigated her way through the rue's of France. Excellent book
This is a beautifully written story of all that is going on, constantly, right in front of us, that we often miss.  Sight is more than seeing. Even in the darkest of times, light shines, light is there.  Set during World War II, the book captures the love, friendship, loyalty, perseverance, and courage of the characters all in the midst of a time where people found themselves thrown into situations, circumstances, and relationships they never sought or asked for.
One of the best books I have read in a long time. Although a very dark, sad, realistic, historically based story it managed to convey a depth of both good and evil in the characters. Characters were developed in an interesting way with constant twists. It cleverly showed how the characters succumbed to the evil propaganda of the time. The beautiful descriptions throughout the book eased the tension and horror of the story.<br/> I would highly recommend the book.
The second half of this book was a real page burner for me and I was sorry to see it end. I don’t mean to imply that the first half wasn’t good but the style took me a while to get used to. I would highly recommend this book. Just stick with it if you find it a bit confusing at first. You won’t regret it for it unfolds into an insightful tale. I not only enjoyed this book, but perhaps best of all was what I learned from the experiences of the two main characters.
I thought this a compelling book in many ways and an intriguing WWII story. Questions about violence and sexual content seem inappropriate or insignificant in regard to this novel. I am now reading Doerr's first novel, where he also treats characters and events in ways that keep me wanting to read on to learn what will happen next. I will read his short stories and look forward to his next novel. All the Light We Cannot See is a  fascinating read--don't miss it!
An interesting way for the reader to experience WWII history through the lives of a blind girl and a bright German orphan recruited for the Hitler Youth.  Their lives are very difficult but in different ways they survive the horrors through the most trying years of the war.  Maturity is forced upon them and they face challenges at young ages that are hard to imagine.  Their friends and family are so important to their survival, both mentally and psychologically.
This book was very well written, but there was something missing that prevented it from being a great read.  Some of the connections between the characters are too tenuous to be believable.  It lacked a strong story line and main character throughout the book.  Better than a lot of stuff that is out this summer, but hard to stay interested in the characters and care about then.  Then, the book, which is set during WW ,ends rather abruptly and leaves you hanging.
I really liked this book. There's not much negative you can say about it. I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt there were areas that were rushed, and I don't think it deals with the issue of rape in war very well. Other than that, it is quite the page turner. I usually don't think page turners are well written, because the tend to be gimmicky with cliff hangers at the end of chapters, but this one doesn't rely on those tricks. Very well written, great story.
I enjoyed the slow, thorough development of character and plot. Like an artist, drawing first the outline and then adding layers of color until a finely crafted, a finely narrated story of merit is completed. All the Light We Can Not See was so seductively shared, I spent wee hours of the morning thirsting for the next clue when I should have been sleeping. This story never held my time cheap. I am so satisfied that I took the advice of my friend and read this.
This story is compelling. But more than that, it illuminates the subject of the book (as I see it) in a way that it seeps into the reader and leaves insight and understanding: the journey and the plight of individuals carried along by events so out of their control that their most heroic achievement is survival without bitterness. I would consider using this book as a teaching tool. The universality of the experience of the characters informs without preaching.
Husband loves WWII literature and history.  We both read great reviews of this book.  He reads while on the treadmill.  The writing is very good on every page, so he was willing to read the entire book.  But he kept "waiting for something to happen"  He felt there wasn't enough action in the novel.  I gave it three stars because he said it was very well written and I don't want to discourage anyone from reading this.  But I'm not eager to read it now...
Excellent book reminiscent of The Book Thief.  Very well done.
I enjoyed this story of youngsters, a blind girl and an orphan, and the lives that revolved around theirs up to, during, and (in glimpses) after the war. The book started a bit roughly, told as separate stories and hard to track; however, through to the conclusion I was living with the characters and was sad to arrive at the end. Very engaging. The four stars are because of the initially rushed and disjointed stories at the beginning. Worth reading to the end.
One of most well written books I have read. The author's focus gives you a very clear picture each situation.  The characters are unique and very believable . The little girl is blind and her father is a genius lock smith and care taker in a great museum. It is a pregnant setting in which the character's that are brave and mysterious .  Most of all you will really care about them and their trials in a time when the world was disintegrating.<br/><br/>Joyously read<br/>Dot
Captivating story about events surrounding German occupation of France during WWII made alive by following a blind girl and her family in France against the backdrop of a young German radio specialist as they grow up during the war. I could not put it down...my wife read it in her book club and her description of the book spurred me to read it. They loved it and I did, too. Highly recommended read especially if you enjoy books that tie history to a good story.
This is a lovely novel.  The beat of the prose is careful, teasing out the subjective states of characters whose lives are overwhelmed by war and death and traumatic memory.  I must admit that there were moments when the pace plodded a bit longer than I wanted, stretching out the inevitability of loss a bit more painfully than I wanted to stand.  Ultimately, it is worth it; it succeeds at transforming feeling through submission to the events that it describes.
Part historical fiction, part war memoir, part poetry, part taut thriller, it was hard to put down. I find it relatively rare to enjoy modern fiction as thoroughly as I did this book. Often, when I get to the end of a 'you have to read this, it's a really great book' contemporary novel, I find myself wondering what all the fuss was about, and kicking myself for not reading more Dickens or Hemingway - but not this time. This was well worth the time and effort!
Quite a good book!  Tells the story of a blind French girl and her father and of a German boy before and during WWII.  Develops both their stories individually and builds suspense as their stories become inexorably intertwined.  Keeps the readers interest and of course makes a statement about how innocent people on both sides are threatened by and swept up in war.  Only slight criticism is that it could have been shortened a bit, but it does keep you reading.
Our book club has read a number of books about WWII this year and this was the most personal of them. This gave a look at what happened to the "real people" not the generals etc. I liked the growth of the characters and how I was able to get to know them better. It didn't color their situations in doom and gloom, or sugar coat them. The story felt real. The view of the world through the experiences of a blind girl was very interesting and believable.
All the Light provides an in-depth look at the experience of war of ordinary people trapped in circumstances they didn't create nor deserve. Although it takes place during World War 2, it has parallels today with the conflicts in the Middle East and Africa that  are causing such hardships for people who are just trying to live their lives. The story was gripping and the characters so interesting that it was hard to put the book down. Altogether a great read!
This was an interesting read and I was really interested in seeing how the stories would converge. As such, I was a bit disappointed, since there was so much build-up but not enough reward. That aside, the characterization was fascinating and I found myself really at odds with myself as I rooted for Nazi criminal Werner as he turned a blind eye to the crimes he was participating in. It was interesting how Doerr made HIM the blind one and Marie Laure saw all.
The story of 2 teenagers whose paths were destined to cross in war torn Europe is entertaining and heart wrenching. My favorite part was the relationship between one of the main characters and his sister and the influence she had on him even though they were forced to spend years apart. My least favorite part was when one of the main characters dies suddenly. I really wanted there to be a fairy tale ending for these two who had suffered much at an early age.
I wish I could have given this book a five star rating. I enjoyed it very much. The writing was excellent and it's an interesting story. Loved the characters.<br/>For me  it was anticlimatic...I kept reading because I so wanted Werner and Marie to meet and fall in love. I guess that's the romantic side of me but I was just disappointed that their meeting was so short lived. That said it is a wonderful book and I'm glad I read it.<br/>I highly recommend it.
Forget the notions conjured by the book being set in occupied France and Germany prior to and during WWII. This book barely touches on front line combat and only hints at the world changing events happening in other parts of the world. That said, it does all of that masterfully. What is also does is bring a subtle and inspired story to life through character building and excellent story telling. Buy this book and just enjoy the ride, there are no weak links.
I  was not sure how I was going to like this book, yet at the same time I found I could not put it down. I liked the short chapters, I had no problem  with the time periods being a bit broken up. I think what disappointed me the most was the character development of the main characters. I wanted more about them. I clearly wanted a different ending. The book takes on a lot of subject matter. Yet, nothing was quite resolved for me in the characters that lived.
I really liked this book.  I prefer to read non fiction WWII books, but am glad I picked this one up.<br/><br/>I was caught up in this book from page one.  I wasn't certain how all of the characters were going to fit together but A Doerr did a great job of weaving their story lines together.  I thought the book read like poetry.  It was an amazing book.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written book or WWII stories.
I can understand why Anthony Doerr won the Pulitzer Prize for this novel.  The Nazi regime under Hitler was such a horrifying part of history and Mr. Doerr makes it extremely personal thru the eyes & experiences of 2 young people on opposite sides of the conflict.  He tells the reality of the War but weaves into it the courage of the everyday people.  I highly recommend this book--it's one to read over and over & would make a wonderful book club discussion.
Truly enjoyed meeting the characters in this extremely well written novel.  The love and care given to Marie by her father was mirrored by the love and care Werner had for his sister but of course Werner was limited by age and circumstance.  The curiosity and desire to learn of the main characters was another common thread.  Throughout the book the author was able to make you feel all the emotions each of the characters was experiencing.  An excellent read!
this book must touch those of us who lived through the time covered by this book.  we here in the u.s. were completely unaware of the depth of suffering endured at the hands of the madness that took hold of the whole world.  mr doerr 's great gift of writing and command of his material awaken the senses so that we must empathize with the characters who while fictional are very real in this historical moment.  I will strongly recommend this book of all ages.
Another WWII book, but this one is amazing: 1944, St. Malo, France, a blind French girl, a savant German orphan, a huge diamond, a war run on radio, a Nazi school for youth, siege and bombing of a town in Brittany -- all told in perfect, dazzling prose. Imagine a chunky Nazi officer "basted into his uniform"!  An easy read -- but jot down the shifting dates, back and forth -- and a great listen (I did both).  Not trite, not predictable, based on historic events.  My forecast: this will become a classic.
I think this is the most beautiful story I have read this year. It's a historical fiction, a story about two orphan children. One a blind girl the other a boy who becomes a Nazi soldier. A very well written book with captivating chapters. The characters come alive in front of your eyes as you read on. The story is beautifully written that at times it makes you teary eyed and at times you find yourself laughing. I could not put down this book once I started.
My Book Group picked this book, and I was all set not to like it too much (in my experience, many best sellers are mediocre books that were expertly marketed.)  I LOVED THIS BOOK  ( especially the very short chapters. ) Beautifully written, no extra verbiage, profound imagery, multi-layered plots, bittersweet characters with far from perfect lives, all of whom will stay with you forever.  I hated for this book to end.  Did I say how much I love this book ?
Many have given thorough and lengthy reviews, so I will content myself with saying the short chapters and frequent switches between timelines were compelling devices that served to hold my interest and were not, after the first few switches, confusing. Characters and locales are vivid and compelling. Prose is lyrical, lovely and-- yes-- thorough! In an age of short attention spans and short cuts for everything, I loved getting lost in Doerr's descriptions.
Beautifully written story of the love and unique training a father gives his blind daughter as WWII as the Germans invade France. And the simultaneous story of a German boy orphan with no future who stumbles on a talent for electronics that gives him a future but in the Nazi Army. There lives, compassion, daring, and the devastation of the war intersect until their lives converge. One of the most beautifully written novels I have every read. Deeply moving.
As a former English teacher, I have read my entire life.  I prefer literature and rarely read commercial fiction.  This novel did not disappoint.  The concept of using two youths on opposing sides of WWII who both become victims would be a great novel to use in the school system.  If I were still teaching, I would buy it for my classroom.  The two lives and voices of the narration evoked such pathos in the reader!  I loved it and would highly recommend it.
I choose this book as book club read. It took a few pages to get into the author going back and forth in times and with different characters but must say it was excellent book. To understand how a blind girl did not let her disability hinder her life is amazing. All the characters had adversity in their lives but did not stop them from going on. The setting is World War II and my book club agreed unanimously that it was a great book and would recommend it.
Well written with a little different story line from many books placed during world war II.  It was interesting to have both the French and German points of view.  Short chapters and the alternating point of view help move the story along and I found myself not wanting to put it down.  I did find myself wishing for a little more development of some of the side characters and there seemed some unnecessary plot elements, but overall a very entertaining book.
I loved this story as sad as it was, and I loved Anthony Doerr's writing style. It was my book club choice or I may have not discovered this author. I immediately  bought another of Doerr's books and will buy others. The story is complicated and I kept wondering how it would all tie together. It was interesting reading about the young German and how he became entangled in the war and the work of the French underground. Complicated story but so interesting!
One of the best books I read this year. I couldn't put it down and read through the night. I loved it as much as The Book Thief and The Gold Finch. I felt the fear and the small triumphs of the characters and thought they were developed well.<br/><br/>I would have liked it better had the story been chronologically written - for me it would have been even more gripping and emotional but did not see it as distracting. I will read this book again and again.
A German teenager, radio technology nerd, prematurely forced into the German army during World War II and in charge of finding and destroying radio transmitters. A blind French girl that helps the French Resistance using a clandestine radio to convey encripted messages, Debussy music and excerpts from Jules Verne 's novels she reads in Braille. What are the odds these two destinies intersect ? Well, they do and it is wonderfully narrated by Anthony Doerr.
Doerr writes in a dramatic and often moving style that provides an effective vehicle to convey his characters and plot. The story is a strange mixture of  concrete events overladen with elements of fantasy. Set in WWII a time when the actual events were in hindsight unbelievable this mixture works to create a moving tale. To advance the plot several of the characters are required to behave in ways that deprive the story of  a necessary feeling of reality.
A beautifully written story of a fathers enduring love for his blind daughter who shows enormous courage in overcoming adversity throughout the years of the Second World War, France. A parallel story of a different kind of struggle is slowly intertwined, which see a German boy transformed through the airwaves and broadcasts of a world beyond the industrial coal fields of the German war machine. This story has lots of heart while being totally compelling.
The story is completely absorbing, the characters well-drawn, and the author's skillful use of spellbinding, descriptive language makes reading this novel a mesmerizing experience. In fact, the language was so lyrically beautiful, that when I finished the novel, and began reading the next novel on my reading list, I found the writing jarring, and had to give up reading fiction for several days. This author has a beautiful command of the written language.
It is rare to read a story so beautifully, eloquently and perfectly told. Sometimes I'd read quickly needing to know what was on the next page. Other times I'd slow down or stop not wanting it to end. I highlighted many lines that were poetic, i lingered over even more that spoke beyond the page. I felt and knew the characters. This book is a gift to us about living in difficult times and surviving in spite of. It speaks of our connectedness and oneness.
I could not put it down yet I did not want it to end.<br/>This novel has everything a reader could want.<br/>Great characters are beautifully drawn and interwoven throughout an intriguing story set during the very tragic events of WWII .<br/>This novel certainly widens the scope of the evils of the Nazi objectives.<br/>The prose is lyrical and succinct . Not one word wasted.
This book just didn't have enough depth or surprises.  It was slow-paced and for the most part, the characters were not likable.  Those who were, suffered.  I know it's on the best seller list, but I cannot figure why.<br/><br/>For me, it was a downer every time I again started reading it.  If hadn't been for the fact that it was our Book Club choice, I would have put it down long before the ending.  I had no curiosity about how things would play out.
A story that not only gives you a true picture of World War II, but helps you understand how people are used so that power can be achieved.  Rulers seem to think they can turn people into their personal machines no matter what age.  We see it today in our world wars and the displacement of people.  The light is there within each of us, but as the story says...some cannot see!!  The only thing I found annoying was jumping from one time zone to another...
There are stories that you read which entertain you for the moment, and then there are the stories that touch you so deeply you know you will carry the memory of the way it made you think and feel for a long time to come.<br/>All The Light You Cannot See falls quite firmly in the latter category.  There are so many things I could write about the book, but they've all been said in others reviews.<br/>READ this book- it will not disappoint on any level.
You feel this book. Much like music rises and falls, and evokes memories and emotions, Doerr writes in such a way that you feel the story as much as you read it.<br/><br/>All the reviews describing this book as haunting and beautiful, are correct. I wasn't sure just what I was getting into with this, but I can see now why this was one of the Goodreads Best Books of 2014.<br/><br/>It was definitely one of the best books I've read. Highly recommended.
A good read. Keeps the author captivated and in contemplation
Great story.  Great characters.  Interesting look at history.
A wonderful read.  Great story and very well written.  Enjoy.
Amazing book!  Very well written; I loved the different view points from the main characters. This book is heartbreaking, but not in the usual way. There is always a feeling of sadness throughout the book, and all of the characters have their own version of sadness/despair that tie into the central theme of WWII.  However, there is also this glimmer of hope, that kindness and goodness are still out there. Truly fantastic book that I could not put down.
I guess if you like a depressing story and want to immerse yourself in a sad time in history, with a wasted ending, you would like this book.  I felt like I wasted my time getting involved with the lead characters, with the hope of an ending that gave purpose to their lives, to only be disappointed .  I definitely think the good reviews are strange.  Maybe depressed people feel at home reading depressing things. It could have been great, but fell flat.
This was a fantastic book.  The writing was incredible in terms of wording and phrasing, the characters had depth and believability, and the story was riveting.  The only thing that some people might find a little distracting was the alternating of characters and dates in each chapter, as well as super short chapters.  I still haven't decided whether that was a detriment or a positive.  It would definitely not keep me from reading the book in any case.
A wonderfully written novel, that keeps you emotionally committed throughout. Ordinarily I am a very fast reader. After a few pages, I concluded that this was a story that I needed to slow down and taste the words. Each chapter was like a sip of fine wine!  Gourmet fare in every bite. Mr. Doerr has written a story that engages just about every sense and emotion. At almost 80 years I have read many great novels in my time. This is surely one of the best!
This is a very moving story that is written in a very unusual way.  The story is about a young blind girl in France and her experiences during and after  WWII.  At the same time and with alternating chapters the story is about a young German boy and his journey through the same time period.  They do meet close to the end of the war, but that is not the end of the story nor is this a love story.  This is a story of war and people caught up in the chaos.
A Good  Read and a different take on World War II<br/><br/>Anthony Doerr is a master of the short story. Here he lifts many of the themes and images of the stories into a tale set firmly in a civilian world  rudely intruded  by war. It is a love story, with love forming many bonds. There is no sentimentality or romance, which makes the purity of the unspoken all the more powerful. There are many people to like and care about. A hard book to put down.
This was a beautiful book about family, love and loss. It opened my eyes to the perspective of a gentle, brilliant German orphan who made his way out of the coal mines that claimed his father, only to become enmeshed in a world that was as dark as the one he left. Despite the training, brutality, and loss he experienced as a young Nazi, he emerges clinging to the love of humanity and beauty he embraced as a child. A great story ten years in the making.
All the Light We Cannot See is an amazing feat of prose, poetry, history, science, and metaphysics. Doerr is a gifted writer, and the reason I stayed with this 500+ page novel. I can't help but think that this novel would be even better with a little less intrusion of the search for the cursed gem. This mystical element is not necessary, for Doerr's characters themselves exude the spirit and mystery of remaining human in a time of immense inhumanity..
I loved this book.  Experiencing WWII through the eyes of an 18 year old German soldier and a sixteen year old blind French girl in occupied France was a new experience.  The characters are very rich, and the hardships that war brings to ordinary people are unforgettable.  Full of bravery and heart, this is a book I would high recommend to anyone in search of a story that is both realistic, poignant, and a tribute to the endurance of the human spirit.
An intricately woven tale of how relationships coupled with events can influence behaviors and shape one's character in unexpected ways. Masterfully written, Anthony Doerr provides us with nonsequentiial short vignettes about the lives of each of the main characters. Sometimes sad, sometimes thought provoking and mostly heartwarming, you will find yourself captivated while personally identifying with each of the characters in unique and personal ways.
I enjoyed the book.  I feel the characters were unique and fairly well developed.  It is a very novel story with a continuous plot going back and forth among different characters and time periods; periods generally separated by several years not decades or more.  I thought the primary characters were well developed and engaging even when some of the behavior of characters was difficult to read.  The story was both uplifting and redemptive, to my mind.
This was truly an excellent book.  The story moves quickly with short chapters that encourages the reader to want to keep reading.  The story is intricately woven based on several main characters during World War II.  Their stories and paths cross later in the book, pulling everything together.  It is a story that the reader will not want to end, but that has a satisfying ending.  This story will stay with me for years to come.  I highly recommend it!
Could not put it down! The writing seemed carefully researched to bring you right into the times of these two main characters. And then it is so descriptive that it adds another dimension of interest to the story. You could picture the towns and buildings, and almost like the blind character feel certain senses kick in and feel what she was physically feeling and smell what she was smelling.  I'm looking forward to trying other books from this author!
Writing was good. The view given of that period in time was interesting and informative. Characters were believable, but the author failed to take advantage of the opportunity to make a great book by not closing the book with any meaning to the suffering endured by the characters. A meeting by two key people in The book ended by neither one facing what had happened in their lives, The reader is left unsatisfied, wanting to rewrite the ending themself.  Perhaps that was the author's intention, but I personally have a more optimistic view of life and found it unsettling and annoying.
Following several different character through their childhood, into war and after, made this book hard to put down !  At times it was hard to follow the changes in characters, location and time frames, but the stories intertwined so incredibly from beginning to end. I wanted it to end to see how it all turned out, but at the same time I never wanted it to end! Beautiful story against the background of war, showing the courage instilled by life itself!
Wonderful book. This story has a nice balance of characters, not all good or all bad on any "side", while providing many little bits of information to explain why Germany let WWII happen. And the author conveyed the horror of the war without being overly graphic. By delving into the psychology of his cast members, and placing them in a detailed environment of the time, the author built characters and settings that I enjoyed spending time with.
This is a very well crafted story.  It takes place during World War II, and there is a long part of the book that describes the ugliness of war.  I did not enjoy reading that, and was almost ready to set the book aside.  But there was enough of a thread to keep me reading, and towards the end it becomes a page turner.  I also enjoyed having one main character be blind, and the thoughtful musing the author puts in this book.  At times it's fascinating.
Anthony Doerr's lyrical writing is mesmerizing!  This is a book that I will read and read again.  The story line is beautiful, poignant and heartbreaking. It has so many layers and so much symbolism - from the title to the characters.  It shows the futile brutality of  war and its impact on innocent children. My second reading will be for the enjoyment of the lyrical writing style.  I plan to read the author's other books as soon as I can get them.
Among the contemporaries, this is the one I found more on the sophisticated side. As a non-native English speaker, I encountered the same difficulty in catching all the nuances between the lines as I did while reading the classics of the 17th and 18th century. Despite myself, I still enjoyed it. I appreciated how Anthony did his research in different subjects, mainly radios and marine crustaceans. It is a both informative and inspiring history novel.
I love long books. If I start reading a bad one I won't finish it even if its half a page long, but if its good as this one was, I get to spend a lot of time far away- in lands I have never known.<br/>The voice of the author immediately grabbed my attention; I was instantly comfortable with the environment he created. Indeed he is quite descriptive; because of this, for the first time in my life I was able to see what a blind person sees. Thank you.
Fascinating story and insight into both the world of a dauntless blind girl as well as that of the young German boy. The title acts as a common metaphor for both stories. It is a compelling concept.<br/><br/>I gave it four stars instead of five for two reasons:<br/>1) the switching back and forth in time was sometimes confusing<br/>2) I thought the dragging out of the story at the end totally unnecessary. It spoilt the effect of the whole for me.
Anthony Doerr finds the positive essence of humanity living alongside its' evil twin, "barbaric humanity'" as both traits grew and evolved during World War Two.  He follows several German and French boy, girls, men and women and vividly illustrates  what life was like and showing how the experiences of the participants were deeply ingrained with the survivors and continued to animate French and German cultures many years later.  Quite moving!
As Hitler rose to power it brought into  being a chain of events that would effect all of the people of that time. The reader is caught up in the evils and suffering brought on by Nazi Germany's push for extreme patriotism and its striving to build a superior race. We follow the main characters, a sightless blind girl Marie-Laurie,  and Werner, a brilliant radio technician, as they seek to find a way to live out their lives in these dangerous times.
A young blind French girl during her early teens is faced with her father leaving her alone with a prized gem from the museum where he works. As the Germans advance toward Paris,  he is arrested and sent to prison.  His Meanwhile a young German boy joins the Army where his  Sargent Major gives him the job of finding the person who has the gem through Enemy radio broadcasts. The book is very well written and worth reading to find the end of the story
“What do we call visible light? We call it color. But the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other, so really, children, mathematically, all of light is invisible.”<br/><br/>This is one of those books where you turn the last page and then sit and reflect on the journey you've just taken. It is one of the most beautifully written books I think I've ever read and it took me through an entire gamut of emotions.
What a wonderfully creative mind this author must have! The characters in this book were so brilliantly unique and well developed it was hard to think of them as fictional. While the story plays out a bit unrealistically towards the end, it's hard to fault the author because who doesn't enjoy a bit of fantasy? Heartwarming, exciting and tragic, this is the kind of book that reminds you how much more rewarding reading can be compared to watching TV.
This book is incredible - beautifully written and such a compelling narrative told from a few different points of view. The first chapters felt a little slow to me so I took a break and thought about not finishing, but I am so glad I did! I'm not a fan of historical novels, which this seems to be, but this is so much more than history. It's emotional and exciting and thoughtful. I hope I forget the storyline so I can reread it a few years from now!
Pure pleasure in reading such thoughtfully constructed prose.  The historical context of<br/>World War II provided the context for a study of two parallel but dissimilar survival stories of adolescents who followed different paths that finally intersected in a sorrowful, but inspiring  conclusion. The short, alternating chapters devoted to each character's separate struggles pulled me into the story and left me wanting to read more by this author.
Evocative prose reaches deep into the dark possibility for human cruelty and even more into human potential for resiliance. This is a book to read thoughtfully, not to rush through for the twists of plot - of which there are many - but to contemplate in the meaning of what we value. The author caresses into life details we often cannot see for our headlong rush toward the next event. It is beautiful, searing, suspenseful; you will long remember it.
Anthony Doerr writes poetry in well-constructed novel form, keeping the tension throughout, drawing the characters vividly and developing them within the storyline, as well as conveying historical information appropriated to the setting and period. I highly recommend "All the Light We Cannot See," a tale of exploitation of German youth during WWII that at the heart portrays the deep conflicts and soul of helpless youth during this period.
Compelling story, fascinating descriptions of how a blind person experiences the world.  It was a glimpse into the horror and destruction of war, and yet a celebration of the resilience of the human spirit.  The ending left too many years unaccounted for<br/>me.  I think it is important to be reminded of the terror, misery, and suffering caused by war, so that we can appreciate what<br/>others have endured and be grateful for all our blessings.
Great story with a different view of WWII in the background.
I loved this book - beautifully written, a pleasure to read.
Excellent read, one of the best books I have read this year.
A difficult read. But worth trying hard. In the end worth it
Beautifully written - like poetry  -  and a very good story,
Beautifully interwoven stories of a young French girl and a German boy just before and during WWII. The story follows them separately for most of the book and finally reveals their brief meeting and intense friendship instigated by a radio broadcast. The settings and descriptions of daily life in the period transport the reader back to a time and place clouded by our forgetfulness. The author received and deserved the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.
This was a very good read. It also provided good material for discussion. I was taken by the juxtaposition of the main characters and of course the detailed description of life in parts of Germany and France during the war. This book acquaints you with the many unsung war victims that we may not have know about, for so many years. It seems war never ceases to provide yet another horror story. This book is on my short list of books worth reading.
Serenely passing through tumultuous historical events, atrocity and human horror, human resilience, All the LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE flows.  My least favorite plot device, disparate story lines meant to intersect not withstanding, it is beautifully written.  I read it straight through.  The characters are artfully created and fascinating.  The blind, the knd, the duplicitous and weak war participants and victims are believable and true to the senses.
All The Light We Cannot See is amazing, beautiful and so thrilling.<br/>I have so much to say but you'll know it when you read it.<br/><br/>One particular experience I had is that I had a difficult time reading it in the early chapters because each short chapter is about a character and the next is another character, alternatively.<br/>And each major chapters start with dates jump back and forth. So, I had to write down and keep track of it.
This is one of those books I really didn't want to end.  I purposefully did not read any reviews ahead of time because I wanted to be surprised by the content and I was not disappointed. This is one of the most beautifully written books that I've read in a long time. I won't give away any of the plot but the way Mr. Doerr describes the young girl's view of her world is absolutely stunning!  Get this book right now - it's sure to impress you too!
I thought I had read about as many WW2 stories as I liked.  For some reason I didn't get them memo this was a story set in WW2 and reluctantly started the book anyway.  Lovely story very well told.  Not the grim WW2 we have grown accustomed to reading.  Uplifting Heart warming well told tale of children in the midst of WW2 finding friendship, love, and loyalty. Good read.  Really worth getting over your bad self and reading yet another WW2 book.
This was a beautifully written book with great insight about the inner lives of a few people on both sides of World War II, from France and Germany, that eventually connected with one another in a very meaningful way. I actually listened to the auditory version on my long walks and had a little difficulty keeping track of some of the people in the story until their activities or thoughts were being expressed. I would highly recommend this book.
A splenditly crafted suspense novel.  Characters well developed and, while unique, are very believable.  Of great interest to my wife and me since we had an apartment across the estuary of the Rance River from St. Malo in Dinard.  We have visited the fortress complex constructed by the Germans at La Cite and the many fortifications along the coast.  We thank Anthony Doerr for wrting such an interesting novel.<br/><br/>Robert and Mary Pierpont
If I were teaching students how to read this book "like an English professor," I could spend the entire term on the words "light we cannot see".  This was a deeply satisfying, yet harshly real book about WWII, and the darkness and light that played off each other.  We see two lives slowly working their way towards each other, only to be torn apart by the lack of light to guide their way.  Wonderfully -- and movingly -- written.
We read this for our book club and we all liked it. It is written in a very visual style so you can picture all the settings in great detail. I loved the beginning of the book where it was more hopeful and nostalgic but when it moved into the war years, it became more tragic and sad as you would expect. I did find the characters interesting and well developed so overall, I really enjoyed reading it except for the darkness of the war realities.
Just finished this book so it's fresh in my mind. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and the vivid emotional and mental picture painted by the author.<br/><br/>There are a few unanswered questions for me, but I'm not the sharpest stick in the bunch so hopefully it makes sense to others. I won't go into details so as not spoil or give away any details the next reader will enjoy for themselves.<br/><br/>Look forward to the next book by this author.
This book is an amazing story of the 1940's and features a blind girl's story and the story of a brother and sister who live in an ophanage run by a French woman on the east side of Germany I think.  The chapters vary between these two characters and you wonder how they have anything to do with each other.  It is well written and insightful.  I recommend it highly.  The book arrived in great condition, well packaged, and was early in delivery.
This is definitely not a beach read! But, if you're looking for a beautifully written and researched story about the interconnectivity and complexity of humans and relationships this book is for you! This book chronicles the life and unlikely friendships of a young blind girl from France and a young German soldier during World War II. I am only giving this four stars because some parts were a bit long and drawn out, but overall worth the read!
I have never read a more phenomenal book such as this.  The wording is beautiful; it lulls you into....I cannot explain it.  I am not done reading and I don't want this book to end.  I am thankful for the very short chapters.  It makes it easier to close down my Kindle and savor every single word Doerr has written for me.  I understand Doerr has another book and I am looking forward to seeing if he continues in "About Grace" his style.
Set during the second World War  This Novel is about a young blind girl and her Father. It is also about a young German boy who has no choice but to join the Hitler Youth Army. Both the blind girl and the young boy have chosen to honor their families and in the end try to stay alive by any means that they can. In the end of the book we learn that the young German boy pays for his life by sacrificing his life to keep the young blind girl alive.
This is a beautifully written novel of WWII told from both sides of the conflict -- a young German boy and a blind girl in occupied France. The characters are fully fleshed out, even the villains. Even though you know the end tale of the war, there are still suspenseful moments and a few surprises. The author ties it all neatly together in the end, in a way that is satisfying. If you like "Cutting for Stone" you'll enjoy this as well.
This was, as they say, a page turner. Author gave vivid detail, but didn't get lost in it. I thought character development was excellent. Author didn't get bogged down in gory details--he stopped just in time to let our own imaginations finish the scene--and then he jumped to one of the other characters he followed. The perspective of the characters was especially interesting, since they came from both conquered France and conquering Germany.
This is one of the best books I have read in ages! It was thought provoking and gave a wonderful picture of the life and times of the Third Reich. It made me think of those who were caught in Hitler's reign - that not all were caught up in him but were simply swept away by what Hitler was doing. On top of all of these things, the book itself was beautifully written. As far as I am concerned, All the Light We cannot See is a book for the ages.
I have very mixed feelings about this book. First of all, the author is a literary master. The imagery used in this story is brilliant, but that is where it ended for me.<br/><br/>I could not get into the story. The plot dragged and was very boring. I have very little investment into the characters even though I knew them inside and out.<br/><br/>Overall, I did not enjoy the story like I had hoped I would, but the author is very talented.
With each of us, unseen situations, decisions, and people influence our lives. During WWII those unseen factors gained greater power to shape, and this remarkable novel explores how ordinary people were unknowingly caught up in something extraordinary. Beautifully written in short, alternating chapters with intriguing characters, this book is hard to put down. The realistic way challenges are faced and resolved sets examples as it entertains.
This was a suspenseful book which had several subjects all going at the same time, but I kept hoping for the book to go in ways in which it didn't.....(I don't know why).  I found myself getting frustrated with the book because it didn't go in the direction I wanted it to, but I truly realized that I didn't WRITE the book.... It was a strange experience, and one I have never had before.  It was still a good book several stories woven into it.
I was really sorry to finish this book! The author writes in a way that made me love many of the characters and truly enjoy the story.  By moving back and forth in time and between characters, the author keeps your interest peaked. The book showcases a human spirit, which even in times of extreme hardship, reveals a resiliency worth reading about and admiring in this wonderful story!<br/>Loved the book and want to read more from the author!
This book was so eloquently written with such descriptive language that you don't want to stop.  I found myself reading on and on late into the night.  Also,  the format of  switching  the  characters and their stories at every chapter is clever and unique, and lends itself to the convergence of the two paths of the main characters.  It is a novel we can learn from and take to heart as it tackles questions of endurance and moral obligations.
I liked the cinematographic style of switching from person to person as their lives were unfolding. However, I would have preferred a present-time continuum, rather than skipping back and forth from present to future, then back to present. By skipping ahead so frequently, there was little left in the way of suspense and because the future was constantly revealed, the present was too predictable. I liked Doerr's present-tense narrative style.
The book is beautifully written with stunning imagery and language.  The story is gripping and the characters incredibly human.  The book isn't a fast read in that lovers of words will want to slow down in order to better taste the words and appreciate the sentence construction.  It is a fast read in that I think the reader easily becomes attached to the characters and therefore feels a vested interest in learning how the plot will play out.
This is the best book I have ever read.  What more can I say.  Anthony Doerr, you are a genius!  My wife read this book for her book club and she said to me, you have to read this book.  Thank you wife!  I finished the book and let it "set in" for a week and then picked it up and read it again.  I have never done that with any book in my 62 year old life.  Buy this book and read it, make your life a better life.  It is a masterpiece.
World War II was happening somewhere else when I was a child in a small town in the United State where I felt safe. Stories like "All the Light We Cannot See" serve to remind those of my generation what children in Europe had to endure in a daily struggle to survive. Anthony Doerr tells this story in beautiful descriptions that allows the reader to see the strength,  tenacity, and heart of a child. I found it very hard to put this book down. It is one of those stories that I am sure will creep into my thoughts for a long time.
This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is chock full of history, biology, and science, but its best attributes are the wonderful, evocative prose, that tells several overlapping stories of great seriousness and moment delicately, with detail and grace.  His words flow like a river over and around you, and you will want to keep turning the pages, to find out what happens, but also for your own enjoyment and fulfillment.
I'm enjoying this book so much..would like to read it slow and savor the beautiful job of writing by this author..sadly I'm reading it far too quickly.  The chapters are short and go by so quickly.  Love all the characters and the story line.  I'm picturing myself in each scene because they are so descriptive.  I'm also learning many things I didn't know about the lifestyles of people during WW II.  I'm recommending this to everyone I know!!
I just finished this book. I bought it for my mother so she could read it for her book club. She passed it back on to me thinking I would like it. She was right! The story is told from the life of two different characters and it goes back and forth between both the characters and the year. World War II is seen from both sides with the two characters and the way the story is written is fascinating and intriguing. I just couldn't put it down.
This is moving, beautifully written, and in some ways heartbreaking.  The unusual structure of short chapters that move back and forth between two main characters and their (intersecting) worlds draws the reader in.  The descriptive  and philosophical passages give life and depth to the narrative.  The quality of the writing is wonderful.  This is not your typical war story, but much deeper and more subtle.  This is a book not to be missed.
Excellent book! One of the best books I have read in a long time with unforgettable characters that draw you into their lives. From a slower pace start to help define the main characters to the fast ending last part this book is difficult to put down. The imagery and descriptions in the book are one of the most memorable I have read for a while. Great separate and different stories and characters throughout. You really get to care for them.
I couldn't stop reading. Every page felt like a special experience; seeing life through the lens of someone who could not see was  beautiful. The characters grab hold and don't let go. You think about them after you put the book down; dream about them when you go to sleep. The stark life of a poor soldier is entwined with the life of a young blind girl and its so worth the read to see how it all ends.  I loved this book!  One of my top ten.
The imagery in this book was very good. Switching the scenes between the two main characters was interesting but I would have liked them to have a bit more of the story- line together.  I am admittedly a romantic and love a happy ending, so I would have liked that to be the case.  About three-fourths through the book I had to put in down for a while because the story- line was so depressing that I had to read something a bit more uplifting.
I loved the imagery and characters in this book --the story is clever and easily kept my interest throughout. The one negative comment I have is that I was slightly annoyed by the way the author uses time in tis novel. You pretty much know early on the basics of what happens and then he winds you further into the past to give more details. I found it distracting and made the book longer. Overall though, a beautifully crafted original story.
The book is set during WWII, a story of lives intersecting. The choices of one impacting another. The choices we have and the perception of choice plays a critical part of the story as a young German lad, Werner enters the Nazi youth and the role he plays in the war. It is a thrilling, nail biting, lyrical book. It felt at times like a young adult book, with touches of over simplification of characters and emotions. Still, a very good book.
I've read so many World War II novels.  This one was so gripping...evil stories of horrid German war criminals and war-torn Europeans struggling to stay alive interwoven with the pure sadness of a little blind French girl who is cherished by her father and torn from him by a war they did not choose and an orphaned German boy who is brilliant and wants more than anything to avoid the fate of his father who perished in a coal-mining accident.
World War II through the eyes of a blind girl and a boy genius.  It was certainly a different take on the war from any other novel I've read (and I'm a World War II junkie).  The development of the main characters was excellent and their trips through the war were unique.  The horror of the Nazis and of war is exposed, but there is healing at the end.  It would have helped if I knew more about science.  The marine biology was over my head.
This is the story of a blind French  girl and a German boy on opposite sides during World War II. The reader knows from the beginning that eventually the paths of these two will cross, but the author keeps the reader wondering how this will happen and what the results will be.  It is a story or war and its devastating effects and how the two characters are drawn into it and how their lives are forever changed.  I would recommend this book.
I enjoyed the easiness of this book.  While it was a depressing story, there was hope, determination, spirit against the odds.  I found myself holding my breath to make sure the two innocent kids got through the horrible tragedies war was bringing their way.  It wasn't what I would call a "page turner" but it was a book that got me more involved as I read.  Liked it so much sent to two friends and now they are reading and enjoying.
Beautifully written novel about a girl who becomes blind and learns from her father how to cope with being blind.  It is also the story of a scrawny boy who will be forced to become a member of Hitler's army.  Somehow against the odds they survive and cross paths even though one is German and the other French.  I cannot write a short review as the book has numerous characters who play a part in the climatic plot.  I will re-read this book.
This is a great book... heartwarming and well written.<br/><br/>The story (actually, multiple stories) paints deep character studies, with flaws and strengths.  The framework is WWII, but the stories are, basically about a young boy and young girl who suffer through the horrible experience and consequences of the war.  They spend their adolescence amid terror, cruelty and suffering, yet they emerge with their courage and goodness intact.
A beautifully written, thought-provoking novel. I loved it!
The writing is glorious, subject depressing but historical.
Nice story and during interesting times. Very well written.
Illuminating, well written, compelling and a work of merit.
Beautifully written story that will keep the pages turning!
This is the best book I have read this year, beautifully written , the kind of book, that can't be put down.  The story is quite different, and  I found it fascinating the way the author carefully put all the pieces together. Yes, it is set during World War II, but not the usual telling of that period. I don't know if every reader will appreciate this profound moving narative, but I know I will long remember it and probably read it again.
It was good to see the war from different perspectives while the realities seemed sometimes harsh I guess they reflected the times. I was moved by the characters  compassion and composure and alarmed at times with the coldness of war and frailness of life as if by chance some lived some died . I always hanker for a good ending hoped thAt there was a happy ending maybe it just slipped through the passage of time but to me it ended too soon
Magnificent use of the language. In the style of literary fiction, the plot moves slowly at first, drawing the characters in fine detail. Each detail seemed to me to add a layer of meaning … no wasted words. I knew each of them so well by the middle of the book that the choices they made in the end were clear and inescapable. The story paints a vision of the quotidian, step-by-step way in which real people managed to live through the war.
Another World War II fiction, but with interesting protagonists: a blind French girl and a young German radio technician in the army. A very chilling depiction of the German boy's life and attempted indoctrination into fervent Nazi-think. My only beef is the unrealistic addition of the Nazi search for a valuable diamond that ends by threatening the French girl.  The basic story had enough drama and intricacy so that this seemed over-kill.
This beautifully written novel weaves a compelling tale of intertwined characters in France and Germany during World War II. Characters live through many a nightmarish scenario, but the emotions we experience on their behalf feel earned because the author has painted a rich picture of their inner lives. Moreover, he doesn't fall back on gratuitous violence even though the wartime setting surely provided plenty of opportunity for doing so.
Sometimes with books you "see" characters  or scenery or actions, but really the image is a bit dark and blurred, but the story is good so you keep going. Not so with this one. Characters so clearly described you would recognize them in the park. Locations drawn with such detail, you could paint them yourself. And the story! Intense, historical, intriguing, amazing. Not a Disney ending, but realistic. Loved this book. Will read it again.
This is one of the best books I have ever read.  As other reviewers have put it, I did not want it to end.  Sometimes it seemed it would go on and on, but in a good way.  I wanted to know everything.  You cared about every character.  So glad I walked into my town bookstore one random day and picked up this book.  Now what?  As another reviewer put it, I have a book hangover.  What do you read after a book like this?  It has to be great.
This is a beautiful novel, written in poetry-evoking prose. The story unfolds and brings together unlikely characters that are touchingly and painfully damaged by the terrors of war and fate. The lines defining good and evil are masterfully shown as not thick dark lines, but the fuzzy hard-to-see borders that they often are in reality.  Inhumane cruelty, love, greed, fear and redemption are starkly illustrated in the words of this novel.
I loved this book!  Amazing entry into the worlds of its characters.  So artfully constructed, just like the intricate neighborhoods made by Marie's father.  Overlapping lives, so beautifully touched.  Complicated at times, but in the way that you want to understand the nuances and relationships!  The horror of war juxtaposed against the innocence of curiosity and caring.  Blindness versus what the sighted don't see!  Highly recommended!
Great writer but what was the point. The end was so disappointing! Really had so much potential but I missed the meaning and did not enjoy it.
This is one of my favorite books this year!  Worth every minute of my time.  I love the interweaving of the two cultures, and the mystery and suspense of simple scenes, the wonder of sight that comes from those who cannot see, and the ability to "see" clearly, emerging fully, from those who take the time to reflect on life in our world,  and the real value of treasuring each new day.  This is a treasure I will recommend forever!
This is one of those books that need to be read slowly so you can think about what is being said. The characters are beautifully drawn and you can't help but engage with them on a very deep level even while struggling with what is happening in there lives. This is a book I want to be able to discuss with someone else who has read it too. It's so thought provoking that reading it alone seems like it should be just part of the experience.
I'll loved this book. I actually stopped just short of the last page so I could have just one more day with the novel. Doerr takes us through two stories that wind and overlap each other with similarly  sad, and  juxtaposing emotions. And yet he novel infuses the plot with hope. There were times the writing was poetic and there is a romantic love for life that runs deep in this novel. I would actually see this if ever made into a movie.
The writing is unusual as it does not just centre on one character but develops the whole cast as you read.  It is intriguing to see where the author takes you. The story line is sometimes heart meltingly sad and at the same time very dark in its presentation of how Nazi Germany devoured its youth and in so doing its own society and ultimately its gran demise.. I enjoyed the way the author brings the story to an end. Excellently written.
One of the best novels I have read in a long time.  A beautiful tribute to the resilience of the human spirit amidst the very worst of conditions.  The characters are the story:  the childish innocence of the much-protected Marie-Laure, the intense curiosity and intelligence of the much-abused  Werner, and the wise-beyond-her-years youngest, Jutta.  This is a story of the horrors of war as lived by its most vulnerable victims, children.
Doerr tells a great story carved from the chaos of W.W. II. Seeing all sides as human beings who are trapped by circumstances beyond their control is a refreshing take on war. The reader learns to know the characters in depth over time, and their choices are limited. However, within those boundaries, there is some agency remaining, and people grow because of this. The last chapters feel like an afterword, but leave the reader satisfied.
A novel about WWII from the perspective of teens. One in Germany and one in occupied France.<br/>It is a complex novel that jumps back an forth in time and between the 2 main characters until they finally cross paths. The author takes time to develop the characters and keeps readers interest by describing their lives caught up in a terrible war. One as the occupied civilian and one as a military occupier but both as innocent humans.
A beautifully written story set during WWII.  The story switches narratives between several characters- a blind girl in France, a young German orphan pushed into the Nazi youth, a village of unlikely members of the French Resistance. The story comes together in an unpredictable and touching way, reminding the reader of how tragedy brings humans together in the most beautiful ways. Truly one of the best books I've read in a long time.
This is one of the most memorable books I have read in a long while.  The story lines - and yes there are several - become one and the ending is quite realistically satisfactory.  Not pat or sentimental.  The language is lyrical and the character development is terrific.  There are many people to root for and cheer on in this story..  The editing is good and the story line is masterfully drawn. A great book club book for discussion.
If you don't care for war books, don't fret!  While WWII is definitely the backdrop and plays a large role in the book, war scenes and lengthy, boring details about the war are not.  It's definitely a more character driven novel with beautiful writing and descriptions.  Chapters are short.  Characters are wonderful...every single one.  Best book I have read in a long, long time.  In fact, I am reading it again- and I rarely do that.
Writing that makes each character come alive in your mind as a unique individual.  An extraordinary glimpse into the defeat of the Nazi regime through the eyes of two young people whose experiences explore the morality and consequences of war.  Beautiful imagery throughout.  A brilliant book that will lead to endless discussion of its complexity and symbolism.  reading it oce was not enough--I will reread it again and perhaps again.
The world of children in world war ll was never told as beautifully as Anthony Doerr does.  It is painful to read when war takes children as soldiers to fight for their beliefs.  They were brain washed to believe they were the perfect little soldiers.  I loved the back and forth that the author wrote to tell the tale from the many points of view.  All the characters were so well developed.  I was so sad when it ended.  A great read.
Beautiful book, I am not finished, but cannot put it down.
Great writer. Feel like I am part of the characters lives!
Just the most well written book I've read in a long while!
one of the best books I have ever read.  Loved every page.
One of the best books I've read this year. Set in  WWII Europe, it is a coming of age story about a boy and a girl and how they must deal with growing up in the midst of this terrible war. Mr. Doer brings the reader into the lives of the characters, their fears, their incredible bravery and their dreams. With subtlety he also tells a tale of creeping horror in which the heroine is stalked by a villain worthy of  any gothic mystery.
Great historical fiction. One of the best books I have read in a good while. Interesting perspective of 2 individuals whose lives intersect at the end of the 2nd world war. Goes between WWII end of war time and the years leading up to this time. Good insight of how the main characters came to be where they were, and how the times left indelible marks. Character development well done. It's no wonder this book won the Pulitzer prize.
It was a great story with very interesting characters and several themes flowing in, out and through the whole story. I tried to predict some events I expected but always failed. The story grabbed me as the reader making the book hard to put down. I was caught up in the emotions within the story that adds experiential satisfaction with the book, so much so that I bought a copy for a birthday present for my sister who loves to read.
Wonderful book with a slightly different take on the experience of the fall of Paris, the occupation of France, the incredible tragedy of war torn Europe.  All sides are given a human face -- how the young were caught up in the inevitable build up to war was a tragedy to everyone.  Yet the novel is not really a tragedy,  rather a compelling story set within tragic times.  It really is a lesson of the durability of the human spirit.
This story is so well plotted and thought out , I could not put it down. History criss crosses itself throughout this book and I came away with a greater appreciation of the suffering of the persons who lived through WWII. The young girl is engaging and tender and her resilience is amazing. You want so badly  for her to meet Werner, the German boy. But no spoilers. If you enjoy historical fiction, you will love this.<br/>Maureen K
I was intrigued by the synopsis, but getting into the book was a disappointment.  It begins too slowly.  I could not stay with it, skipped ahead to find the story and was no longer interested.  I may try once again, since I want to give it a fair trial. Raves are placing it in the top category, and want to find out why. Will probably donate it to my local library with the hopes there will be someone who will give it better reviews.
The rich text just drips off the pages and draws you in. I loved the detailed descriptions. All my senses were engaged while reading. As I got toward the end, the pace picked up so that I found I just couldn't put it down!<br/>However; I reluctantly have to say that some of the final chapters didn't fit together for me. The storyline was running so smoothly but as he tries to resolve he loses me.<br/>Otherwise an excellent read.
Dealing with WWll, this book is difficult to read. There are two parallel stories, each one dealing with  young people coping with the dark days of the war,one in France and the other in Germany. Then, their paths cross. The author does a wonderful job telling their stories. As difficult as it is to read, we all should know what people lived through and coped with during the war. I suggest you read it with the box of tissues handy
This is a superb book, almost ethereal at times.  Mr. Doer writes wonderfully, and weaves such a magnificent story from the main voices of a young French girl and a young German boy, leading the reader through World War II.  I was left with one question:  was the diamond sent out to sea by Marie or was it still in the little house at the end of the story?  Whatever the answer, it provides recurring centering of the novel.  Superb!
Sad and poignantly written, this WWII vintage fictional account paints a beautiful yet horrific picture of the war as seen through the eyes of a German soldier and through the unseeing eyes of a blind Parisian girl forced to flee her city because of the German invasion.  Surprisingly robust, the author continually grasps one's interest.  I couldn't help starting to care about what happens to the protagonists.  Highly recommended.
This book is beautifully written. The prose is a delight to read. Many friends had recommended it to me and I'm glad I finally took their urgings to heart and jumped in. Just one criticism--the plot is very slow to build. I was really caught up in it and then it began to drag. Ifelt as though it was 1,000 pages long. Toward the end, it accelerates a bit.<br/><br/>In spite of that one negative comment, I really enjoyed this one.
This was beautifully written and completely engaging. The story moves back and forth between the point of view of a blind French girl and a German boy who is fascinated by science and by radios, and caught up in the German war machine. The story flashes back in time to before the war and the two characters come together during the allied bombardment and invasion of France. Both points of view are skillfully rendered. A must read.
Another good read with WWII as the backdrop, this time in Paris. The father was ingenious in how he taught his daughter to deal with her inevitable blindness, and she adapted well to his teaching. An enemy, a young man, turned out to be her savior.  Situations brought out the worst and the best in human behavior as victims sought to survive any way they could. I highly recommend this book, and I think it's worthy of the Pulitzer!
So up to the ending, I would say this is one of the best books I've read in the last five years. But did anyone else have trouble with the ending? The rest of the book was so beautifully written that I did not expect to be dropped practically mid-sentence at the end.  Yes, I get the part about not knowing whether the gem was recovered or not, but that question seemed to be handled artlessly after pages of superb writing. Just me?
This book touched my heart and soul. The character development was as gentle as the words that flowed from each page.  What did I like? The ebb and tide of the story, the growth of the two main characters.  It was a way of looking at the horrors of World War Two that was unique.  I cannot say exactly why this book made such an impression on me, you will have to determine that for yourself.  It will be one of my favorites always.
Author writes with mesmerizing clarity, touching human interaction, description that puts me IN the plot.  The life links across fear, anger, hostility, ignorance were well presented.  While so much of it touched on the darkness I still feel having been a child during WWII, I DID see the LIGHT burning through.  The hope, the human connection, positive results in the midst of death and destruction  This story will long be with me
I love books on this subject, but I am slogging through this one. It is very disjointed, for me. I'm glad it has received such good reviews, because it's an important subject. Still, I can't wait for it to be over. I am not enjoying the writing, and not even sure why I remain with it. So many five star reviews. I keep hoping I "get into" it, but its pleasures as a story and writing elude me. Guess I am missing something.
Loved this book.  The authors prose is almost poetry.  There are some scenes that are cruel violence, but are not just "thrown in for effect."  There really is just one sexual content area and also cruel, but a part of the story that is authentic in its context.<br/>All this being said, it is best for mature readers only.  I am very glad I read it.  We are part of a book discussion group and everyone liked it very much.
Until halfway through - it was magical, fabulous. --  But then - the attempts to draw all the threads together  - didn't quite work, I think.  I ended up feeling let down.  All the hope and magic are gone. The survivors are the mediocre.  Is this the dull, horrible reality of war -  Maybe - . but,  I had anticipated not dull reality - but transcendence,.  I haven't read any other reviews.  I assume many feel quite otherwise... .
I loved this book.  Two wonderful histories, really, either of which could stand alone.  But the intertwining of the histories stands as a metaphor for the intricate network connecting our lives to the lives of others.  We inspire, and are inspired by, one another at a distance, across time.  Unexpectedly, we find that we are not strangers.  War does violence to, but can't erase that connection.  Sometimes we need that reminder.
Gripping drama which passed between 2 time periods and locations.  Sometimes a little confusing when I had put the book down and picked it up later--which year we were in and who we were with.  I did not know anything about this particular incident in the French town of Saint- Malo.  The author stayed true to history--I found it necessary to learn more about Saint-Malo on the internet (there is a wealth of info and photographs).
One of the best books of the year, or any year. Anthony Doerr traces the lives of a teenage German boy and a blind girl in France before and during WWII with such depth and humanity, and all the other characters as well. A brilliant handling of describing their lives, alternating the drama from chapter to chapter. Their meeting towards the end of the war in Saint Malo was  heartbreaking and beautifully written. A stunning novel!
Had a really hard time getting into the book initially. But once I did, I really liked it. Interesting points of view, realistic but still moments of beauty in the people and places described. One note – I originally bought the hardcover but it's large and it wasn't easy to it up while reading it in bed (not so much heavy as just unwieldy and rigid.) I ended up buying the Kindle version which was formatted fine and no problems.
An interesting read.  I bought this because I visited Normandy last year and was in the town where the story took place.  The book centered around a young French girl and a young German soldier. The story spins within their parallel lives until you have a full painting.  I enjoyed the read.  I've read many historical World War II books because the stories are fascinating.  The truth of WWII is amazing and stranger than fiction.
Bought Kindleaudio book for the first time. Was impressed how it kept track of where I was in the book, whether listening or reading it from either my iPhone or my iPad. Audio book came in handy to listen to while on vacation at the beach and the glare would have made it difficult to read. Delivery aside, the book was excellent, comparing the WWII experiences of two adolescents Werner and Marie-Laure. A great read -- or listen.
Beautifully written!  By avoiding the cliches of Nazi Germany and Vichy France, you will have new images of that terrifying period of history known as WWII. The two main characters' lives run in parallel, one in Germany and one in France, and eventually and briefly the two lives intersect in Saint Malo, in the Brittany region of France.  Nice short chapters as well as the interesting story lines will keep you turning the pages.
This is one of my favorite books. I had just returned from Paris and the story from the female side was centered around many of the areas I had walked. This is the first book that gave such an illuminating picture from both sides of the war, the German boy and French girl. Clearly shows the destruction, fear and futility of war. I loved the way each chapter gave a different story of what each person was going through. Loved it!
The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I found it easy to put down - though I looked forward to picking it up each time.  It is well written, and I really got to know the characters.  I even ended up rooting to characters that were "the bad guys" because they were like family.  I usually read non-stop:  finish a book and pick up a new one.  I thought about this book for days before I picked up another.
I started reading this on an e-reader but after the first 100 pages, I knew I would want a hard copy on my bookshelf.  I am mid way through my second reading and taking my time to savor the storyline and the wonderful phrasing selected by the author.  There is an interrelated primary, secondary and tertiary tale woven into this novel that is tight and gives layers of unexpected texture to each of the characters.  What a treat!
Having just come back from a trip to France and spending a week in Brittany and the beaches of Normandy, I found the book historically accurate.  More important the story of the two young people involved in WWII portrayed the heart break and tragedy of Hitler's evil design on the people of Europe.  It humanized the war from a point of view not often discussed.<br/>I couldn't put this book down.  Finally finished at 3:00 a.m..
The beginning of the story took hold of my imagination. I became aware of the sounds and smells  of the towns described. Interest in the welfare of the characters, all of them, grew In me as I read. However, at some point,the story became so sad. Instead of the hope that the human spirit will overcome its obstacles,  I felt that the characters, every one of them, were actually defeated. At the end of the book, I was depressed.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and reading from the two character's different perspectives, a French girl and a german boy. This book kept me engaged throughout and had me turning the pages.  Other books I have read and loved that are similar are The Book Thief and Sara's Key. This was a very well written engaging read and a 5 star for me.
Wonderful read and I truly cared about all the characters. The writing was absolutely fantastic and I was absorbed throughout. I won't give a synopsis about the story, but rather state that it was such a joy to read I was feeling so conflicted by the end because I wanted to reach it, yet I didn't want to leave it. I look forward to reading more from this author and cannot say enough how this was such a rich and absorbing read.
I know  many people liked this book, but I found the author's meandering from character to character, interspersed with back and forth time changes, confusing and failed to pull it all together. I saw very little "light" in this very depressing story and the endless prose like descriptive passages distracting. Sorry, cannot recommend this book.
Just a marvelous book.  Shows the heights and depths of the human mind in a tale that is suspenseful but not needlessly violent, despite the WW2 setting.  One gets a feel for the quotidian Germans swept up by the Nazi insanity.  While you get to understand them a bit, you do not forgive them.  A story of like able French working class people is also told.  I am near the end of the book though not quite there.  I will miss it.
Great book!!  If I wasn't reading it.....I was thinking about it.  It will make you think about humanity...or the lack of humanity during war and what we'll do to "just" survive.  At times the emotion is so raw...it makes you swell up inside and you need to stop reading just to gather your emotion.  I highly recommend this book...I know it's published as fiction, but there's a lot of history that should be remembered.
This book is a gem, and the author a genius. It has so many layers--it could be studied [just this one book] for an entire semester and all of it would not be unraveled when the class finished. I loved it -- and I don't usually enjoy the "tired tricks" of literary fiction. They often lack creativity -- but this one did not. It was inventive and creative in the telling of the story from beginning to end. BUY THIS BOOK!
I loved the style of writing this author uses. The descriptionswere elegant and beautiful. As I read the story, I was caught up in the way it switched from one story to another. It gave me an excellent glimpse of Germany and France during the war.However, I was ready for the book to and about 200 pages before it actually ended. After it ended, I felt there were several things that were not resolved in a way that satisfied me.
Anthony Doerr is a magical writer. His characters breathe and stand out from the page. I am not fond<br/>of books about war, but this one engages with story, description, humanity and the everyday life<br/>of two young people from France and Germany on opposite sides in the war.<br/>Doerr artfully combines research, history,<br/>science, philosophy, life, war, and fantasy in a novel that is a wonderful reading experience.
Beautifully crafted WWII story of human suffering and the senselessness of war.  The German children who were molded to become a super race and the French people during the occupation of France by Germany.  The stories connect in a uniquely narrated prose.  The stories spiral away from each other as they so often do in reality.  Nicely tied together through the shared memories.  I will try other books written by Anthony Doerr.
Doerr used well crafted imagery to pull the reader into the novel. The stories built up at a steady pace and kept one interested and engaged. I enjoyed discovering how the individual storylines interrelated and finally, came full circle. The novel has a strong core that evokes raw emotion. I would recommend this novel to anyone looking for an easier read that will have you evaluating the light of life from a new perspective.
If it were possible to give 10 stars, I would do so! But I cannot begin to do justice to this book by describing it's content. JUST READ IT!!!!! This is one of those books that make you feel enriched. That makes you aware of how a system can corrupt even good willing people. And that there always will be steadfast people with faith in themselves and in those they love. And what sharing knowledge can achieve.. And and and...
This historical WW II novel weaves a unique storyline of two young people on opposing sides and how the war eventually crossed their paths.  It is written with exceptional vocabulary that actually gives "light" where there was none during those dark days. The descriptions of the actions of this Nazi Force, both to its young people and those they conquered, is chilling. The ending is especially redeeming and hopeful.
I loved the perspective of Werner. His experiences as a Hitler Youth, and later as a Nazi seemed so genuine. It was squite easy to see how so many people were led into the Nazi machine. The common thread of the radio broadcast that ultimately brings Werner and Marie together is beautiful. In the end, it's the light we cannot see that brings people together, gives people hope, and makes us feel loved. It's a beautiful story.
One of the best books I've ever read. Set in WWII Europe, told as an intertwining of stories of both innocent civilians and not-so-innocent participants in the invasion and the resistance. The author spoke to our differences, our samenesses, and the losses and tragedies of war - always using the most beautiful and descriptive language I've experienced in a very long time. Lyrical, poignant, and well worth your time to read.
The highest complement I can pay to a novel is that it feels like a true story – a profound and beautiful true story.  The seemingly effortless, spare beauty of the writing is a delight.  It just happens, as part of the story, to light up the amazing world of the blind in a way that nothing I've ever read before could do. The novel is so much more than that, but it's absolutely worth the read  for that poetic miracle alone.
This should have been the National Book Award winner.  It was a wonderful read.  I so liked the short chapters that allowed me to grab it so many times a day.  The short chapters are also a superb device for telling the dual stories of the two main characters.  Doerr's use of language is beautiful with imagery, mystery, and description that lingers in your mind.  It is one of the best novels I have read in a long long time.
I do not usually read war stories, but this was not a typical WWII tale. The characters were enchanting and the arc that seemed to point them at each other swung through many possible interactions as time moved them along. I was engaged early and stayed with it through well written characters and prose that stayed out of the way while creating motion and interest, color and life. I will be looking for more from this author.
The imagery is astounding in this beautifully crafted  collage of lives whose destinies are drawn in a sad lottery of war!  Hope and despair are dancers in this story of  preservation of life vs. the power of greed and self-agrandisement. The enlightment seeps through in the weaving of stories, musical references and the steady survival of all things and creatures, great and small. Hard to put down and sad when it is over!
Kindle Edition (edit)<br/><br/>review<br/>Like "Anne Frank" this novel lets us see WWII from the point of view of the children. The story of Werner is really the story of the average German citizen in the war. But the book is not an apology and does not create villains where there are none. Instead like "Huckleberry Finn" Evil is all around, slowly engulfing even the most innocent. It is an amazing book.
I don't often feel moved by a story. I generally close a book and move on to the next one. Not so with Light.<br/>The characters are believable, the setting of time and place evocative, and the language is full and rich.  It moved me,  haunted me.  I need to meet these characters and hold them.<br/>I regret having purchased it on my Kindle.  I have half a dozen friends who need to read this book.  I will buy a hard copy.
A touching and unique way to experience WW II. Beautifully written! I visualized exactly where I was in the story, be it Paris , Brittany or a bunker. I hope some smart person has bought the film rights.  Can't wait to see it on the big screen. Well worth reading! Well developed characters, suspenseful  plot, awesome descriptions. I've never been in a war, but I experienced WW II through this skillfully told tale. Read it!
The best book I have read in a long time. It's been three months since I finished it, and I still think about the characters. It's almost like they are lost friends that I miss. The writing is unique, with alternating story telling that switches between the lives of the two main characters, winding them closer and closer together. This book evoked many emotions from me, and it is one that will stay with me for a long time.
This book allows you to feel once again all the angst and uncertainty of adolescence as two very different teens discover the world of adults surrounding them with war as the hideous backdrop. There's also a considerable amount of historically accurate insight into the Reich's recruitment and treatment of very vulnerable young men.  By the end one is terribly proud of the young French woman who overcomes so much challenge.
In reading this book, I thought of the old saying, "The saddest saying of mice or men are these four words,  'it might have been'". I don't remember who wrote those words, but they are indeed true! War and greed wreak havoc and waste. Each of the characters in this book had such potential - yet the blind girl seems to have a clearer insight than any one of them. There were many lessons to be learned from this book!
I would give this book 6 stars if I could.  I only ordered it because someone recommended it.  I kept seeing it on the Times best seller list, but I didn't think I would enjoy it.  OMG!!!  Everyone should read this book!!  It was absolutely fantastic.  I so enjoyed the way the author intertwined the characters' lives.  It was so very beautifully written, I really couldn't put it down.  A MUST read as far as I'm concerned!!
Anthony Doerr has written a beautiful book about a blind girl and her way of managing in the war-time of  Europe........and the aftermath of its horrors......I couldn't put the book down until I had finished it........Recommended by friends and to others......The ways of figuring out problems of physics and chemistry and the world in which we live......and the relationships that can be formed without pre-planning..........
Anthony Doerr writes of a blind girl and you feel that down to the last detail, he knows the challenges one faces and writes from this perspective in a very visual way. He also writes from the perspective of a young orphan trying to better himself through adopting World War II nazism in order to protect his sister. Such different situations and yet, Doerr is able to write from both perspectives with clarity and compassion.
I had not read this author's work before.  I wasn't sure I would care for it since the story was set in the end of World War II and Nazi Germany's take over of France.  It contained some descriptions of the horrible things expected of that country's young men, but I guess every war is about young men and women and what they go through.  This is an exceptional book and I really cared about the characters, hard to put down.
I just could not get into this book. Too much information to get to the end of the story which was disappointing. I'm not sure why this is considered such a compelling book. It isn't that the writing isn't excellent, the story just went on and on and on. I wasn't sure where it was leading even though I knew it had to be to connect the two main characters. They spent less than a day together, I think. Would not recommend.
Overall a nice story, but I wouldn't give it as much praise as it's been getting. Some of the writing seemed forced and it took a long time to get moving. However, it's likely the allegories went over my head and missed the hidden meaning of the story, so a more seasoned reader will probably get a lot out of it. I just felt like the writing made me work harder than I wanted to to understand what the author was getting at.
The most beautiful book I've read in many years.  If you are obsessed with WW 2 as I am, you will really love this story.  A young German orphan finds a broken Crystal set, repairs it & becomes obsessed with radios. A young blind French girl's father is the key holder for a Paris museum. The war happens & this amazing story of their intertwining lives ensues. Love, death and tragedy. Read this book. I loved every chapter.
This novel weaves together the lives of two characters. One is a French girl and the other a German boy. The book takes place during world war two. Their lives are very different. The horrors and losses inherent in war are described. At the end of the war the two protagonists come together and their differences fade. Even in the worst of times there remains a spark of humanity that can kindle hope. I recommend this novel.
I am a person who has to have history fed to me through fiction and I liked learning about WW2 through the experiences of the two main characters, Werner and Marie-laure.  I always wondered how Germany came to follow Hitler and why didnt anyone make a stand and this book helps explain it a little. I also like to walk a mile in someone's shoes and the writer does an excellent job of creating Marie-Laurie's sightless world.
Anthony Doerr has become one of my favorite authors ever since his first book of short stories.  His ability to show  exactly the right detail and to express it in lyric language makes him one of the best writers writing today.  This novel not only has exquisite language but well developed characters, insight into people caught in the horror of World War Two, but a wonderful story.  I will read anything by Anthony Doerr .
Great character development...This book gave a whole new appreciation for the devastation that war wreaks on the entire population. I especially enjoyed the last few mini chapters which gave summaries of the characters' lives as the years passed. I have already recommended this book to many friends.
Since so many reviewers have already summarized the plot of this novel, I won't waste your time going over the characters and events in this wonderful book. If you are hesitating to read it, don't. I have no doubt that this will be one of the best books I will read this year. I already know that I will have to read it again soon. It is beautifully written with complex believable characters; it is sad and haunting, joyful, and captivating--a very different look at WWII. The story progresses through its journey in a quiet manner with a non-linearly constructed plot. Its beginning, middle and end are all beautifully paced--neither hurriedly contrived nor gimmicky. This is one exquisite read. I highly recommend it.
I had never read anything by this author. Was pleasantly surprised.
Enjoyed the story being told by several different characters.  Was a little slow at times but the last third of the novel really draws you in.  Definitely worth the read.
Unique, touching, riveting.
Beautifully written, ingenious plot, rich understanding of the minds of the characters.
So beautifully written you will think that you have been transported back in time to wartime France. Thought provoking, sad and honest. This incredible story will leave you wishing it hadn't ended.
Although i promised myself i did not wan tot read another WWII book, i picked it up b/c of the title.  And, I love the characters & the feel of the book.  I plan in reading more Anthony Doerr!!!
All the Light We Cannot See is a crafted, intertwining story beautifully told. The author works with words the way an artist would with paint, wasting nothing, making every stroke contribute to the whole. Doerr creates multiple plots with a timeline that weaves back and forth across the years of World War II and beyond while the characters converge and eventually intercept one another on a path that seems fated. He manages to do this in a simple yet elegant way so that the reader is never confused and is always grounded in the time and place. This is without a doubt one of the best novels I've read in the past several years.
I enjoyed this book - the story was sad - but World War II was not a happy time and the main characters<br/>all struggle. I will not give away any of the story but it's worth reading.
Just finished reading this amazing book. A little thick, but totally worth it. Beautiful characters. Definitely a must-read.
Truly unforgettable for its amazing descriptions and remarkable characters. A great understanding of what it was to be young during a war.
A great book.  The characters all seem so real, each playing a part in the drama that was WWII.  From Marie Laure and her father and the family she meets later, to Wener and his sister, to the school, to the army - all so believable.  St. Malo is almost a character and to anyone who has ever been there,  the city breathes and lives.<br/><br/>Wonderfully done.
One of the best novels I've read in a long time!
A very gripping reading and beautiful language. The persons are interesting and special and clearly drawn. It shows the terror and futility of war and the private suffering of everybody concerned.
What a deft touch the author has in so sensitively treating the two main characters!
Very difficult to put down. The pain of war, the way it affected people and changed them forever. It was beautifully written and one of the best books I've ever read as well.
I had a drive-way NPR moment ([...]) and walked into my house & ordered this book! I was not disappointed.
I found this book to be a very compelling and well balanced tale of two teenagers caught up in the war, and experiencing it from very different vantage points.  The author did an excellent job of just telling the story - without a lot of judgement.  You can see how even the best of people get caught up in nationalism, but also how the many everyday Germans harbored great doubts about what was going on.  The book goes back and forth telling the story of a young German soldier - who happens to be a whiz with radios and electronics,and a slightly younger French girl who was blinded in her early childhood. Both characters are compelling, and as the story is told, the reader finds that the two have an interesting connection.  The author tells the story in a simple straightforward manner and does not try to make the German characters villains nor the French as necessarily heroes, but simply as people caught up in a long and horrible conflict.  I recommend it highly.
I can not say strongly enough, "Read This Book". The development of Marie-Laure's and Werner's characters is nothing but fantastic. Never have I felt such emotional connections to two (2) people, as I did to Marie-Laure and Werner. The development of all other characters is also nothing but amazing. Being a student of World War II, I was able to feel the evil set upon the world by Hitler and his Nazi party, throughout the book, without Doerr hitting you over the head. After this read, I will be a dyed-in-wool fan of Mr. Doerr, even if his other books are only 75% as good as "All The Light". I am truly blown away. Thank you Mr. Doerr.
Rarely does one come across a book so well written. I enjoyed every page, lived, smelled, felt every description. A new take on a war whose horrors have been recounted countless times. One of the Protagonist is blind. Mr Doerr describes her world so vividly that you become immersed in inner thoughts. Will recommend. Thank- you for this great experience.
I hope they make a movie, a good one, of this book because it deserves to be told and retold.  Centered in WWII, the main characters are an orphan savant genius and a complex blind French girl.  Though the book shifts back and forth between time and location, it is easy to follow and full of unpredictable course changes. I read a lot - so much so that I forget what a book was about - but not this one.  This is memorable.
this beautiful story, of faith and love and loyalty, changes at every turn and leaves you holding your breath till the very last page.<br/>The level of poverty and hardship is almost unbelievable.<br/>Yet every part of the story is utterly  believable.<br/>The strong bonds of family...father daughter, brother sister, great uncle,  niece.<br/>The setting is in a land, France, and a continent, Europe, destroyed by war.
The horrors of Hitler's Third Reich from very different, but relatable perspectives. No concentration camps needed - the impact on everyone whether considered a 'victim' or not, was immense and the book gives us a peek into those impacts. I purchased this book as my 'read only on smartphone when stuck waiting somewhere' book, but I couldn't stretch it out that long and ended up reading it in bed every night to finish it!
I must admit, there were times during my reading that I thought the writing style was just too flowery.  But the plot kept me reading on and on, and I finished the book quite quickly.  I truly enjoyed the story and charachters.  "Seeing" the world from the prospective of a blind girl was enlightening.  She had such depth and understanding of so many things that most of us do not.  A very enjoyable read, for sure.
A poignant account of the deeply personal experience of war from opposing sides of WWII. Through the stories of a young French girl and a German boy, whose circumstances are vastly different but who both suffer its horrors in vivid detail, the conflict becomes a tale of their common suffering. Two remarkable, intelligent and exceptional young people know hope, courage, fear, doubt, resignation and loss. Beautifully told.
I enjoyed this book very much. Anthony Doerr's attention to detail and historical fact is amazing. The book is not written chronologically, and skips back and forth from character to character, and time to time. This can be both enlightening and disconcerting. But, the overall story is captivating and beautifully written. It will become a story you recall and contemplate many times after you finish. I found it wonderful.
Beautifully written, lyrical. A little-known episode of World War II is revealed with the development of two major characters from different worlds--a blind French girl with a strong penchant for survival and a German orphan drafted by the Reich because he is a mechanical genius. The point of view and timeline shift back and forth with the effect of creating suspense and meshing the worlds of the two characters together.
Mr. Doerr writes so well...He wrote so convincingly that I found myself  in the shoes of the main character Marie-Laure as a blind girl. I actually found myself counting the distance with my feet from my home door to the Safeway in my neighborhood!  This writer weaves a very arresting compelling WWII story...I loved all the well developed characters. Not to spoil the story, only to say its extremely good and a must read.
Excellent. Beautifully written and just the combination of history, insight, suspense, and character development that makes for a great read. I stayed up way too late for way too many nights because of this book. Not healthy. Some of the images created will haunt me for some time. Mr. Doerr has created an incredible sensual experience for the reader. I love seeing a piece of history from so many different vantage points.
I read this book with my book club and we all loved it. It generated some great discussion on political decisions and on the personal decisions we make that define us. Many times we don't feel we have any choices, but we do have some. This was a good look at the choices people make and the impact those choices have on self and others. The characters were well defined, interesting and complex. I highly recommend the book.
Great read!  I loved the mythical elements and the historical perspective, but my favorite part was the small acts of heroism portrayed by ordinary people during the war.  They were just small parts of the overall plot and story, but I thought they were so powerful.<br/>The timeline jumped back and forth which made it a bit hard to follow at times, but the book is so good that this small annoyance is easily overlooked.
It took me a little while to get sucked into this book, but once I did, I had a hard time putting it down. Doerr's language used to describe things was so interesting and I felt like I could really picture scenes in my mind. It was also interesting to learn and think about how life was for both sides in the war. I really felt connected to both main characters and thoroughly enjoyed the story. Would definitely recommend.
What a wonderful story, told in such clean, effortless prose. The characters are rich, and full of life, and their path leading up to and through what we call World War II makes for great reading. It is the type of story that is so engrossing, I find myself stopping to tell someone about some special anecdote form what my life that relates to whatever we're discussing, only to realize that it really comes from the book.
Our book club enjoyed this book.  It was not the typical WWII novel as it took the perspective of a young German boy and a young French girl growing up during the time preceding and during the war. The contrasts of their society, their family life experience and the influence of community members/friends were all very interesting.  It was a bit of a "fairy tale", a mystery, an adventure and history all combined.
Hard to put down. I like the vivid character development and the brief ,sad but critical interaction of the young German soldier and his would be resourceful young and blind French  "enemy ". A story which highlighted for me the wasteful destruction of resources and the loss of future human potential from war. Story of  triumphant  strength, will to survive,  and persistent love and goodness in the face of evil.
This is a beautiful and horrifying story that I could not put down. The characters are so real that I feel I actually met them. I have read many books about the war and lived in Germany on an old WWII air force base for a few years where the ghosts of the past felt near.  This story captured the feeling of hopelessness the characters had and their inability to change what they knew was wrong.  This is a wonderful book.
Fascinating story!  WWII in a whole new way -  seen through the thoughts and actions of a young German boy and and a young French girl.  It prvookes discussion on many levels and I've recommended it to all my friends, both male and female.  One caveat:  the reader must be very aware of the date at the start of each chapter as this writer, very excellent, does move back and forth in time.  I didn't want the book to end!
The stories were intriguing and the Dickensonian plot where many threads became woven together was engaging. As the book was written in the present tense and the time frames moved back and forth, you have to pay attention to where you are when you begin each chapter. I was left with two big questions. 1. What did the title mean? and 2. What was the significance of the Sea of Flames. Read it and see if you have answers!
A beautiful saga of World War Two from the the perspective of German youths caught in the revolution and French youths caught in the occupation.  Werner is a brilliant, young, German orphan whose destiny is ordained early by his love and aptitude for radio.  Marie-Laure is blind daughter of a brilliant French locksmith entrusted with a priceless gem.<br/>A fast read with many short chapters that you don't want to end.
Wonderful story beautifully written! I loved this novel!
Loved this book and felt very bereft when I finished it.
Excellent book. I highly recommend it. Very captivating.
My husband and I read this novel at the same time and we both loved it. It was a little slow at first. You must pay attention to the dates. Keep reading ; I just finished and am saddened that my reading experience is over.  I'm anxious to discuss a discrepancy I perceived with my husband. I probably fell asleep reading and missed something. Now, I must search for a new Ebook for us to read in our two person book club.
Delightful story of two children - an inquisitive orphaned boy in Germany and a blind French girl...both in the throes of World War 2. They, and those around them, are pawns in a war machine yet play their parts, learn of life and grow to make a marvelous difference. Proof perfect that there can be trust and humanity in a world out of their personal control. A WONDERFUL gift to a pawn like me  in a complicated world.
This was a very solid, well-written historical novel about WWII, specifically the German occupation of France.  It’s told in alternating perspectives between a blind, French girl and a German boy soldier/radio whiz.  The reviews make this book sound like the second coming, so my expectations were very high.  Overall, I enjoyed the novel, but I didn’t find it to be overly compelling, either the story or the structure.
If historical novels are your bag then this is for you.  It is set in Paris and St Marlo, both are wonderful cities in France.  It is a story of simple people trying to make sense of all that took place in the 2nd world war.  It is tragic and sensitive and thought provoking but even today there seem to be people who seem to miss the secret of peace.  At the end of the day we are all people trying to have a good life.
I avoided reading this book for a long time - title didn't appeal, synopsis didn't appeal - but finally my curiosity got the better of me.  And, I am so glad.  What a book!  I found myself so tense that I was very uncomfortable.  That, for me, is indicative of an excellent book.  Got totally fascinated and entwined with the protagonists.  Glad the book is finished/sorry the book is finished.  Just an excellent book.
All the Light We Cannot See is a novel of rare perfection. Set during the French occupation of WWII, it navigates the spectrum of human emotion and thought, exploring science and myth in the light of political and personal truth. Saturated and flowing with insights, the author shears away the veneer of civilization, revealing the essence of character at an intersection where survival teeters between will and choice.
The story and characters are captivating.  The book has a choppy feel as it jumps around in time and between characters making it a little difficult to get into initially. But once I got to know the characters, I was excited to see how their stories unfolded. I loved getting the various characters perspectives on WWII. I feel like I really got to know the characters in this book. That is a testament to good writing.
I enjoyed the story. The historical backdrop was interesting, and it was very well written. The ending was disappointing. While I believe the message was about the intangible sensory powers we possess and other invisible forces that encompass our lives, the ending seemed to make the story much ado for naught. It was also difficult to maintain a sense of continuity due to the jumping back and forth between the years.
This is a beautifully written book.  The characters are extremely engaging. It is hard to put down because you want to know what will happen next.  The narrative jumps around in time a lot, so if that sort of thing bothers you, you may not like the book, but I would recommend the book to almost anyone.  It's a good book club book because it does not take a long time to read and because it gives you a lot to discuss.
Great book with great writing! I really enjoyed the story and find myself thinking of the characters still a week later. A story of survival, missed opportunities and internal consequences of not doing the right thing - even when circumstances seem to force doing the wrong thing. Would definitely recommend this book and also recommend The Invisible Bridge for those that enjoy a beautiful love story during this era.
A poignant slice of WWII and some of its effects on a French family and a German family.  The travails and triumphs of the blind French girl and the orphan German boy pushed this reader to finish as quickly as possible even as I expected the worst outcome(s).  The missing treasure provided an interesting story frame, but did not interfere with more fundamental essence/nature of the tale. You won't forget this book.
This is a rare, perceptive book, unique in addressing the horrors of war through a joining of polar opposites. Throughout, it maintains the reader's sympathy with both a vulnerable victim and a hero of the brutal occupying force. The inevitable conclusion, predictable from the start, is no less tear-jerking than if it was accidental. Credible, graphic, emotionally charged. I'll soon start reading it all over again.
even tho the plot was fairly predictable - I mean after all we know who won the war - I still found it to be very fast paced and I really read very quickly wanting to be confirmed in my ideas of what would happen.  Really enjoyed it - especially the very good character development and descriptions of what they were living through.  And I liked the jumping around of the time - to me, made it even more interesting.
I bought this book because my friend that reads many books that I like said it was the best book he ever read.  I appreciated the story but the writer took too long getting there.  I would describe it as verbose with metaphors on steroids.  I don't like his writing style.  It is just personal taste.  He did give a good idea of what living in France and Germany during WWII was like but it was a tedious read for me
This astounding book has made the time of the Second World War in France and Germany come alive in the stories of a blind young French girl and a young German orphan boy who is forced into the army.  It has held me spellbound from beginning to end, and kept me guessing throughout.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book with 'meat' after a series of insipid romances, and would recommend this book strongly to anyone.
What stands out for me is the love between a father and his daughter, which is what keeps me reading it:  What will happen to them?  This parental love story extends to the gifted German orphan boy and his overwhelmed surrogate parent, the tireless woman who runs the orphanage.  Doerr's descriptions of nature are also evocative and lovely.  All of this love and beauty and sweetness, juxtaposed with horroble Nazis
I really liked this book! Although it is set in World War II like many books are, it has a different spin on it as it follows a blind girl who lives in France and an orphan German boy who comes to serve in the Nazi army. It doesn't really touch on the Holocaust or the Jewish persecution but more on the events in the two character's lives.  I was engrossed and couldn't wait to get to the end! Definitely recommend!
Pause for a moment, close your eyes, and take a deep breath.  This is a book for doing all of that. Savor the detailed images that Anthony Doerr so carefully, and beautifully describes.  It is at times a tender, painful and heartwarming book that pulls you through from beginning to end. My relatives lived through this war in Norway and Europe and were changed.  This book gave me a glimpse.  I recommend this book.
I enjoyed this historical novel. A complicated story of human suffering and strength.  I grew up during World War II. I certainly knew the discomforts of that time for Americans. There is no way I could ever imagine the suffering that went on during that time.  Survival was truly a miracle!  Hardships were endured that few of us could even imagine. Love of country and family is beatifically depicted. A good read!
The novel was tightly and beautifully written . The two stories told in a parallel narrative pulled me into the story while I wondered when these two narratives would intersect. The description of the reality of blindness was insightful and instructive for the reader. The description of what happened to these towns on the French coast during the war by both sides was heart breaking. This is a definite must read.
Many themes are mined in this mesmerizing tale by Anthony Doerr. Youth, innocence, love, power, greed, war, science, communication, nature. It is as wide as it is deep and leaves the reader (at least me), shell shocked, exhausted and yet hopeful as life and family, love and nature continue on, surviving and even thriving after the deprivation, violence and senseless loss which is war. Will not soon be forgotten.
What an intense, emotional, beautifully written story!  I was drawn in by the warmth of the characters and the intense difficulty of their times; but this book was made so much more fascinating by its description of mathematic formulas, scientific theories and its fascinating descriptions  of nature. I am amazed when I read such a wonderful work  at how special a work of art and meaning the written word remains.
This book will either inspire would-be novelists or make them give it up forever. Doerr's beautiful storytelling and impeccable imagination makes characters come alive in the mind of the reader. The book is deeply researched and the connections among characters develop in surprising ways that afterward seem natural. The title itself is suggestive in numerous ways throughout the novel. Just an astonishing work.
This book was an incredible surprise.  In beginning it, I had problems with being switched from one character to the other which continues throughout book.  Upon adapting, I realized that this method added to the mystery of story.  The characters were very realistic.  I so appreciated the author's in depth study of the times to be able to present this so realistically.  I hated finishing as the story was over.
All the Light We Cannot See is a book that will stay with me for a long time. It is written from several points of view, in very short chapters that stitch together moving portraits of people living through the war.  There is a strong plot but it is foremost a poignant look at the very real people on both sides of the war.  A war story that is little about war, but is a story of patience, gentleness, and love.
All the Light We Cannot See is John Steinbeck's The Pearl cast in World War II. Like The Pearl, Doerr's novel allows readers to connect with the main characters so that we share in their sorrows and joys and fears and triumphs. Ultimately, Steinbeck and Doerr ask the reader to decide to what extent does a pearl or a diamond or time or place define who we are? And to what extent, do we? This book is why I read.
A beautiful story of the human spirit. This WW2 story comes from several perspectives and offers insight to the times of change and political tyranny.The writing is lyrical and  descriptive, just lovely.  One point, this book changes narrators and is best read in a few sittings, or just one!  If you wait too long between chapters the story can get confusing.I Fortunately it is very hard to put down. Recommend!
I am going out on a ledge here:  "Step aside, 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' I think I have a new All-Time Favorite Novel.  I loved everything about "All the Light We Cannot See."  The story.  The characters.  And Anthony Doerr's exquisite writing, which is lyrical and unlike anything I have ever read before.  I haven't stopped singing the praises of "All the Light...." to my book-loving friends.
This will definitely rank among my all-time top 10 (that list is getting crowded and yet I save those spaces for what I consider to be the very best).  I was captivated the entire time while reading this book.  I love how the author tied everyone together and we got to flash forward a few decades to see the outcome(s).  This would make a wonderful movie - I'm casting it in my head.  Highly recommend this read.
I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I got it for a book club that meets once a month and read this in two weeks. It doesn't really have a ton of violence but if you know anything about the time period this was written it couldn't be an authentic book without some minor violence. It is very mild. This book is worth your time, it is poetic, well written and a beautiful story. Highly recommend this book.
A very good read.  It was difficult to figure out the time line.  The author jumped between past and present at unpredictable times.  By the end of the book, I was used to the jumping around, but I lost the story line a few times and had to backtrack.  The story did not end as I expected, but that's a great finish - the one you don't see coming.  I would recommend the book and I will read more of this author.
This book was touted as a love story between a French blind girl and a German solider.  The love story was a small part near the ending but significant.  Mostly the book was about the girl and her survival in Nazi-occupied France and a German boy enrolled in the Hitler Youth.  Very interesting.  Slow to start, great in the middle, kind of confusing for the end.  But I still recommend it.  Beautifully written.
During the war there are two stories of two children growing up in the same part of the world with difference back grounds.  The boy is in an orphanage, who is very gifted fixing things.  The girl is blind.  They are on opposite sides of the war, however, the twists and turns of their lives bring them together.  You'll need to read this great story to see how their lives came together and how their lives end.
This was a wonderful story that chronicled World War II through the "eyes" of a blind girl, her father, her town and a young German boy.  The anticipation of seeing how these lives would intersect is what kept my interest throughout the book.  There were times when it was difficult to follow the story because it was not done in chronological order.  This is challenging when reading a book on a Kindle.
Thank you Anthony Doerr for an outstanding story.  The Book was not easy to read.  Going back and forth from past to present, from present to past, from character to character.  At first confusing, and then enlightening as the characters collide in story line after story line, so interconnected with each other, some never even meeting. The writing was excellent. The story is complicated. Kudos to the author.
This is one of the most exquisitely written books I've read in a very long time.  The characters are believable and sympathetic.  The author  understands human nature, good and bad and in-between, and writes lovingly about almost all of the characters.  I cannot say enough about this gem of a book.  Prepare to have your heart broken, though, as it is a very sad book about a very sad chapter of human history.
i love a good story and this was a great story.  For me the flowery prose occasionally got in the way of the story and the time periods jumping back and forth made it harder to pick back up and get back into the story the next night.  Those minor nuisances could be shrugged off but the ending left me feeling like my edition was missing chapters.  Maybe if I downloaded the whole book it would get 5 starts :).
This book received lots of praise, yet I found it very disjointed and non engaging. The reader only has a slight attachment to a couple of the characters and much of the story is an implausible ho hum. With so many great books written about WWII and everything related to it, I can't understand how this book has garnered such good review. It may be just me, but I really couldn't recommend this book to anyone.
The story although fictional keeps the reader engrossed. I especially enjoyed the perspective of the blind girl working her way through the exodus of Paris with her father and her encounter with the German sargent searching her uncle's home. Equally as entertaining was the parallel life of the young orphan boy turned German soldier during World War II and the encounter between him and the blind young woman.
This is a long book, but yet there was nothing extraneous about it. When I finished it, I thought about the characters for days - always the sign of a good book. I loved the radio science and the look into the early days of wireless communications, and it was beautifully coupled with the challenges of blindness. This book manages to paint both sides of the war with humanness that is not sappy or simplistic.
Having felt overdosed on WWII fiction, I avoided this one for awhile, but finally gave in on the advice of someone whose choices I respect; I'm really glad. There is some violence, of course, b/c it's about war, but it's mostly descriptions of bombing -- though at a German school for talented kids, there are a few instances I found disturbing. Highly recommended - I liked the structure of the book, as well.
Beautifully written novel about the lives of a blind French girl and a young German soldier in the years before, during, and after WWII. The way the author seamlessly moves the story back and forth in time heightens the suspense and keeps you quickly turning pages. And the way he ultimately weaves the two lives together creates meaning and purpose that will stay with you long after you've finished the book.
The story is intriguing...or I should say stories, as there are two principal characters.  The author bounces back and forth between the two which I found somewhat disruptive and arbitrary.  I am guessing that was an editor's touch?  The two plot lines finally come together.<br/>I enjoyed the book and will probably recommend it for our book group, but I think it could have benefited with some cutting.
An outstanding book,  very well written I spent late nights reading it<br/> The plot  was brilliantly developed with the contrasting worlds of France and Germany. Also the vivid imagery used to describe the protagonists took the reader right into their worlds every step of the way. I highly recommend this book. It's not often that writing in today's world can be as effective as that of Charles Dickens.
A riveting story, realistic to a stunning degree, characters are sharply drawn and draw one into the story, and the writing is sheer finesse. I hated to have it stop but could not wait to know how it would end.  As one who lived in safety during the second world war, as a boy, of course, it was another fascinating literary experience of a simply terrifying time in our Western History.  So well written.
I loved this book.  You can't help but fall in love with the characters and their pure hearts in this coming-of-age story.  Marie-Laure and Werner are all the good in the stories that were lost in Nazi Germany and Europe during World War II.  It's suspenseful and thoughtful, daring and hopeful...even though it's long, you won't be able to put it down.  I've been telling every person I know to read it.
I loved this book.  I had recently read The Nightingale, which is also wonderful, and we just visited the beaches and towns of Normandy, so the subject of World War II on a personal level was of great interest.  Because the narration jumps back and forth between characters, I recommend reading this book over a short period of time.  But it's a really great story, with lots of interesting side stories.
Simply a haunting story and one that I will not soon forget. I had no intention of reading yet another account of the German occupation of France but that was just one aspect of this unforgettable story. This is one of few of the many, many books I have read that I cannot get out of my mind. You are left with a burning question that is not answered but is left to each reader to seek his or her answer.
This was a book that kept your interest to see what<br/>was next. It involved a story of a blind French girl as well<br/>as a young German who was caught up in Hitler's youth<br/>movement. It held one's interest as the plot unfolded. I<br/>gave it 4 stars because of the structure. Instead of<br/>presenting dates in sequence, the author kept mixing<br/>up the dates. It had a very unusual ending.
A very lovely book, thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. Beautifully written and a wonderful thought provoking tale taking place during World War II. I especially liked  the descriptions of the two dominant characters, a young blind French girl and an extremely bright young German boy, both thrown into situations beyond their control. I highly recommend  this book. You will not be disappointed.
I loved this story. A fresh look at WWII in Europe, told from several perspectives. I did not want this book to end! I could have lived in the characters stories and authors magnificent storytelling for weeks and weeks. I hope another great book is right behind this one! Just when you think you've heard the whole German occupation story too much, a book like this comes along to challenge that theory.
A museum worker who tinkers with carpentry cares for his  blind daughter as the world prepares for war in late 1930's Paris.  From 1940 through present day, the book interweaves the journey of the daughter and several other characters as they live their lives and grapple with the choices presented to them.  The legend of a cursed gem leaves the reader wondering whether to believe in the curse or not.
Anthony Doerr created complex characters and thrilling scenes with few well placed words.  He didn't waste--even one.  Each word meant something pertinent to the story.  His characters are living, breathing creatures with whom I am well acquainted.  I think about them still when i have long since finished the book.  The story wrapped up all the questions except one.  It is for the reader to discover.
It is hard for me to get into a book these days, I'm not sure why.  I bring several home from  the library and end up actually reading maybe just one.  This book is written so well and beautifully; I found that it created an ambience all its own that I was loath to give up.  The story held my interest, the characters were full and lovely. (A few were not lovely, of course.) I was sorry for it to end.
Beautifully written. The depth of the worlds described -- electronics, snails, Hitler's program for youth, Jules Verne -- was stunning. The events in the lives of Werner and Marie-Laure bring them closer and closer. What will happen when they meet? This book haunts me. I want to learn about radios and St. Malo and snails. The questions it leaves me with will continue to haunt me for a very long time.
An exquisitely told tale of two young people separately caught up in unimaginable circumstances and their heroic journeys to stay alive despite the odds against them. Set in France and Germany during WWll, you will find yourself anxiously waiting for the next chapter in their struggles. Brilliantly written with beautifully drawn characters you haven't seen before in a novel. A hard book to put down.
The story line of this book is fantastic. It was a little difficult to read because of the French and German languages. Also, the story was not told in chronological order. It took me a while to figure that out. However, the story does give you insight of how people dealt the with the devastation of war. It also gives how people with handicaps had to overcome their situation and frustrations of war.
Touching story that includes some suspense.  The characters are well-developed so you care about them throughout the story.  The author writes well and engages you in the atmosphere, community life, and relationships for both the Germans and the French during World War II.  They are not all white hats & black hats, but individuals who learn to face what life brings to them and find a way to survive.
This was a rare treat. I hate reading books that everyone hypes because usually disappointment follows. This was not the case.the book preserves balance between hope and pathos that is well blended .<br/>  I feared it might have more gender appeal , female verses male, but that is not the case. In many ways it left me feeling like I felt at the end of Sophie's Choice. Great credit to you Mr. Doerr.
Not just another WW2 story, this is an account of two young people whose very divergent lives takes them on an arc where inevitably, but heartbreakingly briefly they touch.With Some elements of magical realism,( the city models the loving father makes for his blind daughter) this book is written in clear and beautiful prose, that engages the reader from the beginning to the end. This is a must read.
I enjoyed this book very much.  It provided much food for thought and helped me look at World War II from several different aspects.  The author did a good job of character development and helping the readers get inside them.  Each part of the plot was so well connected at the end of the book.  The parts of the book involving was loss were not as emotional for me and the connections made at the end.
A beautifully written book that stirs heartfelt emotion for every character.  I would give it four and one half stars but could not figure out how.There were a few areas within the book that went on a bit too long so I could not give it five stars. A very sad part of history told through the minds and hearts of each character that makes you understand why people might have made the choices they did.
Set in WWII in Germany and France.  Has a slow, lyrical start... but if you stick with it the story becomes complex and suspenseful... the short chapters switch between characters and always leave you in suspense... gives a "real" view of both civilians and lower level soldiers life as war begins, during war, and how people coped afterward.  The story weaves connections between characters.
Delightful book, delicious reading about a serious topic.  Delicate protagonists in difficult situations cast adrift during a cruel war, yet retaining their humanity.  An anti all war saga.  Seeing the world through the eyes of a blind but very brilliant and brave young girl is insightful. If you like novels, a bit of mystery, twists of fate, and a beautiful language, I highly recommend this book.
one of the most well written novels I have read in years. the characters are exquisitely developed, the story at once topical and historic.  Doerr fills the pages with metaphor and substance - the only reason I shy away from 5 stars is that in the end he is a bit heavy handed in his message, leaving rather less to the imagination than a truly great work should do. still, this is a phenomenal work.
My wife, a voracious reader, finished the book an informed me that I should read All the Light.  What a great recommendation!  The plot is developed through two young people.  The way Doerr developed this plot is nothing short of amazing.  It is no surprise that he won a Pulitzer Prize.  Very well deserved.  It would make a marvelous movie but "Hollywood" would screw it up.  Keep up the good work!
This is a book about the trials and tribulations of two people, one a young German soldier and another a young French girl caught up in the conflict of WWII.  It is not so much about the actual war as it is about how these two react to the problems they face.  He becomes disenchanted with what Germany/Hitler is trying to do.  The writing is good, but I'm a little tired of WWII conflicts.<br/>Mike
I loved the story and it was a page-turner.  The two main characters were likeable and believable. A heart rendering story of war and a bit of magic thrown in to add intrigue.  I thought Doerr ran out of steam toward the end and the otherwise great story fell apart.  It was as if reality, the mundane, set in after the war and the extraordinary became very ordinary--not the ending I wanted to see..
Absolutely one of the best books I've read this year!
I highly recommend this book.  Some readers in our book group found it somewhat easier to read the paper edition of the book to refer back to prior chapters and to adjust to the author's technique in changing characters from chapter to chapter.  In any version, the writing transports the reader to and through the lives of the characters and clearly deserves the awards and accolades it has earned.
All The Light We Cannot See is a dark and heartrending story, yet also uplifting and incredibly beautiful - a perfectly crafted book. I began reading it as usual, eager to get to the heart of the story, but quickly slowed down, often reading a page several times before moving to the next one, so intense the story, so magnificent the telling of it. Anthony Doerr created a slice of WW2 masterpiece.
I'm a teenager and this book is one of the best I've read in a long time. It's masterfully written with beautiful characters. It's joyous and heartwarming, yet sad and heartbreaking at the same time. By the end of the book I was crying. This book shows the immense power of love and doing the right thing despite the consequences. Just beautiful. Thank you A. Doerr for writing such an amazing book.
An excellent story about WW2 history about which I was unaware (France: St. Malo bombings, Germany: school for smart teenage boys to become Nazi spies) and a tender story about vulnerability and family love.  The jumping back and forth with very short chapters was sometimes annoying, stopping good flow for the story.  But the descriptions were vivid and beautifully written.  Highly recommend.
I will never forget this book; it was one of the most touching, heartstring tugging books I've ever read.  I still want it to be a true story although I know it isnt!  It is an intimate look into events that take place during World War II that one doesn't usually hear about and certainly not events that would make front page news, but very, very human.  You won't be sorry you read this book!
I judge a book based on how much I miss the characters once I finish the book. I am a slow reader, but I slowed down toward the end in an effort to stay in the characters' lives. I think the author did a great job of painting a picture with words - perhaps because Marie-Laure is blind or perhaps because the author is so talented. A really interesting, poignant, heartbreaking book about WWII.
Brilliant book. One of the main characters is blind, and Doerrs writing from her point of view is incredible, things like the feel of the ground and the smells. Amazing book. Highly recommend you read it if you found the synopsis interesting at all.<br/><br/>I posted that there is some violence and some sexual content and while there is really only about one scene of each it is quite mild.
It stays with you, for weeks after reading.  It is, by far, one of the most engrossing, and well written books I've ever read. And I'm 80 !<br/>My desire (as some friends have attempted to do, while traveling abroad) is to go to St. Milo......don't know why....just to have been there.<br/>Book club group all give this book a thumbs up. Cannot describe "plot". Just history on wings.
This book is simply lyrical--and I realize that seems an odd way to describe a book about the Nazi occupation of France. It is so beautifully written that no other word seems to do it justice. The words are a feast, the plot keeps your interest, and there are no disappointments--when I feared the story could not get any better, it did. I have not enjoyed a book this much in a very long time.
Finding myself drawn to tales of the war, so very taken by the author's use of language to describe the indescribable, the perplexity of man, the very raw beauty in which we destroy ourselves and one another. And the hope and promise of redemption of some kind at every turn!  The book itself seems to reflect the endless layers and nuances of this experience of being. Thank you Anthony Doerr!
An outstanding novel that I didn't want to see end. Deep, well-developed characters in a setting that you could feel through every sense. Just one suggestion for readers: carefully note the dates that start some of the chapters as some of the story moves back and forth in time, with the War/1944 at the center. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves excellent writing on all levels.
I haven't been able to keep my attention on a novel for a very very long time.  With tv, netflix, and smartphones, my mind is all over the place.  This book pulled me back into reading.  I could not stop thinking about it.  My lunch breaks, before bedtime, after work, before work.... I love love love this book.  It is beautifully written- like poetry.  I highly recommend it!!!  Drink it in!
Complex and educational. Too challenging to read late at night, but with the alertness of a rested mind, it becomes a gem more meaningful and beautiful than the gem in the heart of this book. The two main characters will remain touching and admired friends reminding me of the best of human traits - courage and kindness - which outshine and outlast the darkest cruelties imposed on humankind.
Having visited San Malo, this was a very interesting read for me.  This book is written in a style that is difficult for me to follow with constant jumps in time frames interspersed with dreams and memories.  The subject matter is tough because it is story about the hardship of war as endured by the innocent population. Time frames and events in the story appear to be historically correct.
It was a little slow at first, but the character development made me want to continue to see how they would end up interacting. At times I was concerned that the horrors of the war would be overwhelming, but the author did not push that too far, and focused more on the characters survival. The detailed description of people and places made it easy to visualize. I would recommend this book.
Despite all the raves for this book, I was not in that camp. It started with a bang and dropped you with a thud. The last third was just a total letdown and the ending just left you dangling...so many questions unanswered. The premise was quite amazing, but it was as if the author couldn't figure out how to close, or perhaps just lost interest and went onto another more compelling project.
WOW...one of the best novels I have read in a long time...such a wide all encompassing story...it will break your heart...such an inventive story line and yet based in truth...how Mr Doerr even conceived this narrative and stitched it together into such an incredible tale is beyond me...( I say Mr Doerr as he has my utmost respect) ...lovers of Barbara Kingsolver will totally enjoy this !!
The ending may leave some readers feeling unsatisfied, but I enjoyed the manner in which it left you wondering about a host of unanswered questions. Although some aspects of the plot were almost predictable, the shifting rythym of the story, alternating between a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy whose paths you know are destined to cross, keeps this well-written story engaging.
I enjoyed this book so much!  From the beginning, one was ALWAYS wondering and projecting, "What will happen next?"  Marie-Laure has made her blindness not a handicap, while Werner has been blinded by Nazism.  Their separate journeys, finally meeting, and and the subsequent conclusion will have you crying.  This book, a Pulitzer winner, was well deserving of the award.  Five Stars!
If you enjoy a wordy, pretentious, and imprecise writing style, this book is for you.  The author's subject had much promise at the start, but he seems to lose himself over and over again in weaving the tale.  The result falls far short of quality work.  If the editor's goal was simply sales volume, the novel is a success.  This book desperately needs 100 pages removed and much tightening.
This was the best book I read this year.  I love historical fiction and All The Light We Cannot See filled every requirement for a great story.  I learned so much about how France was affected by WWII. This tale features two characters on opposite sides of the war; a young blinde French girl and an ingenious young orphan recruited to a Nazi soldier camp.  Fascinating story and a must read.
Easily the best book I have read in a long time. I cannot add much of value to the thorough review by Ryan Dejonghe. If you enjoy a simply well written novel that is refreshing and novel in its approach to the subject matter, has a wonderful use of a wide ranging vocabulary on virtually every page, has an articulate, intelligent and thoughtful style - then this would be a must read for you
Enjoyed the writing style.  Succinct chapters that allow for slow character development.  Draws you in and you want to keep reading.  World War II and the activities of the German people though is always difficult to read about especially as we now know of the atrocities.  This book provides a personal side of two individuals coming of age and their hopes and fears.  Enjoyed it very much.
This sounds tacky but I enjoyed the short chapters - most average three pages.  Narrative moved from one person/situation to another in almost every chapter but was very easy to follow.  I greatly appreciated how the various German characters experienced the war.  Pressed for time so look to others for a scholarly review.  This book deserves one.  Several friends have read and loved it.
Best book I've read in a very long time! Storyline of each person was intriguing and believable and expertly interwoven in surprising ways.  I cared about each of the well-developed characters.  Descriptions of places and events and thoughts took my breath away - absolutely beautifully written from start to finish.  My first experience reading Anthony Doerr but will be looking for more!
I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was very realistic, which in some ways is good and bad. There were elements that may not have been realistic, but that's true of any story. There are a lot of chapters, but they're very short and you find yourself sucked in for hours at a time. It read very well and very quickly, even if it wasn't necessarily a fast-paced story. Highly recommend.
Who would have thought to bring to light the struggles of a blind girl during the German occupation in France? There were times I held my breath as she faced the certain challenges of the times. The cruel training of a Hitler Youth and falling in love with his certain brilliance. Struggles of decency and courage. The past, present and future threaded together by the most delicate words.
This book, although highly recommended to me, just did not move me.  I could not get into the characters.  I could see, however, that Doerr does use extensively the research material he gathered during his year of study in Rome.  There almost seemed to be too much of his scientific findings in the book rather than character development.  I would recommend his book, Four Seasons in Rome.
Interesting and well written story of the impact of WWII on two young lives from two different perspectives and their fight for survival.  Found the ending on the sad side but , in reality , to have expected both to survive wouldn't have been realistic considering he, the young German soldier and she, the blind and resourseful French girl were on opposite sides of any hope for a future.
It was a wonderful story of a blind girl in France who had a marvelous Dad to help her overcome her lack of sight along with a uncle who is with her in the worst of times when Germany occupied France and a German orphan boy with wonderful technical skill that comes to the attention of the German High Command  and as he grows older is a soldier in occupied France where they finally meet.
This is a thoughtful story of how war affects each person no matter what side they are fighting for.  It will swept you away.<br/>I could not imagine what it must be like to be blind and to endure the horror and devastation that takes place in a country that is under attack.  Will we never learn that there are no winners.  I highly recommend this book, you won't be able to put it down.
The lives of two children,  each scarred by WWII in a different way, wind inevitably toward one another.  Their stories are heart-breaking but each character is drawn so sweetly, the reader cannot help but sympathize with both the blind French girl and the conscripted German boy filled with curiosity.  What brings them together -and tears them apart - is the cruelty of man and his war.
This is the backstory of WWII -- involving a young blind French girl raised by her father, uncle and his housekeeper and a young boy, very talented in radio, being trained by the German army. The haphazard nature of the destruction of war and the fleeting coincidences that can elate and bind as well as destroy are the story. The writing is descriptive, literate. I couldn't put it down.
I'll be honest with you.  I had read the rave reviews but still didn't want to read this book because I was put off by the idea of reading about a blind girl.  I was given the book as a birthday present, and am I glad!! This is one of the very best historical novels  I've ever read.  The prose is brilliant, the plot is clever and original, the characters are believable and sympathetic.
I absolutely loved this book.  It is beautifully written.  Set in WWII, I got a glimpse of how Germany was able to control her citizens. It followed a young blind girl in France and a young German boy who became a soldier before he was old enough because he knew so much about radios.  More would give this away.  I loved sitting by my fire and reading this book. I was sad for it to end.
Absolutely loved reading ....held my interest thru the entire book. The ending was perfect as was the content. Had to stay focused  and I found myself reading some chapters a second time but did not find that distracting...it simply heightened my curiosity.A different slant on the war and the greatest generation...here in the United States and Europe. What Marie endured was miraculous.
I am left upon the finishing of this book, awestruck.  All throughout I was lifted out of myself into a higher place, where language is nearly music.  The grim tale is totally refreshed by this style and the luminous tale of children in world war 2, circling the occupation of France.  Completed thought is not any longer possible as the story has occupied my heart and soul with snails.
I just adore this book. I was into it after the first few pages and didn't want to put it down. I kept trying to read slower so I could enjoy it more but alas, the end of the book came and I was sad. The book is beautifully written, the story is interesting and the characters are well developed, making me feel fully invested in how their stories ended up. I highly recommend this book!
There is one other book that comes to my mind that elicited as much intense care about the characters: "Lonesome Dove".  "All the Light We Cannot See" was heartbreaking, emotional and mesmerizing.  I experienced every smell, touch, fear and longing. I feel absolutely drained after finishing it and also empty because I will no longer share the intimate lives of the characters. Amazing.
Pretty good. I now understand the hype. Another WWII war story but it was nice to view it from a bit of the German/French sides. The little girl was charming. I can just picture her freckles and the way she moved up and down the streets and throughout the multi-level houses. I did have some problems with the choppy way the chapters intermingle and then line up. Very interesting story.
The writing is quite sensual....one can see, smell, feel through Mr Doerr's words.  One glides along the story, as though following a ribbon, looping forwards and backwards through time, through emotions, through history, through hopes, desires, fears, horrors, memories.  It is a story of war but more so of the persistence of the beauty, complexity, sheer wonder of our physical world.
I loved this novel which is  filled with descriptive writing and literary allusions. The story itself is full of surprises and twists and the characters are well developed.  What captured me the most was the beautiful, and at times lyrical writing.  I belong to two book clubs and will recommend the book even though it is long by our book club standards. There is so much to talk about.
Exceptionally well-written with original and interesting characters.  The backdrop of WWII and the fate of St. Malo during the war adds texture and meaning to everything.<br/>I don't much enjoy books that do not have three dimensional, realistic characters.  This book, happily, never let me down, even with the most minor of characters.<br/>Read.  Enjoy the pleasure of great writing.
This really is a beautiful book.  A small gem not entirely unlike the diamond whose existence lies at the center of the narrative: something rare and exceptionally valuable, but also prone to inspire heartache.  The book is a generally gentle, sometimes jarring, and always rich depiction of the events leading to the coincidental intersection of two young lives in World War II France.  Well worth the read.
Seeing the war through the eyes of those who were there is always amazing to me.  This book makes you believe these people really did exist.  I find it a little hard to believe a blind person could have lived in any German held area but perhaps some disabled people made it.  People can and do survive many bad events, then somehow move on and find new things tin which to find pleasure
As a fourteen year old my father was in the army and stationed in Germany. My first serious love was a sixteen year old German boy.  I have often wondered if things had been different how my life would have changed. My heart kept thinking the same for them  l wanted them to find each other  even in the end. What happened to the Jewell? I put myself into the book. So enjoyed it. Linda
If you are a student of history, I highly recommend this novel.  I was a very young child during WWII, but I remember the blackouts, the ration books and all the men wearing uniforms.  I also distinctly remember the day it ended and the crazy celebrations.  These memories are perhaps the reason I felt such a connection with the young characters in this compelling drama.  A must read.
This WWII novel read like a fairy tale, in a way. It was fascinating and enjoyable. Story of a blind little girl in France and a German little boy who loved electronics and tinkering and whose dream was to join the Hitler Youth. His adventures and her adventures were told alternately and breathtakingly and of course eventually they meet. It really was an intricately fascinating book.
One of my favorite books ever. Beautifully written.
I know this won awards a few years ago.  While I thought it was interesting, I found it ponderous at times.  I finished it because I thought I should, not because it held me.  Some of the characters were well-developed others were left hanging.  A great writer once said, "If you bring a gun to a party, you'd better fire it."  The author kept a few unfired bullets in the gun.
quite the adventure. Bear with the initial story line of two people (a little girl from France and a smart teenager from Germany) whose lives eventually meet against the backdrop of World War Two in a town in France shortly after D-Day. Once I got to this point (about 3/4 of the way through), I could not put this book down. The ending was a complete surprise and well worth the wait.
I was skeptical about reading another book that takes place during the Second World War, as there are so many. But I am glad I did. I am amazed that the horrors of the war for all its characters could be told in a sad poetic way. While not exactly the ending I envisioned; I recognized it was the most truthful ending for all its characters. Beautiful read for me. I recommend it well.
What an eye-opener this is about the German Army's treatment not only of the French but also the cruelties perpetrated against their own youth. Wonderful characterization helps readers "see" the cast of characters and understand the difficulties facing a blind person every day. Short but complete chapters incorporate so much action but let one know all the details concisely.
I loved this book until the last page....at the time I didn't realize it was the last page I thought it was just the end of a chapter but no...the book just stopped....<br/>I really enjoyed the entire book, I didn't want to stop reading it when it was time to go to work or sleep.  It really is a great book, just wish the ending would have been a little different, it left me hanging
I loved this book for a multitude of reasons.  The storyline and stories within the story are fantastic.  I literally could not put the book down.  I found it very interesting to see a different perspective on WWII as seen from the eyes of youth, a blind Paris girl and a German young man.  I thought the writing style was fantastic, with short concise chapters and vivid descriptions.
Beautiful, lyrical prose with short chapters so that you can rest your eyes and soak in the writing. Such sweet relationships between father/daughter and brother/sister.  Amazing detail on what iblindness "feels" like and how courageous the blind protagonist is.  The author paints a historical picture of time and place for us all to see and feel many years and miles removed.
"All the Light We Cannot See" is a terrific novel that encompassed a great deal of research by Anthony Doerr, and I recommend it highly.  It is a compelling read regarding Europe during WW II, and offers a new, effective writing style that switches back and forth in time using short glimpses of the dominant characters through really short chapters mostly two-four pages long.
I love the authors ability to evoke the sensations of being there!  I felt as though I was living the events right along with Werner and Marie-Laure. The descriptive details were exquisite.  My only dissatisfaction is a personal preference of chronology, I simply would have preferred a more sequential rendering. I really enjoyed the book and would highly recommend to all my friends.
What an incredible book!  The characters are real and personal, as is the greater understanding of WWII that this book describes.  I was struck by how personal this book is, how beautifully it describes the lives of the characters and how powerful and powerless they became in this war.  Although sad and painful, the well written novel is worth the emotions it provokes in the reader.
I've read many WWII novels but this one is by far the best I've come across.  The writing is simply beautiful and the way that Doerr interweaves the various characters is simply amazing.  This novel is inspirational in that no matter your circumstances you can always rise above, even if it is only how you perceive the world.  A must read for anyone who seeks a memorable experience.
Beautifully written. Riveting. Well drawn characters. Lovely details.<br/><br/>I loved the short chapters. It made it so easy--necessary?--to read one more, and then just one more, and then yet another chapter.<br/><br/>It helped me understand how a sensitive and bright young German boy could be attracted to the Third Reich's army.<br/><br/>Marie Laure is a memorable heroine.
Doerr created a set of characters that you really, really wanted to root for. I loved the way it moved forward and backward in time--kept everything moving and the story fresh. I loved that while it was about WWII, it told stories from different angles than the ones I've heard before. Overall it was a lovely, at times heartbreaking, but incredibly hopeful story. I loved reading it.
What a fabulous story. I so enjoyed his earlier book 4 seasons in Rome.<br/>Now, I am a total Anthony Doerr devotee.<br/>I feel those characters in my soul. And, I miss them since I finished the book.<br/>We plan to visit St. Malo this fall, mainly because I feel I know it after reading this book.<br/>He is a master writer and story maker.<br/>Please enjoy it as much as I did.
This was a story of events that happened during the War.  It was very suspenseful and intriguing. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next. It told the story of what a couple of French and a couple of German people went through during the war.  It makes you realize how terrible it was for people living through it and that we are so lucky to be living in a peaceful time.
This is an incredible book that does a great deal of good to bring humanity to people living in one of the least humane periods of human existence.  It will also make you wonder how many geniuses were not realized due to the circumstances of poverty and war. Doerr is an amazing writer who develops a palpable sense of tension throughout the story and creates characters with depth.
The story jumps back and forth in various times during World War II, making it difficult to follow and requiring frequent references to the table of contents.  As in life, many of the significant events are not highlighted at the time, rather their significance only is known later. It is a good read (but not a fun one) and clearly establishes the sense of loss caused by the War,
I was disappointed.  After all the rave reviews I expected a story about a blind girl in France and a young man in Germany.  Instead, it seemed to be more about the struggles during World War Two and it took a long time for the two to meet.  It was clever, but I had no trouble putting the book down when it was time to sleep.  Sorry.  Maybe that's just me.  Doer is a good writer.
Its an amazing work---what more can one say about this novel?  I have rarely enjoyed a book more than this.  It hardly seemed like a work of fiction, more like a narrative of real events.  And the characters?  So well defined that you actually believe they are real people with all their fears, faults and hopes.  A book like this is why I read novels...period...its a work of art.
Lovely descriptive writing, great characterization, and though I usually prefer a straight narrative time line, this novel moves easily and poignantly through several years prior to and during World War II.  It depicts several specific European settings very well. It is a mystery, a horrors-of-war story, a story of friendships.  The epilogue chapters seem honest and bittersweet.
Reading others very positive reviews is what prompted me to order this book for my Kindle. It has been a long chore for me to get through it. The book starts out interesting but the story fizzles somewhere towards the middle then you're reading just to read not because you are enjoying it or are interested.
It was a hard read because it changed venue so often.  Once I got on to how the author wrote I was on track.  I felt I should read it since it was on the best seller list.  Libraries have waiting lists for this book.  It takes place in France during World War ll.  I often felt anxious for the characters.  There was terrible destruction, death, bravery and courage.  A good read.
World War II remains a compelling period of time.  This story is unique as it is told by sympathetic French and German characters.  The reader gets a better sense of the conflict faced by both sides. War is brutal and there are some very uncomfortable passages but it wouldn't have been honest without them.<br/>I found it hard to put down and intend to read more by this author.
For me, the best stories are the ones where the characters take on a life of their own in my mind.  If I wonder what happened to them after the books ends or I am sad at their passing or I wish they had made different choices it means the writer has succeeded in bringing them alive. This book does that and more. This is a beautiful and sad and happy story.  Well worth the read.
It's hard to think of a novel about WWII being sensitive but this book touches your soul. The depiction of humanness is breathtaking. Hardship and resiliency are laid bare. However, the horror, insanity, and discipline of  the Nazi regime is still hard to fathom. Cannot help thinking hard on the ultimate  alliance with the Soviets and the continued suffering  of the innocent.
How one goes about writing a review to justify just how good this story is, or just how well it is written alludes me. In my view Anthony Doerr can  describe moments so precisely that you don't simply picture or imagine the situation, you exist in the situation, blind like the young girl one moment, and then an integral component of the Nazi force in the next. Read this book.
You will not only enjoy this book, but you will feel that your time has been well spent. This is deservedly a popular novel, but it is by no means a genre piece. There is eloquence; there is depth, and there are characters that will win your heart . This is literature in the best sense of the word. Accessible without being pandering. Sophisticated without being condescending.
briefly, i and my book club were disappointed by this book that seemed to promise so much but never delivered...especially weak at the end...we did like some of the characters very much, like werner and frederick...also good representations of what living life could be like during war time and also the brutality of war and its effects on people as well as other living things.
Fine storey about the "light" (wisdom, intelligence) that may be hidden from us or, because it does not benefit our cause, we choose to ignore. Beautifully and creatively written. A blind girl "sees" more than her sighted friends and a sighted boy chooses to "see" using invisible radio waves. Do we choose to see or look away from the atrocities of war.
I loved this book. It deserves to be on the best books of the year list. The lives of these two main characters draws you in.  What they did and how they lived was remarkable, and sad at the same time. The end wasn't what I hoped for but was well told.  Would strongly recommend this, and I will read it again.  Beautifully written  Would give it more than five stars if I could
Read this book.  Doerr takes us by the hand and gently leads us through some very difficult events.  The short chapters, changing viewpoints and times, keep things moving forward.  Wrapped inside the war story, and the personal story, are tales of suspense and wonder.  I was entranced throughout, and although I wanted to know how it all ended, I also wanted the book to go on.
This is a book you want to read slowly, to make it last as long as possible, for the imaginary of the language, the delicate details. And yet you have to hurry, to learn what happens next, want to skip pages for things too terrible to take in. I finished the book reluctantly but I will have to return to it, to savor the language and get the details I missed. An awesome book.
This is a great book that makes me want to read everything else the author has written.  I read it because it was a selection for our community book club.  The reaction of everyone was great.  In fact, this is the first book in nearly  three years where no one rated it at less than a 9!<br/><br/>If you only read one novel this year -- this is the book that you should read!
Terrific historical fiction that helps you understand some of the challenges and attitudes of French and German individuals during WWII.  I particularly enjoyed reading the perspective of a young German man who "bought into" the propaganda. It was also enlightening to read about the strength of the French who resisted the German occupation, sometimes in comical ways.
If you liked " The Book Thief" you will really love this book. It is also set during WW 2 and weaves a fantastic story of 2 young children and how they are affected, through no fault or design of their own, by that terrible conflict. Just amazing, engrossing, thrilling and, ultimately a rich experience. What great imagination and writing at it's best can do for one's soul.
I was somewhat disappointed after all of the glowing reviews. I probably would have been more positive if I didn't have such high expectations.  I felt some of the details concerning blind people weren't true to life (I was an aid at a school for the blind for several years and went through a training program.  I also found the author's descriptive powers somewhat limited.
When we think about war, we usually think about the fighting, the diplomacy, the military action.  This story is about the people who lived through it and how they lived through it.  It is so beautifully written that it sometimes east to forget the horrible existence of the civilians of, in this case, WWII.  This is one of the stories I will remember for a long, long time.
So artfully written, Anthony seemed to give me an emotional connection to his characters. He writes with great imagery, I felt like I was right there with Marie-Laure and Werner as they go through their struggles. Not to give away the conclusion but it left me in tears for how it all turned out, it also left me with a wonderful optimism about how our cosmic universe works.
I along w/ my book group loved reading this.  Every chapter is a gem of a short story.  A friend who lives out of town read it w/ her book group and commented that while everyone enjoyed the book, those that listened to it on audio seemed to like it even more.  I would favor reading hard copy b/c each word is so appropriate; sometimes there's a poetic rhythm to the prose.
This book indeed kept me captivated as the revenges<br/> of war were told through two heroic main characters.  I, however, found the sequence of this story difficult to understand and follow.  The victories were not enough for the losses experienced by the main characters.  War is sad and this book with so many captivating chapters emphasized the horrors of broken lives.
I really enjoyed this book for several reasons. The first is that history fascinates me and I love to learn about these very important events that shaped and affected lives of so many. The second no is that this book did such a good job illustrating what it might have felt like to be a German in World War II. It's a perspective that isn't usually written about. Well done!
This book was chosen by our book club as the monthly selection.  For the most part, I loved this book. I thought it was beautifully written. I did find one had to pay attention as the author flipped back and forth with his dates.  The ending was a wee bit sad. For us romantics, we wanted a different outcome but also realize that there were many sad stories during the war.
I just finished this book.  The writing style is amazing.  The story even more amazing.  Hitler had so many victims and so many were his fellow countrymen.  I can't imagine what it must be like to be swept up in such carnage, to have all your choices taken from you.  Granted, there were many Germans who bought into what Hitler was selling, but there were many who did not.
A well-constructed novel with very likeable characters.  I was sorry to see the denouement as the weakest point.  Too many loose ends were tied up in a somewhat artificial manner.  But, overall, the author did a wonderful job with the characters, and the descriptions of Brittany, rural France and the devastation of war.  Weaving in the Jules Verne story was a great touch.
This book is bit more difficult to read in that it flashes forward and backward but once I got used to  the method  of story telling I was able to follow its progress.  A wonderful story discribing the intricacies of war.  Each side making a case for their side.  Ach side trying to survive.  The struggle between good and evil .  One would hope good triumphs. Marilyn Kelly
Really riveting book. Couldn't put it down. Very different style, might take some getting into. Provided real insight into the suffering of Germans and French at the hand of the Nazis.  And how the Nazi regime brainwashed its youth into serving for the glory of the Fatherland. Reveals the humanity in us all. Also, how a blind person perceives the world. Very descriptive.
This is a beautifully written book of strength, hope and love in the midst of incredible war and conflict.  If that seems impossible to reconcile, it is just the first of so many layers of opposites, coincidences, and destiny.  I will re-read this book in times of despair and realize, again, the subtle gifts of life and love which are ever present, if not always visible.
A mind boggling read through the lives and minds intricately meshed between and within worlds. Would read again and again, fascinating and one of the best ever written about the war.<br/><br/>Made me reflect on humankind's mistakes and repent for my own sins, for we do not know when the next world war would be coming, and it would be too late by then to save ourselves.
The reader connects with the main character immediately.  She is a young blind girl who only has her hard working and devoted father to care for her. One becomes her ally as she is pushed and tugged through the perils of WWII in pre-occupied and occupied France.  I didn't give it five stars because I thought the ending was somewhat weak.  Even so, it's a worthwhile read.
An interesting take on life during WWII  The book follows the life of a french blind girl and a highly intelligent German orphan.  The novel investigates peer pressure, control of the media, inner resourcefulness, and the general environment that led to many actions that we ould not expect from individuals in current times.  A thoughtful that maintains the reads interest
Doerr's outstanding writing made the switching of characters and time after each short chapter easy for the reader to follow.  Doer made Werner seem like a friend not an enemy. He was able to take minor characters and give them a significant role in the resistance effort. He was able to give the reader great insight into the French struggles during the German occupation.
This is a wonderful book!  It's easy to see why it won the Pulitzer Prize.  It is beautifully written and an amazing portrayal of the myriad ways humans show up in the world.  Makes one think at the same time one is being bathed in the beauty of the author's style of writing.  I rarely buy books anymore as I am in a simplifying stage of my life but I had to own this one.
I wish I had more time in the day to just sit and read this book.  This is one of the best reads I have experienced in a very long time!  This is one of those books that when you do have to put down grudgingly due to having to take care of everyday needs, your mind is on the book/story and not on the task at hand.  I will be contemplating this story for a very long time.
An elegant and intriguing book.  All the book reviews were justified in their praise.  I can't say anything they did not say except that I took my time with it and laid it down so I did not gobble it all up at once.  I have a tendency to do that with a great book.  Kindle books help with that.  You can lay it out of sight.  If I see the hard cover it will call to me...RZ
A captivating book....not surprising that it has been voted one of the best of 2014.  If you love historical fiction, this page turner set during the D-Day invasion is a must read.  I especially liked that the author took the characters up to the present.  A heart felt story about how war destroys all who are touched by it...even or perhaps especially, the survivors....
I loved this book.  It offers an insightful look at the ravages of war on both sides.  Rather than the customary look at Germans and Jews, this follows the lives of a young German boy and blind French girl, I was drawn into the story immediately, and by the end, I felt I had seen war from the perspective of ordinary citizens. not good versus evil. I highly recommend it.
Beautifully written story of the connection between a blind French girl and a young German boy. The intelligence and curiosity of both youth bring them together during the German occupation of France. Doerr's style of slowly bringing the characters together creates anticipation and tension that compels you to keep reading. Great historical detail and character building.
An engaging read.  The characters are well drawn, and we grow to care about them.  The chapters alternate primarily between the two main characters, which keeps the story interesting and speeds the reading.  We want to find out what's going on with the other character.  I found it thoroughly enjoyable and felt it enhanced my understanding of life in Europe during WWII.
I enjoyed this novel with its teenager's  take on the horror of WWII. A different and refreshing approach to an old subject.The ending was the one disappointment. Until the end, the story was told in a close and personal point of view. At the end the author distanced us from the character by  going into an omniscient and 'reporting' mode just when things were critical.
The story is gripping, and shows WW II from the perspective of two children powerless to affect their immediate worlds, much less the bigger world that encompasses them. When I got to the 70% point (reading in my Kindle), I knew I had to put it down until I could finish the end in one sitting. I loved the book so much I immediately downloaded another one by the author.
Insight was gained about the plight of the French during the Nazi occupation of France during WW11. The perilous activities of the French resistance and the horrors of war were enumerated in a haunting way. At the same time the brutal methods endured by the Hitler youth were also noted in agonizing details. The book was a page turner. It was hard for me to put it down.
This book was recommended to me by my sister-in-law.  Written circa WWII both pre, during and post, Mr. Doerr does an incredible job of blending History with what happened behind the headlines.  The book shows how a German boy, an unwitting pawn of the Third Reich, begins to see the horror unfolding and his attempts to at least "do no harm".  Very well written.
Embarrassed to give only 2 stars to a book that just won the Pulitzer award. This was not a page turner for me  until the very end--I wanted the book to end. Although author wrote beautiful descriptions of the places--I felt like I was there -- and the same for the events that were happening--I could hear and feel the Bombs dropping. I did not feel the same  way about the characters.
This author is one of the most lyrical writers I have ever read.  The story and characters are brought to life and hold you in their grasp to the end.  The story takes place in WW2 but is a different viewpoint--through the lives of children caught in its drams but far from willing to give up whatever power they still possess.  This book is a treasure to read and share.
A very compassionate book about WWII based in Paris and then on to the coast of France.  This is a complicated story that covers both sides of this horrible war with sensitivity.  It describes the life of the little people who were caught up in this disaster and how they coped.  I really liked the story and thought it was a unique way to tell the story of this tragedy.
Mr. Doerr takes the reader on a journey between characters and time, with exacting description and historical events. One feels the plight of the gentle, blind girl who is loved by those around her. Her strength and character ring true. And the young German boy, so bright and enamored of all things mechanical, who must learn who and what he is in the time of the Nazis.
WOW!  When I heard about this book I expected some sort of 'happily ever after' sort of ending.  Instead, the author wove a story that was every bit as real and impactful as life itself.  As someone interested in WWII history, I was also impressed with the research the author did to make the story true to the times.  All the Light We Cannot See will be a book I reread!
One of the best books I ever read.  Very special.
Historical fiction, well written emotional story.
Beautifully written, incredible story. Must read.
Well written but the complex plot has some holes.
Brilliant, haunting, moving, beautifully written.
Great to read before or after a trip to Normandy.
Maybe I didn't fully grasp the concept behind this book, but personally I didn't find it interesting. I could tell that there was a lot of thought put into it, and I appreciated some parts of the story, but it was either boring or very sad, not many things were happening at all. Maybe that was the point. I just don't understand the hype this book got, just my opinion.
The story held me spellbound.  But the end bothered me a lot.  Of course it was beautiful in many ways:  poetic, gathering up the threads which the title image had spun throughout the story. Elegant. Spiritual. Compassionate.  And yet... I want the end of a book to develop out of the plot, to resolve the plot.  Focusing on the image instead felt to me like a cop-out.
WWII brought to reality through the eyes and minds of two young people, a French girl and a young boy trained in one of Hitler's Youth  Camps.  Beautiful writing, vivid characters, intriguing plot.  This story brings to life the destructive effect of Nazism on German Youth (males) and the profound sense of loss among the French brought about by the German occupation.
Very good reading.  The author writes well.  The book has tiny chapters (1-2 pages for some) which gives the reader good stopping places and makes the book easy to pick up and read at odd moments.  It jumps around in terms of time and characters.  I usually don't care for this structure in a book, but it works ok and the reader is able to mentally assemble the story.
I can  add only a little to the many eloquently written reviews of this book. It is a magical, tragic, hopeful telling of stories of people caught in the most extreme situations and against all odds emerging triumphant,even in death. I can't recall a recent novel that touched me as much. Do yourself a favor and at least sample it. You will be hooked in the best way possible.
a very interesting book. It has two parallel lives being described at the same. They do not know each other. But eventually they meet and the remainder of the book is about the repercussions of that meeting.  There is also a stone (jewel) involved in the story, But I couldn't figure out what happened to it. The author writes any very short chapters. It is a big book.
The book is very well written, the characters are engaging and likable.  However, the story is very long and slow paced.  Sometimes I wasn't sure where the author was leading me to with story, so the reader has to sort of take a leap of faith and keep reading.  At the end, I'm not sure how I really feel about the whole experience, and that sort of sums it up for me.
I liked the history of WWII in France and Germany.  The build up to the War and how it affected two young people.  The aftermath of the War and rebuilding not only their lives, but recovering from the destruction and loss of loved ones. It is a good read. I could not put it down. Very descriptive of what it must have been like to live through that period in history.
Read this book for my bookclub and was so glad that I did.  I enjoyed the book and looked forward to it each time I came back to it.  A little tricky with the change in the time lines.  I did take some notes along the way.  But, I was anxious to see how it would all end.  Well done.  First time for me with this author and I would certainly read another of his books.
I loved the characters who were very well drawn, totally believable.  All the details fascinated  me. It was a bit distracting to have the switch of time frames. Liked the short chapters, and switch of characters. We were kept on the edge of our seats. Still have unanswered questions, as I  think was planned. Beautiful writing. Eager for more of Mr. Doeer's writing.
Oh my gosh, I enjoyed reading the first 7/8 of the book very much. Lyrical passages, interesting characters and places particularly on the French side of the equation . I am shocked by the last part of the book because I do not have any idea what it means, where it goes and how completely unsatisfying it is . So sad . I was expecting it to be a good book to the end.
This is a brilliantly written and researched work of historical fiction. The author's craft in connecting individual storylines is powerful. The quest for power and the consequences of the actions of world leaders are best understood when viewed from the perspectives of individuals. The character development and historical context are complex and thought-provoking.
Breathtaking story. I also recommend listening to this via Audible.com. The narrator hits it out of the park; he brings the story to life so that the characters are not just in your head, they're in your room, or your car, or standing next to you in the kitchen as you sip Chardonnay doing dishes with earplugs in while your kids watch super lame cartoons. Thumbs up.
Without a doubt this book is one of the best I've read.  Such a gentle account of two extraordinary people trapped by the events that were precipitated by Adolph Hitler's ambitions.  As their worlds fall apart, each of the two protagonists responds with strength, grace, and ingenuity. They live alongside Scout and her brother from To Kill a Mockingbird in my heart.
I will say that I put down the book in the first 30 pages as I thought it was trending as more of a non fiction read about WWII battles, but picked it up again and could not have been more wrong!  It was a great read, the characters developed well and was interesting how author weaved the different characters paths together.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
stunning depth and development of characters you fall in love with -  world war two novel following the lives of two children -  one French the other german - a novel which has such depth you cannot but help but feel what it means to be truly human in caring  about the suffering of others in  Paris, in Saint Malo and i.n Berlin.  And what it delivers as well, hope.
I gave this 5 stars because that's as high as the scale goes. This book touched my soul as few others have. As I reflect back on the journey I've just shared with the characters I can hardly stand to realize that our journey is now over.  Brilliantly written... you will fall in love with Werner, Jutta and Marie-Laure... and have your heart broken at the same time.
This book is interesting, but it is too wordy.  I got tired of the metaphors.  The characters  are interesting.  I was pulled into the story and wanted to see how their lives end.  However, I felt like it was needlessly gruesome.  There were many brutal descriptions of was time atrocities and brutalities of world was II.  I found myself depressed after reading it.
I enjoyed the book very much.  Hard to put down.  I enjoyed the way Doerr traveled back and forth throughout each character's life explaining why and how they got to where they were in the story.  Well written.  I appreciated the way he developed each character and the ending brought it all to a conclusion for each character.  The picture of history was well done.
This is one of the best written books I've ever read. It reads like poetry --just about every sentence is a gem. Love his straightforward style which conjures up vivid images. Even tho this is fiction every single detail about the era has been meticulously researched. Beside all this, it's an intriguing plot. It's one of those books you can read and reread.
A very nice story that intertwines two star crossed people with the horrors of World War 11.  A blind girl and a young german boy show the conflicts and horror of war.  Also intertwined is a story of greed that comes apart.  There were parts that needed more explanatioin, but the writing was quite lyrical, and there were moments of grave tension. I would recomend.
Just a wonderful book to read.  I got drawn in to the story and couldn't put it down.  A very personal way to live through those years of German occupation of France during WWII. You will see both sides of the war and the effect it had on the people.  I highly recommend the Sidekick which will reveal lots of hidden meanings and explains why the story draws you in.
I finished the book a week ago and my head is still swimming with the imagery and characters. I had to study a map of the french coast line to understand the geography and now long to visit Saint Malo someday. A beautiful tender story with a riveting ending that kept me reading late into the night. This book would be excellent for high school/ young adult readers.
I wasn't immediately into the book - the choppy chapters and flashbacks were distracting and difficult to find a cadence to get into, but gradually I became captivated by this well told story. The details are amazing, and what lies in the characters hearts during wartime was surprising to me - sometimes in a soft way and sometimes in a shocking, disappointing way.
This was such a wonderfully well-written and heart-achingly beautiful story. The characters are deep and complex and the tension of their parallel stories is maintained masterfully throughout. The author's deft handling of viewpoints from either side of the war is unexpected and uniquely done. I didn't ever want it to end and felt emotionally drained when it did.
Unique look at WWII from both sides of the war  giving much insight as to how some of the German soldiers were recruited and trained.  There are two separate ongoing stories between one of the soldiers and a blind French girl and both of their sacrifices and experiences during this horrific time and how their lives intersect in an ironic way.  Ending is stunning.
Breathtaking novel. The research Doerr put into this is amazing, the story line is compelling and the characters are unique, plausible and I felt knew them personally early on. This is a "can't put down" novel with incredible historical and scientific depth. Who would want to read this? Anyone in interested in a good story, WWII, survival, and a little mythology.
Wish I could say that "i loved it", but the short alternating time/space chapters made for slow going. Wonderful supporting characters. And for someone who has perhaps even less connection to WWII than I (born in 46, but w. parents who were more directly affected) he did a fine job of portraying the chaos and devastation of that short but horrific period.
This book was a well-written story with beautiful symbolism and eloquent metaphors throughout.  It describes the insidious way in which Hitler brainwashed the youth into his service, having them do things that they otherwise wouldn't even consider.  I was relieved to have the major characters be, somewhat, redeemed at the end.  Thanks for the great read Mr Doerr!
I have just finished reading so I now plan to do a personal review of the characters and of the actual assault Germany made upon France.  Most of all, just to hold the characters Marie-laure, Etienne, Werner, Voldheimer, Madame Manec in my memory and think of them, they became so real and I cared for them.  Amazing writing and historical presentation of that era.
Not sure why I liked it, but the book was extremely well written and a compelling read. I guess stories about human triumph among the backdrop of war particilarly when the main characters are children or teenagers  makes you feel good. Although neither the subjetc matter nor the title would indicate it I found it to be suspenseful and had trouble putting it down.
Beautifully written in a concise yet visually rich style, the story was a great deal more than a another WWII saga. At its very strong heart, is a simple, human story, building with depth of character(s) and suspense to a very satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>Crosses genres - would recommend to nearly everyone, with the exception of disneyesque romance readers.
A beautiful book which pulled me in and kept me.
Incredibly moving. Reading the book changes you.
One of the most well written books I have read!!
Possibly the most beautiful book I've ever read.
I'm only 1/3 of the way through this book, but I am transfixed.  Mister Doerr's words are making me feel what it must have been like to be young and uncertain in 1939 France and Germany.  There are heartbeats in this book and I can feel them.  No wonder he won the Pulitzer for this book.  Thank you, Mr. Doerr, for such a vibrant story and your incredible prose.
Each character us alive and sharing , leaving you with the sense you were there traveling in time with each one.  i would have<br/>Loved being friends with Marie-Laure and Werner especially.  They helped me See and see again much of what we close our eyes and hearts<br/>To.  Anthony Doer is a very talented story teller.  I am anxious to read more of his work.
Marvelous book!  Intriguing story line alternating between several characters.  I said there was no violence but this is a book about experiencing WWII so take that into consideration when picking an audience to share this with.  However, the growth of the personalities of the two main characters from youth to young adulthood is thought provoking and sensitive.
I was entranced by this book - truly.  The prose is so beautiful and poetic it left me breathless at times.  It is written with luxurious simplicity.  While the plot is sparse in this modern literary world of action and thrillers, the understated poetic writing takes the reader away to sights and sounds, images and sensations like nothing else I have ever read.
This book is incredible. It's beautifully written, intelligent, thought provoking and insightful. I have recommended it to several people, and all have loved it. It's a long book, but it moves quickly, and you'll want to keep reading to find out what happens to the characters, and the key items from the plot. If you're on the fence, BUY IT! You won't regret it!
suspenseful<br/>well-developed characters caught in war-time 40's in Germany and occupied France<br/>interesting plots include:<br/>story-lines concerning acquisitions by the nazis of precious artifacts<br/>a legendary stone thought to possess powers over whomever carries it.<br/>a disturbing look at the lives of young boys being prepared by depraved officers to fight for the fuhrer<br/>a young blind girl-raised by her loving father who is imprisoned in a work camp after they escape from Paris<br/>resistance efforts by frightened elderly citizens of an ancient sea-side village out-side of Paris
Unique book!  Quite unlike anything I'd read before, with highly descriptive language creating a visual impression from the point of view of a blind girl.  One immediately empathizes with her and the other characters, all of whom become caught up in the flow of WWII history.  Raises questions about how life unfolds and our choices or lack thereof along the way.
Excellently written story.  I found reading parts of it heartbreaking because of the viciousness of war. It was an interesting outlook of what the characters went through, it was very touching, and everyone I know who read it both enjoyed reading it and were  impressed with the quality of the writing style and the flow of the story.  It is a book worth reading.
This wasn't your typical WWII novel.  It was told from the perspective of a young blind french girl and a similar aged orphan german boy, both incredibly sensitive and intelligent.  The story was moving and about the things that break us and the things that heal us.  Beautifully written, I stayed up till 1am reading the last part because I couldn't put it down.
Excellent book.  Intelligently written yet easy to read.  It recognizes the various perspectives from individuals going through very difficult times. I hesitated to read this thinking, " another book about the war," but I heard rave reviews from others.  The book focuses more in individuals and circumstances than on the war.  It was well worth the read.
I really enjoyed this book. I am not a big reader of history books and war novels, but this was such an amazing read. You really get an amazing sense of many of the characters. Just a lot of jumping around in terms of dates and character vantage points, it read so well. I did want a more satisfying end, but it was appropriate, and I highly recommend this book.
The characters are so rich and memorable. If this is not a screenplay how, it's only a matter of time until the movie hits the big screen. I really enjoyed the 3 minute chapters which made for easy reading, but I wanted to savor every chapter and read as slowly as possible.  It was so easy to visualize every character and scene. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
It was an interesting concept and the characters were well developed and rather compelling.  But there was too much of the same things-  the boy learning electronics; the girl learning the village.  It was lyrically written - very beautiful.  But often rather obtuse.  One wasn't quite sure what has happened. The last  third of the book became more interesting.
This book was a joy to read.  Very suspenseful.  The author's prose is delightful.  His scientific explanations are right on, e.g. radios and mollusks.  One really becomes involved with the characters, hoping for a successful denouement.  I liked the short chapters, and the going back and forth in time; before and during the war.  Best book I've read all year.
Having read several books about World War II lately, I looked forward to reading this book.  I found it stirred several emotions as I read….. from sympathy, to horror, to a sense of sadness and loss.  I thoroughly enjoyed it as I read, but one does not feel particularly happy as the circumstances are sometimes difficult to imagine and a tragic part of history.
Lyrical writing, beautiful use of the language. Character development, more so with Marie Laure's family than with some of the other individuals. An excellent story line. I see that some reviewers have been disappointed that the ending did not befit a "love story." I'm perplexed as to why anyone would look upon this as a love story. It is a life story.
This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.  The author has woven the lives of two brilliant young people, one a blind girl who lives in a village in France and the other a young German orphan boy who is a genius in radio transmissions.  Their lives connect in such a way  that I was moved to tears at the conclusion of this amazing book.
An exceptional book, one of the best I've read, and refreshingly different from other WWII novels.  Storyline and character development combine to create a intriguing plot with almost poetic details.  Beautifully crafted sentences caused me to read slowly and savor each word.  I have recommended this book with high praise and have given it as gifts to friends.
This is a beautifully written book about two young people who lived in Germany & France before & during World War II.  Although it was in many ways a heartbreaking story, it was also refreshing to read about the real lives of people in Europe in those days without focusing on the "camps".  And the ending brought the entire story together so skillfully!
doesn't anyone think this book was too long?  The writing is fabulous - descriptive and poetic, charming characters, great back drop.  BUT...where was the editor?  After the first half of the book it became a bit of an endurance test to finish it.  Doerr seemed more interested in showing the reader how well he writes, rather than putting pace on the narrative.
I loved this book although I found the repeated descriptions of the underwater world rather tedious.  However the characters were well drawn and believable and I was totally absorbed in their lives.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a well written novel with interesting  facts about the situation in France and Germany from 1933 / 1945.
If you choose to see the beauty beneath the painful lives of Werner and Marie Laure, you will consider this book a page turner. If you only see their pain and struggle, this might not be a book for you. Werner trapped in a duty that seems inescapable, yet he can still feel beautiful emotions. Marie Laure feels everything she touches and enjoys to the maximum.
Beautifully written, evocative and touching. The focus on the sweetness in the midst of such atrocities, and interwoven threads of childhood, friendship, intellectual yearning and hope, elevated this novel from the confines of expected WWII themes. I expected it to be a challenge to get through over 500 pages of war novel, but found it captivating and moving.
One of the really good books.  "All the light"  provides new insights into the price of war (adn especicially WWII by introducing  unique people with highly individual ways of experiencing the world.  Subtly written it introduces readers to these people from the inside out.  It fits in nicely with Follet's century trilogy and Larson's Garden of Beasts
The story and characters are so well developed that all is believable. The story is gripping and at times I could not put it down. I didn't want the book/story to end; does Freddy ever look ate the print of birds? Does our heroine ever go to the gate that the key opens? Who is John ? Did anyone ever find the diamond?<br/>What ever happens to the mini house?
This is more than a story of two paths crossing during a volatile era.  It combines a close up look at two young people in the midst of war along with the broader aspect of war. The book allowed me to see a young German soldier in ways that have not been explored in other books I've read.  He, along with the young French girl, are both vulnerable and strong.
What an interesting story of history and humanity.  I would like to meet Mr. Doerrr, for he surely must be a deeply philosophical and thoughtful man.  At first the story seemed almost painful, but as I persevered, I didn't want the book to end......a  rare find in our world of endless stories and a treasure for me. Thank you, I shall read your other stories!
I may not be the best person to write a review... I'm not what you'd consider a sophisticated reader... however I felt that the story fell flat in the end. There was no 'closure' or true understanding of the characters. A lot of unanswered questions. It felt like a rushed ending. When I got to the last page I couldn't believe there was not more to the story.
My finding this book long is due to my slow reading. Not the fault of the book. Another reason was my desire to savor the detail Doerr has incorporated. Each of the characters is painstakingly drawn for us. Distinct for me also was the soul saving grace of nature throughout. It is a realistic account of all sides of WWII from those who suffered on all sides.
I loved the book.  I love reading about (and am a succor for) this era in history and I love just a little hint magic.  The characters were beautifully developed while maintaining just a touch of themselves hidden, as we all do.  Mr Doerr creates emotions by depicting vivid imagery of time, nature, physics and the human capacity for all things good and evil.
I usually do not read books about this dark period of time in our world's history. However, this book came to me as an unknown. I started it and found it very interesting. The plot which involves two separate families takes many twists and turns before the ending. It seemed honest due to the author's exploration of the main characters' feelings and thoughts.
The telling of this story is complex in that it is constructed in two different time frames as the main characters grow older and eventually cross paths.  The characterization is excellent and the story is most engaging.  It is the story of WWII in Europe told through the eyes of two adolescents with their own personal challenges.  I did not want it to end!
This is the best book I've ever read in my life, and I'm 46 and a journalist who reads a lot. The topic wouldn't necessarily have interested me, but based on its awards and positive reviews I read it. The writing was amazing. It was poetic. I enjoyed every sentence, every page. I got the feeling this author could write a banana bread recipe and make me cry.
Another story about surviving WWI and the horrors that it manifested on people.  If my book club hadn't read a few two many of these novels, I probably would have given it 5 starts.  I did empathize with the main characters, and I found Marie Laure to be exceptionally well-drawn.  It was a bit difficult to follow at first, but it was worth sticking with it.
This was an excellent read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it surprised me in many ways.  The writing was wonderful and the plot very interesting.  It goes back and forth between two people and two  cities beginning immediately before WWII.  It also goes back and forth between decades.  You have to really pay attention to keep up.  But it is worth the effort.
It took me a few chapters to get into this book- I wasn't settled enough to focus. Once I did, I was rewarded with the best book I have read in years! I was drawn in by the characters, the subplots, the richness of the settings, the intertwining of lives throughout the decades. Beautifully crafted, well written with a satisfying and realistic end. Loved it
I REALLY enjoyed this book.  It was very well written.  Loved that the chapters were short, which made it easy to stop and start.  Great storyline.  Wish the ending had been a little more cohesive to the book.  The author all of a sudden jumps  YEARS in time to end it.  Not crazy about the ending but overall I really enjoyed it. That's why it gets 5 stars.
This book is beautifully written and a story well-told. Because we all know what went down during Hitler's reign and WWII, I had issues with some manipulations by author nudging me to feel sympathy for Germans during wartime. It didn't help that my great grandparents were in a concentration camp, so for me, it was a not easy for me to get through at first.
lyrical writing, sympathetic and interesting characters, and filled with historic details and the description of the inner life of a blind child.  The ending was not a disappointment because it was believable and evoked empathy from the reader. Although the novel is long, in order to get the most enjoyment from it, it should be read in just a few sittings.
WWII visited again with perspectives from two children; one  very bright GermAn boy, the other a blind French girl.  The captivating beauty in this tale is in the imagery which brings the reader into living each moment. Every phrase, every word is perfectly placed.  This is a book in which any one chapter, on its own, is a story in itself. Loved this book.
If I had known this was about Hitler and WW2, I would not have read it as I have read many, many books on this subject.  Since I didn't, I quickly became interested in the story and found the book to be enlightening and somewhat depressing.  It was beautifully written and for those who know very little about the Hitler regime, I would recommend this book.
Wow. Doerr masters  light, sound, place and character. It brings WWII's France alive with such vivid imagery that captures exactly the countryside I visited several years back. The plot is complex focusing on the children of the war--a blind girl and a young Nazi radio operator. This is so much more than a war story. I read through the night to finish it.
This book makes you think about the way war changes everyone's lives, no matter how you feel about the cause.  How one can get pulled into doing things that you would never have even thought of doing.  It also points out that even after all this, it is still possible to retain some sense of compassion and decency.  Most people are not totally good or bad.
One of the best books I've read. It was so beautifully written and poetically described. This book is set in wwii but it's not your usual story about nazis and camps. It's about the fact that in war everyone is affected on all sides. And this shows two sides not really seen. I absolutely loved it and would read it again. I don't say that about many books.
Enjoyable read and thought provoking.  The book progresses in nicely - the blind character develops a little bit in an unbelieveable manner, the other main character develops in a more believable manner.  I enjoy books of this time in history so I am willing to go along for the ride.  Its worthwhile and I very much enjoyed it and was sad when it was over.
Reading this novel was like making your most favorite dessert last by taking little bites and savoring each one. The language was poetic and sparse but so filled with images. Characters were strange but endearing, brave and sweet or filled with self-loathing. The story line was full of complex human issues. This book was a delight! Powerful and beautiful.
Loved the way the father daughter relationship was described, and the strong fraternal ties within the family capable of overcomming the worst.<br/>Did not like the horrible treatment of poor Frederik in Schoolporfta and the despicable merciless actions of the boys, nor the death of Werner; would have liked a pure soul like his to live..<br/><br/>Magic
Excellent story about the lives of a young French girl and a German soldier, whose lives intertwine in quite an unexpected way. Doerr gives detailed descriptions of life during World War II and how desperately it affected those involved. He helps us understand the impact of war on the human psyche and how those who survived made sense of their experience.
Beautifully constructed this unforgettable story is a reminder of all the horrors and tenderness man possesses . Gut wrenching I had to put it down often but forced myself to continue so I could follow the tragic lives of the characters included and believe how fortunate I was to live in Australia at this time in history where freedom is available to all.
The best written book I've read in a long time.
Loved it...like historical novels. Well written
I didn't care for the ending.  I expected more.
This beautifully written book slowly tells the story of both a young blind girl in France and  a young German boy recruited into HItler's military during WW II.  I love authors who know how to just tell their story with beautifully crafted wording but don't tell you how to feel. Rather they let you react in your own way as witness to the unfolding story.
I read straight through this book in a few days, for the reasons cited above. It is as though you enter into the mind of each character, living and breathing with them in the desperate times that they must live through. The language itself is an achievement, evocative in every detail, metaphoric in its artistry. I'd give it more than 5 stars, if I could.
I found it difficult reading.  I finished it but read in spurts.  It has had such high praise and I cannot understand the outpouring of love for this book.  My book club mostly feels the same way.  So many good books to read that I am sorry I spent my time on this one.  I kept thinking it would get better and grab me at some point but sadly it never did.
This is the best book I've read in a long time.  The language is vividly beautiful, and the story is stunning.  Characters come alive on the page. They are believable, well developed. I fell in love with them. The story moves gracefully between situatuations in Germany and France making the reader eager for more. It is an absolute must read for everyone.
Beautifully written, masterfully told. A story which will test the depth of your emotions as it explores the strength of love and courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.<br/>Comparisons will inevitably be drawn between this book and The Book Thief, with All The Light We Cannot See standing tall alongside any other great works in its genre.
Intriguing novel about that moves in and out of 2 different timelines but eventually brings all characters together. The story is poetically written with strong characters based in Germany and France at the time of WWII.  Tragic consequences of people who blindly followed Hitler's evil and the strength of common people who stepped out to protect freedom.
What a beautifully written story through the eyes of Marie-Laure, who cannot in fact see her world at all. Her sight is her intuition and her story, and that of her fellow characters will grab your attention with every page. I couldn't stop reading...I could feel the characters' presence even when I did stop reading. This book will remain in my thoughts.
Some of the best English language writing I have read. The author layers beautiful short phrases and short chapters to create a scene of infinite complexity. The tragedy of war reaches the heart, but also the small wonderful things that human beings are capable of even under the most dire circumstances. It's a book that I would like to read again in a few years.
This is an excellent and lovely written story for such a terrible time in history. It is easy to understand and visualize each of the characters in this story because of how they are developed throughout the book. It gives a glimpse of what individuals had to endure during that horrific time in history, but the story is much more and well worth reading.
Reading this book was peeling away layers, delving deeper into each of the characters as they grew from naive children during the war. These are the people living through the experiences of wartime that history does not tell us about - their lives poignant, sad, loving, brave. I want another book about ML's adult life. This is definitely a book to read.
Amazing book  probably one of my favorites that i have ever read. The characters develop throughout the book with layers of metaphorical symbols throughout both Werners and Marie Laures characters. I had to read this making many annotations and picking out minor details and it was tough but it opens the story up much more and i do recommend trying that.
A totally different book for me, one about World War II and its challenges to individuals.  An interesting concept, dealing with a blind girl and a young boy fascinated with radio.  Their lives intertwine in a brief but interesting way.  Going back and forth between locations and at different time spans is a challenge, but makes for an interesting plot.
Best book I have read in a very long time.  I like the author's writing style.  You are always looking forward to the next part.  Written about very horrific time in the history of man on the earth. You get a view of what it was like living at that time.  Should serve as a warning because it happened once and it could be possible for it to happen again.
I loved this book from start to finish. It is a wonderful story of WWII through the eyes of two young people -- worlds apart -- and yet connected through their life experiences. The story gives you an accurate perspective of the toll the war took on the most vulnerable in our society, children and the disabled, something that is not often acknowledged.
This book captures your attention from the start and doesn't let up to the end. It is beautifully written, and the storyline is well composed. The story tracks two children, on opposite sides, leading up to WW2, and cleverly has the reader rooting for both. I can see this book as a movie, as the characters are strong and well developed. Most enjoyable!
I am sad knowing this was possibly the reality of people during WWII. It makes you appreciate the life we live in. My heart is with Werner, the child forced to fight when all he wanted was a chance of a better life. For Marie-Laure who fights against all odds to overcome. There is only one outcome I would change and I will let you decide if you agree.
Delightful character development. You become very attached to them. The story grabs you and you become interested in each of the characters. I felt a bit disappointed with the way the story ended. After all the time invested in a couple of the characters their story ended abruptly. Other than that, it was a good book and worked well for our book club.
easy reading.I was left wondering when the main characters would meet. However their meeting was sketchy and fleeting. More detail please.Too many points of the book needing the story coloured in rather than leaving us a black and white sketch drawing of the scene.<br/>Generally a good read and story. With more detail it could have been a great read.
Now that I have finished this book I am planning to reread it. After I wrote my own Table Of Contents it is a far understandable. I plan on lending the Table of Contents to my book club as in our library I am on for 397 days to have it available. I loved the prose and the emotion of the wonderful characters who one came to understand their situations.
This book was recommended to me.  When I began reading it, I wasn't sure it was for me, but suddenly I found myself staying up late to see what happened next.  It's moving in some areas and curiously enticing in others.  I think you'll enjoy it and be taken in by the characters.  Give it a try!  I hope that you'll find this review "helpful"!!!
A beautiful novel, well-written and a page turner.  Two very different looks at life during World War II in Europe.  It contributed a great deal to my understanding of why Hitler was so popular and why the regime fell apart in the end.  Also, I had no idea that the French had suffered so much in terms of lack of food supply, and basic survival skills.
This book takes the reader into the Germany and France before World War II as seen through the eyes and lives of two young people. The anguage of this author astonds the read with its ability to move and speed the reader through the collison of two worlds as they meant. This novel examines what is the the hearts and minds of people as history unfolds.
I really liked this book.  It presents WWII from a German's boy's view and from a girl's experience living during German occupation.  The author presents three plots and you follow them each to the inevitable conclusion.  I won't give it away.  This book is well written and quite enjoyable.  I found it to be compelling enough to almost a page turner.
I liked the way the story unfolded; one characters story, then the other. The way the war unfolded through each character. Without using horror as a description, I "saw" the horror of the war through each characters thoughts and actions. It was a very good story that developed the characters beautifully. Recommended reading and great for a book club.
This is a beautifully written book about people living in Nazi occupied France, each character emerging in different ways but also with similarities in reaction to countless hardships and cruelties. The author's language rich and magical, his words draw pictures that illustrate the story with brilliance and profound artistry.  It is a wonderful read.
I came upon this book in the kindle bookstore and thought I would give it a try.  I am glad I did.  It was a bit hard to start but then all of a sudden I was done.  Beautifully written, amazing details, wonderful characters.  I would read this again and I am looking forward to other books written by this author!  All in all a great and poignant read.
After a reading a few chapters, I could not put it down--and neither could my husband.  I want to read it again and slowly this time to savor Anthony Doerr's writing. As a young child during WWII, I am drawn to fiction and nonfiction about this time period.  This story, like The Book Thief portray a very human side to people on both sides of the war.
This is a masterpiece. A blind French girl, an orphaned German boy, and a 133 carat diamond, in the middle of WWII. The writing is the most beautiful part of this book, because the prose is expertly crafted, not too flowery, not too dry, just the right amount of lyrical imagery that breathes life into this wonderful story. Well deserved Pulitzer win!
Just when you think you've read all you can read about WW!!, this plot engaged me thoroughly. Telling stories from different viewpoints seems to be a popular genre these days, but i was enthralled wondering how the story tellers' lives would eventually intertwine. Not disappointed. Lovely story with just enough historical truth to keep me spellbound.
This book tells its stories beautifully, delicately, tenderly. It shines with compassion and great emotional depth, illuminating humanity during the particularly turbulent times around World War II. It is a book to be read leisurely, with care, giving yourself time to absorb its truths and beauties. It is incredibly moving, and I highly recommend it.
One of the most phenomenal books I've ever read - or listened to. I bought this on CD for my commute to work. Not one who really gets into books on tape, I found that I couldn't wait to get in the car so I could hear the next installment! The imagery the author creates is like no other, and I found that I hated to see it end. A must read - or listen!
I read the book on my Kindle and enjoyed it, however, I spent too much time on the computer looking for a map of Saint Malo which listed all the street names mentioned. The author goes into such detail of trips to and from various points around town. I don't know about the hardcover, whether or not it includes a detailed map, but it surely needs one.
I understand why this has been called one of the best books of 2014.  It's a book I'm going to go back and read because I'm sure I missed things but I was so interested in the characters.  It's one of those books you put down and you don't want to pick another book up because your still enjoying thinking about the characters and what might have been.
Doer writes a poignant novel about the parallel but so different lives of young teens. The historical setting of the Second World War is graphic and vibrant. Our Book Club read this book and we almost never all agree that a book was good. However All the Light You Cannot See got a unanimous vote on being a great read and a good discussion tool. Enjoy
Well-written, well researched work with evolved characters. Enjoyed this more than any other book this year. Nothing wrong w/ beach reads, thrillers, etc., but we all need substantive books as well. Hats off to Doerr. His hard work helped me understand what came before WWII & how people endured its tragedy. The human story is wonderful...print melts.
I learned a lot through this book about the training of young boys for the military. While I knew there was a lot of propaganda - it was interesting how it was incorporated into children's stories.  I personally do not like books that go back and forth in time.  I prefer start and go forward - not back and forth many many times.  Overall - good book.
Excellent read. The author puts you in the moment.  Helps to understand the thinking that occurred from the French and German perspective pre Second World War and during.  The insecurities and horror of war are woven into the story line. It brought back to the surface for me the realities that I experienced in Germany as a child of a refugee family.
Started out slow and I had a hard time getting "hooked". But soon I found that I couldn't put it down! The writing style enhances the plot development by giving you glimpses into the future as well as revealing important information from the past. The ending was intense and although I wish it had ended differently, it was probably realistic.
A jewel of a book.  The writing is captivating and the author`s research and knowledge is  astounding.  Then add the history, the breath catching unexpected twists in the war weary  subjects and you have a  mindboggling  race from character to character that keeps you glued to the pages.  What a gift to hold such spellbinding reading in your hands .
I loved this book.  It was such a wonderful sad captivating story. I love to read these and just can't fathom how people survived this awful times with bombs dropping and lack of food.  War is awful and this is just a reminder of it all.  Great characters and wonderful story.  Highly recommend if you like stories about World War Two.  Super read....
I have been reading Anthony Doerr's work for several years. He is wonderful writer with amazing range. It is a joy to see his book on the bestseller lists and to see that it has been reviewed by thousands of readers. This extraordinary book will fill your heart and stay with you always. A tribute to the human spirit by a writer who only gets better.
One review I had read said the story wasn't great but the writing was beautiful and that is what makes the book so good. I found the story to be wonderful. It was engaging and very well written. There were parts about the war that were very difficult to read, but they seemed real and that is what made it heartbreaking. I couldn't put this book down.
Having been to SanMalo, I was envisioning and absorbing the wartime narration taking place at that time.  Quite engaged until toward the end with the young German soldier simply pulling her from the closet while she accepted it without fear seemed unlikely.  It somewhat lost me there.  It had a number of very interesting stories binding it together.
I enjoyed the whole book start to finish.  This author has a great way with words, and for me he really made the horror of World War II come alive.  The two young characters, one French and the other German, are both characters you can root for, and the secondary characters just leap off the page.  I read this in every spare moment until I was done.
My book group assigned this and i dreaded it. I thought it would be an apology for the germans or a sappy love story. Well it tries to be a bit of an apology for the germans but it is not what i thought. It is very moving and for all its detail it is hard to put down. I didn't weep as it closed but I almost did and still feel it tugging at my heart.
This is actually a good book. It is not, as one of the reviews describes, uplifting. But why would it be? Its about world war 2. The characters are interesting, the story is well done and well paced. Really it should be 4 star review except for the fact that the reviewers and whoever wrote the cover synopsis failed miserably at describing this book.
I'm not always a fan of the literature style that jumps around to different perspectives and times, however the way in which Doerr wrote this was poetic. The characters and lines were well developed and I sincerely appreciate the detail he put into finishing our the character lines. I loved this book so much I'm already considering reading it again.
Initially a little difficult to get used to his style, but once you are into the novel Doerr has a command of language and brilliant descriptive resources that are truly impressive. His range of characters are equally captivating and he manages to evoke the horrors of WW2 without ever losing his focus on the two main characters and how their own destinies will play out. An altogether amazing achievement.
this a beautifully written, well constructed story, with fully drawn characters that you care for, one of the best books i have read this year
I didn't like it as well as many of the reviewers.  I did like the character development and how their lives evolved to their meeting.  What I didn't like was too many uncommon words used in the text, use of French, then German.  It just made for halted reading.  I won't say what happened, but didn't like the ending at all.  Big build-up then that.
One of the best stories I've read in a long time
Great craft. Time line jumped around quite a bit, but not beyond bearing. Characters, even minor ones, are 3D (perhaps 4D might be closer for major players). Not hard to see why it won the Pulitzer.
"All the Light We Cannot See" is a heart-wrenching story of the devastation wrought by the Second World War on the residents of France and the soldiers of the Third Reich. It paints a rich portrait of a blind French girl and her family and a young, gifted German soldier caught up in the war machine. The reader knows that their paths will inevitably cross, although their meeting does not develop as one would expect. The descriptions of the landscape, both physical and mental, are beautifully constructed and the reader is left feeling helpless at the wounds that are inflicted on the characters and the futility of the conflict. Although the story is compelling and well-constructed, Doerr's use of extremely brief chapters and his pointless jumping around in time, although not really confusing, is annoying and distracting. Otherwise, this is an exemplary book.
This was an amazing book.  It took a few chapters for me to see where the puzzle was connected, but once the pieces started fitting together I was engrossed in a powerful story that took place in a time that fills our hearts with sorrow.  The way Doerr wove these seemingly unrelated characters together was seamless.  The details in the plot made for interesting reading and I could not predict what would happen next.  I travel two hours a day for work and it was nice to have a distraction for the ride.
This book was more than a novel.  To me it was a book of poetry, of brief images as long as three pages or as short as one line.  They leave the reader sad but also inspired by the human ability to share another's suffering.  I would recommend this book especially to anyone who has experienced war.  They will get it.
This was the best book I've read in years.  I wouldn't have read it except it was one of my book club selections.  The author is such a wordsmith.  There are so many scenes that stay with you because of the descriptions.
Not enough stars in the sky to rate this brilliantly told, evocatively written homage to war, redemption and resilience...
Beautifully crafted, well written and vivid characters. I thought I never wanted to read another WWII novel but this book proved me wrong. Intelligent and skillfully told.
It was an easy read.  A good summer beach book.
Fabulous story. Incredibly interesting characters. Kept you wanting to read all day!
I loved the author's insights and descriptions.  A good story showing both sides of the conflict.
This story draws you in from the first word and holds you until the last. The story lines are carefully woven, the prose beautifully powerful.
Great read
Speaks brilliantly to the human condition.
I LOVED this book! So much so that I dragged out the last couple of chapters because I didn't want it to end. The story is intriguing, mysterious and beautifully written, and the characters are so complex and appealing that I embraced them from the start and never wanted to give them up. Also, I enjoy historical fiction, and Mr. Doerr does a masterful job of using World War II in France and Germany to give us a believable picture of some of the the trials, tribulations and sacrifices of the people in its time while leaving us with a positive, powerful story of love and survival. This book will remain in my mind and my heart for a long time.
The book was too long.  I lost interest after about 300 pages.  IT just didn't hold my attention that long.  Good book but just entirely too long for the content
kept me up nights
I cared about all the characters, even those with serious flaws or wrong allegiances. That is a tribute to the author. These are human beings caught in a cruel moment of history. The diamond is ok for linking together the sub-plots, but the book would be just as strong without the diamond. The characters and the feeling for history are what make it a good read.
AN INGENIOUS WORK OF FICTION COUCHED IN AN ACTUAL FACT OF HISTORY: WORLD WAR 2. THE CHARACTERS ARE VIVIDLY PORTRAYED IN A RARE DEPTH. AND THE EVENTS WHICH INVOLVE THEM CARRY YOU ALONG FOR THE RIDE TOO. CERTAINLY DESERVING TO BE ON THE NEW YORK TIMES LIST OF TOP BOOKS OF 2014.
This is an outstanding novel from a historical and humanistic perspective. I loved it. One of the best books I've ever read.
This would not have been my choice for a Pulitzer Prize. The plot is fairly novel but I found the characters uni-dimensional and predictable. I also found the author's technique of flipping narrative between the 2 characters distracting, especially since the chapters are so short.
Beautifully written. Drama, action and story woven as poetry. Poignant and gripping.  Must read--do yourself a favor and experience this masterwork!
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The narrative follows two teenagers during World War II, blind Marie-Laure of Paris, France and Werner Pfennig of Germany. Both characters overcome obstacles and deal with their own limitations (Marie's physical, Werner's one of character) where time and the machinery of war eventually lead them to meet.<br/><br/>The chapters dealing with Werner's schooling at an elite political school and the brutal treatment of the instructors were exceptionally well written and devastating at the same time.<br/><br/>I held out hope for the ultimate happy ending but was not disappointed when it did not happen.<br/><br/>The chapters are incredibly short, giving this book a fast reading feel despite the 500+ page length. Intricately woven, the short chapters bounce through time and location but surprisingly it was not difficult to follow and was well laid out developing the characters even as we knew how their worlds would ultimately collide.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the plot but both the main two characters and the minor characters are so well written and developed that it's an astounding feat. I can't wait to read more from this author.
A WONDERFUL book.  Seriously.  World War II Historical Novel, so well written.
Good condition
A truly fabulous book.  Read it because of various reviews I'd read from other sources.  Found it to be the best book I have read in years.  I was entranced and at times repelled, but I continued to read.  It drew me in and I could not put it down.  The Nazi horrors were the worst, but the love and the humanity that their war machine was unable to kill in the children they recruited to be fill with hate was redemptive for me, the reader, and I could tolerate the evil as I watched it fail.  Those who were pure of heart including Werner and his sister, the blind girl and her father and uncle, the Resistance members, and all tugged at my heart strings each time I read about them.  An especially touching symbol was the boy who loved birds and was terribly hurt because of his gentleness.  I wanted the book to go on.  I wanted a different ending.  My heart broke for Papa and for Werner and for all who were so wonderful.  An amazing book.  I will read his other books and any future offerings.
My first read of an Anthony Doerr work, but it certainly will not be the last. Having visited Saint Malo with relatives I found the historical context enlightening.
Book lovers will love this book.<br/>It is one of those wonderful surprising and beautiful booka.
Beautiful book. Incredible use of the English language , the author makes everything come to life. We see through Marie Laure's eyes.
Incredibly well crafted and written, the book's only flaw is its length. Long but not too long to take away a star. And speaking of length, inside this book are some of the longest sentences I have ever read! Stanley Fish would be appalled.
The author used exquisite prose to give us necessary sight. During the war, reports from the adults made news and history. In this compelling book, the stories of children take us to a deeper understanding. It is an unforgettable treasure of a book.
Very accessible and believable.  I found it enjoyable and recognized some of the issues brought up by the author.<br/>The story moves quickly and is easy to follow.<br/>The book is particularly well suited for teen girls.  The antisemitism experienced by the main character is beautifully handled and the resolution quite reasonable and realistic..
i loved this book. i advised everybody to read it.
I enjoy stories about WWII, almost as if I were there. I really liked the characters, the suspense, the detail. Beautifully written!<br/><br/>I didn't care for the jumping back and forth in time, I prefer s more linear timeline to a story, but that is just my preference.<br/><br/>I recommend this for those interested in understanding impacts of war on people and those who enjoy a good story.
Beautifully written; thoroughly researched; great pacing and appealing characters.<br/>Highly recommend.
Great storytelling. Beautiful writing.
This is a very interesting story that takes place during WW II. The detail to time and place is amazing. There are several stories that take place in France and Germany and it involves children and what happens to them during war. How their worlds are torn apart because of the war. It is a great read. I will read it again soon.
Charming story, well written
Extraordinarily gifted writing, visual, visceral, emotional -- a sweeping multi-generational narrative set in Europe before, during, and after WWII.
just wonderful, very beautifully written and extremely moving Anthony Doer is a master writer
Complicated plat - hard to follow.
I enjoyed this book, especially the fist half. I'm character driven and I really came to care for Marie Laure and Werner, and many of the other characters in this book. It was lovely change from all of the WWII books my book group has read in the past.
An engaging story with interesting characters set in the last historical period of absolute certainties about right and wrong.  The book humanizes the face of war and, perhaps inadvertently,can cause us to question our own moral certainty.  The languorous and dreamlike telling of the tale can be disconcerting to some who prefer a linear story line.
A wonderful novel.  I couldn't put it down.  It creates a unique perspective on World War II through the eyes of two young people and how they each managed the particular challenges of their lives.  Written in a lovely and compelling way, we are always waiting to learn how their lives will intersect and whether each will survive their circumstances
My feelings on this book are hard to put into words. Anthony Doerr writes with such feeling and intimacy and zest that when you read his work, you become a part of each word, each sentence, each chapter. I was walking the streets of Paris, as blind as Marie-Laurre, but seeing as though I've never used my eyes before. The descriptions Doerr uses for everything from a blossoming flower to a ringing bell to love between orphans, is so profoundly moving that I was feeling, seeing and being as if I was literally a character myself. I was moved by this story and loved every little piece of the plot, including the ending. From the first sentence to the last, I was swept into a different world of happiness, fear, unimaginable loss and sacrifice, on a journey that I could not close the book on. I have found my new favorite author! This book easily tops the list of my all-time favorites and I have already begun reading another of his masterpieces.
I am not a snob about many things, but I am a literature snob--for that reason I read very little popular literature, since most of it is junk. I was so happy to find this book to read on our beach vacation this year...it was so wonderful to find a great, well-written novel (although I wouldn't call this a "beach read"). I loved every page.
A memorable read - a haunting story with such rich complex characters.  I loved the many short chapters that were each purposeful.  I had a hard time putting the book down.  I worried about the people as I went to sleep and as I awakened.  What terrible things man can do to one another whether by choice or by fear.  This is a not-to-be-missed read!
A moving, surprising novel that allows us to see the world through a blind girls eyes. A war story like no other
Very moving story....I liked how the author wrapped it up .
Fabulous book! Beautifully plotted, great characters !
Enjoyed this from the first and was sad when it was over but it didn't end the way I wanted it to, although it in fact ended realistically.
Well-written novel that gave me insight into the lives and times of war-torn France and Germany.  The characters came alive in the story.  Hard to put down.
If you are looking for something beautifully written that will stay with you long after you finish, read this novel.
Beautifully written, engaging characters, interesting theme and time, ineffably sad.
A beautiful book, stylistically reminiscent of The English Patient. I read this book after reading The Book Thief and Life After Life, which makes for an interesting volley of historical, thematic, and philosophical echoes. The characters Werner and Marie-Laure each attempt to apprehend the world, either through the intellect or through the senses (although Marie-Laure is blind, she uses her other heightened senses remarkably).
Excellent read. Captures the emotions and everyday life of a young German soldier and a blind French girl caught in the tumult of WWII.  The reality for both is crushing, but they are caught in forces beyond their control.  The writing style flows well and lets the reader feel the intensity of the times while balancing the perspectives of both main characters.
Beautiful book!  Highly recommend.
Riveting until the end, I just couldn't put the book down until I was done. It took me about a week after I finished the book to stop missing it's characters and wonder how they're doing...
Beautifully written.
Excellent historical novel.  Well written and interesting story.
Beautifully written, exquisitely crafted, almost perfect novel, but the last 50 pages were superfluous. Highly recommend.
I rarely write reviews but felt I needed to share.<br/>A beautiful novel that left my heart aching.  I love when a story wraps the reader into its imagery, so much so that I am there, feeling the love, loss and triumph.  I could see the crumbling city and at times felt my own heart race from fear and desperation as if I, alone, was trying to survive. Extremely delicate in how he weaved the lives of the characters, each looking for someone or something.  Truly amazing.
What a beautifully written book.  I enjoyed the character development and the history lesson in the story.  I hope tp share this with my husband, he'll enjoy the different perspective of the WWII characters.
This is a beautifully written, absorbing novel.  It hurts to read on but one is compelled to read on.  Although the book takes place in France and Germany before, during, and after World War II, the author conveys his understanding that people on both sides are driven by events and pasts beyond their control and the best they can do is to find and act on the best that is in themselves.  The scenic and visual descriptions are incomparable; many I read over and over and even highlighted, so apt were they.  I highly recommend this book.  It's long, but it goes quickly; I read it in two days.  The fact that it is divided into short chapters, from different people's viewpoints, from different dates not always in chronological order, helps mute a bit of the pain you feel for some of the characters, but you overwhelmingly want them to pull through and to allow themselves to act on their best instincts.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
This was one of those rare books that live on in your mind and heart long after it's finished. So sorry to come to the last page.
What can be said about a book that is so lovely, so hard to comprehend, so moving? Without doubt this book is one of the best I've read in a long time and one that I'm sure I'll read again. I've read many books about World War II and yet while reading this one, I felt as if I were there, walking the streets, hearing the bombardment, waiting for the next attack to begin. I learned new information and deepened what I'd learned before, especially about how the Germans prepared and used young boys in the war.  With the war as the back drop, the character development was the heart of the book, and what wonderful characters! Even with the difficult topic, the life affirming relationships carried the book to its end. There are so many ways that is could have been predictable and Mr. Doerr resisted at every turn.
Enjoyed this book very much!  Beautifully written!
Memoralble, I'll never look at the Jardin du plants or St. Malo in the same light again.  One of the best books I've read in ten years. the reality of war and the futility of war and the endurance of human connections.
Incredibly wonderful! So interesting.
What a wonderful read.  The characters were beautifully drawn and in particular the boy and girl and their exceptional perceptual worlds brought a different kind of sensory experience to the reading of the book.  One of my favorite summer books in a long, long time.
This is an absolutely a wonderful book.  I could not wait to read the outcome.
This was a fabulous book, well researched and beautifully written.  It  was easy to get involved with the characters as well as the period of<br/>time in history that this occurred.  I was sad to see this cook come to an end.<br/><br/>Thank you, Bente Clausen
This book was intense and I could not put it down.  You really felt for the characters - especially Marie Laure.  I was sad to finish the book.
I love this book.  Would really recommend it to friends.  It got a little plodding in the end.  Kept me going though!
great read
fabulous book!! best read in a long time!
The jacket description does this book no justice. I enjoyed every word of this book. It was so well written. It was lovely. It was sad. It beautiful. It was tender. I almost didn't read this book simply because it was set around WWII, but the perspective the book takes is so original. I fell in love with characters on both sides of the war.
I loved this book and have recommended it to my book group in Arizona, plus my daughters who have now grown old enough to appreciate good writing.
Beautiful. I am already retreading it.
Loved it.
It was a wonderful story.
Fantastic!  Beautifully written, unforgettable characters.  Another slice of World War II history to learn about.
The author humanized characters who often are portrayed as one-dimensional.  The actions of the characters during extremely difficult situations are believable.  It was sometimes difficult to follow the timeline, but the strength of the story made this a very minor issue.
Amazing story!  I felt connected to the characters-couldn't wait to open the book and start reading every night.  Thought about the story even when I wasn't reading it. Thought about it after I finished it.  Nice and long so  you don't finish it too soon.  Way to go Anthony Doerr.
Wonderful powerful sorry. Great characters.
Wonderful novel.
A beautiful read
Parellel stories that mesh into one are always intriguing,  and this book does it better than any I've read for awhile. The German soldier-boy with a conscience and a talent for electronics,  and the blind French girl who is fearless in many ways, captured my mind and imagination.  I can imagine every bit of this novel came from a real place. It was gratifying that the author continued to tell the journey of Marie Laure into her adulthood and life as a Grandmother.  I highly recommend this novel.
Best book I've read in quite some time. I read a lot of novels set in this era, and this places near the top of the list. I give it 4 stars only because my heart would've preferred an ending that tied up in to a nice little bow. Real life hardly ever ends up that way, and this book is nothing but brutally honest, and maybe better for it. I'll have to chew on it a bit. While I'm doing that, I say you should read this book and Decide for yourself.
A beautifully written novel....
This is an excellent telling of a compelling story of two young people in World War II. Marie-Laure LeBlanc is a blind girl living in Paris with her father who is a locksmith for the national museum. Werner Pfennig is a young German orphan living with his sister Jutta in a coal mining town. He loves building radios and wants desperately to free himself of the mining life which killed his father.<br/><br/>Their lives move from disparate places in 1940 until they intersect in Saint Malao in  August 1944. Werner is enrolled in the National Political Institute of Education #6 at Schulpforta. The novel creates a excruciatinlgy sense of dread as we see the cruelty and evil the young Nazis are taught. Werner "laces his boots and sings the songs and marches the marches, acting less out of duty than out of a timeworn desire to be dutiful."  (p 277).  But he is dutiful.<br/><br/>Of Marie-Laure Doerr writes "To shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindness. Beneath your world of skies and faces and building exists a rawer and oldr world, a place where surface planes disintegrate and sounds ribbon in shoals through the air." (p390) Marie-Laure follows her father from Paris to Saint Malao to escape the war as the invasion of France begins. But of course the war follows them.<br/><br/>The novel provides a sweeping view of both sides of the war while providing a gripping story of two young people caught up in the whirlwind. The tension continues to increase until I thought I couldn't take it anymore. I could barely stand to read the early Schulpforta scenes. By the middle I could barely stand to put it down.<br/><br/>It's difficult to say too much about this without giving spoilers. Suffice it to say it is on the New York Times best seller list for a reason. Get a copy of this book and read it.
Lovely story of courage and will amid strong adversaries . Enjoyable read.
Waited almost all the way through read to connect stories:/
This is a lovely and haunting story.  I was totally drawn in to the story, I could see it all unfold in my mind's eye as I read the brilliant text.
The writing is beautiful. The author paints a picture of wonder, love, hope, and heartache. This incredible story is of two lives, minor characters, in a world affected by the devastation of war.
Beautiful ,'lyrical, spellbinding story.
Loved this book. A great story about the french and German side of regular people during WW II. You really have compassion for the human spirit and don't take sides. I was sorry it was over.
A must read!  Could not put the book down!
An unforgettable experience, not just a good read - the author brings you directly into the lives of these young children! I may be prejudiced, as I love novels about World War II, but this surpassed many others in its humanness. I look forward to a visit to St. Malo.
Very interesting story with an interplay of characters.<br/>An unexpected vantage point of WWII.
I really like the writing in this book ! I read it twice!
Beautifully written. A real page turner. Highly recommended.
Beautiful book.  Impossible not to become involved - hard to know where to stop until the next day.  Doerr has a rare gift with the use of words that transport the reader into his realm.  A privilege to read.  Many thanks to Anthony Doerr for this insight into human nature and the effects of war on the human spirit.
Sad, but a very good read
A very interesting read. I really enjoyed this book.  I have recommended it to my friends.
I read this book in 3 days. I could not set it down. The storyline is great and winding and covers 70 years but does so beautifully!  I am glad to have read it on my Kindle, because the author uses some descriptive words I had to key to know the meaning! Still very good. I am going to recommend it to my sister's book club!
Great story!  I highly recommend it!
A wonderful story that takes place when the world was in some it't darkest times. Thumbs up on it's story line.
I really liked the book  and it's tie  to a period I really enjoy reading about.  The story was good so I continued to be drawn into it.
Beautifully written story of WW II from two perspectives.
It was a good book.
Creative, well written, delightful story. Not what I expected, but what a great surprise.
One of the very best books I've ever read, beautifully written.
I cannot say enough wonderful things about this book.  It is so beautifully written, so moving, and tells such a heartbreaking, compelling story.  It's the kind of book that stays with you long after you finish reading it.  If you've ever loved someone who lived through WWII and then never talked about, this book will help you understand why. Read it.
the story hooks you and reels you in with beautiful language, characters you care about and a story that won't let you go.
Frankly, whenever I read a description of this book it did not appeal to me.  It kept popping up as a recommended book based on my other purchases.  I broke down and gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised.  Enjoyed the book's fresh perspective.
The characters were so richly and cleverly woven together  despite their differences.  A beautiful telling of a of sad time in history.  Had trouble putting it down once I got into it.
Good
A beautiful  and moving book. Characters you will care about and remember.
Amazing book.  Extensively researched, beautifully written.  One of the best books I have ever read.
A beautiful tale of lives coming together in spite of the evil that surrounds them.<br/>That rare novel where the author is impeccable with the written word.
A very well written, beautiful story.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the end left me wanting a bit more information about the characters.  But the connections between characters, times and places were so intricate and well thought out, that even though this book was descriptive and sometimes even slow, it became a page turner I did not want to put down.
I actually really liked this book.  2 story lines, and you know at some point they've got to be intertwined, and yet you have a plotline that (apart from the historical background that everyone knows) doesn't feel at all predictable.  There's some lovely imagery and an aura of hope despite the rather depressing settings.  Sentimental as the epilogue chapters are, by that time you've really identified with the characters and are drawn into the ending.  On a side note, I coincidentally downloaded this book on the last days of a vacation in Germany, where some of the book it set, so perhaps that gave it a certain reality for me.
see the movie
Terrific read.  I could feel myself going through each characters roll like I was there.  I couldn't put the book down and commend the author for this wonderful but heart wrenching story about WW2.  I hope it becomes a movie.
Wonderful book!  This book shows us that in life there is always light, maybe not in the normal way and Maybe we CA n' t reach it, but it is there!
I chose this rating because there were none higher. Simply a beautiful masterful work of literature which I will never forget.
A nice story, takes its time. Unfortunately (and oddly, given the quality of the writing, otherwise), the author rambles on way past the proper ending of the story (I'd say, the end of chapter ten).
Thought provoking in it apprehension and understanding or the human condition.  Character development of every age and station of the particulars. Could not put it down during the first read through. Relished every word during the second reading.  A book to share with friends and especially with grandchildren of a certain age.
very good
A good read, enjoyed it very much.
This will surely become a big hit
Beautiful prose. Good story. kept me interested and engaged.
loved the descriptions..felt as if I were there..cross between The Book thief and The Orphan Train
I could not put this book down.  By the end of the book I felt like I was in Paris with the characters.
Loved this book...could not put it down.
At first, it is interesting, young brother and sister as orphans.  At some point it gets tedious, but not for long.  When you read this, you live through a young man's life.  I truly love this book and highly recommend it.
I loved the book. It is so beautifully written that you don't want to read another mediocre writer ever again.
This was a beautiful touching story. The characters were complex and I found myself thinking about them long after I finished the book.
an excellent read
One of the best books that I have read in awhile. Great character development. My only complaint is that the ending came too soon. Thank you, Mr. Doerr.
Well developed characters. As the story goes on you can't predict where the story is going but you can anticipate the behavior of the characters because you feel like you know them by now.
Tragic, but worth the read.
The alternating chapters developing the story lines for the two main characters is very effective.  The jumping back and forth historically can be a bit unsettling at a couple of points, but still the structure is marvelous for building suspense.  The main characters are so well-drawn and quite unforgettable.  I haven't read a World War II book as good, though the blitz scenes in Kate Atkinson's "Life After Life" are pretty darn close!
A view of World War II told through two children, one blind and the other an orphan. It kept me up late a couple of nights because I could not put it down.
It is a wonderful story, but my reservation is that because it skips around in time, it is a sometime frustrating read, but worthwhile nonetheless.
Great descriptions. The Author had me hooked from the beginning
Beautifully written . This is a story that will stay with you for weeks to come as you ponder the choices made. What would you have done?
So glad others recommended this book to me.  It was beautifully written and I fell in love with each character.
A very good read... worth you time!
Loved it.
It is an amazing story of what the human spirit can endure.
Excellent, very readable story.  A young blind girl in France and an orphaned German boy whose lives converge.  Tells the story in alternating chapters about each young person.  A unique description of the building horrors of WWII and its effects especially on these young lives and their surroundings.
Great story about WWII with a different approach.
A book that is difficult to put down. The story line is very strong even though it jumps every chapter between characters and dates. The central theme of the book is the second world war but the reaction, thoughts and action of the characters are the most important factors.The characters are very well developed and for the only time I can remember, the German soldiers are not described as being without human feelings.<br/>I will certainly read another book by this author.
The time shifting narrative is a bit distracting although Doerr does pull it off somewhat elegantly. The prose is touching and the two protagonists are genuinely involving although I preferred the moral ambiguity and sublimity of the Werner character over Marie-Laure who I feel the author could have introduced more shading to the stereotypically brave and resourceful blind girl. However the novel does not plunge into sentimental mosh nor give away any tidy endings, it is a heartbreakingly realistic portrayal of a war that does not always have closure nor provides any meaningful justification for some of the characters. I'm not so sure about the role of the sea of flames diamond which somehow seems clumsy to the narrative. I am giving this to my daughter to read as a step up from her YA novels because the story is so beautifully painted and the ending so prosaically touching in it's simplicity.
A great read-well written -what a story!
Five big stars from me . Loved it and have passed it on to many friends who also felt the same . Beautiful story set amongst war . Could not put it down . Highest recommendation .
The exquisite language, the engrossing story line all contribute to a must read. It was a novel I hated to have ended. The characters are beautifully drawn and the story is heart felt. I would gladly recommend it to anyone.
I thought it was a great read, a page turning, interesting character development and a most enjoyable book.
Well written.  Beautiful stories. It tells the stories of two individuals, unrelated,  and how each lived and grew through the war.  In the end the stories intertwine.  it was a page turner.  Again, it's wonderfully well told and the end is believable, not contrived.
Strong sensitive and warmly emotional. I felt like I was reading two books at the same time and they both left me with my own thoughts about an ending.
Beautifully written, gentle story during period of striff. Fast read.
A very good book about the second world war and how people suffered and just tried to stay alive. This is the first book I've read by Anthony Doerr and I am looking forward to reading more.
Well written. Great story.  A history we should never forget
Great read !
This is a beautifully written book. After reading it, I bought his Short Story collection and would happily read anything else this author writes.
Beatifully written.The characters  were so believibly portrayed. I empathised with them so much.
Love the stories that intertwine and pull me along. Courage defined in several of the characters. Could not put it down.
Swept away into another era...loved this book!
This book is so interesting and well-written. I admire the writing, the characterization, etc.
Beautifully written.
Beautiful writing, compelling characters - I thought I didn't need another WWII novel, but this one is different, very specific and close-in as opposed to those sweeping war sagas.
Excellent story, well told.  Hard to put down.
This was my first book by this outstanding author, very compelling story and an excellent read.
a little difficult to follow the back and forth in time but intriguing story
What a fabulous book!
Beautiful, lyrical book. Exceedingly well-written, carefully crated, stunningly vivid. A joy to read and to ponder it's deeper messages for today.
The story was touching and intriguing.
Excellent historical fiction with suburb characterization and setting description .
Beautifully written book dealing with the complexities of a tragic time.
Perhaps the best compliment I can pay this book is that I will certainly be reading it again. Couldn't put this one down. I will be looking up other books by this author.
Moving story of two lost people in occupied France during ww2, a young blind girl and a young German soldier whose paths briefly but poignantly cross.
To me this was a really amazing book.  I liked the writing, the characters, and especially the plot--it was really different.  WWII seen from both sides and someone managing without sight at all--incredible.
My advice is to not stop reading this book. I can not use  the word "slow" to describe the beginning. There is another word that is more positive word than that.  If you start reading it, it will gather momentum and suck you in. The story is unpredictable, very well written, very original, emotional, and thought provoking. I finished it two weeks ago, then waited for my wife to finish, so we could have a conversation about the book. I can't see too many people disliking this book.
Brilliant character development in an inspiring story surrounded by the blur of war. The weaving of the lives of two complex characters, one blind, clinging to her father and grandfather for their guidance and wisdom, the other a boy shaped by the Nazi youth camps, struggling to overcome the cruelty and injustices while striving to excel with his technical knowledge. The ability of both in their own ways to overcome their obstacles that briefly bring them together in an unexpected way is the essence of hope and sacrifice that allows us to see the realness of our humanity. LOVED IT !!!
One of my favorite books, ever!
Being a child during World War 11 I always like books pertaining to that era. All the Light We Can Not See put a different perspective on two characters whose lives and ideals were so different . Actually they were only children when their lives collided as their countries were at war with each other. It showed how they had to be grown up to face these challenges they were thrust into. The soldier of Nazi Germany showed himself to have empathy and love for the French Girl showed a side of humanity at its finest' I loved the book and the extra plot of the Flame diamond added too it.
Loved the history in this book... Writer was easy to read. My husband is reading it now, & likes it as much as I did.
A view inside  world war two from a young French girl and a young German boy.  Truth and heartbreak are not disguised.  Gripping.
This tale is about the "little people" who were caught up in World War II, from both sides of the conflict.  As the story progresses, the author provides the reader rich and colorful characterizations about a wide variety of antagonists and protagonists learn to swallow their fears, pride and hearts, in order to survive the horrors and unexpected positive outcomes of international conflicts.<br/><br/>On the one hand, an orphaned brother and sister, on the German-French border grow up understanding that they will never escape the horrors of poverty and servitude to the rich, power classes in Germany.  In this part of the story, the brother is depicted as having a gift for abstract thinking and eventually earns a place in an elite military school for German youth.  At the same time, a widowed keeper of the keys of a famous Paris museum is protecting and educating his blind daughter to survive in the world.  The girl, on her part, is a fast and agile learner, a fact which saves her as the war encroaches on her life.<br/><br/>Eventually these two main characters meet, as the war begins to end, among the ruins of an ancient French city along the Atlantic coast.  But up to that point, the setting moves along a complicated storyline, moving back and forth in time.  The plot seeks to give the reader a wide variety of complex characters who all suffer under the onslaught of the war.<br/><br/>Eventually, those who find the strength and wile to survive, do so.  At the denouement, the future years of the main characters merge and reveal the results of the continental conflict that has altered the heart and mind of many nations forever.<br/><br/>For readers who enjoy World War Two stories, this novel is for you.  For those enjoying the geography and history of modern Europe, this book is well worth the read.  For those who like stories about the "little people" who win in life, this is for you!
This is yet another book about the Second World War, Hitler, and the Nazis in general.  The other books paint all Germans involved in the war effort as monsters of one sort or other.  Doerr's book is much more nuanced, showing the background and feelings of those who were swept up in the war effort.  It illustrates how people are much more complex than thought and what nobility is present even in one's enemies.  Simply and beautifully written.
This story was written from a completely different viewpoint than I have ever read before. The tale of how  One young man chooses the Third Reich over living in poverty and despair in the mines, vs  a young blind girl living in France during the war. The story of how their lives slowly wend toward each other is incredibly well told.  I have never read a story chronicling a boy's upbringing in the Nazi way. I couldn't put this one down.
I loved the short chapters , the back and forth of the characters and time periods. A must read .
It was a pleasure to read this story.  The entire book was superbly crafted with unique characters, amazingly detailed setting, and multiple themes.  The structure of alternating points of view and short scenes made it one I could take with me and read in short bites throughout the day like little pieces of a delicious cake.
Although I could tell where the book was heading, it was still an amazing book.  It was very well written and brought to life the realities of living through both the build up to the war in Germany and the experiences of the French as the war was heading to an end.  Personally, I think it would make a terrific movie.
Good summer read. Gets four stars because I thought I knew where it was going and I was wrong.
Been looking for a great summer read .........and this is it !!  Fascinating story and beautifully written.  I plan to go back and re-read and savor some of the "poetic" descriptions.  Makes me want to visit the setting.
Just made my top 10 list - but I can't remember who now makes #11!<br/>Set in Saint Malo, a medieval French town in the Brittany region, Northwest France on the English Channel which was almost entirely destroyed by fire in August, 1944.
I loved this book.  It was beautifully written, sad but hopeful, a wonderful story with characters and experiences that came to life.
I don't always enjoy books that have such a dependency on beautiful language because sometimes the story suffers. This book was the rare find that incorporates amazing language and a story to match. I highly recommend reading the gem of a novel.
Anthony Doerr draws you in from the instant you start reading it. His character development is fantastic. He gives life to each and every character; and at the end, you feel as if you know and understand them. It's also an excellent historic novel. Couldn't put it down.
Very good book.  I would love to see it made into a movie.  I was dissapointed in the ending and maybe the movie would change the ending.  I would also have liked to see the some of the characters more fully developed.  The book did put you in the frame of mind to appreciate the situations of the war.  The atrocities.  And who the blind really are.
Not another WWII book, but a well written romance. Family, love, life, it all come together in this amazing book. My iPad said I had 7 hours to finish if, and I did. Could not put it down. love it.
Fantastic, reads quickly with action, sentences are absolutely gorgeous. I stayed up all night to finish.  I love everything Doerr writes.
There was some historical accuracy in this novel.  But what was better is the view from those individuals who did not create the situation.
I was pulled along in this novel by the thick and rich story lines that were woven into an intricate narrative, with characters I cared about and loved.  The details--such as the broadcasts and the two gifts--tightened the warp and woof of this book.  I did not want it to end but I raced to the last page and then felt satisfied.
Characters came alive and places were very real. Brilliantly written. The story unfolds and the reader is propelled to the last pages of the book.
I read this book in two days. Historical fiction at its best. The characters and the poetic writing make the story come alive in so many ways.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it was so beautifully written.  It also gave a vivid picture of the life of a young German living through the Nazi indoctrination!  Each character was carefully delineated.  A great book to read.
The pictures it paints of the war and its price for 2 innocents tears the  heart and warms the soul.  A really goog book
Great book! Loved it. A real work of word art.
What a wonderful story.  Such a microcosm of thought and emotion blended together. My imagination flared with visual images and poignant feelings.  It gives one more than anything the scope of damage mankind can inflict on mankind and yet in the random infliction of pain the love that is intimately shared between like souls. Such a wonderful read.
Excellent  book detailing how war changes peoples' lives with particular attention on the two main characters and their struggles.  Life is reduced to the lowest common denominator,  which is daily survival.  The atrocities of the Third Reich and how they affected the French people  and  students in the German military school were painful to read.
Predictable plot about people struggling to survive Nazi occupation in WWII  The blind girl in the story received loving care and protection from people in her local communities, and she displayed a positive, cautious, intelligent way to survive.  I have read other more powerful stories about WWII that moved me to tears.  This was not one of them.
History is brought to life in this book with perspectives from so many different viewpoints. The characters, German and French, are very sympathetic. The reader is even given a hint of understanding and empathy for the Russian devils that make a brief but unforgettable appearance. Descriptive details and symbols of life and death enrich the story.
I enjoy reading books about this era.  I enjoyed reading this book although several times I was confused with all the jumping around by each character.  Anthony Doerr was very descriptive with each of the characters but at times it became boring.  But the story line was amazing and I would recommend this book to those who like to read about WW II.
This is a great book showing the contrast between the French & German people during WWII. It does a great job of giving the different perspectives of the average people in those countries during war time. The ending left me making up conclusions for the book & with a feeling of incompleteness. Perhaps that is the way war leaves people, incomplete!
This book was recommended by a friend, and because of my interest in war novels, I decided to give it a read. Story is beautiful despite its somber subject matter. Author captures the colors of feelings, ideas and thoughts and describes them beautifully. It's lovely to imagine what the world must "look" like to someone who cannot see. Lovely book.
I was really expecting a good read inasmuch as it has been on the New York Times Bestseller list for some time.  Frankly, it was somewhat disappointing.  I think women may enjoy it better.  Rather slow going, not great intrigue.  Character development OK, but not great.  The lives of the characters was really quite mundane.  I would not recommend.
This was an excellent book. Interesting story and with an unusual timeline for most of the book.  The characters were developed very well and the descriptions of things and places was really well done. Just enough but not too much.<br/>The only issue was the very end of the book. I wish there had been a bit more closure.<br/>Five stars for sure.
I read a few pages and put it aside for another book several times, which I NEVER do. His writing is very stylistic and it takes, at least it did for me, a while to really enjoy. So I write this review for one reason: if you are unsure, keep reading... you will end up loving it. True character development that stick with you and a beautiful story.
This book uses words to describe an entire universe occupied by a blind girl in France in the last days of WWII, a universe those of us who are sighted will never enter. The words used by the author in this book are beautifully constructed, using their meaning to describe her imagined experience. To me, they are words I wouldn't have heard before.
Really enjoyed this book . The story was interesting as it followed two children with different experiences, who non the less become inviolved  with nazi Germany. We follow them as the grow to adulthood and see how the War has shaped them and changed them. It also is  a good re minder  to ,note how much technology has changed in such a short time.
I love a book that takes me completely to another time and makes me pause and become thankful for my life. Loved the main character, loved that she could see better than me even though she was blind. Amazing characters. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was sometimes it got a little wordier than I prefer but really a great story above that.
Doerr is a master at creativity, style, prose, literature, history, mathematics, and science.  All of this is rolled up into one beautiful and powerful novel which demonstrates life's phenomenal way of bringing people together.  All the Light We Cannot See has so many levels of light mixed with extreme coincidences that seem to totally make sense.
This story was touching but it had some drawbacks. The changing of time frames , going back and forth with the characters' story lines caused some  disconnect. Characters depicted showed strength and resolve in trying to survive the cruelties of war. Showing both sides of those involved allowed the reader to experience the thought processes used.
One of the best books I have read in ages. If you want your heart ripped open- this is just for you. I've lived in Paris & visited Saint Malo many times, and the writer portrays a vivid portrait of both. Take another 10-15 years to write another masterpiece, or just bask in the glory of having brought so much beauty and raw emotions to the world.
Really grew attached to the characters even though a lot of the interactions were pretty normal. The writer does a great job putting you in the shoes of the two characters and what it would be like to be blind, and also what it feels like being caught up in something you have no control over. Overall I really liked the book and enjoyed reading it
This was the best book I have read in years.  I couldn't put it down  for long.  I could never anticipate what would happen next.  It was a novel, but certainly true to life.  The story is of a blind French girl and a poverty stricken German boy in the pre World War ll years and throughout the war.  Exciting and beautifully written.  A must read.
It was a wonderful experience reading this book. Each character was fully drawn. This was the first book I have read about wwII that allowed us to learn different sides, other victims who lived through it. I was waiting to learn how Marie Laurie and Werner's paths would cross.<br/>Each sentence was filled with language that made the story vivid!
While I appreciated the journey, I felt the constant shifting between so many characters and places made it difficult to follow and therefore easy to put down at times. Vivid descriptions made for masterful mental images - I think it was just a pacing issue. And a length issue. Just not enough suspense to keep me turning the pages in one sitting.
Great literature it is not;however, it's a riveting story that gives the reader much food to ponder. Part of my enchantment was that I am familiar with St. Malo and the natural history museum in Paris so could conjure up the images depicted in the novel. I 'd say this a great cold winter's night read.<br/><br/>Diane Cobb Cashman, wilmington, NC
His way of writing keeps you both in the rich present of the page and also yearning to know what's ahead. A book that makes fresh a part of history we've heard so much about already, not because he is able to enter the mind of a blind person effectively, but also because he presents us with two people for whom this whole experience is so bizarre.
I could not wait for this book to end as I found it exhausting to get through.  It took me months to finish and that's very unusual for me. I did not like changing stories every 1-2 pages and would have liked more continuity.  I'm reluctant to give it 1 star so I'm giving it 2.
Magnificent! My student started the semester by telling me she was rereading a book she had just finished. I was intrigued. She said she became confused because she did not keep track of the dates as this goes back and forth in the story. Intrigued, I read it and had everyone I know read it. Many gifts sent. Did I say this is a magnificent book?
This story seems too real to be called fiction.<br/>There are so many wonderful and complicated elements to this read that i was left holding my breath from one chapter to the next.<br/>I read a wide variety of works and authors, and can honestly say this ranks at the top of my great reads list.<br/>I will definitely read more of this author.
The World War years as seen through the eyes of a young German boy and a young French girl.  This book will maintain your interest to the last page.  The author makes the characters in the book come alive with the quality of his writing.  The story follows the characters from the Middle 1930s through the end of the war.<br/><br/>Richard Ruppel
This is a great book that made me realize how brave the French underground was and the ending was very moving. It also made the case that war is pointless and absurd.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was a little too detailed as others have mentioned.  But it's not a book to ignore because it's beautifully written and it has a nice story line.
This book was beautiful and I totally see how it made it on various lists for one of the best books of the year. It is written with very short, but descriptive chapters, which make it a great read before going to sleep as I like to do most nights. The prose is both intriguing and poetic, while still being very descriptive and moving. I loved it!
Doerr succeeds in evoking the time with beautiful language and memorable characters. I felt like I was there. So many books have dealt with the politicians and generals of World War II, it's delightful to read one that tells the stories of ordinary people struggling with hardship and loss thrust upon them by the ugliness and meanness of the war.
Unexpectedly, I liked this book.. What I liked most was the author's style, both the melody of the language and the use of imagery. The plot moves back and forth in time so that the reader sees a result before the cause which may make it confusing, but also propels the story forward. The emotional development of the main characters is done well.
I cannot recommend this book any more than has already been said. It touched my heart deeply. I have not read anything else that so perfectly captures humanity at its worst (World Wars will do that). ATLWCS also illuminates surviving through atrocities and challenges unimaginable, and our human condition to forgive and move on. Loved this book.
If I had Doerr's gift of language I would be able to express how absolutely wonderful I found this book to be, but I can't find the right words. I can only say All the Light We Cannot See is hauntingly beautiful, heart-wrenching, poignant, unforgettable, and I will read it again and again. Thank you, Anthony Doerr for this literary masterpiece.
A very interesting book.  One problem for me is that I'm not a very visual person and the author spent much time describing the environments the protagonists were in and I couldn't see them in my mind's eye.  That's ironic since one of the two main characters is blind!  But most people are visually oriented and I think they would like the book.
Youngsters are the center of this story with many unanswered questions through the end. For those of us who are still trying to learn more about the times and how ordinary people survived WWII this book shows yet another aspect of life then. Surviving is one thing and then to go on is another matter all together. Well written and worth reading.
Really Enjoyed this book. Steady paced and every chapter was left with a cliff hanger and I stopped myself many times from reading until my eyes hurt .Personally, the Only negative for me ( don't hate me), I felt like there should have been more of a resolve at the end. It ended quite abruptly.<br/><br/>A book i would definitely recommend it!
Read this in two days, couldn't put it down. Loved the back and forth view point between characters.  Seemed quite plausible as to most of the events occurring during the Second World War, excellent research on the writer's part. Felt myself in the shoes of both main characters at various points in the story.  Very touching, well written story.
The characters were so very alive as I was transported to their time, understanding the longings, deep frustrations, and pain. While there is a great sadness with a story set during the time of the waning years of WW II, this is not a war story, but a story of the people affected buy it and endured it. Such strength and resolve was captivating!
I tend to compare this book with "Book Thief" because both books narrate wartime stories in Germany. Ordinary but gifted children are protagonists, though this book shows French side story as well. Both books are well written to observe war from the viewpoint of the ordinary people. I will give "Book Thief" a little more points.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was very well written and the story line was very interesting.I liked the characters and felt the author gave very insightful details about how a blind person could cope in her environment and presented approach to the German situation during the war. This book had some very unusual facets to the plot.
Although I initially had a hard time getting into the story, I'm so glad I stuck with it. It painted such an intensely personal picture of life during wartime, both as part of occupied France as well as one of the young German operatives. The characters became real people as I was reading it.  Even the ending was well thought out and unhurried.
This book is a page turner.  It's insight into the mentality that overtook Germany and allowed the horror of Naziism to dominate the nation is unequaled by anything else I've read--metaphors for blindness compared to the metaphors for sight as exemplified by the radio waves and the literal blindness of the French girl.  The book is a wonderful.
Fantastic read!  I was so engrossed that I could not put the book down.  Used it for our church book club last month and what a hit.  Everyone was so involved as to what the main female character should or could have done to right the wrong.  There were those that did not agree with the final decision for the child but understood the reasoning.
Sigh. The characters have my heart and I am certain I will think of them often as if they were truly people I had known. A true hero of historical fiction, I found myself learning more about events in history I thought I already knew as much as I could know about from All the Light We Cannot See. This novel is now one of my all-time favorites.
I really enjoyed the book, in fact I picked this particular book for our book club and we are reviewing it on 9/24/15, and I am looking forward to hearing what the ladies thought about this book.  We have some highly intelligent professors and other professional ladies in this group.  I really wish something good could have happened to Werner.
Mr. Doerr has written a tour de force. Just when I thought that I could not read one more book with a World War II theme, this book came along with it's lofty reviews. Every time I picked it up, I was in awe of his turn of phrase and the ability to evoke an uncanny depth of feeling, ranging from soaring optimism and admiration to deep despair.
I usually have "problems "with the prize winners, more often than not wondering what the judges saw - not in this case however!<br/>This book is thoroughly worthy of the Pulitzer, a great story beautifully written, it keeps you engrossed from start to finish.<br/>(I think it helped to be reading it as I was travelling around Europe.)
This was one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  I thought I was "WWIIed out," but this was a fresh take on a WWII novel that was so beautifully written with such amazing detail that I felt I could have been in the story myself. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good story, great characters and exceptional writing.
Amazing book that reads like a puzzle. As soon as I finish typing, I'm going back through to find all the pieces and patterns. Mr. Doerr writes so beautifully, with such compassion and artistry. This book is a gem and would make an incredible movie, although only frequent voice over could do the beautiful prose like poetry justice. A treasure.
I've been trying to find some good fictional WW2 books to possibly have my kids read with the intention of stimulating their interest in learning more of the actual history. This story told primarily through the eyes of two children is perfect.  It was both a page turner for myself and I think will be a great educational tool for them as well.
This is the BEST book I've read recently.  Despite the feeling that the reader is pulled into the continually declining conditions of World War II Germany and France, I didn't want the book to end.  This book should become required reading for high school students since it provides informing perspectives on many levels.  It's perfectly titled.
Great book.  Interesting, well-developed characters.  A look at Europe during World War II that seem to come through the eyes of children, but really is much deeper and meaningful than that would seem to indicate. The blind French girl and the orphan German boy show us the devastation of war and also the necessity of standing up against evil.
I loved the way the book took something we know and read so much about, WWII, and gives us a different perspective from a German boy who grows up during Hitler's rise and is forced into Hitler's military, and ties his story in with a blind French girl. It's a beautiful and sad story of the love of family and the destruction brought on by war.
Very entertaining.  I did not want to stop reading at any point.<br/>Very well written!  I liked the way the author shifted the characters' stories and periods in time from chapter.  I recommend this book to everyone.  He personalized historical actions as they relate to the characters in the book.<br/>The ending was an unexpected surprise.
Beautifully written - but I still don't know if I liked this book.  It kept my interest,  had compelling characters and was well-written.  I don't know what I was supposed to take away from this story.  War is evil and stupid.  Certainly! Even among evil there are good hearts.  Yes.  But some message, some lesson alluded me.  Oh well ........
It took a while to get used to the flow of the chapters. It kept moving back and forth between two separate characters. The suffering during WWII for Europe is unimaginable! An even worse for a blind girl coming into her own without her father. Leaders should take the time to relive history before they make quick decisions about going to war!
It goes without saying, the details in this book are amazing!  I wanted to love it more based on all of the great reviews.  For me, I needed a faster pace.  I would have stopped reading if it hadn't been a book club read.  It's such lovely book and so beautifully written.  It's like reading a landscape, beautiful but not necessarily exciting.
A beautifully written story about two very interesting young people who were different,but also alike in some ways, during a difficult time in wartime Europe.  I read the book on my kindle, but plan to get the hard copy to have in my library.  I also plan to give this book to one of my granddaughters who is in college.  She will love it also.
A fascinating study of characters woven into the backdrop of WWII. Wonderfully written and holds your attention through the trials of two main characters facing the challenges of growing up in a violent world. The plot also includes a mystery. A memorable journey into European history. This book should be on everyone's list; not to be missed.
A wonderfully written story focusing on the lives of two young people in Europe during WWII.  Well-developed characters that include others close to and impacted by the main characters.  Not a 'war story', but a story of people and their lives during impossible times.  If you enjoy a good story with good characters, you will enjoy this story.
Not quite five stars. This author paints a picture. A beautiful picture of courage and bravery, and an ugly, bleak picture of World War Europe. Some loose ends.... or hidden ends. Where is the diamond? If it's where I think it is, why in the hell is it THERE? Unsatisfying ending for Marie-Laure, but what a fantastic character. Worth the read.
Long, multi-layered, and beautifully crafted; this novel is one I will definitely read again. If you enjoy historical fiction, you will definitely enjoy this novel. But it is so much more than that. A compelling story, an extended metaphor, a look at the horrors of war from all sides, a meditation on life. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
One of the best books I have read! A page turner. If you don' t want your emotions stirred don't read this book. The chapters are short which I liked (other's did not). I finished it several weeks ago and am still thinking about some of the situations and especially the main characters. I miss them. Well written, I will reread it again later.
One of the best books of the year- beautifully crafted- only negative is a relatively weak ending.  Supposedly took the author 10 yrs to write this book & it shows- wonderfully drawn characters and vivid descriptions.  Just wish the author had taken the same care and time that the rest of the book received to craft a more satisfactory ending.
I love the writing..... The way the words are put together. My parents were holocaust survivors and never spoke of their escape from vienna and London. It gives me insight of these youngsters who were about the same age as my parents. I have just downloaded Rome by Doerr. Thank you for such a lovely literary mind enhancing book. At area fritz
If you like historical fiction, you will love this book.  It's a different twist on a World War Two tale.  Told from the perspective of a young blind girl in Paris and a young orphan boy in Germany, you see how many different people were victims of the Nazis.  This would be a great read for a book club, as it would inspire a great discussion.
This book gave me a different point of view of WWII. The characters were average people going about their daily lives. The museum worker who's daughter slowly lost her sight, the orphan brother and sister, the veteran of the first war who never went outside. Their lives were irreversibly altered, their paths crossing in a fight for survival.
Effective and entertaining door into WW II through young, blind, French girl and young German boy…<br/>I liked everything about the writing except the jumping back and forth in time…The different voices<br/>were well done and the minor characters had important, colorful parts, esp the Bad Guy. Poetic, magic<br/>aspect, too, was enjoyable!
Anthony Doerr is an amazing writer.  It took me awhile to really get into the story, but then I was hooked,  A different perspective of the war in the way the story was told.  Very different from most books I have read.  I felt myself right in the middle of the scene, it was so perfectly described.  It also reminds one of the horrors of war.
This is a MUST read- captivating from the first page, and tells the story of the horrors the Nazis inflicted on millions of people thru the stories of two young people- a young blind girl in Paris and an orphan boy in Germany- both have amazing gifts and their stories and become intertwined toward the end of the book. I couldn't put it down!
Brilliant!  Didn't want to put it down.The story evoked all of my emotions and all of my senses.  I love Marie-Laure and Werner who lived in heart wrenching circumstances.  The reader experiences the best and worst of mankind. The author, Anthony Doerr, paints a magnificent canvas with delicate, as well as broad strokes of descriptive words.
I thought this was an amazing story. A bit too wordy, lyrical and poetic for my taste but I was able to easily skim through all of that. 500 pages may seem a bit much with the very short chapters and easily skimming through the wordy parts it was an easy read. It was very hard to get into at first until you really get to know the characters.
Well written novel that sheds light on what went on in the minds of young people during the War. Some eye-opening revelations as to the emotional conflicts especially from the enemy point of view. The jumping back and forth timewise sometimes was confusing expecially if you didn't read it all at once, though. But definitely worth picking up.
Lyrical and engrossing storytelling; I re-read many passages to savor the remarkable ways Mr. Doerr crafts his sentences and paragraphs. At the same time I wanted to keep moving forward to discover the outcome of each character's journey. A book well-deserving of the praise received from professional critics as well as so many other readers.
A glimpse into World War Two through two very young, brave and very different people. A Parisian blind girl and a German boy who knows everything about radios. Their stories happen during the same time periods and the touch ever so briefly in a way that will make you think about the complexity and the simpleness of life.<br/>Read this book.
All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr: Dark, strange, beautiful, evocative, heartbreaking, human, playful, teasing, devastating, stark. This novel pulled me every which way. It's breadth and depth is astounding. Though the action is simple, each page is thick with ideas. There is so much detail here to ponder, to discuss. A must read.
Amazing.  Best book to come along in a while.
So beautifully written it hurts.  Pure prose.
Not a problem with anything I have purchased.
This was extremely well written and riveting.
All the Light We Cannot See is an excellent book.  I highly recommend this read.  It is a mystery, a romance, and an exploration of a different perception of life.  It is beautifully interwoven to tell the story moving back and forth through time.  The characters are strong and the reader is able to understand where that strength came from.
I cannot review this book because I never received the ebook on my Kindle device; I cannot find anyplace that I can report this information successfully.  The price of the book was deducted from my gift card, but the book did not arrive.  Hopefully someone can contact me to remedy this issue, because it has never been a problem in the past.
This is one of the most affecting novels I've ever read! A master piece. It should have won the National Book Award. It is: excellent, artistic, brilliant, intricate, a tour de force, original, with memorable, vivid characters and events. It evokes the great tragedy of WW II, on a very personal level, and perhaps the tragedy of life itself.
This was a wonderful book with amazing characters, pieces of history and a great story line. It did not have the ending I was hoping for but isn't that part of the fun when you read books? You know you are totally absorbed in it when you start empathizing and hoping for the outcome you want for these fictional characters.  A very good read.
Excellent, this book captures the imagination very quickly, my wife is reading it now and can't seem to put it down. The depth of detail of life in the late 1930's to the end of  World War II from  Eastern Germany to Paris and Western France is brought directly to the reader and become a light that allows one to see another side of the war.
Mr. Doer managed the nearly impossible with his interspersion of a soft, delicious and moving narrative juxtaposed against  an incredible dark and dismal background.  This first and foremost a story of unbelievable courage and the waste of war.  A vivid picture, too, of just what propaganda can accomplish.  My favorite read in a long time.
There is a great analogy between the world the little girl used to know (thanks to her father) and the world that has been destroyed, both physical and culturally. It is hard to talk about this book without giving away plot details, but it is both fascinating and terrifying to watch these two work their way closer and closer to each other.
Although difficult to follow the writing style initially, once I got the hang of it, it was a fantastic book to read. One of the few wartime books that made it very real for me. The characters were complex and the lead characters likeable. I loved reading about St. Malo during the war and the horrific times war bestowed on its inhabitants.
Beautiful, incredibly well told story of a French girl, a German boy, and a mystical, priceless diamond in the ruins of their world. You'd think by now we'd all be hardened to the descriptions of war-the chaos, bloodshed, depravity and evil - but this book plows new ground. Memorable characters in a world gone mad make this a special read.
Though it took me about 100 pages to really get into this book, I actually enjoyed the story and the rest of the book. The story is a bit slower paced than I like, but the characters are well-developed and lovable. The ending is definitely bittersweet, some of the events I was upset by, but overall, it is a great story with great messages.
All the Light We Cannot See is a story of World War Two.  I have read lots of books on this subject, but the characters in this book really grabbed me.  It was a real testimony of how strong people can be during trying and dangerous times.  I wish it could have ended well for both of the two main characters, but the ending was appropriate.
I purchased this book solely because of the reviews.  All The Light We Cannot See is beautifully written however, I've only given it 3 stars because:  The first half is wonderful, but sadly the second half gets somewhat dull... and for me the ending was disappointing. Simply put... it was a good book, but doesn't deserve more than 3 stars.
This novel is so beautiful, flowing and feeling that I'm sad I have finished it.  Truly a work of art.  You live in their lives, feel their feelings and thots.<br/>Always delighted to find such a brilliant literary creation........what a beautiful mind created this story using the pages of history, developing living, breathing characters.
Excellent WWII novel.  I was reluctant to read yet another WWII story but this pulled me in completely.  The author focuses on a particular occupied French city, telling the story through a blind girl who has fled Paris to live with her uncle.  The other main character is a mechanically gifted German boy.  Eventually their stories collide.
This is simply a magnificent book,  a special event in a long lifetime of reading. The writing is superb, the whole book is compelling,I read everyday in every spare hour for a whole week. Very exciting, wise and with great insight. I bought two copies, and already they have left me, am suffering until at least one is returned.Jean Elliott
One of the best-written books I have read in a long time.  Other reviewers have outlined the story so I won't repeat it all, except to say that this is a remarkable tale that is well worth reading. WWII is a necessary backdrop to the experiences of the young people but it is not a war story like so many others.  Read it, read it, read it!!
I couldn't put the book down until the last 50 pages. Then I didn't want to read because it would soon be over.  Loved the structure of following 2 11 yr old children, one French the other German, who did not know one another until they were 17/18.  Book paralleled their lives as WWII began.  Reminded me of "Stones From the River."
Fantastic. I downloaded the first chapter to my Kindle and knew IMMEDIATELY that this book was something special. I received the hard copy as a gift. Everyone has pretty much said everything there is to say about this book, but I just wanted to say that books like this are why you read. Why you love reading. I didn't want this book to end.
I love when an author writes so vividly, that the story actually takes place in your head; like a 5 star movie. Sights, colors, sounds come alive in this book. The characters have personalities that jumped off the page. I hope a director/producer somewhere in Hollywood is thinking about turning this into a movie; I'll be the first in line.
So well written.  The story of all the characters is beautifully weaved together in this novel taking place during WWII. The epilogue gave me a glimpse into what life 30 years after the war was probably really like for many Germans that I never contemplated before this.<br/>You will not regret reading the story of Marie-Laure and Werner.
This novel about WWII from the viewpoints of the citizens of Germany and France (primarily) is well deserving of the awards it has won.  The story is compelling, poignant, revealing, and lodges itself in one's mind for a long time after the reading is completed.  The violence has mild allusions to the actual horrors of this egregious war.
This book is well written and thought out. I loved how the author wove the story between the main characters which takes place over nine decades. As I read I could see in my minds eye the architecture, events and the characters in the book. Furthermore having most recently been in Paris, I appreciated the descriptions of places I visited.
Beautifully written historical fiction .<br/>Strong characters.  Chapters alternate from multiple narrators which can be confusing at times but gives many perspectives whiich strengthens the story.<br/>A must read if you enjoy a solid story that is true to life in terms of it's mix of  love, joy, and the harsh realities of life and war.
This book took me longer to read than any other book in my life! Tried to read 5% a night and it took me over 3 weeks to finish it. Usually I finish a book in 2-3 days. Doesn't grasp you, doesn't hold your attention, I just wanted to finish it. Ending was Ho hum. Thought it would be amazing from all the great reviews. Sorely disappointed.
I originally bought this as an audiobook. I loved it so much, I went back and bought the hardcopy. When I finished it, I bought another and sent it to my family. It is an amazing book that follows several characters through WWII. It is brilliantly told from many different perspectives. You cannot help but care (or despise) the characters.
This is not just another story about World War II. It is a story about both the resiliency and fraility of human beings during the upheavals of war. While neither Marie Laure and Werner had any control over their circumstances, both were able to connect on a very human level to impact the lives of those around them.  Very compelling tale.
Rarely does one find such a book as this.  To give a rating of 5 stars doesn't begin to reach the depths that this story deserves.  I can only say this:  read this and know you will never forget it.  That you will be left uplifted and more aware than ever of the preciousness of life and the untold bravery and goodness of a thousand souls.
This book is literary in the best ways, rich with the symbolism of light, in a tale that rings tender and true.  The story feels almost magical, despite being set against the harsh landscape of World War II.  Its heroes are awed by the wonders of science and nature, while enduring horrors wholly man-made.  Soul touching and unforgettable!
Beautifully written narrative, set in WWII in both Germany and France.  The novel actually merges the lives of two young people as they move into adulthood during a brutal war that affects each of them in unique and personal ways. Emotionally absorbing and full of creative twists. This book is about war on the human level. Excellent read.
This book was so beautifully written, it was a joy to read.  The characters were well-developed and I found their stories engaging and uplifting.  It was interesting to see WW II from both sides of the French/German conflict.  I appreciated that some of the difficult things were not sugar-coated, even though it is sad to read about them.
One of the best books I have read in a very long time.  It is set in  both France and Germany at the beginning of the 2nd world war, as experienced by a young blind French girl and a German Boy.  The characters are fully developed and the story, while complex has fascinating twists and turns.  Doerr is a wonderful writer.<br/>Deborah P.
This is a novel that engaged me totally. The story weaves history, science, art and literature through the lives of endearing, well developed characters surviving the invasion of France.  Mr. Doerr really sparked my curiosity, prompted me to research and google the details of  locations and historical details, and gave me many pauses for
This is a complicated book set in a complicated time, beautifully written. The double points of view of the boy and girl give an expansive look at what it must have been like to live inside World War II. They may be on opposite sides but there is more that they share than divides them. It's a fascinating read and I strongly recommend it.
One of the best books I have read. Loved the style of writing in this story. Doerr's description of Laure's "vision" of the world was compelling. Great moments along with sad and frightening ones that were written so well you felt like you were watching it unfold. Highly recommend this book; no "happy" sappy endings here.
Rather long and confusing in the beginning…they keep jumping from persons and time frames.  But once you figure out who's who…it becomes and amazing tale..with amazing people in the same time frame.  It starts pre WW2 in Paris with a very you little blind girl and her loving father, and continues thru the way and beyond.  Very good book.
One of, if not the, finest written book/s I've read all year.  It's a beautifully crafted WWII story with well-defined characters and numerous metaphors to the invisible types of magic in our lives, from the radio, to all the goodness in mankind even in times of ugly war.  A must-read for anyone who loves the best of literary literature.
I did not expect much of this book, but I love to be proven wrong!  The author has written an engaging book which addresses a period of history which has been exhaustively (and often redundantly) portrayed in written fiction and film.  This book provides great character development and a perspective which is fresh and compelling.  Enjoy!
I loved this story up to the point where Marie-Laure and Werner separated. All the after war follow-up was a great disappointment. The cliche-driven rape of Jutta and the others by Russians was completely unnecessary. It seemed like Doerr was hurrying to get it done. I wish he had stopped as Werner watched Marie-Laure fade into the fog.
This is a very thoughtful novel.  The story is allegorical, with engaging writing.  While seemingly plot driven, the novel is thematically complex, and I found the ending surprising and beautiful.  I found the themes of connection; fear and hiding;  and the impacts we unknowingly have on others thought provoking and well worth the read.
I read this for a book club, and was sort of dreading reading historical fiction.  But after I started, I completely changed my mind.  The style of the writing was remarkable, and pulled you in.  I was also skeptical of it turning into a cheesy romance.. but he avoided any cheesiness as well.  Now one of my favorite books.  I recommend!
I loved the book. The book is set in the World War II era. The book is more than 500 pages. The book's  context goes back-and-forth in time, so you need to remain patient while reading the book. Otherwise you may miss important storylines. Read it for the story told through the eyes of a blind girl and a boy who was forced into the war.
This novel is so well written that it seems you are there and KNOW these characters.  A really good story about what happens to real people in war time.  The tragedy and helplessness of ordinary folks while war just rolls over them.  I feel as though the author researched  World War II extensively.  I recommend this novel to everyone !
Brilliant writer, I found this book was a profound experience and I recommend it to lovers of amazingly good literature. It gave me a greater understanding of how  people lived and died in WW2 and in particular what it was like for the occupied countries. Anthony has woven a true masterpiece - it will live in my heart and mind forever.
A most interesting novel based on the French resistance to the Germany's invasion in the late 1930s and early 1940s from which you realize how little our human senses perceive all that is going on around us.  My only reservation is I  personally would have preferred that the author not have many so many time jumps in telling the story.
Very interesting storyline and well written. The book goes at a good pace - not too fast but not slow either. Despite having read books and seen movies about WWII, this story felt fresh and one isn't quite sure where the story is headed or where the characters will end up. Loved it and have already recommended it to family and friends.
Every once in a while there's a book that better than most other books out there and this one is in that category.  The characters and situations are suspenseful and steady at the same time.  The characters are lovable, hateful and lovable at the same time in some cases.  It left me thinking and it left me sorry it was over.  Loved it.
This was the most beautifully written and intriguing story I have read in many years! It is always fascinating to read about the Nazi era but this one focuses on a blind girl and an orphan  boy who is an electronics expert and a member of the Hitler Youth. Neither is what you would expect and their paths cross in a most unexpected way.
Definitely one of the best books I have ever read!  A humane and sympathetic treatment of very human characters caught up in various complexities of an insanely inhumane war.  Once you start reading "All the Light...", it will grab your heart, your mind, and your soul and you will not be able to put it down until you finish it.
A beautifully written book which also had an intrrigueing story. You saw the world as the blind girl and appreciated her difficulties in a changing ,dangerous world. The story of the two young people , one French and one German during World War 2 has the quality of a modern day Grimm's fairytale . An excellent read from start to finish
The story line is good, however it took awhile to build up the characters, to the point where I almost lost interest.  I'm glad I stuck with it as it began to gather steam about 1/3 of the way through.  Reminded me how lucky I am that I have not experienced the human tragedy known to so many who lived through and survived World War II.
Beautifully written story. The characters were so individualized, they became part of my heart. Thankful that there was an epilogue set several years after WWII because it was the ending I wanted to see. The plot and descriptions of a German school for boys, contrasted with the French setting of a German occupied village by the sea was great reading. The story is about a German orphan boy and his experiences during World War II as a radio technician in occupied France where he meets the other main character, Laure, who is a blind child living with an eccentric uncle. This book was our book club selection for February, and it was deemed one of our best selections.
It is 4 am and I now am able to sleep as I have finished devouring this book. What a great read, the characters and their experiences were amazing. I feel very blessed to have discovered this book and been able to enjoy it, almost as if it was a gift. Very seldom do I find stories such as this, ones that I don't want to end. Thank you!
This is an amazing, captivating historical fiction book with heartfelt emotions coming from the characters.  You want to read from start to finish, but also want to savor the well written descriptions of people, places and the events surrounding World War ll Germany and France.<br/>I've told all my friends this is a winner manuscript.
I enjoy World War II novels very much and his was no exception.  The author cleverly told the story of a young French blind girl and an orphaned German boy.  You saw the war through the eyes of both children as they lived through the early years of World War II through the occupation of France by the Germans and the liberation in 1944.
This book opened up a lot of occurrences during WWII that civilians (especially American civilians) don't know, such as how the boys were trained to be Nazi soldiers and the activities of the French underground.  The characters are intriguing.  Mr. Doerr has a fine command of language that brings the reader into the story beautifully.
This was a hard book to review. It was so interesting, especially in the beginning. I had great hopes it would join the group of my favorite books. Maybe my lack of knowledge of some of the Nazi goings on made it difficult to understand. It seemed to me that all of a sudden the book just ended with so many unanswered questions for me.
This book kept me reading on and on, becoming fully engrossed in the story of how the main characters (children and adults) are involved in World War 2. Writing is excellent and makes for compelling reading. Although a dark subject, you feel part of the characters' lives as the author moves backwards and forwards during the war years.
This book is full of vivid descriptions through the eyes of the young blind girl thanks to her beloved father.  It is interesting to see how the two parallel stories involving the girl and a young man are going to converge.  All this set with the background of war makes for suspense, cruelty on several levels, grief and familial love.
This is a wonderful book about youths in Europe during World War II.  It is as much a book about coming of age under difficult circumstances as it is about the war.  The descriptions of the scenes are rich and the story seems realistic. It did not end with a neat and tidy happily ever ending that I expected, which made it even better.
Marie-Laure and Werner are two exceptional children each part of opposite sides of WWII. Anthony Doerr's beautiful writing, allows us to glimpse the horrors of war from the eyes of these two innocents and trace the war's ugly path through their sweetness, their fear and their conviction to restore order and humanity. Loved every word.
Exceedingly well written, with superb characterization, but  it dragged and I found myself skipping pages. The storyline was not strong and wandered at times, and I wondered sometimes what it was all about. It was probably an accurate representation of Europe at the time of WWII, but when the story finished, I asked myself 'so what?'.
This book is quite simply, wonderful. The characters are expertly drawn and the story beckons you in, before you know it. I had a very difficult time putting this book aside, to get on with my work!! Anthony Doerr has a gift with words and paints the most glorious pictures in your mind. I would highly recommend this book. A must read!
Couldn't wait to see what would happen to the characters next! Even though the general outline of the actual historical events is well known, it was intriguing to see how these characters would fare. Some events made me very sad & some made me cheer. Well written, well -rounded characters. Can't wait to have this Book Club discussion!
My Book of the Year choice.<br/>I could feel the cold, the fear, the hunger, the love of a caring father as he taught his blind daugher at an early age how to survive in case she lost her father, how to memorize the steps to escape if neded, how to decipher the code he hid knowing one day this would be very important to her survival.
This is a great book. The story, the setting, and the characters are outstanding. Set during WWII, the inevitable moral judgements are nuanced and not preachy. The main characters are a blind French girl and a German radio technician, but the author skillfully avoids the trap of stereotyping and caricature. All in all a terrific read.
Absolutely loved this book.  It took me a bit of time to catch on to the time flow as it goes back and forth in time periodically. But that was my issue, not the book's!  It was fascinating to read/hear the perspectives and stories of the lives of the two main characters and the impact of the war on them.  I highly recooend this book!
This was an interesting read viewing 2 young people victimized  by both sides during WW II. The ending left me pondering "the ending". I was expecting something different, but I guess it touched a part that helped me realize, in a new way, the confusion and discord of real people in the midst of their lives after such a terrible war.
I absolutely loved this book.  An original story that completely pulls you in and gives an inside perspective of life for young people caught in the horrors of WWII.  It's the heart and the perseverance of two young people, that don't even know each other and are on opposite sides of the war, that let you still have hope for mankind.
It has been a long, long time since I've read such beautiful writing. The Pulitzer Prize is deserving, for sure, and FYI, we chose to read the book way before the prize was announced. I am in two book clubs: the dilemma is what can we possibly read NOW after All the Light We Cannot See? Anthony Doerr has spoiled us, and we thank him!
One of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. The sensitivity and beauty of the writing brought me to tears, I wanted it to never end.  You will inhabit the lives of these characters and fall in love with them. A must read for any novel lover.  My Book Club is reading it this month and I can't wait to hear their comments.
I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. The character development was so rich and the storyline so intriguing. It was very difficult to stop reading as you kept wanting to find out if Marie-Laure would survive and if she and Werner would ever connect. I would definitely read another book by this author.
Thought provoking and emotionally stirring.  The characters are engaging and relatable, and as I read I had no idea how things would turn out. which is something that sometimes does not occur as often as I would like.  Only wish it were longer, more detailed, following lives after the war ended.  A page turner, couldn't put it aside.
This was a very good book of the World War II genre, but from the perspective of a blind French girl and an orphaned boy, both geniuses in their own way. Easy reading on a touchy subject even after all these years. The ending, though not a compete surprise, was sad/satisfying and very different. I highly recommend reading this novel.
This book was great! I love books about WWII and this did not disappoint. Great character development and the story does not seem rushed or drag at all. Wonderful job tying the loose ends; sometimes authors spend great time in developing the book but close it out in about two pages which did not happen here. Highly suggest this book.
A beautifully written book and a good story.
Intriguing plot.  Great characters.  Unusual
Good story, well written but badly organized
I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written and the story line was beautiful.  The development of the characters gave a new picture into the lives of 2 young people during WW2.  I was able to see the humanity in the young German soldier and how war devastates in ways that are not always apparent. I strongly recommend this book.
I purchased this book solely because I ran out of options from my usual action genres and it was recommended on Amazon.  Beautifully written.  I felt like I had an emotional bond with the characters,  and I was sad when the book ended.  This book has left me thinking about it weeks after I read the last page.  I highly recommend it.
World War Two and Germany's atrocities will forever haunt civilization. "All the Light We Cannot See" illuminates the humanity that war seeks to destroy.  An elusive diamond is used as a metaphor in this novel to illustrate the lasting beauty of life and the hellfire that surrounds it.  A blind girl, herself a gem, shows us the way.
I rarely read a book so richly and elegantly written.  It is a great story that you can barely put down. The characters are intriguing and credible and I loved the combination of history and marine biology that was woven in with the story.  Truly a must-read.  I have written six books and I am envious of this authors supreme talent!
I'm about 75% of the way through, and figured I would write my review before I finish to make sure I don't give anything away.  The book is not what I expected, and it is wonderful.  A great story, great background, history and geography, nice short chapters, very interesting style of writing.  Now I'll go back and finish reading...
The book had special meaning for me on many levels.  Much of the material mirrored experiences in my own life, having been born in Germany and visiting St. Servant and Mont St. Michel in my teens.The writing was written by a true artist, I am grateful for the beauty of his words and how the story flowed so gracefully for the reader.
As people  careen closer and collide  into each other's worlds.  The stark beauty of life in a war are played out in aching fashion  and the painful childhood view makes war  seem chaotic and nonsensical even while people survive.<br/>I had trouble setting this story aside,even dreaming of the children after I had finish the tales.
I thought the novel started out a little slow but definitely improved as I continued. The reader soon sympathized with both of the children and the awful circumstances that surrounded their lives. The brutality of the SS military school and the sacrifices of so many innocents made it the subject of nightmares. Don't read before bed.
This is one of the best written books I have read in a long time. The subject is interesting as it gives the perspective of two people unwittingly caught up in a war that neither of them felt strongly about or really understood.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction and great character development.
I'm not one to embrace war stories, but because this was my book club's choice, I reluctantly read it. To my surprize, the many twists and turns kept me anticipating "what's next". The characters are extremely complex and interesting. The war was a blurred backdrop to the intricate development of the characters. I loved it.
All The Light We Cannot See is so well written and so well crafted that I didn't want it to end. That is the test of good literature; it's why the ancient classics were so long. People just kept adding on to them so they could postpone the ending. That's the way I felt about this wonderful work. I'm ready to start reading it again!
This book won the Pulitzer Prize, and has been on the Best Seller list for over 50 week, where it is likely to remain for some time to come.  It is a compelling read, almost impossible to put down, beautifully written, with well-imagined characters, details of historical, philosophical and scientific significance.  One not to miss!
A literary masterpiece. I am a fast reader but I lingered over this book , never wanting to rush, even re reading  especially beautiful sentences or descriptions, marveling at this  writer's huge talent .  The day I finished it , reluctantly I might add, it won the Pulitzer Prize.  A well deserved award for a stunning  achievement.
This is the best book I have read in many years.  It accomplishes a profound reach across boundaries of all kinds.  The voices are authentic.  It is a story of the wrenches and outreaches of war, the cruelties and the kindnesses.
It's well written but not particularly thought provoking or engrossing.  It certainly doesn't tackle any big ideas, at least not to the point you feel they're being tackled with any skill or vigor.<br/><br/>This book is what way, way too much fiction written by males is lately:  Refined and spotless instead of valuable or durable.<br/><br/>All skill; little talent.  MFA fiction.
It's been a long time since I've had this since about a book... I couldn't put it down but I didn't want to see it end.  The images, the feelings, the horror and the beauty.<br/><br/>I don't know if Americans will ever know how a war can impact a land or culture until it's been fought on their homeland. This book captures it all.
A wonderful book. One of its main themes is how people in difficult situations end up doing things they don't feel right about but simply want to improve their lives. Another is the ability of children to deal with circumstances they find themselves in through no fault of their own. It's a wonderful read about life and being human.
It was difficult for me to put the book down.  I especially liked how the story was written using both characters perspectives : Werner, the German boy having to grow up under Hitler's regime and Marie, the French girl having to learn how to adapt under German invasion.  I liked how their stories overlapped until they finally meet.
Loved the writing, characters, storyline. At the beginning I thought it similar to "The Book Thief" (which I absolutely loved). I had to re read parts of it because I never realised it was bouncing backwards and forwards. Set in Germany Paris, Saint-Malo during WWII from a different perspective. I'm still not sure about the ending?
I liked the way the story was woven together. I thought the descriptions of Marie Laure' s experience of being blind and living an independent life in Paris during the Occupation was brilliant. Werner and his expertise with radio fascinating. What Marie could sense with her fingers and senses! I found all the characters came alive.
I really loved it.  I thought both Werner and Marie-Laure were extremely brave teenagers in an awful time in history.  The book showed both the horrors of WWII, as well as the love and support of family and community.  I had wished for a different ending, but know it could not have ended any other way.  I would highly recommend it.
A good story that flashes back and forth between two young people, a blind French girl and a very clever young German boy and how  the  the two intertwine. The novel spans the time before the WWII up until the Normandy invasion. The writing is good, the characters are interesting and you will enjoy the few hours you spend with them
Lovely story, well told. A very simple setting and yet capable of highlighting the cruelty and the stupidity of war. Npt a historical account of WWII (very one sided for that, full of bad germans and good frenchmen), but a chronicle of two seemingly vulnerable kids that endure with a remarkable nobility the turns of a cruel story.
I liked this book because it caused me to experience every human emotion that could be felt.  The characters in the story came alive, good and evil.  Some times I had to put the book down because the horrors of war seemed so real, I felt fearful.  The story clearly showed that there are good and evil people on both sides of a war.
The visuals this book created were stunning. It opened me up to a world of imagination, a world Marie-Laure created more beautifully than the one in which she lived. Not just a compelling and poetic story, this novel also works the brain, forcing us to consider what life's choices really mean and how vast the impact of war can be.
This is without a doubt one of the best novels I have ever read.  The author draws you into these marvelously described characters and their lives.  The book captured my imagination of what it must have been like to live in Germany and France during WW 2.  This book touched my emotions profoundly.  I did not want this book to end.
One of the best books I've ever read. Doerr's storytelling is like poetry--his sense of lyricism and description leaves you hanging on his every word and detail. I found myself drawn in almost immediately, and really didn't want it to end. If you're even remotely considering reading this book, just do it. You'll find beauty in it.
A wonderful read.  Characters were well developed and I cared about every one of them.  The final lesson, that no one escaped the war without lifelong scars, wasn't particularly upbeat, but the love and compassion of the main characters made the lesson easier to bear.  I will remember this book long after I've finished reading it.
At first I was tempted to regard it a potential version of "The Book Thief" (which I thoroughly enjoyed) but not so.  This is a fine plotting of the story of what WWII did to those swept up and into a hellish war capable of destruction on a scale that has horrified world ever since.  It is a splendid "I couldn't put it down" read.
I loved this book, and am still thinking about it. It is beautifully written, and the chapters move quickly and pointedly. I was a little disappointed with what seemed to me to be a lack of depth in the main villainous character, and with some points about the ending. But these are minor criticisms. I'm very glad I read this book.
This book is riviting.  I liked the way chapters alternated between character.  Character development was wonderful.  It is fiction but the way the blind heroiine copes with her disability is absolutely amazing.  Not always beliveable but interesting to read and imagine.  Definitely a book you want to read and recommend to others.
Physical blindness does not necessarily diminish our ability to see light in life;  there is unspeakable cruelty in war, but this is often paralleled by unspeakable bravery and humanity, even from those labeled as the enemy.  The author wraps these two main themes in beautiful prose and vivid description.  This is a wondrous book!
Human beings are caught up in the machinery of WWII Europe. Their desperate longings for normalcy, survival and love against terrible odds make up the fabric of this tale.  Through it all, the author has managed to allow the light that comes from goodness and hope to shine.  Sometimes the light is very dim, but it never burns out.
A fascinating story of two very exceptional people that find themselves in a complex situation brought on by WWII. Chapters are short and  jump between the characters like David Baldacci or Steve Berry, but the characters are much deeper and no one is a super hero. A well written book that holds your interest from cover to cover.
If you're in the mood for something beautifully moving, that manages to create a fiction world while remaining impeccably human then this one's for you.<br/>It is so much more than the description gives it credit for. It's feeling, it's emotion, it's the human experience. Give it a try, you won't regret it.<br/>IG: @outofthebex
One of the best books I've ever read. I loved the bravery of the little blind girl; her father didn't let her handicap "handicap" her. The little orphan boy was also such a brave person. It was such a beautiful story with all the strong, wonderfully intelligent characters. I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end.
This is a book entirely worth reading! The talented author takes you to places in your awareness that you seldom visit, reminding you there is a world of images, smells, and sounds wrapped up in experiences and thoughts. The character portrayals are so real, you forget that you are not there. Best book I have read in a long time.
A beautifully written book, with many different twists in the story line. It was refreshing to read a story with a  different view of WWII, however the last 20 pages left me wanting a different ending to finish the last minor plot line. I really enjoyed this book, and if you a fan of historical fiction it is a very pleasant read.
This novel gives us an insight into WWII conditions in Europe by following two main characters through a relatively short span of their lives. When they intersect and how they come to pass is tricky and complex, just like the models built by LEBlanc. The depth of characters was well written and I enjoyed reading this morbid tale.
A wonderful read. The story is woven together than I found so compelling that I kept reading at longer stretches than I had intended. The writing is beautiful and should be read carefully to fully appreciate it. The book has so many interesting threads to it, I am not sure a book club could finish its discussion in one gathering.
Good read.  Others commented that they did not like the way it bounced back and forth between characters and times, but I had no problem with that.  It did take a long time to build up the story (maybe too long).  Ending was ok but it could have been better.  Glad I read it but I'll move onto another author after having finished.
An amazing and tragic story , taking families from ..normal.. lives  to incomprehensible violence and  suffering,  and then trying to return to  normal.  All the while I was growing up  and ignorant of the world's suffering.  Further more, I recently toured the Holocost museum in DC,  unbelievable what humans can do to each other
From the reviews, I thought the focus of this book would be a love story, but it's really not.  Anthony Doerr does an excellent job of making World War II in Europe come alive in all its atrocities.  Can be a harrowing read, but well worth it.  The short chapters drive you on to read just one more.  The characters feel very real.
Doerr's novel brings an interesting perspective to WWII with the viewpoint of a young German boy alternating with a blind French girl narrating.  The story of each character moves along and then becomes interwoven into one story.  this is a book where when you get to the last page you feel like you are saying goodbye to a friend.
I loved this book!  A wonderfully written unusual World War II story that was centered around two young people growing up in different countries & lives during the war. There were adults involved in the story, but the young boy & girl were the main characters.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves/reads historical fiction.
This historical novel is haunting and enchanting. I was so connected with all the characters and had a hard time putting this one down. I laughed, I cried. I always know I have read a great novel when it remains with me days after reading it. I think this story, of war, bravery, love and perseverance will remain with me forever.
This is a fine book.  I thought it the best book I have read in many months.  If you are a ham radio enthusiast you will love it;  the details were too much for me and so I skipped the parts of how radios were put together from just a few parts.  This is a World War II story told from two very different children's point of view.
I was so impressed by the depth of sensorial description in this historical novel.  As the story of a young blind French girl during the Nazi occupation of France, the author's depth of language paints the impressions, emotions, and her thought processes in her limited world as if you were walking in her shoes.  Very impressive.
Outstanding writing.  The narrative is riveting all the way to the end. The characters are beautifully deliniated in the complexity they have found themselves in, both physically and by the happenstance of being born into a time of war. As a reader, I  was pulling for them to survive.  I have recommended this book to my friends.
Once you finish this book, the story, the characters, the scenery, the history and the prose will literally haunt you for weeks afterward. You'll scratch furrows into your head trying to figure out how writing this beautiful blossoms and blesses the pages that flip by too fast as you hang for the amazing ride Doerr takes you on.
A complex and intricately plotted story that shows how everyone is a victim of wartime and yet some human choices are redemptive. This is a sorrowful book, somewhat reminiscent of The Book Thief.  If you liked that, you will probably like this too.  The writing is very skillful and the puzzle of the book is extremely intriguing.
I am not old enough to have lived through WW II, but I did spend 9 months in Europe in 1952-53. There were still ruins and ruins and ruins of bombings especially in Germany. I was 7, but was taken to Dachau. So the war is likely more real to me than most Americans my age or younger. This book brings it to life and makes it real.
I've read so many non-fiction accounts of WWii , it never dawned on me the humane stories of its victims. This story of innocents caught in the maelstrom of War is beautifully crafted leaving me more aware of  the terrible price war extracts from its victims. I recommend this book without reservation.<br/>George A. Portland, OR
Loved the whole idea of the story of how innocence was destroyed by the war but it was sometimes difficult to stay in tune with the characters as the story skipped around.  I had to keep going back to be sure I hadn't missed something.  The story, itself, though was beautiful and yet very sad.  Have recommended it to my friends.
Yes I know, another book about World War II. But this one is terrific. It follows a French girl and a German boy along with their families. The characters are believable and vivid such that the book is hard to put down. The interspersing of time through the book made it even richer as a reading experience. Definately a must read
An entertaining book that was hard to put down.  Hated it to end, but end it must.  Loved the characters, the blind girl and the radio boy.  One day in our lives can affect them forever.  The legend of the diamond was fun too, made you think that sometimes jewels were meant to be kept as a part of nature, not cut up for jewelry.
This book is beautifully written and paints a picture of life during WW2. Although there are many WW2 books, this is a good addition and worth the read. However, I felt the book spent too much time leading up to the climax, switching times and characters so quickly it sometimes became confusing. Overall, though, excellent book.
I read a book a week. Most are entertaining, as reading should be, but I will remember this book for quite some time. The author presented both  sides of the young people who had been drawn up into the WWII conflict through no fault of their own. Well worth reading, especially if you're interested in WWII in Germany and France.
I loved this beautiful story of choices and redemption. Descriptions of evil were so chilling it gave me goosebumps. The vivid scenes set inside the houses, villages, and apartments make one feel as though you were there in a different life. Dark in places but inspiring and with plenty of light. I will probably read this again.
I don't know if this is the best book I have ever read because I can't remember them all.  But it is near the top of the list.  Amazing, spellbinding look at WWII from the experience of those who lived IN the houses that were being pulverized by bombs.  Seeing the consequences of the bombs on Doers' characters is like being rie
The time is the second world war but his is a beautifully crafted book that feels relevant today. It raises questions of good and evil, of the breakdown of social order, of the compromises we make with ourself.  We watch history unfold through the coming of age of a German orphan and a blind French girl. I could not put it down
Beautifully written Worl War II story from the perspective of a German boy and a blind French girl.  They do not know each other although the stories of their lives being affected by the war are parallel sagas of  worlds coming unraveled, gravely victim to forces beyond their control.<br/>Different than most war stories.
compelling novel about a blind girl and a teenage Nazi soldier during WWII.  Very well written.  Time periods in the development of these children are interwoven throughout the novel.  Could be disconcerting to  a certain type of reader but it just kept me interested.  Their lives intersect by way of a blue diamond.  Well done!
I downloaded onto my Kindle, and WOW!  I have not finished this novel yet, but want others to read it now.  I would say this is as good as Olive Kitteridge, by Elizabeth Strout.  Such amazing characters, solid story and character development all packed into one novel.  It is such a treat to read good writing.  I love this book!
this is the first book by Anthony Doerr that I have read and I enjoyed it so much that I want to read his others. This story captures history, science and humanity and provides a journey that as a reader I did not want to end. I am always looking for new perspectives about WWII and this book met my interest. Highly recommended.
This is the best book I have read recently.  It ties the characters and the story together beautifully.  Because each chapter is short (some only one or two pages) it is easy to stop reading without breaking up a chapter.  I have a few pages to go, but I recommend this to anyone who likes gorgeous prose and an intriguing story.
Excellent read...I couldn't put this book down!  It was beautifully written and brought me to tears several times.  The love the father had for his daughter, the courage of the young girl, the bravery of the villagers was wonderful.  The horror the young German boy had to endure was heartbreaking.  I highly recommend this book.
This is a beautifully written book. Set during World War II, it is largely a character study of the individuals involved.  We read it in my book group, and everyone loved it.  We all thought the author created some unnecessary confusion at the end of the book, but this is not enough to change the fact that the book is terrific.
For two and a half days I did nothing but read this book.  I couldn't wait to turn the pages; I was so involved with the characters, even the minor ones.  Any book that can keep my attention and keep the tears running down my face for the last 50 pages is beyond outstanding.  This book will be in my memory for many, many years.
While it's a slow start, the author does a wonderful job in crafting the narrative, weaving the story of two seemingly disparate characters in a masterful way. All the 'pieces' begin to click together, and I could not put this one down. It should be made into a movie in order to do justice to this heartbreakingly lovely story.
How refreshing!  A novel with a captivating plot that is also written by an author with a true skill with the English language.  I found myself frequently re-reading passages in order to fully savor the author's use of words.  His descriptions of various scenes made me feel as if I were truly looking through the author's eyes.
I loved the history that I learned from this book.  I also loved how it followed two different characters and kept alternating between them and between time periods.  It made it more interesting.  The author's style is amazingly beautiful.  I don't know how anyone can write such graphic sentences.  It's one you can't put down.
Very well written novel about people in Europe during WWII.<br/>The two main characters are a blind French girl, and a German boy who is an electronics prodigy.<br/>Through these people you get a sense of the war from both sides. Very interesting view.<br/>But the book is really about the people, who are skillfully created,
A story of two children on opposite sides in the second world war in France and how they coped with almost unbearable circumstances.  The story was told with sensitivity.  The violence was never gratuitous and the sexual context was hinted  at as a threat, but not used graphically.  It is a story of hope and survival and love.
This book grabbed me in the first pages and never let go. I read it completely in two seatings. Doerr cleverly lets you know early how much of the story will end but not really. The denouement is exactly what I hoped for while still leaving much to the imagination. The characters are beautifully human and believably imperfect.
I loved this book and didn't want it to end.<br/>Anthony's prose told the story in a very heartfelt but painful way.  I was aware of the conflicts of emotions, alliances & strengths of the prominent characters as they navigated their way through the brutal war years.  I will have to read some of Anthony's other books as well.
A powerful, intense story primarily of two people during World War II, a young, talented German orphan boy drafted into the army and an intelligent, blind French girl who was a refugee in occupied France. Their paths eventually cross but not in the way I had anticipated.  The ending is bitter sweet, but the story is well told.
Gripping book,  lures the reader in quickly
Beautiful use of words.  Great storytelling
Very well written and its very interesting.
This is a beautifully written book with a new look at the impact of evil ideology and war on the humanity of individuals caught up in its destruction.  Despite this disturbing theme, the portrayals of the characters are so well done that you are inspired.  Rich detail and storytelling leaves one in awe of the author's talent.
If you begin reading this, don't stop reading it.  About 1/2 way through it will become a page turner.  This story starts off slowly and gets confusing.  It's also a little hard to take in some areas.  But it will all come together during the second half.  It's not my favorite book, but it did keep up reading until 1:00 a.m..
This is a very interesting, suspenseful story involving two characters on either side of the fence during the nazi occupation of France. There are some twists and turns which keep the reader engrossed in the story.  I almost overlooked this book as we have been inundated with novels dealing with WWII but am so glad I read it.
Another book based in WWII, with a different point of view. Werner is a German without choices, and Marie is French and also not in control of her life.<br/><br/>I love the way the author jumps back and forth between times. It keeps the suspense going.  Slightly slow start, but it grabs you and pulls you through to the end.
This is a wonderful book that will break your heart. A European chronicle of love and war and the war's impact on the lives of people who just want to enjoy the world they live in. It humanizes World War Two and yet makes a statement about science and it's impact on people. A Great book. Get it and read it. You will thank me.
Supremely well written. Beautifully developed characters. Mr. Doerr brings a great number of elements together by the time he concludes. Nevertheless, the end seems a little unsatisfying.  But, that lack of satisfaction seems to make sense in light of the background of the story. The best book I have read in a very long time.
This novel touched me deeply. It is a simple yet amazingly profound story of a few people young and old caught up on a war they had no stake in.  The parallel stories of the two main characters are expertly woven, the prose is rhythmic and rich and all the threads come together in a touching conclusion.  Don't miss this book!
A wonderful read. You are so captured by the historical period of WWII through the eyes of a little girl who goes blind and the men that become part of her life. Het grandfather, her Uncle, her husband. The turmoil of the war for this family and their friends is a real history lesson. Definitely will read another book by him.
With intricate, beautiful details, the book captured my imagination and I felt myself seeing Marie-Laure's world through her sense of touch, sound, and smell. The love she shared with her father, great uncle, and his housekeeper was a wonderous thing to behold against the horrendous inhumanity of France's occupation by the Germans during WWII. The quiet acts of kindness and humanity were heart warming.
A thought-provoking, wonderfully written book.  A must-read…and makes us question our behavior in certain situations and the<br/>"it can't happen here or again."  Do we really learn from the past?  It's important to teach this history and read these books, I<br/>think, so that we do learn something about ourselves.
A Pulitzer-prize winning novel, this story is a great read.  The characters are well developed and kept me "in the story" the whole time.  I don't want to get into what the book is about as sometimes I feel some people say too much.  This was a "pick" for the book club I belong too and I was not disappointed.
HHHMMM?!?! Not sure what to say. While there was a great story line it was distracting at times as it went off in so many directions.  I found myself flipping a head at times because it seem redundant in places. It is amazing how people you know for only a short time can impact ones life so profoundly. Great book club book!!
Very well written.  Following two young people's experiences with one being an unenthusiastic oppressor and the other, the oppressed was fascinating. When I first started reading I thought "Oh no!  More WWII"!<br/>But very soon I was totally into the story. I have recommended this book to several other avid readers.
All the skipping around from one time period to another was a bit annoying---especially if you are reading on a Kindle and need to review in order to keep up with the plot.  The ending to the boy/girl story was very unsatisfactory.  What was the purpose of having it in the first place?  I was expecting the book to be better.
An excellent story about the lives of people during World War 2. The story envolves a blind girl, and her life during those difficult times. The story includes a young German boy and his sister, and how their lives become intertwined with the blind girl. Most people who like stories about lif during war will enjoy this book.
I would highly recommend this book.  It is beautifully written.  There is strong character development and symbolism.  If you enjoy the setting of France and Germany during World War II then you will truly enjoy this great read.  I might add that my Book Club also enjoyed "All the Light…" as we had a rich discussion.
Putting today's feelings into yesterday's lives isn't a fair treatment of what happened during WW ll.  It's a well written story that doesn't seem to respect the feelings of the time.  It would be like writing the pharaohs felt guilty about having slave labor.  Maybe, . . . but unless you can back that up why write about it?
Wars, especially Hitler's war tears people apart, literally and physically.  A beautiful book about a blind girl, a young soldier from an orphanage, plus death, grief, strength, resistance, terrible people, wonderful caring people.  A complex story that I highly recommend.  You learn what we can individually overcome and be.
It captures you from the very beginning.  You follow these two lives at the same time occupying their space and that they lived as young people in the European front during WW II makes this a rare chance to peak into some of that experience.  I like that it ends on a high note and gives a sense of tribute to that generation.
This book reveals  both sides of a young man who is basically kind and wants to help others and having to obey his war officers orders.  The young lady, who is blind, is a character who keeps you rivitated with what she sees even though blind.  I was captivated by this book and did not want to lay it down.  It's a must read.
Not many novels are so gripping that i stay up til 1 to finish them. i just could not imagine where Doerr was going with this beautifully written story about two smart but challenged  young people damaged by war who just kept plowing on. yes, it has its brutal moments but war is brutal and young people often suffer the most.
Beautifully written. Anthony Doer develops his characters and tells their stories with depth and compassion. I could not stop thinking about them even when the book was finished. This was an event of WWII that I was unfamiliar with, the bombing of San Marlo. After reading this story, I want to know more. Highly recommended.
It presents an entirely new view of WW2, ,not usually the type of book I would read, but I really enjoyed it and had that "sad" feeling when I had finished it, wanting more.<br/>It highlighted the futility of war in a totally, but different way. It should be compulsory reading for all politicians and world leaders.
Well written and a page turner. Ordinary people  coping with life in occupied  Europe during WWII. as seen thru the French villagers and German soldiers .  A young blind French girl & her village friends and family and a young German soldier and his army collieges doing his duty although sometimes reluctantly.  A must read.
I really enjoyed this book. It did take a while to really get into it, as the chapters jump between characters and even times (pre-war/during war), but once I got used to that it really grabbed my attention. Loved the characters -- felt I really got to know them, good character development. And the plot lines were engaging.
Very touching historical fiction about WWII in occupied France. The character development was very detailed and realistic. I was riveted by their stories and how they came together. If you like reading about good hearted people that are affected by war, this is the book for you with more tender moments than you can imagine.
My first read of this author and found it so enjoyable that it was hard to put down. He captures the vulnerability and innocence of the main  characters and shows that in war there is pain and suffering on both sides. The inclusion of the  diamond is a clever addition.<br/>Hope the next book of his I read is just as good.
I'm still in the process of reading this, as I do it at various times. It is very interesting the way he writes one character &, then, writes the other character.The description of the mindset (it is the war). It's easy to read, but, make you think about it when you are NOT reading it. The title is very thought provoking -
This is one of the best fictional books about World War II .I have read a number of historical novels .but all started to seem a bit conventional--until I read this book. I'm not sure how to describe this book--the best.I admit that there were parts of this book that I found a bit slow,  I would highly recommend this book.
This is a luminous, novel written in poetic prose. The author succeeds in writing about the dark, brutal events of WW II in a style that reminds me of a butterfly's wing and offers the kind of hope that comes from individual acts of humanity, courage, and care. One of the most stunning pieces of writing I have experienced.
Loved this book. Fascinating to learn about the invasion of France during WW2 through a story that brings two unlikely characters together - a wise and resourceful blind French girl fighting to survive the destruction of her town and family with a German soldier that could be, would be her life love if fate had allowed it.
Poetically written picture of innocence and youth during war. Yet another perspective of how lives flow unknowingly along a path of the unknown ..magical, and always with heart. Beautiful imagery..well paced..unique storyline. Thank you Anthony Doerr...I look forward to reading more from you...dare I use the word brilliant
This is some of the finest writing I've encountered in my entire life. Even if Doerr weren't as masterful as he is in constructing the story, I wouldn't have wanted to miss reading this book for the beautiful writing alone. Both the language and the story are pure magic. Give this man the Nobel Prize in Literature -- soon.
Sorry, but I feel that the way the book was printed with so many short pages with no type was very environmentally incorrect. Would have been a lot less pages if paragraphs just got tabbed down. They were not new chapters. It was an interesting read, but I think my opinion was slightly less enthusiastic then other readers.
I really like historical fiction about either WWI or WWII, and this was a beautifully written novel with an interesting plot entwining the two main characters.  While I certainly wouldn't call it suspenseful, it kept me riveted for the entire 500 pages.  I don't give many 5 star ratings, but I certainly will for this book.
Kudos to Anthony Doerr for this insightful, well-woven, informative and beautifully woven novel.  Although there are "main" characters, there really are no "minor" characters as all are vital to the tapestry Doerr weaves. This is one book I was reluctant to put down; yet when I finished it I wished for more.
Deserving of its bestseller status. A superbly-written story that brings two separate narratives, the young French blind girl and the young German soldier together for a critical wartime encounter. The only negative was the somewhat overlong and unclear coda after the climax, particularly as to what happened to the jewel.
Doerr has woven an interesting perspective of WWII through the lives of two young persons on either side, a blind French girl and a brilliant German boy.  Their lives come together briefly at the end of the war.  All the Light We Cannot See seems to travel in the intellect of these two characters as they perceive the war.
Love love love this book!  The writing style is beautiful and intriguing.  Though some found the short chapters annoying, I loved them as they created so much suspense for me.  I couldn't put the book down.  The story is quite unique and resplendent with history and character development.  I found the book very enjoyable.
A captivating writing style and an interesting plot make this novel about WW II well worth the time. I thought I had read enough war stories, but this one is different with its primary setting on the north coast of France. Fictional characters combine with historical accuracy to make this an informative and gripping read.
I really enjoyed this novel about the effects WW11 had on young innocent people.  The characters were well developed and believable.  The plot, however, was interesting, but slow to progress.  I think it would have been better if it had been edited more and eliminated some of the minor characters that were less important.
"All the Light We Cannot See" has a slow beginning, a very fast paced, really intriguing and suspenseful middle, and then a slow, disappointing ending, in my opinion.  However, I was  constantly amazed at the vastness of the author's detailed knowledge of events leading up to and during WWII in France and Germany.
A gently written, thoughtful story that places you easily into the minds, hearts, and souls of the main characters. I can't remember the last time that I truly cared about the people in a novel ( I read very little fiction because of this ). My only issue is that I wish I knew every detail of their lives as the book ends.
I have never read any of Doerr's books but that will soon change.  I felt each character as if I was inside them.  I found myself immersed in the scenes and at times speed-reading through them to get to the final act of each one.  What a fabulous story and story-teller the author presents.  I would recommend it to anyone!
Although this is a work of fiction the subtext was consistent with what I have learned about pre world war II  and the actual war with Germany. It explains how the population became active and passive partners into the horror of war. You peek into the lives of the people who were invaded and how war disrupted their lives.
As a child in Nazi occupied Norway this book resonated down to my bones. Almost too real, too dark, but redemptive in the way all humanity (and the creation itself!) is connected. What a masterful writer!  I wouldn't be able to read it again, but since every word-picture is indelibly embossed on my brain, I don't need to.
I really loved this book. I found myself reading "just one more" chapter continually. I liked the way it went back and forth between characters. It kept me wondering how it would all come together. I felt like the ending could have been better but all in all it was a good read. Loved that the author is from Idaho! Me too!
A beautifully written story that keeps the reader interested right from the beginning.  The style of writing short chapters allows the reader to bring closure to each scenario. The characters are beautifully portrayed.  There is much symbolism regarding what people "see" or are blind to seeing. Wonderful story!!!!
One of my all time favorite reads!  Even though it was fictional, it made me imagine living through the war.  I suspect there was some basis in fact behind the use of children as Nazi soldiers and how women and children - even old ladies - may have been involved in helping the allies win.  What an interesting perspective!
Absolutely stunning work!  The story is extremely well crafted and brilliantly told.  I felt that I "knew" the characters, was almost there with the and missed them when the book ended.  Doerr is a gifted writer and I look forward to reading more of his work.  If I could give this book more than 5 starts, I would!
Well writen.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat. A little scary, a time in our History where it must have been a horrific life, never knowing who was your friend or when you would be arrested for some nonsensical thing. Surviving on so little to eat, etc.  Being blind on top of that, this young woman had so much courage.
This book was well written but for me it lost a lot because it jumped around way to much from character to character and year back and the forward!! The stream of the story just fell apart-for me. And then the ending !! What?? it felt like it just dropped like a hot rock . I loved the main characters inspite of the rest.
Well, what can I say, I loved this book.  I have suggested it to others, and they did not care for it, but I think the author did a beautiful job weaving a special story unfolding during World War II. I am especially interested in this period of time and what it took to survive. I thought the book was beautiful. READ IT!
Loved, loved, loved this book.  While most of us love a happily ever after, and this  book really isn't that, it is a fairly realistic depiction of life, death, war, and valor.  Beautifully written and very hard to put down - you truly want to know what happens to Marie-Laure and Werner, the men and women in their lives.
Two tales, woven together, exquisitely told, of a young blind French girl and an adolescent German boy, an orphan, on opposite sides in the war but on one side of humanity. You will feel the cold of the winter and the salt of the ocean, the hunger of the hunter and the hunted, and the love of a parent. Relish every word.
Beautiful story. Historically accurate with so much more depth of time and place than any other WWII fictional account I have ever read. Characterization was true. They literally came alive off the page. I read on Kindle but will now go out and purchase a paper copy so I can give this book a hug and always keep it close!
Beautifully written, unusual take on WWII. Unusual characters and great detail. I tend to read these books without much analysis, but this story evoked many feelings, symbolism of light and dark, images of life and survival, random death and loss. There was much beauty amidst the destruction from the War. Loved the book.
I LOVED READING THIS BOOK.. IT WAS UNIQUE, HISTORICAL, POIGNANT, AN SO WELL WRITTEN..<br/>GIVES YOU A VIEW OF WHAT THE NAZI REGIME WAS LIKE AND HOW CRUEL,  INHUMANE AND DESTRUCTIVE IT WAS TO THE PEOPLE OF EUROPEAN INCLUDING GERMANY. IT RUINED SO MANY LIVES WITH LITTLE THOUGHT GIVEN TO ALL THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING CHILDREN.
This book makes you think so much about people and what effects them during regular life and during wartime. You watch a mechanically brilliant German boy and an intelligent thoughtful blind French girl grow up during WW2 and how their paths, by the choices they make, eventually cross. Beautiful book. I'll read it again.
This is the most beautifully written book I have read in a very long time, and I read a lot!  So evocative, you smell the smoke, and the sea, feel the snowflakes or the sand, hear the static of the broadcasts.  I felt as though I got to know each individual character.  Thoroughly enjoyed the read and hated to see it end.
I don't often read fiction, however I was interested in the World War II timeframe setting for this novel. It also took a little getting used to the short chapters and their change of characters/venues/timeframe but I eventually kind of enjoyed the rapid fire aspect. Overall I enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
This is an exceptionally good story, presented in a masterful way. The characters were vibrant, human, somewhat flawed, but truly memorable. The author wove together different time lines and unique narratives that majestically overlapped without fully merging.  Great literature should all be as captivating and enjoyable.
A brilliant and technically curious boy named Werner discovers the world through invisible radio broadcasts. A blind and naturally curious girl named Marie-Laure discovers the world through her father's miniature creations. WWII will shatter their childhoods but cannot quench their light, unseen, powerful, movingly told.
The author's writing style was somewhat unique, but I really liked it.  I red this for my book club and we are discussing it soon.  I am anxious to find out other's opinion.  The two main characters were well developed.  I expected a different ending; however,  I was not disappointed.  I was surprise at the way it ended.
Anthony Doerr takes you to a time a place of great devastation. Through his descriptive narration you become part of the times and places and you see and feel all the sights, sounds, feel the emotions, get to know the people. He shows you not only devastation but beauty of spirit and the tenacity of life. Excellent read.
This book contains some of the best prose type writing I've read.  The management of words of description certainly puts the reader right "there" with the characters.  Great character development as well.  The book managed to intertwine main characters with the greatest of ease for reading and keeping up as well.
Beautifully written story set during WWII and told from two different perspectives: a young, blind French girl and a young German soldier. Characters are fully drawn and the reader is able to build a true connection with them. That creative efforts were made to protect valuable art pieces was a unifying theme. Excellent!
I did not care for this book at all.  I would not recommend it.  Boring!  I had to convince myself to keep reading it thinking it would get better, but no such luck.  I do not care for this authors style of writing.  Can't understand those who liked it:(
How do you describe a book that flies out of its words right to the core of your soul?  This book held my attention by the wonder of its story , by the resilience of its character's lives, and it's sorrow of the destruction of war.  This goes down as one of the deepest books on our most human of lives that I have read!!
This book is simply amazing!  From the first chapter you are caught between 2 worlds. You get to know each character intimately .  Their lives all intertwined while caught in the most horrid of times! You will not be able to put it down but if you do, you'll be afraid to pick it up again. Lives can change in an instant.
Reminiscent of "Suite Francais", a wonderful book, it brought so many memories and spoke to me in so many ways.  The Characters are real and well developed, the understanding of the war deep and realistic.  I am too young to have been there, but was in Europe a few years later. Mr Doerr has done a fabulous job.<br/>WEH
Provided interesting observations of the mentality of German citizens during the war.commentary of how they allowed ignorance &ethnic;,religious hatred ruin their country,as well as the others involved in the war. Unfortunately the world has not learned a lesson from history and it appears we will be doomed to repeat it.
This to me is a study in how to build character within a plot. The characters are alive, breathing, human.<br/>What the characters did showed every human emotion in interesting details in depth.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book for the above reasons.<br/><br/>The book is well written and is set in World War II.
This was an excellent read. We were tranported to another place and time and treated to a unique perspective on the daily life struggles of those living under Nazi occupation. The characters were wonderfully developed, adding to the reader's understanding of the story the author was weaving so well. Don't miss this one!
This is such a great read.  I thought about this story daily and looked forward to reading it.  I am so impressed with the author. His book with stay with me always .  I felt like I was there in amongst the individuals and places and my heart stopped, my eyes teared up. Felt so many emotions. Thank you Mr. ANTHONY DOERR
This was our book club selection and we met tonight to review the book. Everyone rated it between a 9-9.5. We had a lot of discussion about the character development, symbolism and resiliency of war time and apprpeciated the story from a young Germans point of view. We all agreed it was a book we would highly recommend.
This was an exceptional read. It is a very intimate look at how the French and the Germans might have thought and acted during world war 2. It was very well written and very lyrical at times. I was able to feel as if I was there in the museum and in the little French town. I would recommend it as a very, very good read.
This is the coming of age story of a German boy and French girl, set in World War 2.  There is inner beauty in both of them, but war has compromised their youth.  This book is beautifully written, and the characters are portrayed in depth.  It is the kind of book that lingers in the mind long after you have finished it.
Loved this book! I could not put it down!!
Very slow moving book. Couldn't finish it.
Best book of the year, perhaps many years!
One of the best books this year. Loved it.
Haven't read a page turner like this in years.  I couldn't put the book down. Usually I don't like a lot of detail but one has to make an exception with this book.  It really added to the book being so interesting.  I loved that it took place in France during WW II.  I was a great book that I will no dowubt read again.
I waited quite a while before purchasing this book because of how depressing this period of time was. As heartbreaking as the story was, I loved some of the characters and kept rooting for them and didn't expect happy endings for most of them. The 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the pace of the book was too slow.
Very interesting from a historical point of view.  Human interest for the individual, on each side of WWII, made it more personal.  The intrigue was huge and varied as the war progressed through France.  Definitely left you knowing how this period of time left everyone affected very  deeply for the rest of their lives.
A book club selection.  Wonderful lyrical writing.  The ending seemed dedicated to wrappimg up all the story lines and at times seemed forced and was somewhat unsatisfying. Perhaps my reaction is indicative of the emotional investment in the characters.  Still, a wonderful book. I would recommend it with some reserves.
Three children: a blind girl, a boy who amazes everyone with his<br/>amazing abilities, and the boy's sister left in an orphan's home, manage to stay alive during WWII.  This book tears into your emotions as you live precarious moments with them.  The horrors of war paint vivid pictures as you go from one to the next.
Very absorbing book.  The story covers the lives of several characters caught up in World War Two in France.  I enjoyed the stories and how they weave together at the climax, however, what I found really fascinating was the "epilogue" that brings the characters  up to date long after the war.  A very good book.
I thought the book was wonderful and an easy read.  The writer had me into it from the beginning.  My only qualm is with the ending,  I had fantasies throughout the book of a happy ending,  however,  the book just ended.  I definitely appreciated the read and am glad to have experienced all of the emotions it provided.
I never read about war as I simply don't want to go there. But this captivating story held me in some unexplainable way, reminding me people are so complex.  I wish I had the words to convey the emotional and profound experience of this read.<br/>It's presumptuous to tell anyone they "should" read anything but I will.
Just an amazing story taking place during a horrific time in our history.  You join the lives of a young blind girl and a young orphan soldier who take us along on their individual journeys.  The story touched my heart.  It's a history book, a thriller and an exciting story of love and unbelievable courage and loyalty.
Sad that the writer could not come up with a better ending. The writing was excellent and most of the characters well developed. But too many unanswered questions and the whole buildup of the two main characters was ended in such a bad way that I felt I had listened to the book in vain. Very disappointed with this one.
I am not a good book reviewer. Suffice it to say, I loved this book. There were two main characters, a young boy and a young girl who was blind. I loved the way the author told each person's story alternating back and forth. Somehow we knew that their world's would cross, but we couldn't see just how that would happen.
I loved this story and how it unfolded. The characters all played an important role to the overall story and the moving back and forth through time was handled very well. No matter the side of the war they were on I Still cared about each character and truly wanted to know how they got there and what happened after 1944.
So much detail in the beginning and middle was painful, then it ended rushed I felt, I expected more and it left me annoyed.
A wonderful work of prose that evokes a range of emotions. The reader is transported to WWII Germany and France through the eyes of a young, brilliant German boy conscripted to the army, and through all other senses of a courageous young blind girl in Paris. This is wonderfully woven tale of duty, doubt, and devotion.
A good story leads you by its characters down a pathway riddled with history, impossible situations and love. A great story does the above while dangerously hooking you, daring you to pause at the next chapter. This is a great story, hard to put down, and totally unpredictable. It is definitely worth your time. Enjoy!
Loved this book. Story was sweet, mean and awe-inspiring. A history lesson wrapped in the life of a blind girl, the angst of a brilliant, sensitive young German intruder and interesting and perfect characters in support. You and I have met these people, have loved them and some cases have let them go. A Calder mobile.
I could not put this book down and twice was awake in the night and just had to get up to read more.  I am doing some other WWII reading with Brock and Brodie Thoene books, and this book adds another dimension to personal stories and in helping us to understand how Hitler had the influence he did on the German nation.
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. I normally shy away from anything that takes place during a war. But it was highly recommended so I bought it. I'm glad I did. This was not about the war, though it took place during it. It was about people. And what a great cast of characters. A great read.
This is a wonderful novel, which deserved the Pulitzer Prize it won.  The writing is a joy -- simply beautiful.  The characters feel completely real, like people the reader has met and knows well.  The plot is based in real history and it is nonetheless unexpected and heart wrenching.  I was sorry to finish this book.
A stunning story.  It is hard to believe that the author was not there with the characters who are so real, observing their every move and feeling their every emotion.  The writing is breathtaking.  You feel like you are there with the children and it reminds you vividly of what war does but how hope somehow survives.
I thought it was a wonderful book. I loved how Marie father made the little houses for her. They were more than a puzzle. They really were there to help her find her way. In more than one way. It was fun how the story tied together the 2 main characters, Warren and Marie.<br/>I would recommend this to all my friends.
This book was very well written and has really great characters!  It goes back and forth between two families and places during World War II that eventually come together.  It makes you question war and who is the real enemy during times of war.  Many things happen during times of war out of the necessity of survival.
This was selected for my book group and I thought that it produced some very interesting observations and discussions.  The hostess did some research about that time period that was helpful.  It was well written and interesting to see how the two main characters finally interact with one another. I would recommend it.
From an "educational" standpoint, I really liked it. There is so much I don't know about WWII, especially from the perspective of France. I thought it was well written and worth the read; I just wished it hadn't been so sad. There could have been some happiness in the end, but I can't explain without spoilers.
This book was so believable. Not one false note. I also loved the writing, close to beautiful prose. The story jumps around in an interesting way, really helping the suspense to continue but also offering relief from the intense emotion. The story is unique, intricately interwoven, but all tidied up at the conclusion.
Beautiful and thoughtful prose, a sweet story of goodness and human kindness and heroism in the setting of an evil war. The book is a very satisfying read that I hated to see ending. Definitely made me want to be a better person and appreciate the goodness in humanity. I'll be looking for the next Anthony Doerr novel.
This is one of those books that will stay with you, maybe forever. Beautifully written, not a throwaway word in its 600 plus pages.<br/>Two fully developed characters whose stories are told alternately  make you fall in love with each. The war is central to their lives but it is not who they are. Thank Anthony Doerr.
A beautifully written book that could have used further editing.  It's a charming story with richly drawn characters.  But the story tended to drag, while the author got sidetracked with lengthy descriptions and flowery metaphors.  The story is told by going back and forth in time, a contrivance that I find annoying.
Excellent Read. I could not put it down. Wanted to wake up in the middle of the night to read more. The writing is magnificent. The writer weaves<br/>the story together so gracefully providing insight into to each character and how their individual World War II circumstance changes who they are<br/>and will become.
I loved this book. I thought it was lyrical, albeit a LITTLE long.  I like the ultimate message about life it tries to empart.  I feel like it's a similar message that Christopher Nolan tried to get across in his movie Interstellar but failed miserably.  This book is much simpler, and easier to wrap your head around.
This is an interesting story about World War Two set in both France and Germany about two young people , one blind, and how  they must<br/>cope  with the frightening aspects of the situation they are in.  But what makes this a great novel is the author's writing style.  It's a fascinating story beautifully written.
Loved the style of writing.  Intriguing plot.  Loved the character development in the first half of the book.<br/>I happen to read a lot of WWII books centered around the Holocaust.  I found it very interesting to see the war through the eyes of the French and the young Germans.  I would highly recommend this book.
I really loved this book. I was looking for a good summer read, and this book didn't disappoint! It's an interesting story of two young adults in the midst of World War II in two different countries. It has surprises weaved throughout the book, and the different time periods let you really understand the characters.
I chose this book for my book club.  I thought it sounded interesting.  It was so much more than that. I found I didn't want to put it down. I thought about the characters in the book in between readings. I identified with them. As in life, things don't always turn out like you expect. It was a wonderful book to me.
The plot is a little contrived.  The heroine's education is unusual.  How did she learn Braille?  The radio transmission is unusual.  Don't want too many spoilers here, but these things made me question other things...I can't imagine a girl under WWII extreme rationing not harvest seafood along with the housekeeper.
At times I struggled to remember the characters and I had to re-read. This book had a lot of floral language. The characters were very interesting. At times I couldn't put the book down  the story added to my interest in why Germans got themselves into this mess. They indoctrinated the very young. Truly War is Hell!
Very interesting book.  My only issue was the odd time sequencing -- it was seemingly random.  Since the reader is already bouncing from the French girl's to the German boy's perspectives, the additional switching of past and future was disconcerting, and I did not think it added anything to an already strong story.
I expected that I would really enjoy this book, based on how many of my friends  were reading, or had read it. I was very disappointed in the book, finding it long and drawn-out. It was a little hard to follow the time line at times. I persevered, reading until the end, because this was a selection of my Book Group.
Liked this book a lot and was able to feel the crushing weight of the Nazi totalitarian regime. The characters were well developed and complex. It seems they were destined to have a very difficult life but were able to maintain dignity and hope while enduring their conditions created by the horror of war and Nazism.
Of the several books I have read about the holocaust, I thought this one was the least interesting. It was too long and not much happened until the very end. The main characters of the book didn't even cross paths until the last quarter of the book. I would recommend The Book Thief or Sarah's Key ahead of this book.
The reason I read this book was because it was on the best seller list. The reason I recommend it is because it was different from other books about the war I have read. I liked the way it was written and the fact that it was not a predictable ending. My first book by Anthony Doerr but won't be the last I will read.
This was a very good book with an interesting twist on the usual war novel.  I wasn't sure for awhile how the author would tie all of the pieces together but he did.  The characters were well drawn out and the setting was quite vivid.  I was definitely involved in the plot and moved to keep reading until I finished.
The author put me in the middle of WWII in a way that other books have not. The characters dance in a point-counterpoint that is mesmerizing and when their lives touch for just the briefest of moments, hope soars for a happy ending. But as in real life, some things are resolved and others are not but life continues.
Far apart lives spin ever closer, this novel, about a tragedy and miracles, and connections you cannot even imagine, weaves effortlessly through the underbrush of WWII. If ever there was a novel that showed how your actions could reverberate into corners unknown and come back around to you, this is it, this is life.
This is such a well-written work, especially from one who loves metaphors.  They caught my breath and made me pause my reading.  My father received a Citation from the French nation for his active duty liberating France in WWII.  The era was personal and the weaving of this tale was brilliant. Thank you, Mr. Doerr!
This was a  well written book.  It made me see WWII through the eyes of the German people.  I had tended to think of them as evil.  This showed me that they were just common people caught up in a situation that they didn't understand or have any control over.  The characters were interesting and the story engaging.
Wonderful story ... didn't want it to end even though it carried us through 3 generations up to 2013~<br/>The author did a marvelous job of intertwining the lives of the two characters, born in different countries<br/>It was also a realistic look at what it was like to live in both France and Germany during WWII.
This is a WONDERFUL book! It puts a personal insight to the horror of World War II as experienced by an Austrian boy and a French girl from their early youths, through and beyond the war's end. This writer is masterful in his writing -- one of the best novels I've read. I look forward to his other and future works.
Beautifully written.  The story depicts a more in depth and personal look at how young boys were "conditioned to join the Hitler regime and how it affected one in particular.  It follows a young boy and a young blind girl in Paris during the time of the WWll.  I look forward to reading more Antony Doerr novels.
Starts slowly, but beautifully written, and in time I found I was having a hard time putting this book down.  The symbolic use of light throughout the book also hooked me.  A German friend has also commented to me about how well it portrays how the young of his father's generation were pulled into the Nazi machine.
The attention to detail offered by the author is unsurpassed. A blind girl, electromagnetic radio waves, all the connections to color and the absence of color brought about by the war conspire to envelope the reader in a world comprised of light and light we cannot see.<br/>Do yourself a favor and read this novel.
A magical story describing how the war tore apart the lives of different characters. The book illustrates courage and resourcefulness from the French resistance fighters, the maniacal greed and cruelty of the Nazis, but most touching was the story of a father and uncle trying to protect the blind girl, Marie-Laure.
Lovely, sometimes magical prose. Familiar WWII story, presented as disconnected but gradually intertwined stories. Wonderful characters you'd like to meet if they were around. The one question left hanging at the end... I can't decide if I like it that way or not. But I don't have a better idea! Highly recommended.
Excellent read. I was captivated throughout and I was concerned that the subject matter would be too dark for my preference. Very well written and wonderful character definition of two vulnerable youths during this sad time in world history. If you're looking for a good book buy this one, you won't be disappointed.
A beautifully written tale, compelling characters who become so real as the pages fly by. The descriptions of towns, houses, and the sea are enchanting, so real I could see them in my mind's eye. And the story is riveting, complex, and exciting on many levels. Thanks to the author for writing such a beautiful book.
Beautiful prose, alternating short chapters keeps the pace moving. The search for a legendary gem brings hope against the backdrop of a relentless war. The main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, find momentary ways to escape the war by communicating through the airwaves. I worried about them throughout the book.
Wonderfully written, even haunting, but it takes forever for the two major characters to be brought together in any sense.  It's one of the longest expositions I have ever seen.  The second half, however, is worth the wait.  Two very interesting major characters, quite unique in my experience. Overall, I loved it.
I've never been able to get into Historical stories, fiction or not, but this book drew me in with its poetic imagery and beautiful characterization. I, admittedly, catch myself being rather critical but there isn't a single aspect of this absolute masterpiece that I can assess as anything but that, a masterpiece.
Well written. Goes back and forth between the two young characters. Starts out on the up side at the beginning of WWII for the Germans, then deteriorates along with history. The French in Brittany and their struggles are highlighted. Young blind girl's relationship with her father and her great uncle are touching.
A fantastic novel. Keeps you reading and wanting to know what happens next. A wonderful fictional story about one of the darkest times in human history, Doerr shows that even in darkness there is always light, that when there is always evil in people, there is also good. Completely deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
Wonderfully written book. The characters are very well developed. Among the many novels written about WWII, this one provides a unique perspective. As the author goes back and forth between the main characters, he keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering exactly how they will tie together and what will happen.
Much better than I hoped for - even though all of the reviews were very positive.  One of the top books I've read in some time.  Just a good story - nothing earth shattering or big action- just a constant good story that keeps your attention and curiosity as to what will happen next.  Can't stop thinking about it.
Good story with two young characters.  Taking one from a possible future in the coal mine to a school to learn electronics.  All because of Hitlers war.  Then a young blind girl whose father builds models of Paris and the town they fled to, learns to be brave and daring. Plenty of side story to keep things moving.
Well written and held my interest from the start. A somewhat fantastic premise (fabulous gem with a curse attached) in a familiar WWII setting. The author does a very good job of melding the two. Endings for this type of novel are often unsatisfactory but I thought this one was a perfect mix of real and fantastic.
Beautifully written. I did not want to put it down because I wanted to see what would happen next. Story line showing both sides of the war allied and invading forces. The human suffering and experiences were emotionally consuming. Interesting how every day life of people changed in Europe changed during the war.
This is a wonderful novel and story set in France during the onset and progression of the nazi takeover of beautiful Paris.  What makes this even more interesting is that this is "seen" through the thoughts of a young French girl as her life unfolds in this unforgettable era  It is one you hate to finish!
I've read this book three times and each time the writing becomes more and more breathtaking incredibly descriptive without being boring. Like the protagonist Marie-Lare although you are not present you can "see" everything he chooses to describe. My suggestion is to re read it for its beauty and clarity of prose
This book was very compelling.  I wanted to find out what was going to happen to the main characters.  There are two main characters on male, in Germany, and one female in France.  It is their take on the World War II that effects each of their lives very differently as they grow up.  I would recommend this book.
When I reached the last sentence of of "All The Light We Cannot See", the only thought I had was "No!  Not now!"  The ending, like nearly everything about this book was nearly perfect.  My only complaint was that it came to an end at all.  I have rarely enjoyed a book more and I heartily recommend it to everyone.
A terrific page-turner, featuring a pair of unforgettable characters and an intricate plot that builds suspense as ingeniously as one of the puzzle boxes constructed by the heroine's father. Written with a vivid vocabulary and admirable economy. What keeps it from 5 stars? A tone that's too precious for my taste.
A vivid trip to the Europe of pre to post years of WWII. The eyes of the German children and the eyes of  blind French child take us through their many experiences different and coincidently (New word) intertwined. I found this a hard truth of a time when I was living a safe childhood in Brooklyn, N Y, thank God.
I loved this book. Mr. Doerr's characterization of the blind girl was so wonderful that I felt as though I knew her and wanted to help her. You really feel her vulnerability and emotions in this book. I have recommended this book to many friends and all have loved it too. Excellent story from an excellent writer.
I got this book because it is on an NPR list of the best 10 books of 2014. Should be in the best ten of the last decade! Such perfect images, intense emotions beautifully written. I can read only in small amounts because it is so intense and deep. -  like a very rich food you love, but can't eat too much at once.
This was an extremely well written book. I tend not to enjoy a book when the author goes back & forth between characters & time periods, however the flow in this book was easy to follow & made sense.  Although this book highlights a very negative time period it is "easy" to read.  I enjoyed it immensely!
This book was recommended by our local librarian in his article in our local newspaper.  I am so glad I read it.  I have always been fascinated by WWII and the evil wrought by Hitler on the Jews, but this story brought to light the horrors he brought on his own people as well as those who fought against Germany.
This is one of the best books I have ever read! Having visited St Malo last summer, seen the re- built Old City, and learned of its destruction in WWII, the location of the story was especially appealing. The characters are very well developed and I was invested in them immediately. I recommend this book highly.
A terrific well timed story with interesting characters opening a window to the French resistance for those of us who did not realize what it was like. 10 out of 10 people in my book group recommend it and were happy we read it. This is very unusual with my group because there are many books members do not like.
Not my type of book, not my type of story. That said after reading it, it is my kind of book and also my kind of story. Brilliantly written, engaging, engrossing, real as your skin feel. The characters are beautifully flawed, fearful & brave. A hint of what the past generation was like. It will be sorely missed.
Excellant book.  I didn't want it to end.
Good read for those who like period books
I liked this book as it gave me a different perspective on WWII. It was really not about the holocaust, but about the persecution of all Europeans by the Nazi regime. It took a long time to get into this book, but the characters were fascinating and the story was informative and revealing. I would recommend it.
I feel uncomfortable calling this book fiction, with all the history, science, ethics, morality and incites into the great spectrum of human nature.  It is so much more.  However, I guess truly great fiction does go way beyond fiction to teach life lessons and so many other things.  This sure was great fiction.
This was a different kind of read than other novels. Once into the book the characters were very real. There were a bit too many descriptive details for me. I did skip some of them. The best thing about this book is it made me take a long hard look at my own attitdes and beleifs about how valuable each life is.
I rate it five stars. I enjoyed it thoroughly, although the subject matter was, of course, a very sad time in our history. I particularly enjoyed it when I discovered it was set in an area of France I had just visited in June. The characters were very well developed and I was immediately involved in the story.
I was astonished with this book...it is a wonderful tale, beautifully written and was a joy to read.  I truly didn't want it to end ....  I think Anthony Doerr is brilliant with his ability to gap the two main characters and their stories and the eventual joining of the stories.  Great book.. Recommend highly!
Well developed characters, evocative depiction of WWII, the kind of book that keeps you up nights.  Only wish one of the mysteries could have been solved - read the book and you'll see what I mean.  Other than feeling of incompleteness on one story line, excellent book for anyone who enjoys reading about WWII.
This was one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  The writing was beautiful, the mood intense, the history was explicit and sometimes uncomfortable.  You have already read what this book is about but I urge you to read it and bask in the light of an excellent story that keeps you turning pages.
Beautifully written and unashamedly sentimental. Doerr's book is best when it explores the inner worlds of a blind girl and orphan boy. The plotline can feel contrived, but that's not the point: this is a book full of luxurious sentences, exquisite and almost tactile. He makes us see the things we cannot see.
This novel is a complex story, which requires the reader to keep the two major characters and others straight as he/she pieces together the storylines set during WWII. The story lines are set within various settings and often told out of sequence, which tends to pique reader interest. The ending is emotional.
One of my favorite books!  The way the author weaves the story back and forth between the two primary characters is very effective and adds to the quality of the reading experience.  I find it difficult to find words to describe how much I enjoyed this book.  Books of this quality do not come along every day.
This is a wonderful book with starts with the bombing of the French city of St Malo in August 1944 but then goes back 8 years to trace the lives of a German boy and a blind French girl which eventually intersect,  The writing is beautiful and the characters all very well developed.  I was sorry to have it end
I read constantly and finding a well written book that engages and doesn't let you go until the very end is sometimes a challenge. This book is one of the best I have ever read. I read it on my Kindle but also went to the Bookstore after reading it, to buy the hardback.<br/>I want it in my permanent library.
Read this book while in Normandy & Brittany.  It was perfect while "touring" the many WWII sites and museums.<br/>St. Malo was 80% destroyed by the Allies, but it has been rebuilt to resemble the old city.  I walked around the old city looking at buildings which might have housed the main characters.
Beautifully written. Prose that is wonderful. Characters that come alive. Plot development that is great. Brings home the horrors of war in a tale of twists and turns. Like life itself, Unforeseen events alter the fates of innocent and compelling people. Best book I've read in a long time. Highly recommended.
I thought this book was on the right track, but the very short fragmented chapters meant that the flow of the plot was frequently interrupted.<br/>After completing this book, I was still confused as to a couple of the twists in the plot.<br/>Overall happy with the purchase but wasn't madly in love with it.
Anthony Doerr has written an intimate story of beauty and war and loss and some kind of resolution. I couldn't put it down and yet I wanted it to last longer.  I didn't get the ending I wanted from the book, but neither did any of the characters in the story.  Thank you Mr. Doerr for a heart wrenching story.
This is an exceptionally beautiful and affecting story told with matchless prose, a poetry of imagery; the use of electromagnetic waveforms may seem like an unlikely metaphor but consider what a tiny wafer of reality we can perceive. All The Light...widens that ability by reenforcing perception with feeling.
I loved this book until close to the end when I felt it collapsed into a "follow up years later" mode that didn't work well for me and seemed utterly unnecessary.  The writing overall is beautiful.  he story is compelling. The characters are genuine (mostly) and believable.  I certainly recommend it.
This book was a great read! The character development kept me intrigued. I loved the short chapters because I knew that each time I finished a chapter I would be taken to a different character and time. I loved putting all the pieces together in my mind and the ending, although heartbreaking, was satisfying.
It is interesting to read a book from the German's perspective.  While the war is ongoing, this book takes you behind the scenes to kids who are trained (brainwashed) in Nazi ways.  I loved the story from the children's perspective and understood how the Germans could become so blind to the Nazi propagganda.
Can hardly wait for movie! This book told another story of the bravery and cruelty of the holocaust through 3 children growing up during the war,the bravery of the mother's and local women,  the resilience of the children . Also the story  shows how this could happen any where, again, if good men do nothing"
This is a novel covering France and Germany in the Second World War.  The character development is<br/>amazing and there are many of them.  It is fantastic the way the author weaves the plot together so<br/>that the lives of the characters eventually intersect.  It is a really well written, engaging novel.
Usually stories that go back and forth in time an place are hard to follow and can be frustrating to read.  This author presents two<br/>characters during WW two and even though the he takes us back and forth between these characters who live in different<br/>countries it is a good read and easy to follow.
This is not a typical book for me. Normally I go for science  fiction or fantasy. This is one of the most grippingly beautiful novels I have ever read. The characters are so human and the individuals are so well developed that it's hard to reach the end. I recommend this to readers of all ages and interests.
Deserves all the praise it has received. Captures the quotidian details that crushed souls, warped minds and wasted millions of lives - not just those killed but those who who survived.  And then there are the awful choices so many good people did not have. Rush to read this book, but linger over every word.
The book is beautifully written. The reading is very enjoyable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars  is because the story cannot keep me captivated.  I have enjoyed reading it when I have time, and I put it away and not go back for a week or longer. I have not finished it yet, and it was over couple of months.
My first thought, was yet another WWII novel... Regardless, this is a beautiful novel.  Told from the point of view of two young innocents, caught up in the madness of the time.  The power of love, may not save everyone but it does help counterbalance the terrible cruelties man can inflict on his fellow men.
The play on words, what can be "seen" by a blind person, what can be "seen" mentally when the means of communication is aural, defines the book. WWII may be overworked, overkilled, overdone, but like Stones in the River, this one resonates with humanity, angst, compassion and a moral compass.
This was a very visual book. Anthony Doerr's story was, I think about the futility of war. About all the damaged lives. Interrupted lives. A few people managed to survive but they were scarred by their experiences. Fredrick as a young boy was wise, their lives did not belong to themselves. It was a sad book.
I found myself rushing to finish this book and hoping it wouldn't end.  Beautifully written in short, rich chapters that shuttle between the main characters and time.  The book has a wonderful cohesiveness, where lives intersect, plots resolve and some find peace.  A novel of résistance, survival and growth.
Well written book, I like the English. A WW 2 story... Tough to finish quickly especially if you want to appreciate the diction and the author's command of the language. The end is compressed a bit, meaning decades are traversed at high speed relative to earlier parts of the novel but overall I love the book
I had a difficult time sticking to finishing the book.<br/>It is well written. The theme is about a blind youth<br/>adapting to the bombing of her home city by Germans<br/>who benefited from her grandfather teaching her how to cope with blindness.<br/>It also has a curse factor attached to her blindness.
Well researched and carefully crafted, this is an intriguing read. The many many short chapters shifting time and perspective left me a little bit disjointed as I read it, but otherwise it was enjoyable and enlightening. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Occupied France during WWII.
An absolute MUST READ.  I lost two nights sleep reading thru the book...worth it!  It was hard not to skim ahead I was so anxious to see what would come next.  The ending had me in tears.  I don't know about writing styles and genre, but this book is part history/romance/education and a wonderful mix it is!
Two central characters who capture your imagination immediately.  Several other characters who are masterfully introduced and well developed into the building story of what will happen when the two central characters meet.  Doers brings this horrible time in history to life through each and every character.
This is one of those books that you don't want to end.  What an amazing debut novel. This is an anti-war novel.  It provides a helpful perspective about growing up in a war zone that most Americans would benefit from understanding.  It is literary but accessible and enjoyable as a summer beach read.  Enjoy.
I have recommended this book (and author) to many of my friends. I expected Mr. Doerr  to gain more recognition with the publishing of All The Light We Cannot See. The awarding of the Pulitzer was well-deserved. The book is filled with images the reader will savor.. Mr. Doerr has "a way with words".
This is one of those books you recommend to everyone you know and hope they actually read it. It's a story that will appeal to all generations, from teenagers to their great-grandparents. I've read several books set in Nazi occupied France, and like The Nightingale, is an unforgettable "experience."
Great story from beginning to end. The parallel stories are amazing and loved how they came together at the end. So many tragedies associated with the war, and this story brought a very personal perspective from teens living countries apart. I highly recommend to anyone interested in this period of history.
This book brought me to times and places that I didn't know existed. The writing was crystal clear and the author went into great detail when introducing the characters. I love the fact that the book kept my interest and was never predictable. The ending was different than the one I predicted and that's ok.
Great emotional stories of individuals and relationships. Solid writing. Good way to learn interesting history while delving into deep topics like the ethics of war, the horrors of group think, loss and mourning on an individual and national scale, feeling vulnerable, coming of age in wartime and much more.
This started  slow, but  came highly recommended by friends.  As I  continued on, I found myself thinking about these young people.  How did they survive.  It is beautifully written but so horrid.  This is overwhelming but sometimes we need to be reminded of that time and hope history does not repeat itself
It was an Eye opener.I never knew what happened to the children at the beginning of the war.No one ever brought it up in other books I've read.<br/>I liked the honesty with which the author wrote it wasn't sugar coated.<br/>I guess the German children with the blues eyes suffered to .<br/>unimaginably. .
To revisit WWII with this story was very entertaining, the characters are clear, believable well thought out. Writing is very good.  I wanted to know what was happening next with every chapter.<br/>I especially loved how the author brought these characters to present day, it felt very real.  A great read.
A story that makes you sneak away to coffee shops or spare bedrooms to read just one more chapter before the real world calls you back.  The story leaps back and forth between times and characters but is not confusing.  Gorgeous, descriptive writing about people living through WW2 on both sides of the war.
This is a well written story with characters that come to life and become part of your life. During the reading, it was brought to my mind that not everyone  is a willing partisipant during a war. This is something we tend to forget. The web of war is far reaching and demands a change of everyone involved.
This has become one of my all time favorite reads.  The symbolism warrants Cliff Notes!  A lovely, sad story really all set during WWII.  I don't want to give anything away.  There is a reason why this book is on 2014 Best Book lists....don't delay.  Read this as soon as you can, you won't be disappointed.
This is a gorgeous book that anyone will love.<br/><br/>I don’t understand the 1 star reviews, or the massive spoilers or personal abuse they feel the need to throw out there so casually. The story is faultless and flawless.<br/><br/>Trust the overwhelming majority of reviewers on this beautiful story.
One of the best books I have read in months. I found myself looking forward to waking in the middle of the night just to squeeze in a few more chapters. Great characters, powerful time in history, and interesting path the story follows. Have recommended it to several other people before finishing the book.
Recommended by a voracious reading friend and she was absolutely correct. The language of Doerr brings to life the era of WWII, its tragedies, its humanity, and the defiant spirit of goodness to overcome evil. Each event and each character is so very real that I wondered if this really was totally fiction.
I liked the review of the war time as I also was a young girl during that time and remember many of the happenings.  They took too long describing the procedure of carving little towns and too long describing Werner's ability with wires, conduits, and radio repair, etc. But all in all, it was a good read.
There were lines from this book that were absolutely amazing. However, I still found it to be too slow and sometimes difficult to follow. The relationship between the main character and her father was beautiful, as was the imperfect friendship illustrated between two boys who were both victims of cruelty.
I loved the way this story shifts between time and characters.  I was continuously updating my prediction regarding how and when the characters would meet, but I was almost always wrong. I intended this for a quicker read, but it took a bit longer than I had planned, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute.
The strength of this gripping novel is the richness of its characters. When the motion lags a bit towards the end, the reader's engagement with the characters pills him through. The blind Marie-Laure, the earnest Werner, and many others, are deeply drawn. I look forward to his short stories, my next read.
This was an excellant book. I read this book as part of a book club. We all agreed the way the book was written, going back and forth throughout the book was an especially helpful way to read this particular  book.. The two children in the book were exceptional characters.  I look forward to rereading it.
A beautiful story during such a horrible time period. Not the typical WWII story. Such warm and loving characters will be with me for a while! I did find the jumpy  time lines  a little difficult to follow. Probably worth a re-read to pick up all the underlying details that I missed the first time around.
Highly recommended read for anyone who is a fan of European novels set in 20th century Europe and particularly for me as a Brit as it offers a perspective on the French + German experience. The ending was not exactly as I hoped but that may have been too trite... I would look for more books by this author
The war seems ancient in my mind but the everyday lives of people were so affected and ultimately intertwined that today's daily encounters and experiences seem almost trivial to the characters in the book. These may be unique but are probably more the norm than not. A really good, thought provoking book.
Exceptional book w/ an intriguing structure.  Lives in France & Germany merge during WWII & beyond.  The plot absorbs & envelops both the beauty & hatred in human nature.  Lovely metaphor & simile pervade this book which celebrates survival, & mixes mysticism w/ the devastation & courage shown during war.
A well-written and thought provoking novel.  An unusual account and viewpoint of the misfortunes during the horrors of World War II in Germany and France as encountered by young  people.  All the Light We Cannot See makes the reader look at everyday life and realize that we, too, do not see all the light.
Excellent book. I could not put it down.
This is a war story from French/German perspectives but it's less about the war and more about the story. There is a sense that answers are missing, things are left undone in the end, coincidences collide, and nothing is as it should be, but that was intentional. I'd consider this one of my better reads.
Author takes the reader into a world of average working people who are facing upheaval in their life due to invasion by the WW2 German arm.y  .Add a young blind girl, several orphans, an uncle suffering "shell shock" from WW1 - plus many supporting characters ,for a book that is hard to put down.
This was a great book about a German boy's life, and a French girl's life during WWll. The author told a complex story by weaving in the stories of individual characters until they met at the climax. This was a realistic novel full of insight. There were quite a few cliffhangers, I could not put it down.
It's amazing how a novel so rich can be written so simply.I loved that it focuses on two character, one French and one German, and how the chapters alternate between the two. I can't say much more with spoiling it so I won't. But I suggest reading the first two or three chapters. I bet you'll be hooked.
The storytelling in this book is utterly captivating in a way that I don't often experience in books, but which makes me forget I'm reading at all. I felt similarly when I read Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner. Just an incredible story incredibly told. It is utterly, almost painfully beautiful writing.
Beautifully written, an easy read but packed with details that allow the story to come alive in your mind. I appreciated the historical references of WWII - Germany invade France, Americans enter the war, Berlin falls, the aftermath and it's victims. The characters intertwine in this page-turning drama.
This was an outstanding book! Beautifully written and a great read. Great character development and hard to put down. Historical time is described in a way that takes you back in that war period and you are there. The blind girl uses her senses to see and feel very intensely. A wonderful book club pick!
This was one of those books that is hard to put down, but one doesn't want to end. This book provides two uncommon views of WWII as described through believable characters and situations. Their circumstances and abilities/disabilities reflect what many above average Europeans experienced during the war.
Doerr's novel is overtly creative and truly brings the unseen issues of war to the firefrint. I feel in love with both Marie-Laure and Werner very soon after I started the book. My overall rating of five stars for this novel sho u of indicate to any prose time reader that this is a text if high quality.
Well written historical fiction. I can see why it won the Pulitzer Prize. Delves into the human psyche and begs the question of how the reader would have acted under similar dire circumstances. Or does one do whatever it takes to stay alive? Not all heroes survive but their sacrifice is never forgotten.
I had heard that this was a good book but was not sure that I wanted to read another WWII story. I am so glad that I did.  This is a fascinating look at individuals and what was happening during this period. It is compassionate and very a very different story from my expectation.  I highly recommend it.
A trio of stories entwine to create a beautiful WWII story. It was so enticing that I stayed up hours reading. One thing I didn't enjoy was the occasional flash forward. I also didn't enjoy the deaths and suffering but it was a part of life in that time. (At one point I shouted "No they can't die!).
This book will go on my top 10 (current) list.  Even though moving from one time to another is not an appreciated style for me, this book was specific, detailed and characters well develop so as to follow well.  I also was intrigued by the writers style so as to read all, not skipping unwanted verbiage.
This complex novel with the most beautiful use of language  that I have ever seen in a novel is stellar from start to finish. What a pleasure to spend time with the complex, well developed cast of characters in this incredibly exciting, suspenseful, complex novel. This book is like a great work of art.
I was impressed by some of the skills developed by the characters, and yet left guessing about the lives and backgrounds of others, such as Etienne.<br/>It did not live up to it's hype as far as I was concerned- perhaps I have read too many WWII novels about the lives of those living in the war zones.
This book didn't draw me in until after the first 100 pages, so I hesitate to give it more than 4.  However, after that, I could not put this book down.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it just gets better and better.  It's about family, love, grief, devastation, war, and compassion.  Read it!
Extraordinary book that engenders many emotions and leaves the reader breathless trying to anticipate when and how the lives of the two principal characters will finally intersect.  The characters are beautifully drawn; the violence of World War II, both overt and covert, is extraordinarily disturbing.
Engaging historical fiction about a WWII event few people are aware of. Told from the point of view of a young French girl and a German youth. Their lives touch only tangentially but each has a profound effect on the other. The story goes on a bit too long in the author's attempt to wrap up loose ends.
The writing is beautiful. The characters are tragic and touching.  They lose all because of the viciousness and cruelty of man. They are broken but resplendent. They suffer in the terrible world they are born into to survive beautifully broken.<br/>I loved it and would le to read another of his books.
Well developed, interesting characters deal with survival during horrific war conditions. The author brings a fresh, multi-faceted perspective to each of them. Beautiful, well-paced writing brings unique depth to well-trod literary ground of WWII. We'll be seeing press about a movie being made any day.
Anthony Doerr transported me to different dimensions.  The reader can SEE through the eyes of his characters, understand what they feel, get under their skin. Despite the horrors of the war he narrates, the book is optimistic in that it dwells on the good that can't be crushed by evil . Wonderful book.
I loved the way the different lives of the characters were woven together so beautifully -  even when their paths crossed only briefly. Such good storytelling. And somehow learning about world through the eyes of the blind protagonist made the images in my own mind so much more vivid. Loved this story.
This really was an wonderful book, probably one of the best I've read in a long time. While it was not a mystery, it was hard to put down. The author told a World War II story from the perspective of 2 children both affected by the war but in very different and traumatic ways. It was just a great book.
This was an interesting story of the war from both sides. The development of each character was well done.  The humanity of the main characters was developed into an understanding of what each side was taught by their elders.  I enjoyed the courage of the main characters withstanding the throes of war.
This is wonderful story very well written. A blind girl in Paris and an orphan German boy with a talent for radio repair set on a path of convergence as WWII progress. The author sets the stage well and allows the reader to engage each character along the way. It is one of the finer books I have read.
As a WWII buff, this book took me completely by surprise.  To read "personal" stories of the German invasions and occupations from people that actually experienced it, fictional or not, was enlightening and gave another tier of understanding.  The ending(s) were sad, surprising and unexpected.
The time shifts in the story telling were at times disorienting, but necessary. The past and present needed to be told side by side, in order to take the reader from safety to danger and back again. he topic, told from two perspectives, was engaging and informative. Excellent read, well-crafted story.
This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. What magnificent skill this author has to bring such brilliantly defined characters to life. I just finished. I will turn to page one and start over again, as I don't want to let go of Marie and Etienne and Werner and Frederick. A wonderful book.
I had not read a book from this author, but decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed in it at all. I loved the history part of the story and the fact that I currently live in Germany and know most of the places mentioned, made this book absolutely interesting. Will definitely read another one.
I;ve read so many stories pertaining to that period in time WW11,this was very different,the upheaval of war was set in a small coastal town in France, The story starts in the mid-thirties,and continues through the bombing by allies,of this beautiful sea side town,and many stories develop in this era.
Loved this book! A riveting and very well written story. Every page stays with you. If you like the human interest side of history (with lots of twists) this one will keep you turning the page...and stay with you long after you're finished. It's one that makes you want to start at the beginning again.
Intense and absorbing read.  One of those novels where you repeatedly find saying to yourself.....'well, i'll read just one more chapter"....and the next thing you know you're half way through.  Filled with easily imagined characters that are sensitively and intelligently developed.  A great read!
Beautifully, simply written.  With short, accessible chapters alternating between two war torn lives, The book reads like a children's book yet has depth and poignancy.  It is a romance and an exciting adventure too.  The tension builds and builds with an undercurrent of gentleness.  Highly recommend.
I had to plod through this book but I am surely glad that I did.  Sad to say I remember W W 2 only too well and was lucky to live in the USA where we sent our boys to fight bravely for us but did not really have such destruction all around us as they did overseas.  Makes me appreciate life a bit more.
Just read this book. Very timely with the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.<br/>Such a wonderful story of love and family with a day to day telling of the difficulties many endured during those trying times. Sometimes a book grabs you returning you to events upon which you enjoy reflecting.
This is the best book I've read in many years. A beautiful story that provides a fresh perspective of WWII from the eyes of children. With two key characters on opposite sides, both innocent and trying to make the best of their shattered lives. This is an eye opening novel that is very relevant today.
This book was a book club selection. At first, I wasn't sure I would like it,but as I read I became fascinated with the lives of the French girl and the German boy. While it is an informative log of what was happening in WWII, it was one of the most beautifully written books I've read in a long time.
This is a wonderful book by an extremely talented writer. His characters are well drawn and memorable. The impact of war on individuals and families is realized slowly, as hope gives way to sorrow and the need to prepare for battle ultimately causes the German young man to question his own character.
This story of WWII is told exquisitely through a young German boy soldier and a blind French girl.  The book, 10 years in the writing,  paints scenes,  develops characters,  and tells the tale of war with such beauty,  heart,  and sorrow.  One of my all-time favorite books.  A major literary triumph.
A wonderful, wonderful, beautifully written novel.  It was like reading velvet.  Definitely the best thing I've read this year.  At one point, I had to put my head down to absorb what I had just read.  I didn't want the book to end.  And, now it will not.  Doerr's brilliant writing will stay with me.
Excellent book by one of the best writers I have read. If writing teachers instruct students to "show" the audience rather than just "tell" them, this would be the perfect novel to illustrate that skill. I cared about every thought and movement of the characters. Bravo, Anthony Doerr!
This is a beautifully crafted and written novel.  Doerr masterfully integrates the lives of both the main characters as well as providing the background that bring the two together at a fateful moment in history.  If you enjoy history and its effect upon the lives of people, you will enjoy this book.
This book is a must read.  From the beginning to the ending it keeps you engrossed in the story.  The depiction of the characters is compelling and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Thank you Mr. Doerr for one heck of a book.<br/><br/>It's been quite some time since I fully enjoyed a great book!
So immensely well written that I was sure he had lived in Europe during the period. Could not ( neither could friends) put the book down. The phrases are unexpected, details colorful, twists in the story so moving, real, personages with true human virtue and vice. A masterpiece. Brunno Ristow,D, FACS
Heartbreaking in its perspective and definitive in its characters, doerr has told not just another tale of war. The infinitesimal details of every human heart are revealed in each character, culminating in a hive of love and loss and memory, of generations and those things carried forward. Recommend.
I viewed this more as a character study than a book about WWII.  It was quite different due to the two main characters involved and their war situations.  Trying to put yourself into the position of a blind teenager needing to survive a war situation is a challenge, and I found that most interesting.
This was a moving novel that gives two perspectives of World War II simultaneously: that of a German soldier and a blind girl living in occupied France.  The details of war are impressive, but so too is the vivid, lyrical imagery that mimics all the creative minds that were stymied during this time.
This is the first book in a wartime setting I had read that was narrated from the point of view of minor children for the most part. I found it to be especially heart-rending and poignant as a result. Well plotted but does leave some questions unanswered. I plan to read other works by Anthony Doerr.
The author tells a WWII story through the "eyes" of two children/adolescents.  I appreciated that this wasn't just good vs evil and that the character development was complex although it would have been nice to know more about a couple of the supporting characters such as the housekeeper.  .
I read this book while touring Europe. The story became very clear and realistic. We as Americans often ask how the Germans could be apart of Hitlers dominance? All the Light allowed me to see how the lives of ordinary but yet not so ordinary people especially children evolved in the wartime effort.
Seeing the world through the eyes of different people during and after World War I, including a blind girl, gives the reader a genuine understanding of the effects the war had that were everlasting.  It is historically correct but very compelling reading as you follow the different characters lives.
The book is a well written story of the events of the second world was seen through the eyes (one blind) of young people..It was some times difficult to follow the plot as the chapters would flow from one individual (the blind girl)  and the talented young man.  I would recommend the book to others.
I enjoyed this book so much more than I had anticipated.  I have read a lot of circa-WWII books but, for some reason, this one really made me think of what trials and tribulations both the French and the Germans went through during and post-WWII.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.
One of the most beautifully written books I have read in several years.  Not as fond of back and forth stories but then Michner was good at that and I loved all of his works, too.  Also, found myself going to the dictionary 7 or 8 times - that seldom happens any more.  Just a fabulous read !!!!!!!!!
This book captured me from the beginning with the unusual title to the strength of the main characters. I felt like I was a part of them as the plot developed and the movement back and forth between them and their thoughts and struggles. My kind of story, both tender and intriguing at the same time.
Beautifully written. Tension filled and a testament to the resilience of the people to survive the awful conditions of WW 2.The determination of Marie in spite of her blindness is wonderful. The events that lead Warner to her home remarkable. I was truly touched by this story. Bravo!! And thank you.
A beautifully written tale. Set in the turmoil and turbulence of Europe during the 2nd World War, it is a story of despair and hope, of sin and redemption, of what was and what might have been. If this book doesn't move you to tears, you are made of stone. The best new novel I've read in many years.
The story held my attention with the characters well drawn. Sometimes the format was a bit confusing but still able to keep the stream of the story in hand. The behaviour of the Nazis even though known through the years, still held the unimaginable horror of that time in history. When will we learn?
Not really a "fun" read, that's for sure! The story begins in the mid-thirties, the author neatly contrasts the lives of a German boy and a blind French girl, and how they ultimately come together, if however briefly. Its a moving and at times uplifting story, most certainly worth your time.
Well-written, meticulously laid out in shifting of time and place. A book that's difficult to put down, as the story keeps pulling the reader along. Interesting for everyone, and especially those who enjoy books written about times, places and characters involved by choice or chance in World War II.
I recommend this book.  Anthony Doerr's writing in this book is filled with all the things we see.  Yet reading his written words we "see".  It is a pleasure to read a book so well written you can smell the sea, feel the stone and taste the bread.<br/>Looking for another Doerr book to read.
I put off reading this book for a while; the description didn't seem to attract my attention but then I gave in because of all the awards it won and because it was always a recommended reading based on other books I've read.  I was so glad that I finally read it.  What a great, well written story!!
I absollutely loved this book....history approached from a very different perspective...and magical in many respects...I actually read it twice,<br/>and enjoyed it the second time as much as the first time....also attended the author's talk at Chautauqua recently (attendance was in record levels).
We chose this book for our family book club this summer.  We are all reading it in sections and reporting back to the group.  This book is a hit with all of us, men and women alike.  We are not all the way through the book, so I cannot give you my final opinion.  So far, it is better than expected.
It took me a while to connect with the characters at first, but I was glad I stuck with it.  This book is well-written with very "pretty" sentences which in no way got in the way of the plot.  Sensory-loaded images, especially from the blind character's point of view.  It was worth reading.
All the Light We Cannot See was a well written, profound story of love and compassion during a time of hatred and warfare. The characters are so beautifully developed that you instinctively feel their pain and joy, agony and love.  I could not put this book down until the very last page was turned!
I am sure many people would enjoy this. However I lived thru this terrible war as a very young girl. Saw all the terrible news reels at the movies. The atrocities on our people by the German's & the Japenese, so I personally am glad to be finished with it & all the memories it brings to mind. Betty
Bittersweet tale of love, war, and redemption.  Although movers through time proved awkward, ir did finally make sense.<br/><br/>The author helped us to inderstand the charscterst through deeds, but a bit  of history on the surviving soldier would have helped the reader understand his motivation.
This is an awesome story about the intertwined lives of people living the horrors of World War II. It focuses on a small town on the coast of Brittany and the lives that crisscross there. Not for those who want strategy and troup movements, but for those who want the inner lives of ordinary people.
Wow...a story that grabs ahold of you and doesn't let you go until the end. I'm not a usual reader of WWII novels and Nazi Germany but this story is different - sadness & hope -redemption - power of love. Beautifully told - characters that you will remember long after the book is done. A must read!
Enjoyable and thought-provoking book, with passages of real beauty and craft.  The chief villain was a bit too broadly drawn and similarly, the most moral minor character was a touch cartoonish, but these are minor quibbles that only just keep me from rating this book a 5.  A most worthwhile piece,
The writing was simply excellent. I couldn't put it down. There were some graphic and horrible scenes involving the Nazis, but  that is not unusual in a story about WWII. It really gives a slice of the lives of people living during the war and inside the war as well as growing up during that time.
A little slow getting started but was very good once i got into it.  Would have given it 5 stars if it had a different ending.  Was well written but sad and I can't recommend it.  I like books with happy endings and it would have been so easy to give this one.  I bet the movie will end differently.
Liked the juxtaposition of the French-German characters during this WW2  drama.  The descriptive manner the author uses to present a terrifying time in history grips the reader, creating a feeling of presence.  The humanity of people, no matter nationality, shines through like a glittering diamond.
Solid writing fundamentals. Scattered, viewpoint-wise, but possibly intentionally so (why else would there be 178 chapters in 540 pages?). Steady, almost metronomic, pacing mutes the attempts at suspense, almost to the point of being monotone.<br/><br/>Befuddled by the laude heaped on this novel.
This book is hard to read but I did enjoy it.  The story it tells is of a difficult time in our history and one we do not always want to read about.  But it is very real in it's depiction of World War II.  I understand why the book has garnered the acclaim.  It is well written and very descriptive.
The story was beautifully written.  The intricate descriptions made it come to life. However, I found myself getting very tired, waiting for something that I never received, all the way to the final word. I really wanted to love this book as much as others in the same genera. Sadly, it just didn't.
I loved the book, and the vivid descriptions of the historical period that it was set in. I must admit that it took me awhile to get past my confusion as the book jumped back and forth to different time periods with each of the characters. I will definitely recommend this beautifully written story.
This is a magnificently written and researched book set in Germany and France preceding and during WWII. Doerr brings his characters to life masterfully, leaving one with the feeling of having read history, not fiction. The writing style is beautifully lyrical, and the characters are unforgettable.
An extraordinary book.  It is hard to put this book down once you start reading it.  From the first page to the very last page, I found myself engrossed in the lives of the characters as well as the historical accounts of World War II in France and Germany.  It is a beautifully written tragic tale.
I'm looking forward to Alzheimer's so I can forget the details of this book and read it again. I was absolutely lost in the rich fabric of the story and reading it was like falling into a swiftly flowing river that I couldn't escape from, but really enjoyed the journey! A wonderful, wonderful read!
This book ranks in the top ten of any I've read.  Extremely well written, almost like poetry.  Mixing of two stories that eventually become intertwined helps with the quality of the book.  Doerr does a a great job with emotions, innermost thoughts of characters using many different kinds of images.
I enjoyed this story a lot. It provided a really vivid picture of the difficulties faced by people during this time period. The author did a good job of building the characters piece by piece, so that you felt you knew them on a deeper level by the end of the story. I highly recommend this novel.
A very well written book from a different perspective. Telling the story by preteen/teens is very effective especially because WW II horror is actually quite common as so many books describe events that take place during this time period.  It is definitely deserving of all the awards it received!
This may be my all time favorite book. It was a pure delight. The insights into the perceptions of the two main protagonists were captivating. My envelope was constantly stretched, gently for the most part, and with wonderful imagery. The prose is, at times, so elegant that it feels like poetry.
Characters that will live on in my mind, settings that brought back my years living in Europe, a narrative that kept me engaged and wondering how all the puzzle pieces would mesh and a theme so important to consider, all wrapped in a tone of kindness and wonder.  My best read since The Goldfinch.
Interesting, but too long.  I like reading about how people lived and survived or died during that period of history.<br/>Could have been reduced and perhaps been a more enjoyable read. Too much emphasis on things most people<br/>know little about, so some of the detail could have been reduced.
Very unusual and creative storyline.  Since the lead charater is blind, she must use all her other senses to describe her world and experiences.  The quality of writing surpasses literature and becomes pure prose.  Enjoyed this book immensely.  Will definately seek out other works by this author.
I read this book for book club two months ago.  I loved the writing style, the characters and the story.  As I continue to read books, both non-fiction and fiction, my mind drifts back to this book and how much I enjoyed it.  It also generated a great book club discussion.  I highly recommend it!
I have read so many fictions on WWII but this is my all time favourite! The story is beautiful and the characters were full of depth and personality that I felt so connected to each of them.  It's about family, hope and love amidst the ugliness of war.  I read it in 3 days, could not put it down!
This was clearly the best book of the year for me. I love the writing and the storyline. Being a fan of military and detective novels, this book was clearly a very good change of pace.  I have recommended the book to most of my friends who like intellectual and well written novels like this book.
Although fiction this was a very very well written book.  I was sorry when it was over.  While I greatly enjoyed this book the author was a bit long winded in his descriptions.  For me, some of it was a little too much information but I got used to it.  It touched my emotions.  So glad I read it!
This book was captivating, inspiring, and creatively written. I couldn't put it down, and I loved that there was plenty left to the imagination for a time period in which writers often give immense detail. Doerr knew what needed to be said and what didn't. I recommend this to anyone and everyone!
I found the book very interesting in how it presented both sides of the war from the viewpoint of young people.  They had no say in what happened but faced the consequences of the war.  I also liked the postwar followup.  So often you are left handing at the end of the book wanting a resolution.
I commend the author for excellent and in-depth character development. The reader gets to know the characters well and can sense their struggles and fears as they make their way through WWII. Each character experiencing the war in their own way. Heart-wrenching, beautiful and deep.  A good read.
Actually a sad tale of two people who dealt with what life handed them in a courageous fashion.  Growing up in the throws of Hitler's regime the protagonists survived in stellar manners.  How they come into each other's world makes the reader believe in predestination.  A good read well written.
Beautifully written. So interesting how the story's threads find each other and weave together. Love how it wrapped up, yet wish it would have kept going. Aside from the story, some of the lesser - known facts about living conditions and political realities of WWII seemed really well researched.
I really enjoyed this book, especially the lyrical writing. No wonder it won a Pulitzer! The World War II theme is one I have read in several books, but this one is different because of the complicated characters. It may not be for everyone, but it appealed to my enjoyment of science and nature.
This was an excellent story that provides insight into the second world war and those in Europe that were directly effected. It's hard to believe that at the end of the war, Germany had 11 and 13 year old and elderly men fighting. It make you realize that the people of Germany were also victims.
There's a quietness about this book that I really enjoyed.  The two main characters are well developed and I became attached to them, wanting them both to succeed.  I know it's a great book when I can't wait to finish it, but at the same time I make myself go slow because I don't want it to end.
Very interesting characters and a well-told interesting story.  But the writing style is magnificent. Strong observations about the effects of World War II on the people of France and Germany.  Read it on my Kindle, but ordered hardback for more leisurely encore read to savor the story-telling..
The book came highly recommended and it has been on the best seller list for quite some time, but I found it plodding and loaded with way too much detail. Yes, the language was beautiful, but I read more for the plot of the story and this took too long to get there. I couldn't wait to finish it.
Great writing and turns what could have been a dull or predictable story into a wonderful tale about life, loss, hope, darkness, and purpose. There are a couple scenes (it's a war!) that are mature, but seen through the eyes of a child it's not something that takes center stage. Loved this book.
So exquisitely written and constructed.  A story that will carry forward to generations just as it took us all back, to times we knew, just not quite like this. Sitting quietly in your whole self. A world you know you will have to leave behind, reading, not wanting, but needing to know, the end.
Everyone should read this book.  Beautiful writing.  I had not read any of Anthony Doerr's work before, it was an exciting read.  Illustrations one could just "see", told with an insightful eye.  I loved this and wish I could read it again!  There are no disappointments on these pages!!!
One of my favorite books!  Lyrically written with unconventional characters, this book will stay with you long after you put it down. Often I'll read a book and can't tell you what it's about within a few weeks of reading. Not this one!  I loved the style, characters and the heartbreaking story.
This book was written from a different perspective. A very young German boy forced into the German army and a young blind girl from Paris. I enjoyed the book as I learned even more about the circumstances surrounding this War. I. however, kept waiting for a deeper tie between the two characters.
Great read!  Lot's of interesting information re WW II.  Great insights of the German and French perspectives.  Also some personal touches and reflections on loved ones.  I liked the character development and descriptions of what was occurring .  You could almost picture yourself as being there.
This was an amazingly descriptive book.  It was so well-written.  The character development was awesome and the story-telling was riveting.  I carried everywhere I went until I finished it and then wanted more.  This book is first-person from the viewpoint of several angles in the World War II.
This book drew me in from page one. I cared about the characters and what happened to them. My book group enjoyed the story for the most part, but we agreed it would have been easier to read if it were chronological instead of jumping back and forth in time. However, easier isn't always better.
Masterfully plotted. Characters easy for a reader to care about apply just the correct tension to keep you reading. An enjoyable balance of human frailty and the beauty to be found when you bother to notice it. A much needed novel.<br/><br/>Bradley Ernst, Author of "The New York Copy"
Absolutely beautiful story. I wasn't sure if I would like it based on the summary, but it was so well written, I couldn't put it down. The story is painted in your mind from both characters' perspectives so you feel as though you are experiencing just what they are experiencing. Excellent read.
I don't have many words to describe this book. Life is a series of events, they are in some ways entwined.<br/>Nothing is black and white, there are a lot of grays in life.<br/>There always will be a chance to make a difference to trascend, to do something worthy.<br/>It's a personal choice.
It sustained my interest to the end and provided information and insights to World War II as background to the lives and trials of the players.  I felt that somehow the writer was an observer even though often writing as if first person, but I was reluctant to part company with them at the end.
Wonderful story!  The author was extremely thorough describing the backgrounds of the subject characters, a little too much for me, as I like the story to move along, and I almost put it down several times.  That being said, 3/4 of the way through, it became a thriller and worth the time spent.
This is such a rich story, I could not put it down. The author weaves many threads and characters together through time and space. The end is bittersweet as they come together in shared loss. The descriptions throughout are so beautiful that you feel as though you are there with the characters.
A compelling story of two children as they grow up in the midst of World War 11.  Marie-Laure, a blind child and Werner , a very bright student bright into  "special " school to help the Hitler regime .  It intertwines between the two and keeps the reader totally engrossed in the story.
Each chapter is a short beautiful look at people and place caught in the war. The protagonists begin the war as children, one a girl of privlage in Paris the other an orphan boy in a mining town in Germany.  Their lives slowly drift toward a confrontation facilitated by their interest in radio.
This book will always be in my heart and in my thoughts.  It is both horrible and wonderful at the same time.  The characters are lovable, courageous, and unforgettable.  I may read it again, because there are so many facets to the plot.  Please take the time to read it and ponder.  Joan Fowler
Engrossing read.  Characters espouse a world view that I had to remind myself is not true.  I imagine that people who live through wars would have that kind outlook.  Only gave 4 stars because the book switches between character perspectives, and it seemed that at times the switch was too fast.
This book was wonderful. The characters were well developed and very easy to love and sympathize with. Warner is conflicted between duty to the Reich and doing what’s right. Marie is heroic as is her father, uncle and the housekeeper – all in a believable way.<br/>I highly recommend this book.
Really just two characters, how their lives intertwine at the end which you know would happen. How a young desperate  child who has  so little, becomes a German Nazi. A pretty fast read but quite different when it takes the view of a young soldier and a blind French girl. What they both endure.
The characters are wonderfully developed in this excellent read.  Of all the books I've read about various aspects of WWII and the occupation, camps, resistance, this was such a different story.  It was a great story I am recommending enthusiastically to our book club and other reading friends.
I have not yet finished this book, but I love it so far.  Doerr does a great job of making you feel you are right there with the characters, hearing what they hear, smelling, seeing everything around them.  Their decisions during a very dangerous place and time become completely understandable.
I keep saying I am not going to read another novel set in or around WWII.  I keep reading them - and this book is why.  Like The Book Thief, it is pure poetry.  Written with so much heart, intelligence and soul.  You care about all the characters, even the ugly ones.  Thank you, Anthony Doerr.
I loved this book. It's sense of history, tragedy, fortitude and compassion were so skilfully drawn. It engaged me in their lives and couldn't let them go. I had to keep reading. The story line/s were so skilfully interwoven yet separated out it wasn't until close to the end that they came together in a very believable way.
Great read with absorbing details and a twist on perspectives.  The view into a outcast German living and serving in the Wermacht was fresh and different. The perspective from a French view into the Nazi occupation and ordinary lives was also revealing and interesting. This a really good book!
A new and illuminating (pun intended) take on World War II with lots of twists and turns, plus interesting characters and plot line.  The author did a superb job of capturing all the inconsistencies of the war, and the personal battles of people caught up in the worst of living a daily horror.
A lovely,poignant story that takes place in Germany and France during WWII.  The reader is readily brought into the lives of the two protagonists, a blind French girl and orphan German boy.  This is the kind of book one does not want to put down!  It also reminds us that "war is hell" and fruitless.
How can a story be so beautifully written yet bring home the horror of war?  Visit the war torn countries of France and Germany. Walk in the shoes of the common people who inhabited the everyday villages and cities and confronted what we could only imagine. A beautiful story written with love.
My husband and I both loved this book. Strong, resilient characters and a whopper of an intricate plot set at the ending of WWII. Makes a person feel like an idiot for complaining about any of our minor day to day problems or inconveniences. I now want to see what else this author has written!
This book brought tears to my eyes and it is a wondrous story. To me it struck home because my family also left Paris with the French surrender. My mother is gone but I thank the author for helping me remember her through the lives of his characters. Thank you Anthony for this wonderful story.
Amazing. Through his skillfully constructed sentences I was transported to a gruesome time in modern history where I could see, touch, taste, hear and smell the story. And through it all, though scarred by the actions of evil, the memories and actions of the good and humanity are what remains.
The book is very well written, although I did get confused occasionally as to which year was the focus of the different chapters.  The main characters are inspiring and for those who enjoy reading a novel where the good guys are truly good and the bad guys are purely evil, this one is for you.
one of the few literary books I've read this year.. I was particularly impressed by the use of color, light, and music to describe things and express emotions.<br/>Doerr's  technique of going back and forth in time, and the use of short segments, added to the rhythm and suspense of the story.
One of the best books I have ever read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Mr. Doerr writes beautifully and for a long book, the short chapters make it go by so quickly.  His character development is amazing.  I could go on forever about this book but all I will say is read it!!! You are in for a wonderful treat.
For me, this book was about the journey.  Its poetic prose.  A few chapters in and it did not matter to me where we went, author and reader, i just wanted to be led there.  This book became a companion and i was sad yet satisfied when it came to an end.  A wonderful story, beautifully written.
A deeply moving, engaging story.  Some novels capture you with 'what happened next' and you rush along trying to find out what DID happen.  I savored every word of this novel because the writing was so beautiful. If you thought we had exhausted the subject of World War II, you'll be surprised.
An interesting and touching story taking place during WW 2 without relying heavily on violence and gruesome details.  It also brings to life uncommon aspects of the Natural History Museum in Paris and the beautiful city of St Malo.  The mix up of periods in the story can be slightly confusing.
I can see why this book was such a popular success, if not quite why it was a critical one. Like "The Kite Runner," it packages well-known historical tragedy in high melodrama, with "the most innocent victims" (children) as protagonists and a villain so cartoonish he really does just about slither around hissing "My precioussssss....." The very short chapters are designed to hold the shortest attention span in thrall, and the pileup of cliffhangers it all leads toward is shamelessly over-rigged. I would have found all this easier to stomach--and it was certainly easy to read, until it just got too absurdly contrived--if Doerr didn't take himself so seriously, and practically congratulate himself on the seriousness of his endeavor at peak moments when he literally feels called upon to halt the action and remind you that this is about LIFE, dammit, right down to the molecular and up to the interplanetary and mind-of-God level. The epilogues re-introduce a certain degree of sobering reality, which is nice, but by then the b.s. factor had risen so high for me that I couldn't really respect the book. I totally get why people would love it, and I wouldn't tell some I know NOT to read it, because they'd very likely enjoy it. But expecting a piece of literary fiction, it was way too baldly sentimental and manipulative for my tastes. Doerr views good and evil in comfortingly simplistic terms, when the truth about wartime is that it coaxes and/or forces people into accepting compromising moral greyzones they couldn't imagine themselves in under different circumstances. That's the whole point of great (like Ursula Hegi's "Stones from the River") or good ("The Book Thief," etc.) novels with themes very similar to this one. But Doerr's pandering stays too safe to risk any moral ambiguity.<br/><br/>P.S. Why some books (like "The Book Thief") are marketed as "Young Adult" is often a mystery to me, but "All the Light" is one novel I'm surprised WASN'T marketed as a YA title.
Early in the book it's hard to tell just who is invading whom. Although that might be deliberate as it's clarified later. Reasons for French migrations prior to the war would have made an interesting discussion, missing from this shallow story. Marie's father is not credited with clairvoyance. Characters are appealing, but thinly drawn. Doerr engages in staccato style sentence structure. The rapid switching of scene after each short chapter works during the buildup but becomes annoying when tension builds late in the novel. There is a triple conjunction of plot threads that come together a bit too fast, culminating in two of the protagonists trapped in a hotel that s likened to Jules Verne's Nautilus. There are literary references to Verne, Dumas, Audabon and others. The most interesting aspect is the geography centered on Saint-Malo and Essen.<br/><br/>Errors abound. The jewel was first small then large, then it seems to get smaller again. The German hyperinflation was over well before 1934. Grocery prices would not have been expressed in millions of the new reichsmarks. That one destroys credibility of any further politics or economics incorporated in the book. A character that eats a roasted duck every day is neither realistic nor interesting. No self respecting moth would flutter against a window in a rainstorm. He refers to a Grundig tube radio, What else would it be? T-34 tanks with the White Russian army in France in 1945 is either very interesting or very anachronistic. I suspect the latter.<br/><br/>There is little originality. The French-German connection was better done in “Sarah's Key.”  Limiting the use of radio for propaganda has been well covered in books and movies. The reference to the German protagonist fixing radios by thinking is taken directly from “Surely You are Joking, Mr. Feynman.”<br/><br/>Can an electromagnetic frequency range beyond sight properly be called light? Doerr says zero to infinity. That requires a far deeper explanation than provided here. My feeling is that the amateur science spoils an otherwise clever title allusion to the sightless protagonist.<br/><br/>Insertion of the trig equation for triangulating the location of a radio transmitter from two receiver locations (page 153) is almost humorous. It's not wrong, but the more direct form: d = L / (cot α + cot β ) is simpler for both derivation and calculation, avoiding the need for the author's angle summing method. Also it doesn't cover the general case where the detecting receiver is moving towards the transmitter. Stephen Hawking famously remarked that each equation cuts book sales in half. Apparently that doesn't apply when the equation lacks contextual significance. It's a case of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. In this case it's very little. The attempt to make literature out of “triangles” falls flat.<br/><br/>The book lacks a map. A glossary with a few German words and some mollusk related terminology would also help. The book contains little of significance.
Pulitzer Prize Winning . . . really?  Why?  The book was okay as I began reading it, but nearing the end I was "Meh."  Once the story ended I was kind of irritated.  "Really?  Really?  That's it?  That's all it was about?"  There was no happy ending; no sad ending; just an empty ending of a couple story lines.  1.  Frederick's beating?  The point is?  2.  The two deaths?  Okay; if that was the case, why did we even need the info of her dad after he was taken?  Where did Werner's mysterious fever come from?  What was the point of his death like that?  3.  Etienne was interesting in some ways, but was treated as one would write about the actions of an eccentric uncle, who was surprisingly able to be depended upon, rather than a man debilitated for decades by mental angst.  4.  The stone was just annoying.  I never did care about it.  It was like a fly to be batted away; it added nothing to the story.  5.  Possibly I was the most irritated (and what has lingered) with was when Volkheimer visited the sister, and when the sister visited Marie-Laure---NONE of them opened up with any conversation or emotion.  We were hardly let in with more than a couple sentences of "nothing" conversation.  Perhaps the author could not see people so directed by the war actually opening up.  However, as the reader, their interactions were wholly unsatisfactory.  There were soft things that could have been said to give a balm around the heart, both for those left behind and for the reader.  Do I think many, like Marie-Laure, lived through the war and lived to a ripe old age with a satisfactory age, with just remnants of memories that hold no bearing to current generations?  Sure.  Still a crummy ending.  I read the other reviews, and there were many points I agreed with that were made by reviewers who gave one or two stars to this book.
I can't believe this book got such high reviews and praise.  The style is written in is terrible with every chapter jumping to a different character.  I had to go back and read parts over again many times and I even put this book away about a 1/3 of the way in and had no desire to finish it.  After going back and reading the reviews, I decided to finish it after all and kept telling myself that it was bound to get better.  Nope.  I'm disappointed that I wasted my time on this book.  It went on and on and on without saying a lot of anything.  Well, unless you count describing all of the scenery.  It did plenty of that but the character development was non-existent.  If you want an example of going on and on and on, this is ONE SENTENCE found in the book:<br/><br/>Not all that far from her, Jutta Pfennig sleeps in the ultramarine shadows of the girls’ dormitory and dreams of light thickening and settling across a field like snow; and not all that far from Jutta, the führer raises a glass of warm (but never boiled) milk to his lips, a slice of Oldenburg black bread on his plate and a whole apple beside it, his daily breakfast; while in a ravine outside Kiev, two inmates rub their hands in sand because they have become slippery, and then they take up the stretcher again while a sonderkommando stirs the fire below them with a steel pole; a wagtail flits from flagstone to flagstone in a courtyard in Berlin, searching for snails to eat; and at the Napola school at Schulpforta, one hundred and nineteen twelve- and thirteen-year-olds wait in a queue behind a truck to be handed thirty-pound antitank land mines, boys who, in almost exactly eight months, marooned amid the Russian advance, the entire school cut off like an island, will be given a box of the Reich’s last bitter chocolate and Wehrmacht helmets salvaged from dead soldiers, and then this final harvest of the nation’s youth will rush out with the chocolate melting in their guts and overlarge helmets bobbing on their shorn heads and sixty Panzerfaust rocket launchers in their hands in a last spasm of futility to defend a bridge that no longer requires defending, while T-34 tanks from the White Russian army come clicking and rumbling toward them to destroy them all, every last child; dawn in Saint-Malo, and there is a twitch on the other side of the wardrobe— Werner hears Marie-Laure inhale, Marie-Laure hears Werner scrape three fingernails across the wood, a sound not unlike the sound of a record coursing beneath the surface of a needle, their faces an arm’s reach apart.<br/><br/>Who writes like that?  Anyone would lose interest!  Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  .
Hypnotic, beautiful prose, deeply affecting, incredibly depressing (to me)...of course, what should I expect, a WWII book about a blind little French girl and a sensitive German boy forced into the Hitler Youth should have a happy ending? I read a Kindle sample, was hooked and got on the long library waiting list; once I got the book and started reading beyond the first 50 pages or so I was still enjoying the beautiful prose and engrossed in the characters of Werner, Jutta, Marie-Laure and her father, but then came the first chronological jump. Never a favorite plot device of mine unless essential to the story, I found it jarring and irritating here; I also could not get into the sub-plot about the precious diamond that disappeared from the Paris museum and the creepy Von Rumpel's fanatical hunt for it. That whole part of the story felt like an awkward distraction tacked on to from a different story and I found myself skimming the chapters concerning Von Rumpel - by the end I felt like cutting this part of the book would've tightened the rambling narrative up considerably.<br/><br/>Despite those criticisms I am glad I read this book, although it left me feeling emotionally raw; I read for enjoyment and to be entertained, and I often find modern fiction too dark, depressing and angst-filled. I'm a news junkie who reads several on-line news outlets daily and tries to catch "NewsHour" and my local news every night, so for my pleasure reading I generally choose fiction (historical mysteries and historical fiction mostly along with an occasional romance for light relief), avoiding books like this except for a few times a year. The nightly news is heartbreaking enough - books like this flesh out the horrid news stories about current wars and bring the subsequent terror and displacement they cause closer and closer, reminding you as you watch the latest news from Iraq or Syria that those quick screen shots of terrified civilians fleeing atrocities are today's Marie-Laure and her father and all of those terrified Parisian refugees.<br/><br/>Characters like Werner, Frau Elena, Jutta, Ettiene and Frederick burrow into my heart and mind and will haunt me for awhile. No spoilers, but after the scene where Werner wakes to find Frederick has left school I had to take a break and read something else for a day or so before I could make myself pick the book up again; these two were my favorite characters and I really couldn't take much more. Maybe these two got to me so much because I have a teenaged son, but I never thought I'd be moved to tears over the brutal challenges faced by two German boys forced to join the Hitler Youth! Frankly once I put the book down I found it hard to get back into it; I felt as it the promise of the first half of the book somewhat fell apart in the second half and I lost patience with the jumping back and forth. I skimmed the last quarter or so to find out what happened to all of the characters (especially Werner) and was haunted by Volkheimer's fond words to him - "What you could be." Beautiful prose, deeply affecting (if not quite my cup of tea), I can see why this book deserves all the buzz it has received.
I'm glad I'm not the only person who didn't love "All The Light We Cannot See." I read it for my book club and everyone else in our group loved it, so obviously mine is a minority opinion. Briefly, it tells the story of Marie-Laure, a Parisian girl who loses her sight at the age of six, Werner, a German orphan boy, and Van Rumpel, a German officer looking for a very valuable, possibly cursed diamond that the Nazis want to get hold of, before and during World War II. It shifts back and forth in time narrating the events that shape the characters and the hunt for the diamond. Marie-Laure and Werner are teenagers when they meet each other and Van Rumpel in 1944 in the Brittany village of Saint-Malo, just as the Allied Forces start bombing. Werner, a gifted technician, is a radioman in the German army, and Marie-Laure and her Breton community participate in the Resistance.<br/><br/>It's not horrible by any means, and unlike some readers, I didn't find the constant time-shifting difficult to follow. Some of the writing is lovely, and some of the details, like the miniature city models Marie-Laure's father constructs to help her learn to navigate without sight, are enchanting. But for all its length, the main characters' development was shallow, depending too heavily on what happened to them rather than expositions of their thoughts and feelings. The battle scenes were bland when they should have been nerve-wracking. The plot payoff was tepid. Bumper-sticker wisdom passed for insight; for example: "Don't you want to have lived before you die?" The vocabulary was elementary, the sentences monotonously short--can't anyone write a subordinate clause any more?--and the chapters so short it was hard to sink into the story. I really didn't care what happened to Werner or Marie-Laure, and for the time invested, I should have. If not for the book club meeting, I wouldn't have finished. I've always been the annoying girl who does her homework.<br/><br/>Also, two personal prejudices influenced my discomfort with "All the Light We Cannot See." I mention them because perhaps they made me unfairly harsh, and if you don't share them, you might enjoy the book more than I did. The book has a lot of snails, and I have a gastropod phobia (kindly bear in mind that a phobia is an irrational fear that nonetheless incites extreme anxiety in the sufferer) so those passages were very hard for me to stomach. Second, judging by the endless parade of public television programming on the topic, I must be one of the only people on the planet who does not think a World War II setting automatically enhances the interest a story holds.<br/><br/>If a book like this makes so many short-lists for prestigious prizes and top-ten-book-of-the-year lists, I have to wonder about the future of mainstream American literary fiction.
This may be the best Young Adult book about the Second World War I have ever read; the only problem is that I don't think it was intended as one. But still, it has great strengths. It is the story of two young people, a German orphan boy and a motherless French girl, who come into their teens during the War, until fate throws them into each other's way at a moment of extreme peril.<br/><br/>Both characters are utterly sympathetic. Marie-Laure Le Blanc is the daughter of the locksmith at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, and escapes with him to the walled coastal city of Saint-Malo when the Germans invade. Blind from the age of six, she has learned to rely on her other senses to survive in an increasingly dangerous world. Werner Pfennig grows up in an orphanage in the Ruhr, destined to be sent at 15 down the same mine that killed his father. But he develops an uncanny ability to build and repair radios which earns him a place at a Nazi military school, with all the bullying and indoctrination which that implies.<br/><br/>Doerr has chosen his title with care. One of the first things that Werner hears on his home-made radio is a Frenchman broadcasting about light; this will turn out to have been Marie-Laure's grandfather. Light shines throughout the book in contrast to the encroaching darkness, not least in some luminous writing. But of course it is light that the girl cannot see, and the boy is raised in another kind of darkness. So sound becomes the principal medium, with radio as its carrier. The mental liberation of those first broadcasts is replaced by propaganda, as radios picking up non-German stations are forbidden. The transmitter that had broadcast the science lectures from Saint-Malo will later be used to send messages for the Resistance, and Werner's Wehrmacht unit is sent to track it down. [These are not spoilers, because the story alternates sections set in 1944 with those from the preceding ten years, and we are introduced to the players in the endgame very early on -- though not, of course, told how exactly it will end.]<br/><br/>All the same, this is one of the qualities that make me call this a Young Adult novel, the fact that it IS set up so clearly, and we are just waiting for the pieces to come together. Add to this protagonists who are scarcely more than children, a rather fanciful subplot involving a precious diamond with a curse on it, and a story told in very short chapters with catchy titles and easy to read, and you get something that would be pretty well perfect for a teenager, much like Marie-Laure's favorite author, Jules Verne. Against this, you have the book's length (530 pages), the fact that the adventure-story quality of the first half changes to some real death and horror towards the end, and the author's decision to extend the story to 1974 and then 2014 in a decidedly adult way. So an odd mixture that doesn't quite come off. Make no mistake, I loved the book and raced eagerly towards the end. But I also felt it was too pretty, too carefully wrought, too EASY, for the terrible times it claimed to represent.
All the Light We Cannot See was far and away my favorite book of 2014 thus far. At its core are two incredible characters: Marie-Laure, a blind French girl from Paris, and Werner, an orphan from Germany. These two are on opposing sides of the war, but become connected through the waves of radio.<br/><br/>The story begins before the war in Paris with a little girl, Marie-Laure, who has recently gone blind. She spends most of her time with her doting father, who serves as the locksmith for the Museum of Natural History in Paris. Her blindness at first leaves her isolated; but, her father carves a scale model of the city that she follows with her fingers, learning her way around and to beginning to trust her other senses to guide her.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Werner and his sister Jutta are being raised in a German orphanage. Werner becomes obsessed with radios, and begins to teach himself engineering. Though he is destined for work in the mines given his social status, his intelligence and drive provide an alternate path. The tale continues through the war leading to the moment that these two, swept up in the tides of war, cross paths in St. Malo, France.<br/><br/>The elements of this story integrated quite a few personal interests of mine, including:<br/><br/>1. Having visited both Paris and St. Malo, and given that I have a trip to Germany planned for the summer, the settings were definitely of particular interest.<br/><br/>2. The book is definitely on the literary side. The writing is beautiful and the cast of characters both rich and unforgettable. That being said, the subject isn’t a particularly light one as you might imagine, and this certainly doesn’t read like a beach novel if that’s what you’re looking for.<br/><br/>3. I pretty much love any and all things, fiction and non, that take up the subject of WWII. Before I even began reading, I was utterly sold on the subject.<br/><br/>4. I love when the stories I’m reading incorporate references to other books. For example, a character that I kept thinking about while I was reading this novel was Alma Whittaker, Elizabeth Gilbert’s heroine from The Signature of All Things. Alma is an isolated child, much like Marie-Laure, who becomes obsessed with the mosses growing at her family home (not unlike Marie-Laure’s fascination with mollusks). I kept recalling Alma’s enthrallment with Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species, as Marie-Laure read and reread Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. Both Gilbert and Doerr’s novels made me want to run out and immediately begin these two classic works.<br/><br/>5. I hate sappy endings. I don’t like when everything works out perfectly and everyone lives happily ever after. It’s too unrealistic and I often feel like it cheapens the story. I like it when the story ends happily but not perfectly. I don’t want to give anything away, but I will say I was completely happy as I turned the last page.<br/><br/>This book is definitely not to be missed, I think there is some part that will appeal to any reader. It is on the long side, but the story is just so good that you’ll actually savor over the length (500+ pages), and if you’re anything like me, wish it had gone on further.
Good story with descriptive setting to create a vivid picture in your head.  Interesting characters that are well developed.  It is a gentler introduction to the horrors of WWII.  It is better read in a shorter time period or it can seem long.  The ending is strange, but otherwise, enjoyable.
Very interesting POV from the French side of the lines. There are points that the author could have made clearer as to their significance. When our book club read it, there were lots of questions around these. However, we had the opportunity to hear Doerr speak, and he clarified many of them.
The author writes in an incredible style that I do not know how to describe, except to say it was very descriptive, actually beautiful. I was fascinated with the characters and how the story wove together. It was beautiful read with characters that you were vested in right from the beginning.
Amazing book, the author weaving the stories of a German boy, a blind French girl, and a priceless diamond together.  Beautiful descriptions, suspense, and WWII history combine to make a historical novel you can't put down.  I can understand why it has been on the best seller list for so long
The author has a gift describing the seashore, etc.  I found it to be a very touching story.  The father tried his best to ensure that his daughter could be independent, even though blind.  Once again, the brutality of the Nazis was emphasized in the treatment of the young friend of Werner's.
Beautifully written. The story is captivating and with many turns.  At times, the changes in time frame and character can be confusing, but the story continues to keep you involved.  Doerr's descriptions create a reading experience that is visceral and places you within the character's lives.
I really was looking forward to reading this book after hearing someone talk about it.  But their explaination was not what I got from the book.  Several times I thought about just stoping, but still found myself intreaged and wanted to get to the end.  Finally realizing I did enjoy the book.
I found the pros and storyline pulled me in to the characters while covering the viewpoints of war from both sides: German and French aspect . I felt firsthand how was lived through as young adults and how the experience shaped and left its marks on a generation.<br/>It was a wonderful read.
This is a fascinating book.  It depicts two young people--one French and one German--who live during WWII.  Their lives are separate but become intertwined through radio transmissions.  I did not plan to like the book but actually loved it!  It shows how normal lives can be so changed by war.
I've never felt compelled to write a review before but I knew I had to write one after reading All the Light We Can Not See· The story is so rich and beautiful that the pages just fly by. Doerr takes the story of WWII and turns it on its head. Do yourself a favor and read this beautiful book.
all the light we cannot see by anthony doerr was an amazing book.  It is not one that grabs you on the first page but one that you read one page and think what next, and before you know it it becomes a book you can't put down.  I loved it and it one of the few books that I want to read again.
This is an intriguing story about the lives of two young people during World War II, a boy lured into service in Germany and a blind girl struggling to survive in wartime France.  Their interesting connection wove throughout the story, always having the lingering promise of a coming together.
This is a poignant, well written story. From the beginning I was caught up in the narrative.  I liked both of the main characters (they alternated, chapter by chapter) and was genuinely interested in their welfare. On my recommendation, it was chosen as the monthly selection for my book club.
I usually give a book 100 pages before deciding to move on.  It was  a real chore to make it with this one.  I agree with some of the posters who said Ursula Hegl's Stones from the River was a  far better book with these themes.
What an amazing book!  The author has a beautiful way of describing things!  Even though she is blind you get a sense of light and dark.  I couldn't put it down!  We picked it for our book club which was perfect because it is the kind of book you want to discuss after.  Highly recommend it!!
One of the best fiction books I've read. I just hope Hollywood doesn't turn this mesmerizing book into a film because film couldn't possibly capture the beauty of his writing.  Have recommended this book to everyone in my circle who are avid readers. Just loved it & will buy his other books.
This is the novel is worth your time. Insights into the human condition and the perils living in this world. How one travels through a dangerous, I expected situation and hopefully how was eventually finds meaning and prevails.  Fabulously written with deep insights. Very much worth reading.
I know this is a best seller, but I found it to be very dull and predictable, and lacking in significant character development. The best part was when she read and broadcast Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. Unfortunately, the comparison only makes Doerr's book suffer by the comparison.
This beautifully written, deep story tells about the sad and challenging lives of a blind French girl and orphaned German boy during WWIi. Their experiences and perspectives are vastly different and yet their paths cross in a surprising way. This is a complex story with very deep characters.
Rather predictable as to plot and some really clichéd characters. The relationship between father and daughter was without conflict of any kind but sweet.  I felt like I had read this book before, many times<br/>  Typical of the crowd pleasers that usually win a Pulitzer<br/> DOROTHY,  L.A
When the read the subject of this book, I wasn't excited. WWII books can be hard read. But, this book characters are so interesting and the way it moves through their lives and the lives of the people around them is beautifully written and gripping. I'm glad my book club suggested this book!
That rare, ever-sought after experience on journeying through a story, "such a book as this is WHY I read!" My mind feels like my tummy does after Thanksgiving dinner and seconds and desserts!! Now, to over-ingest everything else by Doerr and to devour more of his polymathic writing.
I went on this journey so invested in the lives of the characters.  It was such a pleasure to emotionally experience this dark period of history without being retold the well-known facts of WWII .  I loved this book, so well written and engaging starting with page one and lasting to the end.
This novel is ambitious, and I could see how some might pin it as over-reaching, but it is beautifully written. The character development, pace, and structure are beyond sound. Anyone who picks this story apart is looking for another genre. It deserves all the acclaim in has received. Bravo.
The short chapters were great for my train ride because I could guarantee that I always got to the end of a chapter when my stop came.  However, I'm not sure if the story flowed very well or if the connection between the two main characters was as natural or intriguing as it could have been.
I enjoyed the portrayal of the young characters in the days before WWII.  I love the connections made with people on either side of the conflict - and bring the characters through to 2014 was a delicious treat.  Finished this book a week ago, and still thinking about it.  That's a good sign.
The story of two remarkable people whose lives intercepted for less than a day is beautifully told.  Two young people and their stories as they grow and negotiate life in the midst of war brings the reader new perspectives and knowledge of a period of history many of us only have read about.
Such a beautifully written story about two very different children growing up during WW2 and how they save each other. Anthony Doerr depicts a very different perspective of the war from any other story I've read about that time.  I highly recommend that everyone read this heartbreaking book.
Few Americans can appreciate growing up French or German in the 30's and 40's.  Characters are so well developed you would recognize them on the street today.  A true emotional masterpiece. I prayed for a different ending, but know the ending was real. I will read anything the author writes.
This book is a microcosm of what made the greatest generation what it is. Each of those who lived in it and survived are a part of it, and their unanswered questions about the fates of loved ones and friends helps make them what, without their knowing it at the time, the greatest generation.
This book draws you in- loving its characters and hoping all along for a happy ending for all the characters, minus one. Readers who enjoy books that go back and forth between time periods (1941, 1944, 1974, 2014) won't be disappointed. Definitely a realistic view , from both sides, of WWII.
This book provided a nice balanced perspective from both sides of a war - really good read.  I read it while on vacation in Caen/ Paris which made it even more interesting.  I enjoyed the style in which it was written - really got to know the characters well. Nicely researched and presented.
Just when the 'Hitler genre' was becoming numbingly repetative, this beautifully written story and characters are brought to a vibrancy that is magnetic and grief striking yet poignant without the Hollywood expectations...simply raw human characters described with a clarity without blinders.
Intricate, mysterious, with many turns of the plot, this novel is as intriguing as a shell of a whelk. There are so many priceless gems within of history, familial relationships and character development you will make more time than you should for reading, and then want more when you finish.
I enjoyed the interplay of events of two people who were connected by outside forces but did not  know each other.  It also showed the effect of World War II on the French blind girl and the young German radio expert (who eventually wss in the German army) in similar but also different ways.
One of the greatest storytellers I ever did enjoy, with an imagination which is quite unbelievable (and I found confirmed in another of his books I have read in the meantime). The background action of WWII really is secondary only when we look at the main actors and their live of this novel.
Possibly the best book I've ever read.
A nice story that you forget in a day.
Beautifully written.  Ending was weak.
This novel begins slow and strengthens as it moves forward. With its innovative timeline, the author allows us to empathize with the plight of each character whether good or evil. Gripping at times while delightfully poignant, the novel takes you through the many faces of war. A great read.
Very well written story that stayed with me long after I finished it.  A look into history that most of us have only heard or read about and circumstances we cannot begin to imagine.  Brave, heroic characters who might have been real people and what ultimately sustained them.  Amazing read.
The development of the characters was so fine tuned that I felt I knew each one.  The description of  Germany,  Russia, and France  in World War II, from the onset to the end of the war, was excellent. This was the type of book that keeps you up until two a.m. just to see what happens next.
This ranks as one of the two best books I've read in years. It grabbed me from the moment I began reading and that continued throughout the course of the book. Beautiful writing, compelling intertwined stories. Many of the books I read are set in WWII, and this far surpasses all the others.
I can't recommend this book highly enough.  The way it is written is both enchanting and haunting.  The characters are beautifully rich.  It is a little heavy, so it took me a while to get through it.  But one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Excellent, enthralling, exquisite.
I felt like I was reading a real life story, the best I have ever read about WWII and those who played parts. I was moved and fascinated and gained heretofore unimagined glimpses of the realities of kindnesses and cruelties that swirled in the maelstrom of those times. Couldn't put it down.
I was so taken by this story that I read it almost straight through.  I was pleased to see it won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction well after I had read it.  If you are interested in WWII, which I am, you will perhaps have a new perspective on life during that dark period in our history.
I would recommend this book to any reader who is interested in seeing how each of our lives can significantly touch the lives of others, even when we are unaware.  How perseverance pays off, and how some things are not as important as they seem -how relationships are really all that matter.
This was a very different point of view of World War II.  Doerr described some of the regime issues from the ordinary German's point of view.  It was also a good description of trying to survive in a city under attack.  His descriptions of the blind protagonist's experiences were very good.
Waste no more time reading reviews. You will most likely love this wonderful, engaging, and surprising story. It's so well-written, the next book I (re)read was Jules Verne's "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" because Doerr's references make even that sound magical. You'll see.
A beautifully written book about sympathetic protagonists during the final days of WWII on an island in France.  Not really a convincing love story but definitely conveys the naiveté of some German youth joining the Nazi training groups and their gradual understanding of the horror of WWII.
Set within both individual and political contexts of WWII, the main as well as secondary characters are all sensitively drawn and developed. The writing is both descriptive and mysterious, luring the reader ever more deeply into the plot. I found this novel hard to put down, fully engaging.
I felt enlightened when I read the book because it gave one an understanding of WWII from the German and French point of view via real characters.  I stayed up late wanting to know what would happen next to Marie~Laure and Werner, plus Etienne, Madame Manec, Jutta, Von Rumpel and the Giant. It was a good read and discussions for book group!
This is a beautifully written book that looks at the effects of WWII on the lives of a blind French girl and a German boy.  For much of the book their stories run parallel to each other but at a crucial time for both of them their lives intersect.  This is a book you don't want to put down.
Doerr's memorable characters include a blind teenage heroine in a besieged WW11 French coastal setting, a German  boy,Werner, who can build and wire anything and a structure in which two to three page chapters cover late  WW11 and end in 2014. My choice for most memorable novel of the year.
I enjoyed the writer's style.  His descriptions allowed you to "be there."  The book was the catalyst for a great book club discussion.  I think everyone in our group liked the book very much.  It reminded some of "Stones From the River" by Ursula Hegi.  It was a great read!
Amazing writing and an incredible story. The author's structure of this book, his two unlikely protagonists, and the history provided of the nazi invasion of France were just short of brilliant. This is one of my top ten reads ever.I know I will reread this book several times in the future.
I read this book as it was chosen for my book club. I found it to be extremely hard to keep reading for the first half or so. As a matter of fact, a couple other book club members gave up after the first couple of chapters. I perservered and found the last several chapters to be very good.
A truly magnificent book that I didn't think I wanted to read.  Somehow the combination of a blind girl and a Nazi boy sounded terrible, but my book club was reading it, and so did I.  The characters draw you in and the story is just wonderfully told.  I recommend this book to my daughter.
this book is extraordinary.  its a fascinating, novel perspective on WWII.  and I love how Doerr uses elemental themes to connect the narrative - which does jump around in time and character: radio waves, ocean ecology, and carbon... so clever and sensuous.  I just loved reading this book.
A wonderful  ride. Get your dictionary out as Mr. Doer challenges the mind with rich vocabulary. Savor each word. I think you will be hard pressed to read a more magnificent book. I have aced our book club to put it on the list for next fall!  Consider it to be "an all week  ride."
I loved this book, as did my husband, my Mom, my step-daughter...anyone I recommended it to, who read it.  My husband doesn't often read fiction, but even he loved this book.  The accuracy of the historical context makes the fiction seem plausible, even if it's fiction.  A beautiful story.
I really enjoyed this book except, perhaps, the ending.  It kept waiting for something more, bigger, or a revelation.  I've been to St Malo when I was a teenager and this book makes me want to go back and re-explore it all over again and look for some of these places mentioned in the book.
The best book I have read in a long time.  Even if  you are not a fan of historical literature, it is worth reading for the beautiful characters and story.  I thought it was even better than The Book Thief and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.  If you are a fan of either of those books, it is a must read.
The best book I have read in three years.  The characters are real, the trauma is believable and well developed.  The story line is both beautiful and sad.  If you like well developed characters, in historical fiction, with descriptions you can feel, smell and see, you will like this book.
Loved this book.  I especially love how it told the story of several people and then came back around to tie it all together. I don't remember reading a book that did it quite as well as this one did.  The characters were imaginative and beautiful, all of them!  I really enjoyed this book.
532  unputdownable pages kept me enthralled. I cannot begin to express my admiration for this author as he weaves an unforgettable novel of exceptional prose and incredulous descriptive verbs. A hundred times, I changed and rechanged the title - it need be entitled "LIGHT ?" . I loved it.
Beautiful story and beautiful writing. There were so many overlapping parallels in terms of theme, including the actual word smithing. I didn't give it 5 stars only because the ending felt a little pat, buy at the same time, I haven't a clue as to how else the ending could have been told.
Beautifully written story of a blind French girl and an Austrian orphan boy during WW2, and how they both learn to see their worlds. I loved this book for its story, it's writing, and for the ways it made me think about how our understanding can grow - or not - as we go through our lives.
This was thought provoking and WWII continues to be of interest to most people, probably for the continued amazement that these things happened. We need to keep reminding ourselves how easy it is to slip over the ethical and humane lines, into atrocities that we observe or participate in.
An amazing story of the courage and the carnage of World War II from the perspective of the citizens that lived through it. Not just on the surface or of a single country's viewpoint, but from the perspective of the hearts, minds and memories of the many varied characters within the tale.
An amazing story that parallels the lives of 2 young people from the beginning of World War II to the end on the Brittany coast of France.  Jules Vern's, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea brings an element to the story that is very enriching and so very creative.  This is definitely a re-read!
There was excellent writing in this book..a Avery CAREFUL use of metaphor and poetic devices sprinkled skilfully.  The story was told;  perhaps there could have been more cropping of text.  It did drag in places. I would recommend this book to friends who enjoy intricate, creative novels.
This is the one I did not want to start ,<br/>The beginning is so depressing, did not think I would finish it.<br/>Funny I could not put it down ,nigh after night I did not watch TV,<br/>Just kept reading .<br/>The unusual style and  plot is very addictive.<br/>Definitely great read.
Beautifully written novel with very interesting story lines. This is just a book you will not want to put down. I loved the mix of good and bad characters and the triumph even when the odds seem truly against it. The horrors of war mixed with survival, strength and hope make a great read.
I read this book with such joy and wonder; I was spellbound...<br/>I will continue to re-read this book for years and years.<br/>It is absolutely one of the best books I have ever read in my life.<br/>You will fall in love with the characters and miss them so when you are done reading.
Have been so dissatisfied with reading lately after reading "Unbroken". It totally spoiled me! Have been searching for a book to grab me the same way and finally found it in "All the Light We Cannot See". Could not put it down. The ending was hollow and lonely but how else was imaginable?
It's a goal of mine to read at least one book per month this year, and with this being #21, I can confidently say that it IS the best book of 2014. What gorgeous prose, I just wanted to savor it and digest it slowly... I even started to re-read it, which is very, very rare for me, indeed!
Excellent novel; well-written saga from the human impact side of war and occupation.  It makes you realize there are multiple sides to any conflict, and it's not just a good vs evil thing.  Heroism, betrayal and human suffering happen on every battle front and also back at the home front.
This novel was one of the few I've read that I couldn't wait to finish but didn't want to end.  Heart stopping descriptions, with words from deep in my knowledge bank.  I wish l could convince all my friends to read this novel.......I think l will just go back to page one and begin again!
This is a superb, multi-textured novel about life, death and the insanity of war. The principal characters are a blind little French girl and  a German boy conscripted into the Wehrmacht. There's also an undercurrent of Indiana Jones running through it. Just a tremendous, tremendous read.
A most unusual take on the now classic tales from WWII and Occupation France.  It is a well woven story of the childhoods and destinies of the two main characters who end up as starcrossed 'could-have-been' lovers under other circumstances.  An unforgettable read!  I highly recommend it.
I listened to All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr, with Audible books and was mesmerized.  The story was mysteriously and tenderly human, compellingly woven characters and intertwined points of history, with a truly gifted narrator, Zach Appelman.  It was beautifully presented.
It was good. It was written very well but I was going to give up on the book several times because the first half of the book was setting up the remaining book. All in all, I am really glad I read it because the ending was amazing but it took me a lot longer than I expected to get there.
I am a daughter of an American glider pilot , now a grandmother. And my daughter married an east German. This story was so beautifully crafted and I have been to many  of the places it touched. It haunted me and touched me like no other book of the period.<br/>Just so tenderly written .
What a fabulous story.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Reminded me of The Book Thief in the way the author is able to relay the sinister atmosphere that hung over Europe during the war without detailing the already documented atrocities.  It was suspenseful and sad.  What a brave girl!
I was sorry when I reached the end!<br/>Aside from compelling stories and the unanswered mystery, I was left with an appreciation of what life might have been like in Germany and France during the war years.  I finished it a week ago; the novel is still lingering in the back of my mind.
Our book club chose to read the book before it won the Pulitzer.  We all really enjoyed it and thought a worthy selection.  I have been to St. Malo and some of the other places named in the book, with the opportunity of touring the Normandy landings, so it was especially appealing to me.
This novel is beautifully written with a compelling plot and well deserving of the Pulitzer it just won. My only quibble is that the book should have ended with a devastating event which occurred near the end. Anything written after that was superfluous. But it still is a wonderful book.
Short chapters go fast and well.  I do not like books about war, but this story of the interconnection of people in Germany and France shows how humanity can gradually to the events which, in retrospect, seem shocking and inhuman.  This book is well done, and on of my all time favorites!
When will publishers honor great books with readings by professional, classically trained actors?  Robert Ian Mackenzie or a dozen other women or men could have made this book sing. Instead we get another monotonous made-in-Omaha version of Seri. A book this good deserves a great reader,
All the hype about this novel is absolutely true.  It's a stunning book, so well written, and one that I tended to read slowly, savoring the author's descriptions of Paris, ST. Lo, the French countryside, the characters who were so well drawn.  Additionally, the ending was so satisfying.
A very tender book, the story comes together well, even though chapters start and stop in other countries and times, it's announced at the beginning of each chapter. Fell in love with Werner and his mind....and of course the survivor of it all as well.  a book I will remember for awhile. We read for our book club, and we had a lively disccussion-good choice.
This book is one of the most beautifully-written works I've read in many, many years.  I was so taken by it that I a) bought a copy (after reading the one from the public library) and b) recommended it to my book club.  I am looking forward to our discussion of the book after New Year's.
This book had an interesting plot line, but I was sort of in and out at times.  There were particular segments and characters that I found fascinating...but some others not so much.  I know a lot of people are enthusiastically reading this book, so maybe it was just wasn't my cup of tea.
This is one of the best books I have ever read. The writing is beautiful with wonderful descriptions of the people and the environment. The story is haunting, taking place during the Nazi occupation of France and the buildup to the occupation. I recommend this book without equivocation.
This is an excellent book. I was not looking forward to reading it because I feared it would dwell on the horrors of war. However, it delves into the two main characters from childhood to adulthood, and how their characters developed and strengthened. I unreservedly recommend this book.
Beautiful. Lyrical. Precise. This is the book I am always looking for. Gorgeous writing. Spell-binding story. I savored the last few pages, unwilling to end my time spent drifting inside this profound and powerful story. Magic.<br/>Mimi Zollars<br/>Author, benediction for a black swan
This is one of those books that after you finish reading it, you think about it for days after.  I also researched some of the places and events described in the book because I wanted to learn more about it.  I would recommend it highly especially for junior high or high school age kids
I enjoyed every minute of this book. It is poignant and thought provoking. The characters' lives are separate, yet inevitably and inextricably intertwined. It is the story of two young people, a young French girl and German boy, that spans the time before, during and after World War II.
This is an engrossing novel. Absolutely holds your attention. A must read for everyone who needs to know that wars destroy more than armies. They destroy souls and futures and dreams.If you aren't' old enough to remember the 40s and 50's  and the changing world after the war read this .
Wonderful novel.... Doerr weaves you in and out of the different time periods in a powerful way...you are riveted to the story as the plot unfolds over a time span of 10-12 years....<br/><br/>A very different kind of love story and very atypical hero/heroine characters....!  Loved it!
At first I was a bit perplexed by the shifting of chronological sequences within the main fold of the story, but as the author reaches the climax everything seems to fall into an entrancing intersecting perfection of a beautiful and thoughtful ending of a story I will not forget easily.
I enjoyed this book more than any I have read in awhile. The language is lyrical and creates wonderful images ... Not something you might expect from a book whose central character is blind. The characters are well developed and likable and the story flows. I highly recommend this book.
I didn't want to finish this fine work of fiction. I read it on Kindle and listened to the audible version on WhisperSync; the narrator was excellent. Other reviewers have covered the plot and character development details, and I just wanted to add my enthusiastic 5-star recommendation.
I prefer books that have a healthy dose of realism where things don't necessarily end as you expect or, as is the case far too often, as you want. Enjoyed seeing the world through the eyes of a blind girl and a young German boy whose lives are very much intertwined, but from a distance.
Beautifully written. A true work of art. I highly recommend reading this book. It is spectacular. The author really engages the reader and the storyline is beautiful. The characters are very deep and complex. I would recommend this book to everyone wanting to escape into another world.
This could have been great, perhaps it suffered from too many ideas, too many plot devices, or too little explanation of the characters' motivations. This was an interesting read, but I just have the feeling that it could have been better with a different mix of character perspectives.
All the Light We Cannot See is simply the finest novel I've read this year -- it grabbed me from the first page; left me with head whirling, wishing there'd be more, but what more could there be?  I loved the 1970s look at some of the characters.  Truly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
Beautifully written in twining the characters' lives and back stories to bring them together in a town in France during WWII.  A precious diamond is at the center of the story lines and is a character of its own. How this diamond affects their futures ties this memorable tale together.
This book took a long time to develop.  I found it hard to follow because it jumped between two characters, the blind girl and the soldier.  I didn't read it continuously so maybe that was the problem.  The most interesting part was the last couple of chapters when their paths crossed.
I enjoy the book even though it's was a bit slow at the bigining. I think the fact that author took 10 years to right this novel is defenety shows in style and content. It's not just a story about WWII events. It's also the story about social pressures, personal choices, love and fear.
This is a terrific book.<br/>Went to hear the author talk at the "Arts and Letters Live" in Dallas and was so disappointed.<br/>He was unprepared, and rather roughed it through the talk.<br/>However, he is a splendid writer.<br/>The development of the characters is amazing.
This is a beautifully written novel. The descriptive language evoke a feast for the brain!  It is a novel set in pre..during and after world war 2. The characters, both good and evil, are people we can relate to.<br/>Please read the book slowly. Savor it!! You will not want it to end!
I told myself I would not read another WWII novel but I'm glad I did. Loved the flow of words effortlessly across the page. Loved the intrigue, suspense, hope, innocence. Still very heart wrenching and in the end unresolved. War at any time is a losing means to an end for all involved.
Mr. Doerr has written a masterpiece; tenderness in a time of savagery, sadness, beauty, compassion, the small details which make up our lives, and the power of memory.  All written in language that causes you to stop and admire the artistry of truly great writing.  Thank you Mr. Doerr.
I found this book interesting in how it jumped through time to tell its story. While at times it lagged a bit with too much detail I would not want to cut it myself. The characters were memorable and the story was completely believable in its twists. A fine book that needed to be told.
I loved,this book. Told through eyes of two growing into teen children whose life in the war was totally different but equally painful. Beautiful writing and description of Saint Malo. Want to visit it . Resilience of the human spirit is acknowledged again but why must man be so cruel?
What a intriguing novel! I loved every minute of it. The two lives that eventually make their way to each other is well written and keeps the reader engaged. In addition I learned a lot about that part of WWII . It is one of those books you want to keep reading, but  don't want to end.
On page 47.<br/><br/>The images feel like a John Mathieson cinematography. With a very very, very-very sobered up Wes Anderson. An Anderson cinema in principle surely.<br/><br/>Reading this after "The Martian." Tough act to follow but I'm surely in love with all the light!
This is a wonderful novel, probably one of my two favorites in the past year. I loveThe human story set in World War II Europe. The characters are wonderfully drawn and incredibly deep. But it wasn't until the end of the book that I really truly loved it when everything came together.
A deeply moving, engaging, lovely book about strength, determination, brilliance and the impact of evil on the world. Fantastically literate and sophisticated in creation, with many layers of mystery, suspense, love and devotion woven throughout its pages. Sad that it had to end . . .
Great insight as to the thoughts and lives of those on the perimeter of the holocaust.  How the invasion of France affected peoples lives, thoughts, fears, how they survived  and how they died.  It's tells we are each important in the lives of others.  You alone can make a difference.
Book made me think about each persons evolution into a better person.  Wonderful book. Well written. A book I read eagerly until the end.  The book gives an insight into WWII from a different perspective weaving the lives of two children toward their meeting one day at the end of War.
This is a wonderful book that gives the reader insight into how a young German boy was influenced to accept the doctrines of the Nazis.  At the same time, a blind girl learns self-sufficiency through unusual means by her talented father.  I found the book to be very thought provoking.
From time to time, a book comes along that cannot be rated like others. A book so beautifully done that it is more like a work of art than just words on a page. This is simply one of the best books I have ever read and will definitely become one of the very few that I will read again.
I loved this book.  It is a compelling story told about a very dark time in world history.  I loved the parallel stories of two children growing up and coming of age in terrible circumstances.  The writer draws you into their stories and keeps the reader entranced until the very end.
I loved the characters. While they were fictional, it makes you believe that there are good people on both sides of any war. Both Werner and Marie-Laure showed so much courage and perseverance. Wonderful descriptive writing, too! I could easily envision the walled city of Saint Malo.
An amazing and riveting story.  Doerr's use of language is magical.  He describes every nuance of time, space and character.  His tale is full of symbolism and mystery and left me trying to decipher the many things said and unsaid that made the story multi-dimensional and enchanting.
Since I love history and this was about WWII and gave insight on both sides, it was interesting to me.  I cannot say I loved it because it made me sad to know that people were at war but maybe I can be more sympathetic as an outsider - young as I was.  So well researched and written.
This was a great book club read. Touched all human aspects of war and how it affects so many. Descriptions were so colorful and how one young girl without sight can lead you so far. Characters were so real and how they each coped with useless war in their own way.  Highlly recommend.
what an amazing novel! Set during World War II, it follows two young people, one in Germany the other in France and how their lives interconnect. Thoughtfully written, this is a winner. I haven't enjoyed a novel as much in a long time. I will be reading Doerr's other novels for sure.
Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law
great writing. Didn't love the story.
Magnificent writing. Beautiful story.
Great book, great writer.  Loved it!!
One of the best books Iv'e ever read!
Fabulous book, didn't want it to end!
Anthony Doerr can write and has such empathy for his characters. I truly loved every single one. Four stars because often I wanted the story to hurry and get to where the inevitable was going. That said, how much he weaved the wires and entangled the good and evil was breath taking.
I thought the writing was very good.  And I appreciated the short chapters, set at different times, around different characters.  I did feel though that the book was somewhat contrived making me as a reader feel rather manipulated.  I would still recommend it however as a good read.
If a fan of sequential storytelling, this book is not for you.  The author alternates between characters and time  in relating this story of WWII.  He does a beautiful job of describing towns, villages and countryside, allowing the reader to become immersed in the events developing.
Great story!!! It is quite important to acknowledge that lives taken violently during the war have a past, had families, loved ones, they were living people...There are no collateral damages, just murder. Felt a lot of emotions while reading it... Thank you for writing it Mr. Doerr!
This was recommended by a friend and I'm so glad I listened. I haven't read much historical fiction but All the Light had me fully absorbed wanting to learn more about Marie-Laure and Werner. I couldn't put it down and Doerr had me feeling every victorious and heart breaking moment.
Two young people - one German, the other French - grow up as WW !! starts.  The author alternates their stories and at the end, they meet.  That's all I will tell you, except to read it.  I am going to give my copy to my daughter and 3 granddaughters to read.  That's how good it is.
This is a very well written story of the paths of our lives crossing in unpredictable ways.  The story is both beautiful and sad at the same time.  It shows how much has changed with time as well as how little our condition has changed with time.  Highly recommended for a good read.
So appreciated the intricacies and details. The way that the author wove the story and created complex characters with fully developed back stories kept me turning the pages. I cared about each character and wanted to know how and when they would return to the forefront of the tale.
The characters are so well developed that I found myself turning each page quickly until the end.  Although sickened badly by the cruelty of our history I wanted to continue so that some characters could gain some peace. However, anyone who actually survived I am sure, will never f.
Anthony Doerr certainly has his way with words...yet another WWII book, but this one adds it's own twist, and vision and subtle opinion on war and nations and people...just as I say I doN't want to read WWII books anymore, along comes this one, and puts yet another spin...great read
An interesting and absorbing novel, with unusual and likeable main characters to offset the conventional nasty Nazi villains.  The continual flashbacks and flash-forwards become hard to follow as they get closer together in time, and it's not clear why the book was written this way.
It was a wonderful book that pulled from you different emotions throughout the book. I couldn't put it down very easy because the book kept moving from different character's some of which the author could have wrapped up on better than he did, thus the four star rating vs. the five.
This was an exceptional novel with very alive and real characters which kept you very involved. Loved the descriptions of emotions and feelings that were very real. I didn't like the time skip as well but could understand the reasoning for it.  Will look for Mr. Doerr's other works.
I was deeply touched by the young girl in thiis novel.  The novel depicts a time when compassion and love for fellow men was looked upon with disdain. Power over others at any cost was the rulte of the day.<br/><br/>A tragic time in history portrayed with deep accuracy and horror.
I loved this book!  Imagine, a War Story, as enchanting as a fairy tale.  The story follows two children, one German, one French, during WWII and culminates at the end of the war in a fascinating place, of which most of us are unaware.  Beautifully written.  Heartbreaking.  Read it!
From the first pages, the reader is pulled into this book. The characters are truly alive through the authors words. You will care about each one, and be transfixed by the events around them. It has been a while since I couldn't put down a book . This story has just this hold on me.
I just started this book - about 60 pages into it, but I find it very interesting. I like the description of the young characters. It is a book that you don't want to put down. I was in St. Malo about 15 years ago and it will be nice going back there through the pages of this book.
Although the story is sad and disturbing in its war theme from WWII, it is so well written and so expertly crafted, I couldn't put it down. If you ever wondered what it was really like for average people living in the war zones during WWII, this book will answer all your questions.
As I read I was wanting the characters to come together the way I hoped they would all the while knowing that probably wouldn't happen.  Each of the main characters had a depth to them that made them interesting and made me want the very best in them to triumph over the evil deeds.
I haven't been this moved by a book since "Cutting for Stone" by Abraham Vergese.  It is a story more beautiful, more profound than anything I could describe.  The author's prose wraps itself around you and does not let you go.  I still live with these characters every day.
This book is heartbreakingly sad. However, it will go down as one of my all-time favorites because the writing is  like poetry. I do have to say I was sorry when it ended because I had grown to love several of the characters and missed them when I didn't have them 'around' anymore.
This book embraced me on the first page!!  It is so beautifully written, the reader "feels" what the characters feel and "sees" what the characters see. Because of this, one forgets that Marie-Laure is blind.  This is my book club read - I cannot wait to discuss it.
A little disappointed.  The whole book had far too many adjectives and phrases that distracted from the impact of the story.  I was<br/>also a little disappointed in the ending.  Expected more elaboration on the "diamond" and it's effect on whomever received it!  Whatever.
These are real people, not just characters in a story, that become our witnesses to history.  All that happens in their world validates the facts we learn about.  Their emotions write this story, which the author describes in such otherworldly ways.  What a wonderful, magical read.
Loved this book....everything about it makes you want to keep reading long after bedtime.<br/>The characters were described in such a way to make them real and the small chapters made it easy to connect the story.<br/>So glad I read it....definitely recommend it to all my friends
I loved this book.  The characters were interesting and the plot was good!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it jumped back and forth between characters and timelines.  That is harder for me.  I think I have adult ADD and I need the story to follow a straight timeline.
Doerr's book is lyric--the language transports the reader to another time and place, the interwoven story lines pull one inexorably along to a conclusion you wish would never come. I was captivated. If you enjoy history and a beautifully constructed story, you will enjoy this book.
I loved the way this book told both stories, went from present to past and how it all met up in the end....read it for book group and cannot wait to discuss it.  Confusing at first, but give it a go and continue with it...really good story with interesting and different characters.
It's been a long time since a novel absolutely swept me away the way this one did. From the first page, I was transported by the language, the characters, the historical setting...it makes me want to read everything Doerr has written. Warning: you will not be able to put this down.
This novel is one you don't want to miss. It involves a father's overwhelming love for his blind daughter, & the lengths he will go to to protect her & a jewel he is not even sure is real. The scenario takes place during WWII and includes some factual occurrences during that time.
Really enjoyed reading this, but I'm a sucker for all things WWII.  The novel pulls you in, and keeps moving until the end.  At first I was a little confused by the back and forth in time, but settled into it soon enough.  Finished reading last week, still haunts me. Well written.
While it took me a little while to really get into the story, it was so beautifully written. The characters really came to life and as the story progressed I loved the book more and more. It was a lovely book. Only gave 4 stars bc it took awhile to get into. by the end i LOVED it.
I did not want to like this book for some unknown reason and then did not want it to end. It made me think "what would I have done?"which is both disturbing and fascinating. I would like to believe that i would be more like her father and less like Werner but I'm not sure.
I waited to finish this book until today when I heard an NPR program on it this morning. After reading this book and listening to this program I realize all the meanings this title has.  I highly recommend this book as a must read and know why it was one of the best books of 2014.
Doerr's writing is soooo beautiful. Descriptive passages exceeding anything I've read in a very long time. I put off reading this because of the synopsis....thinking it was a young adult novel only. My mistake. I'm glad I finally picked it up and will search out more of his works.
An intelligently writeen and beautiful book.  I almost didn't read it because I was not interested in reading another book about WWII, but I'm so glad my sister told me to try it anyway!  One of the best books I have read this year and one of those you can't wait to pick up again.
An interesting portrayal relationships and morals in war written in a lingering poetic style. A little confusing at first with the switching back and forth of characters, their thought processes, and situations, however, worth the time to figure out and to enjoy their development.
This is a wonderful book with great characters.  It was hard for me to put it down.  There were very sad parts but overall has an uplifting ending.  A story about courage, loving relationships, war from two different, but at the same time, similar perspectives.  I loved this book.
The book started off slowly but the characters were so intriging that I continued on. It's a  good story line that brought you back in time to a period that was not a pleasant one. It  showed us both points of view and the challanges of life in each of the 2 main characters lives.
A pleasure to read this novel set in was-time Europe.  From the perspective of youngsters, the war's affect on  innocents is a well-written, informative anti-war novel different from most of the many WWII novels most people  have read.  Buy, read, enjoy, and think about this book.
So beautifully conceived and written, this book deeply touched me. I cared so much about the main characters and those that they loved that I risked having my heart broken. This book has lived in me long after I finished reading it. Glad I bought it so I can read it again -- soon!
It wasn't that I disliked the novel, but I wouldn't say it was really good. For 530 pages, I was expecting more from a character, quality standpoint. I thought Marie-Laure was coddled throughout much of the story. For a fictional book, I was expecting more from the blind child. Even if it's in the middle of WWII. It wasn't until the end that she started to show some spine and real grit. I wasn't rooting for her character until she was holding a knife challenging the german to come and kill her. Up until that point (around pg 450 or so), the book made her out to be quite helpless, static and practically hopeless. I wasn't blown away or surprised that the blind girl after spending years memmorizing a miniature version of her neighborhood was able to walk out on her own and find her way back home. Without going on too much of a rant I was just very un-impressed. The saving grace of this novel was Werner. Just wanting to know what happened to him kept me flipping the pages. He was a very well developed character in a book that at times had very static individuals.<br/><br/>I thought I would have been more enthralled with the Sea of Flames rock. The mineral/jewel that seems to tie the interest of so many characters in the book. Once again, I just feel Anthony didn't do his best here in fully fleshing out this back story. It's teased throughout the book as if to remind you its still a plot point, but I didn't feel it was integral to the story in any manner.<br/><br/>Overall this book had to flex its muscles real hard for me to give it 3 stars. This is a book that you might say to friends that you read, but keep in the back of your bookcase.
I wondered about All the Light...when I started reading. From the first chapter I could feel the oppressiveness that marched inevitably forward. I felt sadness for each child. We've never had a war on American soil. I pray we never do. I would recommend this book by EDWARD DOERR.
Truly, I can't remember all the particulars of this novel, which speaks for itself. it has lovely pieces to it, but not enough to hold it together as a really memorable book. Ending was weak -- entirely disappointing, like the author got tired of his own story and wanted it over.
May be one of the best books I have ever read. Set in a difficult period, the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the Occupation in France, it is deeply open to the humanity in its main characters and follows their development to its moral and physical conclusion. Touching and real.
What a great story!  I enjoyed the way it was written as every other chapter talked about the two main characters and their lives alternately.  The chapters were just long enough to keep one's interest.  A real page turner - with mystery and hardship during World War II revealed.
Exquisite writing and beautifully connected throughout the story. Even though each chapter is brief and there is a lot of time-jumping, I didn't have the slightest problem following the story -- the author crafted a gorgeous story and the prose is poetic. Truly beautiful writing.
Loved reading this and how it all came together.  You know it will, but it's not obvious as you read.  I enjoy books set in this period.  I felt this could have happened or something similar. I always find it interesting to read about ways some people survived and were resilient.
The story ends somewhat abruptly leaving several loose ends that I'd like to see resolved. Otherwise this was a well-written novel that immerses you in the overall story and it's various settings with vivid descriptions of the landscape and the interior dialogue of the characters
This book, which is unsparing in its depiction of a Europe torn apart by war,  is poetry at its finest. The reader may have to adjust to the shifts in time, but the thread of the two main characters whose perspectives drive the story brings sense and continuity to a chaotic era.
Oh! The most wonderful book! I thoroughly recommend it! Did not want to put it down. Author's ability to characterise, flip forwards and backwards in time without confusing the reader. And the setting....makes me want to seek out Saint Malo. Well deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
It was a little hard to jump back and forth. I did feel like I didn't pay close enough attention in the beginning as well. Other than that it was a wonderful read with heavy issues! I'd read it again! I am going to either reread or just skim through the beginning all over again.
Beautifully written the story jumps from past to present often enough to keep it interesting but not to often it becomes difficult to understand. Characters that you feel like you know as you learn where they came from and how they got here. A truly great novel. Hard to put down
An amazing story, of Nazi Germany during the time of Hitler in World War 11.  Very poignant with just enough details to picture everything that was going on.  I love the way she brought the two main characters together in the last chapters.  I would highly recommend this book!!!
"All the Light We Cannot See" is one of those outstanding books.  The author develops the characters with great depth and understanding.  I loved how the story played itself out.  It had a real ending.  Not a Hollywood ending.  I would read this books again on my Kindle.
Interesting story taking place in France and Germany during WWII.  It is really 2 stories that come together in the end.  At times it was confusing where Werner was because of flashbacks.  Interesting, good character development, but a bit of a challenge keeping it all straight.
Wow!!!  I hesitated to read this novel being so disillusioned by reviews of "great" novels.  But Doerr is not only an amazing story teller, his prose is prolific.  I loved how he juxtaposed the two stories and the ending was so appropriate without being at all schmaltzy.
so  much war and devastation. and so many lives lived. and yet we stumble on to the next day. Triumph?  not likely. So well written and such intelligent thought. Characters are indelible and you will remember each and every one. bravo to the writer and reader lucky to read.  har
After a few chapters you feel like you know the characters. This book tells a story of perseverance and caring by people in very difficult times. While the World crumbles some people remain humane. WWII brought out the worst and best in people. This book tells the story of both.
Beautiful writing, thought provoking, and definitely not a typical WW 2 novel since the emphasis is not on the fighting or the war atrocities but on the lives of 2 very different individuals that are eventually woven together. Great sensory description and character development.
The writing was excellent. The story enthralling. I am fond of historical novels. This one really tells the story of the French and some of the Germans during WWII. There were good and bad people on both sides. There were those who really had to overcome so much. Loved the book.
It was a great read. Short chapters encourage you to read "one more chapter"  Characters are well developed, and the story is very intriguing. It is such a well written story that makes you want MORE MORE MORE We read it for our Book Club and it led to great discussions.
I enjoyed the story weaving that brought both the German and French perspective together. I thought the stone was an odd tangent to the book, but liked the characters the author brought to life. At times the characters seem a bit flat and romanticized. Overall an enjoyable read!
Very good Work. I was totally engrossed in the writing and the lives of these kids. Their daily fear and uncertainty makes me realize how sheltered most of us live our lives. We should all thank our lucky stars to have been spared the kind of strife and constant pain depicted here.
It is a long book but it held my interest the whole way.  It may get somewhat confusing because the chapters can switch back and forth in time, but this also explains future actions.  Characters are real as is the time period and all the horrific things that happened during WW2.
This storyteller put us in the heart of WWII, behind the lines , through the young lives of the French and the Germans. Mesmerizing and tender and touching. If you've ever been to France or Germany, you can see the beauty and the agony through this story. Beautiful - and tragic.
I don't 100% enjoy the type story that goes back and forth between time periods. I was very interested in this story because it was unique--placing a young, blind girl in the throes of WW II. I loved seeing her develop maturity and stamina in the face of dreadful circumstances.
I like the author' style of writing, interchanged between 2 settings and characters. Simply a mutual interest brought these two, were not fully fledged, togethered at such heart wrenching circumstances! The ending was able to give his readers a closure, which was bittersweet !!
The writer might have used more metaphors.<br/>Yet the story ,as a whole, is so intriguing;  I wanted to know the end of the story and was happy that  it had a realistic ending which the mind would accept.<br/>The main theme reveals the effect of war and the loss of humanity at such time.
This well written novel keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens next.  After you think the conclusion is at hand, the author gives you a last encore of each of the main characters. Anthony Doerr's novel won a Pulitzer Prize because it deserved it.  Read and enjoy!
One of the most boring books I have ever read. Way too long and nothing really interesting happens until the last 100 pages. I really don't see what all the fuss is about regarding this book. Hard to follow when the story goes back and forth between characters and time periods.
I loved the book, but not the last couple chapters. It made me cry. I partially didn't like some of it because it was sad and I don't like sad things. I loved how it basically told the story from both sides German and French. I also learned some things I didn't know about WWII.
This is a wonderful book. I love the short chapters, and how it alternates the storyline of the two main characters. Having lived with a legally blind person, the book certainly captures the challenges they face. This is a must read! Enjoy it this summer--- great beach reading!
A recommended reading to me by a friend. She was so correct this story is well written and holds your interest right to the end. I believe anyone liking historical type fiction will find this interesting. You will catch yourself thinking of the story after you have finished it.
I just loved this novel. Beautifully written. You fall in love with these characters. A haunting story that I won't soon forget. My only complaint is that my it left my heart hurting. I had hoped for a little more peace at the end. But I suppose it was true to its period- WWII.
What a wonderful interweaving of young characters from Germany and Paris in Brittany in WWII.  What a gift for language that makes one feel part of the scenes.  For a wonderful literary style, it is also a page-turner.  This should be a classic for writing stylists and readers.
This was a wonderful story about World War II that did not involve the Holocaust. But instead focused on those who try to live through such a horrendous time.  A very brave little girl and an even braver little boy whose lives try to parallel each other in such a different way.
I loved the book and recommended it to many, many friends and acquaintances.  Brilliantly written, could pit it down.  The book truly shows that in a war, the worriers are just as victimized as the people who's country it is that is the warriors occupy.  So sad so unnecessary.
Beautifully written story with an intriguing premise. Two young people caught in a tortuous journey during temultuous times, WWII, Nazism, and their unique need to survive, to listen and to be heard. It makes you experience both joy and extreme sadness. A truly beautiful book.
Very well written.  I kept trying to imagine my life without sight and would I accept this and continue my life through learning or would I give up.  We all have choices but each of these characters did not have choices and had to live within the confines that were given them.
I can only imagine the research and comprehensive ability of this author. The range of topics that he thoroughly covered and wove into a great book is outstanding. I couldn't put it down. My judge of a good book is that you just do not want it to end. I did not want it to end.
Terrific book...great story, well written and held my attention throughout a very long book. I felt the author did a lot of research of the time in history that was the setting of the book and the characters were well drawn and made the reader care about what happened to them.
I was not thrilled when my book club selected this book - not another W. W. II book, I thought. I was wrong. Really enjoyed this book, especially getting to understand the characters. Parts were so emotional, I could hear my heart beating faster. Great book, wonderful writing.
An intriguing view of WW2 shown through the perspective of a young blind French girl and a brilliant German boy.  The postmodern style of writing made the book challenging to read, but the characters were very well developed and the plot was  suspenseful especially at the end.
Looking at the war from a different angle.  The descriptions are detailed.  Felt like I was there.  Had to re enter reality each time I stopped reading.  The horror of war is there yet the strength of the characters shines through.  The prose is wonderful. An outstanding book.
I loved this book so much!  I've recommended it to many friends and sent copies as gifts. For anyone who loves historical fiction, or just a great story that makes you feel, and think and care about characters even when you're not actually reading....it's this book right here!
Very highly quality writing but too light on plot and intrigue. The use of time period transitions could've been more effective to create tension and mystery but in the end the story fell flat. I did enjoy the look ahead at the end to see how things turned out for Marie-Laure.
The story is riveting and makes me hope for a movie to<br/>be made at some future date.  It is well written and<br/>gives a great insight into what some people might<br/>have been experiencing during the time period that<br/>would never make it into a generic history book.
One of the best books I have read in a long time.  My stomach clenched in worry for the characters and hoped they would survive the terrible things war brought.  Yet, the human spirit is amazing.  The author is a great storytelller.  Read this book and feel hope for humankind.
The book tells two stories that take place during World War II, from a French and German perspective. The author ties the two stories in an interesting detailed manner.<br/><br/>I could not put the book down. I highly recommend this book to folks who like historical fiction.
A very moving, well written book. The two main characters are just children when the story begins. Childhood is snatched from them. However, there are people who care for each of them and for each other. The kindness in some characters makes it poignant and warm. A great read.
The author does an amazing job of letting the reader. "See"".  What it's like to  Be a blind girl during. The scary times in world war 2.  Also not everyone forced into the youth movement  went along with the torturing and hateful mentality. Of the nazis...,,,,....
Brilliant writing and unusual plot. This one was hard to put down (so I usually didn't.)  If you are fascinated with WW II this will capture you from the very beginning. If you're not interested you'll still enjoy the way the story is written and the development of characters.
Beautifully written.Wonderful story.
It was a little dark, but, there were a few bright moments. It was interesting to read about the war from the perspective of a German boy and a blind girl. I think that it was made it so compelling. I wanted it to have a different ending, but, it did leave on a positive note.
Excellent story set in WWII.  Two stories are intertwined of a young French girl and a young German boy, each gifted in different ways, as they are inevitably brought into the conflict that engulfs them.  I was surprised by how quickly I was gripped by this captivating story.
Really enjoyed this book. I've read a lot of novels with WWII settings but I liked the changing perspectives of the narration and nonlinear timeline of events. Great use of flashbacks and hearing the story from a blind girl's perspective was fascinating. Highly recommended...
This story is an insightful look at what 2 teenagers from opposing sides had to live through just to survive during WWII and the circumstances that led to their meeting. One of them is a blind girl from Paris and there is a lot of imagery concerning light throughout the book.
One of the best I've read in a long time.  The author does a masterful job of developing empathy for those caught up in both sides of WWII and weaves historical fact and fiction deftly.  This book can be read by anyone old enough and mature enough to be interested in history.
A must read.  World War II from a very different perspective.  Both sides presented as rounded characters with clarity and insight.  By the end, you think you've seen the movie since the descriptions paint with vivid language.  It wraps things up so the actual ending is slow.
This was a beautifully crafted and very easy to read story.  The short chapters made it a page turner and it did have some suspense but mostly was a beautifully woven story.  I also learned a lot about that period of WWII from the French and German sides.  Highly recommended.
Once I got into the story I could not quit reading. I was intrigued by the descriptions of what the characters were thinking.<br/>I would recommend this book to all who love the study of sea animals, tinkering with electronics, history of WWII and all who love a great story.
Beautiful story which makes you think about how what you do can effect people you do not even know....it also tells you about how the young are brain washed into doing what is wrong because of patriotism....the love of father for the daughter and the true grit of Fredrick....
I've read plenty of novels and plenty of WWII history but hands down, your heart will be tossed about and your emotions will collapse in anguish and then triumph in relief. It is the character of these people that you love to hate, others to love, others to pity. A must read.
If you enjoyed The Book Thief you should definitely read All the Light....It is a mixture of moments of joy, horror, suspense and the the reader actually cares about the main characters. Nothing easy in reading about Nazi Germany but this book is ultimately an excellent read.
One of the best books I have ever read. The descriptions so vivid. The characters so real. I wanted to go to Saint Malo and walk the streets, find the house, feel the history.<br/><br/>Don't plan to get anything done once you start reading this book. I couldn't put it down.
A page turner!  It gallops along and keeps you reading on even though you should turn off the light and go to sleep!  The characters are well drawn and interesting and the story and setting feel authentic.  Really liked the short chapters and the alternate narrators approach.
A book with depth; characters who you never want to leave.  Occasionally, when a chapter took you to the past or future there was a moment when you had to shake your head until everything became clear again.  I flew through this book.  Now maybe I can get something else done.
Great Book!  A slice of history that puts some interesting small things within the arc of world changing events.  Not quite a romance novel, but not truly a war novel.  It is the people of Europe struggling on both sides of the conflict in the middle of the twentieth century.
Didn't want this novel to end. I created my own alternate endings based on the characters and their development. One can never learn or appreciate enough of the hardships in Europe during WWII. Beautifully written. Take a trip back in time with this novel. You won't be sorry.
At the time I was reading it, a friend of mine came to visit, and she told me she was reading a book she liked so much, she was reading it as slowly as possible to make it last.  It was this book!  The story is very interesting, and the writing is superb.  Highly recommended.
I put off reading this book because I have read so many books about WWII but this was certainly a story different from so many others.  It was not so much about the atrocities of war as about how characters dealt with the hardships created by it.  Worthwhile reading, I think!
Enjoyed the writing very much and was really pulled into the story.  What bothered me a great deal was the jumping back and forth between different times. It was a little difficult sometimes to decide what point in time I was with each chapter, which I found a bit confusing.
I liked then book very much. I am not a regular reader of novels, but this one gave me quite good reading moments. It is not five stars because at the beginning is a bit confusing and also because each chapter is too short, the writer could have developed each scene further.
This book takes place during ww2 .  The two main characters are a German boy and a blind French girl . They have suffered tragedies in their lives . I kept waiting for when they would finally meet and they do but the ending isn't what of quite expected . It's worth reading -
I loved this book.  It was a slow read for me due to the amount of German & French.<br/>It is not an easy read due to the story, I appreciated the short chapters; Each new chapter had a different focus.<br/><br/>It is very thought provoking and not an easy book to forget.
All the Light We Cannot See---be ready for a long, intense read, especially if you were alive during any part of WW 2. This is an epic novel that will take you from 1940 to 2014, packed with descriptive imagery that contrasts with the blindness of one of the main characters.
This is my first read by this author and I was extremely impressed. His techniques are innovative and he puts his characters in tremendous focus. The whole notion of following a blind French girl's life intertwining with a young German soldier is riveting. I loved this book.
Liked contrast of chapters. The mysteries developed were spellbinding. Language of author is beautiful. Reread several parts aloud. The story is intense with happy and sad events.  Well tied together with the theme of love, perseverance and mystical, particularly at the end.
I loved the details in this book. The scenes came alive. I learned a lot and often felt like I was on the scene. Beautiful writing. Gut wrenching story.  I can only imagine the many hours it took Doerr to produce a work so fine. He gets my highest praise.  Author, Lisbeth Thom
Excellent story brilliantly woven. Many different themes are meshed at once from science to imagination, the past to the present, fear and hope. Plenty of suspense and just enough mystery to make it a great novel. I find it hard to imagine anyone not really liking this book.
This is one of the best novels I have ever read.  Doerr weaves together disparate characters and manages to maintain the interest and tension for the entire book.  I couldn't  put it down but in a different sense than a spy thriller.  Doerr involved me with the protagonists.
Like the multi faceted jewel at the center of the story, the reader is pulled into a series of events, so rich in detail, they become luminous. It glows with a warmth that illuminates a dark forgotten time and in that warmth brings a measure of timelessness to the narrative.
Very interesting but very drawn out. Did remind me of the sins of war and how the innocent suffer the most. Did not care for short chapters and the movement from character to character. The ending was disappointing but what else can be expected considering the place in time.
This was a page turner, not for its mystery of who was murdered my whom, but of who loved which child. So beautifully woven with the weave barely visible for long into its pages. These characters all loved well, had their burdens and their triumphs. I won't soon forget them.
Beautifully written and unforgettable. I always somehow feel unsatisfied with the next author I read, because Anthony Doerr lifts his readers to another level and I just don't want to come back. His stories always stay with me, even years later. How many authors can do that?
It was not what I expected. Much more about the people, and what actually happened during the war to ordinary folks and especially children.<br/>A terrible price to pay, one we are probably still paying today. Adults can do terrible things to young, impressionable children.
Maybe one of the top 10 novels I've ever read.  Extraordinarily crafted and obviously well-researched, this is a true literary page-turner.  Well into the book, I was aware that I now had a relationship with these people and could be inside the story.  Powerful and touching.
Book was very good, sad, poignant, describing chilling experience for young people trying to live in a world that is the beginning of the NAZI regime...one of the main characters being a young blind girl who doesn't allow her physical blindness to hamper her living her life.
This is now on my "favorite books" list. It was hard to put down. I found the jumping around in time a little distracting, but the descriptive style (especially the use of similes), was superior. I found myself rereading several parts just to enjoy the descriptions!
The author is a wonderful writer. As you read, highlight... Go back reread them. Each wonderful highlighted sentence can leave a lasting impression. Enjoy each and then think about each character. I would love to change the ending but as it is, each character will haunt you
A moving and lyrical exploration of WWII, a subject I typically avoid. Doerr's evocation of the individual consequences of the globally significant events of the war in Europe struck me repeatedly with its focus, poetry, and feeling. Definitely deserving of its many awards.
Story line(s) and writing method are beautifully articulated; shapes and patterns,  references to Light, juxtaposed stories of two central characters....all work together to heighten reader's pleasure and understanding of matter and method.  Extraordinary artistic creation.
This book had the potential to be a really good book. Unfortunately, it didn't become a very good book until I was 3/4s of the way in. I Felt it was very slow going for a long time and I wish the way it wrapped up had been a larger part of the story. I almost gave up on it.
A fascinating portrayal of two young people caught up in Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied France.  At first, I had some trouble as the story skipped from person to person and from young childhood to "present day".  But in the end I think it is more effective this way.
I especially enjoyed Doerr's use of unusual but appropriate verbs.  Occasionally the writing tends toward purple, but the book caught me by Sentence One and never let me go.  Look at all the ways the author plays with the concepts of "light" and "blindness".
Another okay read from the best seller list. It wasn't a fairy tale. Separate and parallel sagas of a French blind girl and German genius boy coming of age during WWII.  Story and style juvenile, but matured as did its two protagonists. Should have remained focused on them.
Absolutely fabulous book; would have given it a higher rating, but the author jumps around in history, making it a bit difficult to keep up with what the main characters are doing.  Very confusing, the way he bounced from year to year, but besides that aspect, a great read!
I loved putting the pieces of this story together as it mirrored the very puzzles that ML's father built. To read about the events leading up to and during WWII in France & Germany simultaneously from a French and German youthful perspective was riveting. Such a great read!
Wonderful story that give us an understanding and window  into the lives of the French people as they were invaded by Hitler's armies, and how young people in Germany were forced into that army and brainwashed.  Beautiful insight into the mind and struggles of a blind girl.
My wife and I listened to the audio version.  Good story, great characters, but just too wordy.  I think I would have rated this 4 or 4.5 stars if there were just 30% fewer words.  We enjoyed the description and character development, there was just too much of it for us.
This is a marvelous book! Unusual in that the heroine is blind yet lived through the troubles of<br/>WWII. It's a book about courage and hope. I learned some history reading it, as well as grew to love the characters.<br/>You will enjoy it and cheer for the young heroine!
The first part of this book was a fairly good read, but about halfway through it got a little boring.  I felt it drug on too long, and some of the plot was fairly unrealistic.  I give it a "B" because it was a good try by the author but definitely not a page turner.
This is one of the best novels I've ever read. The story is compelling. The characters are complex. And the language is poetic. Another  thing that makes this work unique is the clear suffering of German civilians during WWII. The closing will stay with me for a long time.
One of the most beautifully written and compelling books I have ever read.  The use of the English language will make you want to read and reread certain phrases and sentences, but the story is so compelling and moving, you don't want to stop one minute to reread anything.
Very interesting story.  Excellent writing but a bit hard to follow.  Had to re-read some chapters to get characters right.  Very difficult to determine just where the diamond ended up.  Never did figure it out.  Had to read summary.  Maybe my fault.  Definitely Recommend.
A real  page turner.  She presents a different angle of life preceding and during WWII.  The earlier reveiws did not excite me but I tried a preview anyway and got hooked.  It's too good to label as a "beach book" but it is easy to get into and hold one's interest.
Very slow pace to this novel. However, the author does a good job in developing the characters of Marie Laure and Werner.  It just didn't hold my interest but, thankfully, there were a few twists at the end.  I sure don't see how this ever won a Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
A story of life thrown into the blender of a huge war that takes children to their future far too fast. The embody all the finest traits we hope all mankind has. Love, courage, compassion, intelligence, and hope. Truly novel worth the award. Read it twice for good measure.
I had a hard time getting into this book for the first few chapters, but once I got used to the way the author told the story through different years in Werner and Marie Laure's lives, I couldn't put it down. It was one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read.
This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. The writing is just musical, lyrical...it is one of those rare books where I wanted to keep reading just to what turn of phrase would be used next.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this book enough. What a masterpiece!
I liked the way the book unfolded.  So often short chapters make for a disjointed story but it worked here.  I thought the characters were interesting and credible.  The creeping tide of Nazism and the occupation of France seen through the eyes of children was interesting.
A tragic story of two young lives living in war torn Europe before and during world war two.  The way each one responded to their early interests and upbringing  and how that led to their opposite activities during the war.  This is not a book that you can easily put down.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br/><br/>The writing was imaginative, lyrical and almost poetic in certain parts. The character portrayals were superior<br/><br/>The plot, even though I hoped it to end otherwise, was engaging, a page turner and the book ended too soon.
This fiction presented real people, neither all good or all bad. The story line was fascinating; the characters unforgettable. The prose was like poetry, evocadtive, saying much with few words. The background is at the time of Hitler's ascendence. Heroism takes many forms.
Our book club chose All the Light We Cannot See as our book for February.  We all enjoyed the story of both main characters and found the book very interesting going back and forth between them.  We learned a lot about living both in France and Germany during World War II.
A well-written, powerful story with believable characters who strive to cope with terror and hardship during WWII. I became so absorbed in the book that it was difficult to lay it aside and complete simple daily tasks. It is currently at the top of my list of great novels.
This is a great story of a little blind girl making her way through an unthinkable time of a world war. Incredible writing makes you feel you are with her through every turn of events and page. I truly didn't want it to end and can't wait to pass it to a friend.<br/>Robin
Fascinating story which shifts from place to place and time frame to time frame as it tells of a young German boy and a young French girl launched into dfficult lives by birth and then by history.  Set in WWII era.  One of the most beautifully written books I've ever read.
Amazing novel ...couldn't put it down. The amount of factual information in this book was just amazing. The author definitely did the required diligence to come up with a historical fiction novel set in the times of WWII.... very enthralling -- read during a 3 hour flight!
This is a view of WWII as told in part by a blind girl living in France.  Due to her blindness invents and objects are described in details using all her senses that I found interesting.  The story is beautiful, poignant, sad happy and forgiving.  It is an engrossing read.
This is the kind of book that urges you to read passages over and over just to savor the language. The story is compelling through it's rich depictions of less famiar settings and complex characters, as much as it's engaging plot. I'll look for more to read by this author.
The two main characters are wonderful, as well as their supporting characters.  Two young children who had to grow up quickly during the war in France and Germany.  I recommend it to book lovers.  It is a very popular book.  Seems everyone I talk to has read and loved it.
This is a beautifully written book set during the time of the Nazi invasion of France. It tells the concurrent stories of a blind French girl and a bright orphan German boy whose lives intersect in wonderful ways. This is one of the best books I have read in recent years.
I would rate Little Women five stars.  So anything else will have to fulfill a twelve year olds dream of perfection.  But this book surely came close? The ability to become one with the character and her sense of responsibility despite her hurdles were perfectly depicted.
I would have liked this book so much better if it were about one-third the length. The author could have easily condensed it without losing any of the storyline. I do not enjoy this style of writing, although from the popularity of this book there must be in the minority.
A very good book. You become attached to Marie-Laure and Werner. I love that this blind girl is surrounded by people who love her just as she is.<br/><br/>It is sad.<br/>It is melancholy.<br/>It is happy.<br/>It is life. It goes on even under difficult circumstances.
A masterpiece of enigmatic beauty.  From beginning to end it did not disappoint.  For me, unputdownable.  A story told, through second world wartime until now, with a deft narrative.  Pleasurable entertainment, even with a morose subject.  Triumph of human spirit invoked.
Read it a second time for reading group<br/>Very powerful for me because  I met<br/> An Auschwitz survivor when I lived in Manhattan and a woman whose husband was in the Austrian resistance<br/>This generation is<br/>Leaving now & we should never forget what happened
This exquisitely crafted novel has shot straight on to my favourites list. The characters are beautifully drawn, the plot is fascinating and the themes are deep, insightful and resonate strongly in our current geopolitical landscape. Anthony's prose will melt your heart.
One of the best books I've read in a very long time!  Anthony Doerr is a beautiful writer and his scenes come to life for the reader. The characters are well developed.  And there is always a sense of hope that the story will end well for all of them.  I LOVED this book!
Two completely different people living on different sides of war and you know that their lives are running down one track toward each other but you don't know what the outcome will be when they collide. You are hoping for one outcome but you know the odds are against it!
I read this book for our Book Club.  It was very intriguing.  I was reading The Lady in Gold at same time, so both books spoke about the Nazi's and the heinous acts that were committed against so many innocents.  I had a hard time putting the book down once I started it!
Gorgeous language shapes this story set during the Second World War. Three main plots are artfully woven with memorable and believable characters and hauntingly beautiful themes of connection, obligation and the strange ways that fate plays our lives. Loved every minute.
I love WW2 stories and this one was written so beautifully, it makes me want to visit Saint-Malo. The characters were so loveable and the story, tragic and beautiful, kept my nose in the book. Anthony Doerr did a wonderful job at portraying the beauty within the tragedy.
Truly one of the great reads. I like novels set in world war 2 I have probably read over one hundred or so and I would rank this right at the top. It's sad, the characters are wonderfully written and you care deeply about them. I have sent this as a gift to many friends.
I enjoyed the structure and imagery of the book, like a nautilus, spiraling to through the story. Provokes reflection about the many prices of war. Compels us to contemplation of ideas such as choice, destiny, morality, wonder and awe, but isn't as boring as that sounds!
A remarkable story, well crafted and researched telling a fictional story about very real people and a very sad time. Don't miss this book, the very short chapters keep the story going at a tremendous rate and will keep your interest until the last page (and beyond)!!!!!
Going to Paris on Friday and staying in St. Malo.  This book was so descriptive and I was so enchanted.  Sadly, WWII was so cruel and almost robbed us of cultural art, jewels etc.  Thank goodness for preserving artifacts, paintings, and for the start of the computer age.
This is a story that absorbed me immediately into the worlds of wartime Germany and France. Well-drawn characters allowed me to see (and feel) the world-changing events that shaped their lives. This book grabbed my attention and didn't let it go until the very last page.
Very good read with wonderful insights into love, loyalty and family relationships.  Also, the historical depiction of Europe in the years during the Second World War was poignant and well depicted. I found the shifts in chronology, however, a bit tiresome and confusing.
A touching, lyrical story about children of light who are forced to live in a dark world, this story is one of lovely prose and narrative style that is extremely impressive. The author is a gifted writer who deserves much credit for his perception of the human condition.
A beautifully written book with strongly developed characters. Set in World War II, the novel alternates between the widely different experiences of a German boy and a French girl. It is a story of survival, the use of technology for good and bad, and love. A great read!
Beautifully written. I can see everything that Marie does not. I cried, I laughed. Someone told me it was like poetry after she read it and I didn't understand that, but about half way into it and when all the pieces start fitting together, well, it's beautifully poetic.
While I enjoyed this historical fiction, it really isn't the caliber of story to win a best book award. The author mixes times and places very well but it is sort of 'Dancing with Wolves'; he just couldn't come up with a good ending so he just rambled along and it ended.
This book has everything, drama, intrigue, sorrow, horror, love and a nail biting ending! I read this with my book club and I really enjoyed it. It was like every scene came to life in my mind and I could see everything. Such a riveting book.<br/><br/>Valblue, Kentucky
A wonderful compendium of prose, language, culture and writing acumen, beautifully woven into a rich story filled with history and truth.  This story, it's interwoven characters, will be held close to the treasures of my heart for a long, long time.  Thank you Mr. Doerr.
I avoided this book for a long time because it sounded depressing and I was tired of World War II books. It was a mistake. From the first page the book brings the reader in to an intimate memory of a young French girl and a German boy and how they met the changing world.
A very poignant story about life in France prior to and during WW2.  It exposes some misconceptions we in the US developed about the German people.  It also is a vivid depiction of a father/daughter depiction and how a handicapped daughter overcame her physical handicap.
Confusing going back and forth in time, would have been nicer to follow the different characters chronologically.  Too many coincidental connections (eg radio broadcasts from exact place where Marie ends up).
This book is so beautifully written, you want to soak in each word. I loved how there was two stories running parallel, each compelling in its own way. It was interesting to see a good side to the Germans, it humanize them. A book that will stay with me for a long time.
Touching, moving, sensitively drawn characters, with whom one cannot fail to empathize. Best novel I've read in several years!  Beautiful storyline, evoking sympathy and pathos, but never maudlin, fantastic, or forced. An immense contribution to the world of literature!
Well written story which switches from a German soldier's viewpoint to that of a young blind girl in France.  I thought it started out a wee bit slowly, however, it picked up the pace pretty quickly.  It sure kept me turning page after page!  Highly recommend this read.
This is a second world war story - and depicts the life of various young people, and how the war affects them - it is an excellent read. The young blind french girl, the young german boy, the families of both - all keep you interested and the story really develops well.
You won't want to miss this book. It's one of the best World War II stories. How can a young blind girl manage? What happens to a museum piece, a one of a kind? How can a inquisitive kid be so creative and teach himself to survive? Read and you'll see. Outstanding book!
This novel is excellent and should be read by teens as well as adults, so they see some of our history during WW II.  The author tied the radio through out and developed the characters and the setting well.  The diamond is in the story but not the most significant part.
Beautiful book weaving together several lives. Definitely demonstrates the horror of war with concentration on Nazi Germany. Would recommend to any reader. I think his development of how Marie-Laure grows and becomes independent is particularly interesting and accurate.
Like a cut diamond - so many facets shimmering. Small and precious moments of disparate lives that come together then split apart. Beautifully written without being maudlin. The horrors of war without being either grotesque or cliche. I would highly recommend this book.
I give it 4stars because it's well written, a solid read but was hard to get into at first.  There was so much background about the characters I could have done without.  Once I got through it I was hooked.  It was an original story with a lot of<br/>breadth and depth.
Touching, poignant story..exceeded my expectations in every way. Loved the chapter set up..short..just leads you to the next..hard to put down! Sent the book to my brother who is a WWII buff and he loved it also...a winner for sure! You won't tregret ordering this book.
This novel will stay in my heart and mind - for its powerful writing, for the beauty and heartbreak of its masterfully intertwined stories, for its poetically spellbinding passages.<br/>Recommend to all who feel deeply - about war, about peace, about human connections.
I really enjoyed this book.  It was very well written - the characters were realistic and their complexities were explored throughout the story.  The reader is able to empathize and sympathize with the characters and the time period.  I would highly recommend this book.
Characters are engaging, particularly the secondary ones.  In the film version, we'll say it has a strong supporting cast as this book is just aching to become a movie.  Not exactly uplifting and not depressing either --- mostly just a tale of survival and life goes on.
A magnificient book. (Per my wife.)
great book.  I highly recommend it.
I loved this book and was a great refresher on what the French went through during the war... it even gave you a sympathetic feeling to the starving young people in Germany who joined the Hitler Youth.. new shoes, clothes and food... and a promise of a brighter future.
Wonderful story and well written.  I had trouble putting it down.  The ending was a surprise I didn't think it would end this way, but it makes sense.  War changes people; some don't compromise their beliefs, others will. But, they all suffer in some way.  Great story.
A very inspiring novel about people who lived through some of history's darkest hours but never lost their humanity. There are lessons here in courage and common decency that we can all benefit from given the lack of courtesy and compassion commonly seen in cyberspace.
Absolutely loved the first 80% of the book and then it seemed as if the author rushed to finish, just wanting to be done with it. So much more could have been done with the character interaction in the last chapters.  Ending was very disappointing from that standpoint.
As others have written, this is a magnificent work of literature. The writing is superb and it is difficult to put down once you start reading. I am a "geezer" and retired college professor and have read several thousand books in my life. This is in the top 10!
One of the most compelling and thought provoking reads in a long time. So many themes and sub-themes and amazing characters that could be books in their own right....this book has kept me thinking about it for weeks and after a second read, at that! Highly recommended!
Incredible read. I learned so much about the craft of writing and WWII. The perspectives depicted in this work have not been explored in other works about WWII that I have read. I enjoyed this book so much. I hated to finish it. I look forward to reading more by Doerr.
An amazing book that follows the horror of WW2 through the lives of two young people and their amazing connection through radio, the light we cannot see.  Had got me interested in further reading about this  period in the 20th century.  And there are lessons for today.
A powerful novel about the awfulness of war and the human toll it takes on every level.  The plot unwind in a unique fashion that intensifies the effectiveness of the story.  The characters are deeply etched and reach out to the reader. The impact of this book lingers.
An extremely well written, historically accurate account of the human impact of Hitler's rule during WWII. It tells the main story through a German youth and a blind French girl. The book is quite long, but well worth the read.  I won the Pulitzer prize for literature.
I read a couple of novels a week. Over the past year I've read just two that I would describe as great. This is one. (The other is The Secret Of All Things). I got this as a library ebook, but I'm going to get myself a copy so I can read it again to savor the language.
Purchased as a gift for my wife, was disappointed to learn it may not be a "true 1st Edition" but not sure by the copyright page info provided.  Thought it was advertised as a 1st edition, may not have checked it out closely enough.  She likes it none the less.
Read this book because my friend said it was her favorite read this year. I, too, really enjoyed the unique plot told by a young blind girl dealing with the atrocities of WW II in France. Certainly not light reading but very honest and uplifting, with a touch of magic.
Such a beautifully written book. The author describes the characters so well, you feel they are all apart of you. Suffering through a terrible age in history, each of the characters is heroic, all for such diverse reasons. Maybe just for surviving. Lustrous paragraphs.
I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about Orthodox Jewish practice within the unseen world in which this takes place. Our book review this month in our women's group will be discussing this book and I look forward to hearing other women's take on the story.
One of the most engaging books I've read this year.  It has characters I loved and those I hated.  The author weaves a beautiful story around events that are familiar but brings new depth of understanding of day to day life for ordinary people.  I didn't want it to end
This story follows two characters through WW II, who interconnect at the near end of the book. Many times I wondered how they would meet, and when they did it was perfect. I loved that the end of this book, though sad, gave me satisfaction and closure. Excellent book.
The book is interesting about what the young people in Europe had to deal with during World War 'll. Many had to live with their relatives away from. hometowns were they grow up . They fought for the freedom as well did the elderly people and they survived to the end.
A spell binding book.  The entire spectrum of feelings and emotions come into play many times.  It is beautiful written in spite of being wrought with some horrific times.  The author does an incredible job of plot development which keeps ones turning page after page.
This is a beautifully written novel and a page-turner.  One gets very close to the main characters and experiences scary war times with them and yearns for their safety and happiness. My only complaint is that Doerr wrapped up the action rather too quickly at the end.
I really enjoyed reading this book.  The story line was very good and the characters we very interesting.  I did not, however, much care for the way the books ended....it wasn't a bad ending, just seemed to be a "non-ending."  I would still recommend the book.
The first part of the story was confusing as it jumped about in time. Never understood the point of that. Then it became very intense as protagonists and antagonists closed on mutual intersections. Then I was left wondering what was the point of it all? Life, that is.
This was my second read this year. Once as a men's book club and then, again, this summer. This summer, I kept running into people who were reading it at Chautauqua Institution. We would fall into conversation about it. Doerr spins a fine yarn.  I highly recommend it.
Excellent book, enjoyed it very much. Takes a little getting used to as to how it is written, however, short, choppy chapters that switch back and forth from point of view and back and forth through time. Once you get the hang of how it is written, it reads very well.
A wonderful read; at times painfully sad but also so uplifting and heart warming.<br/>History seems to be repeating itself as man turns unmercifully against man, woman and child.<br/>There are many lessons we all could learn from the characters in this moving novel.
Beautifully written, a compelling read of the experiences of two children from opposite sides in world war 2. The writing just came alive off the page, I loved his use of imagery and the characters were so real and I really engaged with tgere stories. Loved this book.
I might have given this book 4 stars because I found the time and place shifts hard to follow, but I tend to go for 5 star books, and I don't want to dissuade anyone from reading the book. It's very good, and I find I miss being in the story now that I've finished it.
A beautifully crafted story set during WWII, but so uniquely different from so many others of that period.  The usual one sentence description makes it seem depressing, but it is actually hopeful in many ways.  Wonderful characters made real and lovable.  A must read.
A very good novel and a real page-turner. The descriptions are both sensory and lyrical and are images that one envisions even after the book has been read. The characters captivate and a real plus is finding out the later lives of these characters at the novel's end.
This author writes in such a different way until it was hard to read in a normal rhythm.  Some of the passages seemed to want to be sung.  It was very different for me but also very beautiful.  I don't know if  he can find another story to tell as good as good as this
I enjoyed the story and the way the story was told with that alternating points of view.  I also thought is was easy reading, especially with the relatively short chapters.  At night it was, "I'll read just one more."  I was hoping for more at the end, though.
The writing style of A. Dower is quite different and enjoyable.  The story is not at all what I was expecting.  I am a biologist and the small amount of museum science was accurate and added much to the feeling and calm feeling of the story.  The book is aptly titled.
This story is intricate and beautifully written. What a story teller. The characters were superb and the interwoven lives was captivating. If you like well written books then read this one.... I hadn't read this author before but I am off to purchase his other novels.
Captivating, even haunting.  Such an unusual war story that it's characters have to have been drawn from real lives and experiences and insights into hidden beauty, courage, fear and brutality.  Couldn't put it down yet sad to part with its characters when I finished.
I loved this book!  The character development was excellent.  The story presented a very realistic picture of life in Germany and France prior to and during World War II.  This is a powerful story about some very extraordinary people thrust into extreme circumstances.
Characters are compelling but a few holes in the plot and the structure (short chapters that jump around in time) is hard to follow on a Kindle reader, would be a lot easier with a physical book. But a rich look at relationships, human nature and life during wartime.
Very good story. The love a father showed his daughter was heartwarming.  She was blind, but her father taught her how to "see"  The other<br/>protagonist was a very interesting study too.  I was sorry to see him die.  However,  I enjoyed the read very much.
I just loved this, from beginning to end, and looked forward to my evening reading every night.  I know everyone is getting a little burnt out on the WWII fictional novels right now, but definitely read this one.  It will suck you in, and leave you totally satisfied.
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. I absolutely loved it!! The plot is engaging. Character development is compelling. The writing is beautifully crafted and almost poetic. As I finished the book, I wanted to start all over and read it again!
This is a tough book to wade through the first third as it describes the horrors and intensity of war but it becomes an excellent read as characters are developed.  The sentence structure is a joy to read and the language is truly beautiful.  I strongly recommend it!
One of the best books ever.  Normally, alternating narrators and short chapters are annoying.  This is so skillfully crafted that it flows without ceasing in ah historically correct narrative that involves believable characters.  It well-deserved the honors received.
This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The imagery was wonderful and the story was beautifully written. Thank you Mr. Doerr for such a powerful and heartfelt book. I'm looking forward to reading more of your work. You absolutely have a fan for life!
This is one of the most haunting books I have read.  The characters, Werner and Marie Laure were vividly portrayed and took me to a time that has always interested me.  The other characters were well-drawn also.  I look forward to my book discussion group next month.
So beautifully written and structured. A puzzle like the tiny houses Marie-Laurre's father makes for her.  Two - no more - stories alternating and then finally intersecting.  Yes, it's about WWII, but that's so beside the point.  One of the best books I've ever read.
I WOULD HAVE LIKED A , BIT MORE CLOSURE. What did Werner WRITE about? WHat was done with the stone. HOw did Werner effect the blind girl emotionally, etc. I would recommend this high school literature classes to get people thinking about all the complexities  of war.
Historical fiction reminiscent of Suite Francaise with an 80 year timeline allowing us to follow character development and outcomes.  Very satisfying.  The author created vivid portraits of. Pre. During and post war characters, nature. and landscape.. Jo Ann Lederman
I love books that have interesting characters and are set in interesting location or time. This book achieves all three. The prose is great and the story moves along. I'm quite a reader, not really a critic, but this has been the best book I've read so far this year.
All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel s a great read that will transport readers to Paris during the World War.  With a young boy enthralled  with radio waves , a blind girl, and a master locksmith and carved as the characters work through the challenge s of the time.
Slow to start but becomes more interesting from an historical view and very engrossing as one follows the protagonists. Going back and forth between the two protagonists was a little irritating at times but was a good vehicle to show the differances and similarities.
Good detail about what it was like to live during the Nazi years, especially for two young people.  Rarely do readers get the point of view of children and teens, French and German, the occupied and occupier.  Two children trying to survive with their unique talents.
I put off reading this book because I've read too much about WWII and the Nazis recently. This book has some grim moments but ultimately it's a wonderful story that's wonderfully written. My only complaint is that sometimes the back and forth in time gets confusing.
This book deserves more than a Pulitzer Prize.  It should be required reading in senior high school English courses so that students may learn how to write coherent, thoughtful and complete sentences, paragraphs, dialogue and memorable texts/letters/research papers.
This story was well written in the description of each characters feeling and emotion in the story. Many books are predictable. I was surprised several times with the path this story took. I like books that take me to another time, and this one did that beautifully.
This a well written fiction that puts the personal impact in the horrors of the war in France. I appreciated the personal impact on young Germans . We can see the need to remember there are people of every age hurt by violent conflicts. Memorable for happings today.
This the best book I have read this year.  Although it is sad, the characters are quite interesting and the story intriguing.  It is so beautifully written, that I could easily read it again just to appreciate every word.  I would encourage anyone to read this book.
beautifully written and cleverly told.  I will read this novel repeatedly.  Such anice interesting perspective of the conflict from a German child to a beloved blind daughter,  to  a troubled man all living out the same events from opposing angles.  A favorite read.
This book is simply stunning. The backdrop is all too familiar - one more story about WWII.  But the plot, the characters, the multi- layered meanings of various elements make this novel rise above - far above - anything that I have read in the last couple of years.
Had a hard time getting into this book.  However, it's been several days since I finished it and it remains with me.  It's thought-provoking in the sense that it reveals man's true nature...caring for one another even in the face of war when we are supposed enemies.
Gorgeous writing!<br/>Loved the characters so well developed.<br/>Also found the very short chapters made this 539 page book just fly.<br/>Each was complete and something to savor.<br/>A difficult story line somehow still uplifting not unlike Diary of Anna Frank
An emotional and very well written book.  I struggled some in the beginning and middle because of the horror of the events that were happening, but the last half and especially the way it was brought together at the end was spell-binding and I didn't want it to end.
Amazing book, riveting story, complex characters, spellbinding. The interweaving of characters from different, conflicting worlds was amazing. Gives you a unique perspective on World War II. This story will linger in my memory more than most others that I have read.
My father served in WWII and so every page I felt I walked with him through his youth and a time that made the Greatest Generation. This is not so much a war novel as a discovery of self that every child experiences as the world pushes and pulls each into adulthood.
A story about two different people and how their lives intersect. Doerr is able to really draw a great picture of each individual in your mind. I felt what each character felt. Storyline was very good as well. Don't want to spoil for other readers, highly recommend.
A compelling and suspenseful read. Tender ,parallel narratives , eventually intersecting, of a diffident German boy and a blind French girl trapped amidst the chaos of WWII . The story is studded with a bonus of curiously intriguing,and esoteric, scientific details.
I did not expect this book to end and as fast as it did. I guess what else can you expect from a war story? Things didn't end pretty for anyone. I bawled through the end and wished it turned out differently, but I felt as  if I was experiencing the truth of it all.
I was immediately captivated by the protagonists.  The author presented each one in their unique environments and the history that formed them.  How they all meet during the final year of the war becomes z story that left me hopeful in the goodness of human nature.
One of the best books I've ever had the pleasure to read.  Beautifully written.  Believable characters.  A good story and an ending that was satisfying.  I've recommended it (and had it recommended to me!) by almost every reader I know.  The highest recommendation.
An imaginative tale of innocence, corruption and the wasted lives as a result of war. The writing is always beautiful impactful without beign obvious or preachy. It does what any good book should do--make you feel like you're there in the story with the characters.
This story is told with so much care and detail. The characters are all so clear and lovely. Amidst the war and the bombs and the ugly the reader is made to feel pensive and to listen for the sounds and use their fingertips like the main character. I was entranced.
This is a superb novel which is gripping in many respects.  It shows a blue collar German boy who rises through the ranks during the Nazi time, and a French blind girl who makes it through the war.  Very touching story.  Could not put the book down.<br/>Tom Kirsch
Really enjoyed this book! The two main characters are people you want to succeed, and I got engrossed in their movements throughout the book and how they interplayed within the context of WWII. The writing is clear, with a steady plot and pace. Very enjoyable read.
I loved the characters and couldn't wait to see how their lives would intersect in this gripping piece of historical fiction.  The mystery of the whereabouts of the Sea of Flames added to the page turning element of All the Light We Cannot See. Highly recommend it!
Beautifully written. Various themes- the barbarism of totalitarianism, the horror of war, the unbelievable courage of some people, the value of perseverance, the sanctity of family. The book is loaded with value. It would repay a second reading. Highly recommended.
Interesting and original story showing not all war stories have a glamorous side. Most of the time you're just trying to survive.  I read a lot of books based in this time period and while this was not my favorite, I will give it points for originality and reality.
This is an amazing story of fortitude. The dreadful conditions and emotional upheavals the young people in the story suffer are hard to imagine. I found the story quite difficult to follow in some parts but I was glad that I had stuck with it when I got to the end.
This story brings you into the lives of two young people during WWII running parallel lives one in Paris the other in Germany. I found each character well developed I truly cared about each one and was saddened to leave their lives once the story ended. Great read.
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Beautifully written, at times breathtakingly composed.  Every character comes alive three-dimensionally; none are simple, all have complex histories and motivations.  I lost sleep over this book!  Highly recommended.
A good read as it depicts the life of young Germans during the second World War. Also the invasion of France and what the people suffered. It is told through the lives of a German teenage boy and a blind teenage French girl. I think 5 stars would be an over rating!
I got this book on audio - it started out ok, but then it seemed the writer must have been getting paid by the page, since he got overly involved in adjectives and the story lagged.  I dropped out about halfway through the book since it just was not going anywhere.
A rich tail of two family's love, courage,and strength. Werner and Marie Laurie experience the horrors of world war OK. Werner caught up in the hysteria of Nazi youth by his desire to learn . Marie Laurie rescued by her family and in turn rescues them. A great read
This is one of my new all time favorite books.  What a beautiful, tragic, thought-provoking read!  The story is spellbinding and the prose is poetic and positively luminous.  I found myself savoring every word.  This is something altogether special.  Don't miss it!
I was astounded by the the authur's transition from one city/country scene to the other but never loosing its smooth transition.  How the author able to see but think as a blind person to count heartbeats or breaths for knowing where and how far and to think space!
A beautiful novel about an ugly time.  The sense of innocence and lightness is lovely.  The characters are well-drawn and very human.  The architecture of the novel is interesting and the short chapters made it seem a light read but with many things to think about.
Beautifully written story.  The main characters were wonderfully developed and their stories fascinating.  I kept reading and reading wanting to know when Marie-Laure and Werner woud finally cross paths.  It wasn't at all what I expected but I was not disappointed.
For some reason I could not feel that I knew these characters.  The constant back-and-forth in time was distracting from the main point of character development. I did like the follow-up portion of the book where the final outcome for the characters was described.
A story of life during war told through the arc of two children, one French girl and one German boy. The purity of the main characters juxtaposes against the horrors of WW2.  Their struggles attest to the creativity and Persistence of the best of the human spirit.
I enjoyed  the book.  This has enough history of WWII to keep a history buff involved and a very good story with interesting characters.  It was easy to read at a  good pace and keeps you involved even thought there is a good amount of detail.  Very likeable read!
Starts slow but picks up and becomes hard to put down.<br/>World War II as  seen from two entirely different points of view and experiences.  Very interesting and keeps the attention of the reader throughout.  The ending ties the whole story together.  Well Done!
When this book was recommended by several very different friends I decided I should give it a try. It was a history lessons and several personal stories combined. The short chapters made it easy to stop and start again, although putting it down was extremely hard.
Good book. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it jumped back and forth in time & sometimes became confusing. Because of the NY Times review, I inferred the relationship between the main characters were going to be more than it became. Schadenfreude.
This book encompassed a compelling history of intersecting lives woven into brief exposures that culminated into a whole.<br/>It was very well done, excellently conceived, and achieved an aching goal.<br/>A book for everyone who appreciates a well written story.
Every line was crafted.  The imagery is so remarkable that I feel like I have just emerged simultaneously from a vivid documentary film and an emotionally riveting epic movie.  I think Mr. Doerr's writing will be studied in literature classes for many, many years.
I really enjoyed reading this. Lots of history and a little science mixed in with great characters. As is usual with books about World War II, it's upsetting to read for me. I will never get over the fact that all of these horrors happened just 70 or so years ago.
This was definitely a book of human spirit and the will to live.  I enjoyed the journey of the two main characters and how they survived.  Of course it was sad to live during the war, but it had times of joy, love and even laughter and this is when survival wins.
I'm reading this book for a second time to find all that I missed the first time through.  The chapters are short, which I like.  The slant on WWII from the perspective of extraordinary yet ordinary characters makes it stand out from other books set in that time.
Beautifully written saga of two young people's lives during the Nazi occupation of France, which eventually intertwine.  Each chapter switches perspective and place from one to the other.  I hated to see it end.  However the story and emotion have stayed with me.
This book was not an easy read.  Spent an eternity waiting for the big meeting between these two characters, to only be let down<br/><br/>It is very well written and descriptive, but boring.  Am I the only one who feels this way?  I'm missing something for sure
It was a very important book that forced you to look at WW2 differently.<br/><br/>There was a situation that made me almost quit reading the book-the prisoner and the water.<br/><br/>I gave it 3 stars because I had to force myself to resume reading each time.
I loved the writing in this book. I usually read a book in a day or two, but I took my time with this book reading it word for word. I felt like I was reliving the story and knew it couldn't be all a fairy tale ending. I know it will remain one of my favorites!!!
This was a great read/listen (i used whisper sync)  ... I am often disappointed by endings... this was no exception.. But, what would have pleased me was less realistic than where the author went.  I enjoyed the book very much.  I miss it.  I wish it wasn't over.
Well written with an insight into how Hitler recruited youth for the Third Reich. Two characters whose lives are parallel experience the tragedies of war while remaining innocent. A beautiful and sad story with suspense and a look at what it really means to live.
GREAT story line and plot with really interesting characters.  I loved the way the characters all come together through the story.  The details of the settings are incredible and gave a very good glimpse into what went on during that time.  A fascinating read!!!!
The writing is poetic. This story presents a different take on events of World War II, from the viewpoints of a young French woman and the grooming if a young German youth. Insightful. And very interesting. The pace will keep you engrossed in the plot. Well done.
This is a wonderful story, a book I could not put down. It tells the story of a young French girl and a young German boy during World War II.  It spans the whole war and up to the present day. How their lives intersect in a strange and beautiful way. A must read!
All the Litht We Cannot See is an amazing but sad history lesson.  You see the war in the eyes of young children.  It's sad to read what children had to live through and what we take for granted.  This tender novel is written so beautifully you can't put it down.
I absolutely loved this book.  You wouldn't expect someone to come up with a new and novel twist on such a well-traveled subject as the Second World War, but Anthony Doerr has done just that.  I couldn't put it down.  Well worth all the accolades it has received.
This was a wonderful story that takes place during WWII, from the perspectives of a German boy and French girl, each with their own story to tell. Well developed characters, interesting storyline and the book will bring out many different emotions as you read it.
Amazon: asking anyone but an expert to review this book is ridiculous. Can you imagine if this were back in the day.... You've just finished War and Peace! How many stars? Grapes of Wrath! How many stars? Sometimes there aren't enough stars . This is one of them.
A beautifully written book with an unusual, compelling story of two young people whose lives intersect in WWII .  The author's love of science is threaded throughout the book beautifully, providing depth and complexity to this engaging story.  Highly recommended.
Beautifully written, and the book displays an amazing knowledge of science, geography and history.  I'm sure it's possible to get a lot of that knowledge through research, but Doerr weaves it together with human emotions in such a way that it kept me spell bound.
Fantastic story!  The author does a great job of developing the characters.  There are twists and turns through out the story.  I don't want to give anything away but I couldn't put the book down.  Many of my friends have read this book and felt the same!  Enjoy!
What a beautifully written book.  It certainly did deserve the Pulitzer prize.  Sometimes I was so afraid for Marie-Laure LeBlance that I  had to put the book down and come back to it later.  This was World War II in occupied France as we have never seen before.
I bought this because of a book club I was thinking of joining.  I thought this was going to be some boring WWII book.  Boy was I wrong.  This was about WWII but far from boring.  The way it was told and the interesting characters really made this a page turner.
An astonishing book. Beautifully written. The characters are developed in such a way that they become real and make you feel their every experience. My words are inadequate to describe this beautiful book. You will think about it long after you have finished it.
One of the best books I've read in a while - spoke to me on so many levels that I'm still thinking about it several weeks after finishing. I don't normally bother to review books that I'm not very impressed with. So take that for what it is worth - I enjoyed it!
So beautifully written, almost poetic. I felt the heart and soul of each and every character. How we are all so different and yet so alike. To love and feel loved. I wanted to see how the story would end, and yet I didn't want it to end. I truly loved this book!
This is a beautifully written book that conveys very powerfully the horrors of war.  The characters are well-developed and interesting, and the story moves forward and backward in time, giving a sense of suspense to the story.  I recommend this book very highly.
A very cerebral and unique writing style with multiple flash back and 'flash-forwards". Very in-depth psychological understanding of people deeply affected by the political happenings of the day and their own hidden flaws. Enjoyed it thoroughly -- must read.
This book is achingly sad  as it explores the burgeoning conscience of childhood. Just a little labored at times with technicalities, but worth it for the story that takes us so immediately into the machinations of the Nazi War machine and the French Resistance.
Beautifully written novel.  I loved it.  Only criticism is I would have ended it a little sooner.  There is a natural end the author could have chosen that to me would have been more meaningful.  But other than that it was so enjoyable and I miss the characters.
wonderful read. a little sad, but also uplifting.<br/>there is no way we can imagine what people went through during this horrendous period in time<br/>unfortunately it is still going on today throughout the world as we know it.<br/>always the children suffer
I must be an odd-duck because I did not enjoy this book at all. It really dragged on and on... at 50% I was wondering what else the author could possible write about. Most of the writing is beautiful though, just imagine one big long poem without much of a plot.
Very different.  The novel alternated between the German soldiers and the French blind girl and time shifts.  Some readers might find this confusing, but I did not.  Very compelling with the differing points of view.  Would be an interesting book for discussion.
I belong to a book club, consisting of nine members.  We read one book each month and then gather to discuss the book after sharing a good meal together.  This book was highly recommended by one member who has recommended a lot of books with World War II themes.  Having read several books with this theme in the past year, I naturally felt hesitant.  I started it slowly, reading a small section each day.  Then, about 100 pages in, I read for the next four hours.  I could only put the book down because I had to accomplish some work.  The next day I read the book until it was finished.  What made the book so compelling?  The author had a way of making each character real and present in the moment.  He developed the story in a way that the plot, although complex, was very easy to follow.  Developing sympathy for the many important characters in a book is never simple, but for some reason it was impossible to say we disliked any of the characters.  The story centers around a myth about a 132 karat diamond with alleged magical properties.  One of the curators of a museum in Paris is charged to create copies of this diamond and send them to various safe places where the German would not be able to find it during the evacuation of Paris before the occupation.  Soon the focus of the book turns to the daughter of the curator, Marie-Laure, who is blind and travels to St. Malo in Brittany to live with her great uncle and her father.  A counter plot tells the story of a young German orphan and his sister whose father died in a coal mine accident in their home town in Germany.  Later Werner is selected to be trained as part of the Hitler youth in the military because of his talent in dealing with radio equipment.  He lands in St. Malo a part of the German occupation, and meets Marie-Laure just before the Americans liberate St. Malo.  Anything more will spoil the read for you.<br/>If you choose not to read this book, I say "More's the pity".
Set in the waning days of WWII, the lives of a German soldier and a blind girl from Paris intersect.  Story is well developed, very descriptive. Mixed reviews from my book club.  One person thought it was the best book ever, another hated it.  Most felt just OK.
Excellent....great read....in one part it was a bit confusing....thought I had missed something and went back....kept reading and realized that a few chapters had  an ending and then went back and told how it happened.  Otherwise, I would  have rated it 5 stars!
One of the most beautiful books I have read in years. I couldn't wait to see how the characters lives would meet and so sad for the book to end. It told a different view of WWII that brought the plight of these children to the horrors of a war. Highly recommend.
All the Light We Cannot See was a fascinating story of two young people on different sides in WWII. The juxtaposition of their stories is a fascinating tale. How their paths cross for just a moment adds to the suspense that builds as the war escalates in France.
beautiful book.  Rich in elegant imagery and unforgettable complicated characters struggling with love and morality.  I could not wait to read it at night like I usually do, but downloaded to my iphone so I could read it between things during my day.  Fantastic.
This book was selected for our book club. Everyone really liked it for its complexity and a view of the war from various perspectives.  It was a reminder of how some humans can descend into depravity and how others can uphold humanity even in the worst of times.
At initial reading I didn't think I would care for the book.  But suddenly I was transported into the lives of the characters and their plights. Thought the author used some inventiveness in how he wrote and developed the story and it's impact on the characters.
I spent a lot of time around blind children when I was growing up and I was amazed by this story and what the young hero was able to do.  I enjoy reading books about the Holocaust and many are too hard to read due to the inhumanity but this book was fascinating.
book was very well written and kept me rapt in attention.  Loved the back and forth of the two main charaqcters, but be prepared to be deflated with the ending.. i honestly have read so many7 excellent books whose authors do not know how to conclude, or when to.
Beautifully written, but very sad.
A great book with wonderful prose.
Perhaps the best book I have ever read. If you are interested in what life was like in Europe before and during the second world war, this book does an amazing job of presenting that. The character development and attention to tiny details are beautifully done.
This is an interesting book that reveals the complexities of World War II from the perspective of a young German orphan and a blind French girl. Some amount of intrigue keeps the reader engrossed in learning about how precious jewels were kept from the Germans.
This book truly took me on a different journey through that horrific time in our history. It was soft through Marie-Laure's eyes and loud through Werner's. But in the end, each took the other's view. It was beautiful, heart-breaking, and inspiring!! Loved it!!!
This book is a worthwhile read.  I especially liked the aspect of family.  However, I found the present tense somewhat awkward and distracting.  The story also flips back and forth in time.  In spite of this, I enjoyed it.  It's a different take on a WWII epic.
It took me a while to get into it. Once I did though, I was hooked! The writing is beautiful. One paragraph has stayed with me: when Werner and Marie Laure meet. It's a metaphor, for someone being born, and for when things come together. Anyway, it's beautiful!
I enjoyed this book very much...although i did think the final chapters were a bit too contrived.  the writing is awesome--i could envision all the scenes described.  the book makes you think of the terrible price both soldiers and civilians played during WWII.
Like many other readers, this book kept me enraptured. Doerr can craft words to manipulate octaves of emotions within you. He literally turns you into the characters that you are reading about. This is a complex read. For people who appreciate literary fiction.
I loved this book! At first, I couldn't put it down, then, I didn't want it to end. I love a book that is character driven, and the characters in this fascinating story are wonderful! A great perspective on ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances.
Beautifully written story of intertwining lives during WWII, focusing primarily on a young woman from France and a young man from Germany. Very lyrical and poetic while at the same time conveying the true horrors of war, which made it at times a stressful read.
A book that is very hard to put down...<br/>I often read before sleep and it is sometimes difficult to follow stories that skip around in time, but worth the look backs needed for this one.  I like the fact that he bring the story up to the present in the end.
I read all the good reviews but the subject matter wasn't what interested me in a good read. Then Christmas rolled along and I got the book. Well I must say it surprised me. I really and truly enjoyed the story. Now I need to find another book like this. Enjoy!
What I enjoyed the most about this book was the perspective of a young German boy forced into being a soldier. The other young character who was a blind girl in France also had to deal with the horrors of the war. The author intertwined their lives beautifully.
Another voice trying to make sense of the innocent who participated in the rise of the third Reich.  The innocent who became guilty because they ignored what their consciences tried to reveal.  This is a great story and a different angle or view of the problem.
At first I thought this might be another world war 2 survival story, there's been so many others. But if you want a book about self discovery, inspirational connections and self sacrifice you'll love this book. Fantastically written, extremely hard to put down.
The book is OK.  I bought it on the basis of the other reviews.  Yes, it is nicely  written, but I read a lot, close to 50 books a year...sometimes more...and while the story line was interesting the book is not a "page turner" as other reviewers wrote.
Great book. The life and experience of a blind girl is expressed quite vividly.<br/>I read it right after reading  East  by Fritz Schroeder, which also takes during the same time period. Both books are excellent. The Schroeder books feel very autobiographical.
I so wanted the story to end differently...<br/>It is brilliantly written.  I felt as if I could see the characters distinctly...and knew them as friends or acquaintances.<br/>It helped me understand some of the feelings Europeans must have felt during WWII.
This is one of the best novels I have read. The vivid descriptions put me right in the heart of the pre-war movements and the war (WWII) itself. Pay attention to dates at the beginning of each chapter or sequencing will become confusing.  Don't miss this book!
The book was great from a historic prospective and the development of the character.  I thought the ending was rather anticlimatic and was a bit disappointed.  It was a bit difficult to keep track of the timeframe you were in being that it jumped around a lot.
Wonderfully drawn characters experience the sacrifices of WWII with hope and courage. From Russia and Poland to Italy and France, the reader gets a real sense of the scope of Hitlers reach. A heartwarming testament to the strength of love and the human spirit!
I liked this story very much.  The writing--concise, crisp sentences and description of settings--was the best I've read in a long time; and, I read a lot of novels.<br/><br/>Will read some more of Anthony Doerr's books. " All the Light...' was terrific.
The tragedies and humanness of WWII.  This book shows glimpses of the life of a young German boy and blind French girl. Both caught in the machine of war.  It shows how hard it was to make choices and the turmoil of the choices made. It is well worth the read.
Based on the traditional fairytale story of "princess in tower", this rich, dense, terrific novel takes us on excursions through war, science, early technology, treasure, obsession, brilliance, deprivation, and various wonderful adventures of the mind.
This was a beautiful book in spite of it's subject, Second World War, but from a very different point of view, that of a german boy soldier and a french blind girl, plus little is always said about the people on the loosing side in a war, everyone is a victim.
i loved the story but i don't like the style of writing<br/>it went from 1941 to 1944 back and forth frequently<br/>i did not stop reading it because the story is worth it<br/>but i would have enjoyed it more if there was not so much back and forth in time.
I don't usually read Fiction...This book was so WORDY...he has to explain everything in detail...that is why I don't read fiction, I feel that way about Mitchner  I only read Hawaii and that was so long and drawn out.  not thanks<br/>Sorry about this comment.
This was a very moving story and told in a unique way than most stories of this time period. It speaks of family love and ties, courage in the face of inner turmoil ,  fortitude to keep moving forward and loyalty to ourselves and those who mean the most to us.
One of the most profound well written books I have ever had the privilege to read. On so many levels it grapples with what it means to be human and ethical. The author moves seamlessly between time periods - a brilliant writing- a powerful read- don't miss it!
A fascinating and so original piece of war writing, that guides one superbly through the horror of "what a war really is". the emotions are so stimulated that the probable reality of those crazy and bitter years will be with the reader for a long time.
Not surprising given its broad acclaim, this is a wonderful read. Compelling characters, fascinating plot, and a great WWII story, told by an eloquent, lyrical writer. I really liked it. Felt a bit lonely when it came to an end. The mark of a really good book.
This is a sobering, sad, and wonderful book about World War II Germany and France.  The characters wonderfully parallel each other, the tension builds, and they finally  - albeit briefly - meet.  (Hope that's not a spoiler.)<br/>Read it.  You won't regret it.
This book is about a young boy taken from an orphanage to train in the Nazi youth army and a young blind girl who with resilience withstood the hardships during WW2.  A good insight of what life was like in the European countries during the war.  I enjoyed it.
The language seeps in and captures you without you realizing. I felt like it was a slow start and just as I got to know the characters and care deeply about the direction of the story, I was near the end. There are no cliches in this story which is refreshing.
A very well written story, lots of twist and turns. Many sad times for the main characters but what an amazing journey they each had with so many difficulties to overcome. Loved how their lives eventually connected. A good read that you don't want to put down!
A lyrical account of a devastating time in our world history, told through the eyes of several people, most notably a young German orphan named Werner and a young blind French girl who has grown up in a museum, Marie Laure.  Beautiful, devastating, inspiring.
Prose as poetry, my favorite fiction. A marvel of imagination set in the lap of history. Time moving this way and that like flashes of light. A thin line between the real and the not real, like the stone itself. Recommend to anyone with an elasticity of mind.
This is one of the best novels I have ever read, of any era. Such a wonderfully crafted tapestry of intersecting stories.  Beautifully written. A sad tale of the human condition in so many ways, yet still finds ways to inject elements of hope and inspiration.
Great book. Touching story of the dedication of a father to his blind daughter.  I learned more about world war II and how terrible it was for so many.  I looked up on ask.com of how many casualties there were in world war II and found 72,000,000 were killed.
A fantastic story. Two lives, moving through very differerent realities during World War II, eventually connect in the town of Saint-Malo, France. Their dramatic meeting near the end of the war is life-saving for one -- and life-affirming for us, the readers.
I recommend this book to anyone who is fascinated by the stories  of vastly different characters whose lives intersect against the backdrop of war. There was just enough explained over the course of time and what wasn't doesn't matter. I couldn't put it down.
This is a great read.  It shows how people on both sides of a war are caught in their love for their own countries and how the supposed enemies are not enemies at all.  It is the political machine and the abusive governments that cause hatred between nations.
This book sounded like it could be boring and too long.<br/>But it's not.<br/>It's finely crafted without feeling like you're back in high school English.<br/>You quickly care about the boy and the girl.<br/>Very smart and the world is painted so clearly.
Oops, this posted before I edited.  It was supposed to be 'beautifully written, wonderful characterization, haunting'.  It let you see the heart of those involved in the horrors of war from many perspectives, giving insights into the "whys" of human behavior.
Such elegant language that was a pleasure to read. Bouncing back and forth in time, it would confuse briefly, then later chapters would clear that up. Unsatisfactory ending, but don't let that stop you from reading this: it's the best book I've read in years.
If you wish to be gripped by a story with characters that are exquisitely de emoted, then run and do not stop until you start reading the book.<br/>Be careful---all chores will go by the wayside as you follow the stories developed by this outstanding author.
A good book, but what an ending?  I have to go back and reread it, because it simply doesn't make any sense.  Maybe I missed something, but it seems like the author got a call to finish the book and quickly finished it, without regard to what had gone before.
I loved this book, couldn't put it down.  I found myself truly caring about the characters, whose development was fascinating, as were the descriptions of what happened in the war.  This is one of those rare books about which I very much wish it wouldn't end.
This is an incredibly beautiful story. Rich, complex characters living through a period of history where all the best and all the worst of mankind was on display. Poignant and thought provoking. Oddly not depressing. Bravo Mr. Doerr. please write another one.
Our Book Discussion Group read this an ALL of us agreed that the book is outstanding-the characterization, the setting near Saint Malo (25 miles from Mont St Michel on the coast of France), the portral of the Germans and their occupation. It is a page-turner.
I loved this book. The characters and the story are compelling and it is beautifully written. I tried to slow my reading down so it wouldn't end. To find such simple bravery and kindness during the depths of war from these ordinary people brought me to tears.
While I am not quite finished, the book is wonderful.  Such a sad picture of what Europe was going through during Hitler's rampage.  The two children who come of age (one German and one French blind girl)  before and during World War II will touch your heart.
The back and forth between what was happening to the characters during the same time makes this a page tuner. What's next? I gives insight to what happened to normal people in the most abnormal of times and circumstances, and the consequences in later years.
I was immediately drawn in and found the characters complex and cared about the outcome for all of them.  Plus, since it was accurately set in an historical period, I got to learn a little about world war II France.  Will read more Anthony Doerr as a result.
Very well written; let me experience the War as though I were on both sides especially through the eyes of one who could'nt see yet had more insight than most. A great book for me is one I don't want to end and this was it. Looking for more from this author.
Spectacular. I couldn't put it down. The way Doerr was able to add to the story by describing it partially through a young wonder-filled blind girl and weave the multiple stories together was fantastic. The language of the novel was colorful and descriptive.
I have read many books about WWII and this is one I can recommend.  Every part is interesting especially the back lives of the two main characters.  Also what happens when a country is occupied by the enemy. Even the bacics of life are missing and treasured.
Interesting read but very lonnggggg...winded.....Was actually disappointed with the slow pace and found it difficult to pick up again once I had put it down for a break. The historical aspects of the novel were good but the book went on and on and on........
I don't read much fiction and read this book for a book club I am in and I am glad that I did.  The author's ability to describe events and places so as to make them come alive in your imagination is truly amazing.  I plan on reading some of his other works.
A sensitive novel about the morals and ethics of war and of relationships. It is set in a fairly accurate background of what was happening in France and Germany during WWII, and is an "excellent read." It is certainly deserving of the Pulitzer Prize.
I am not a writer nor a critic. I can just say that this is the best novel that I have read in many years. It's structure is unusual, but I liked that. The characters are endearing and in spite of the horrors of war there is a warm, lovely feel to the story.
A well written novel with very strong and memorable characters.  Viewing the horrors of Nazi Germany and WWII through the eyes of a young woman and young man provided a close up perspective of what life was like for so many people during that troubling time.
Otdd organizational technique...not confusing, but jumping between both time, countries and characters took away from smooth story telling line.<br/>Marveled at resourcefulness of a blind girl to survive into womanhood with no sense of missing much in life.
It is not often we are given a gift such as this, where the writer not only bares the soul, but does it in such a natural way, as if we could all see into others' soul. Beautifully written, it brings sadness when the book ends, and you know there is no more.
If you love historical fiction,  especially WWII,  you will love this book. It is a treasure.  Beautifully crafted story, characters and writing. You will care about what happens to all the characters,  Germans and French alike, even if you didn't like them.
Very interesting, with an unpredictable plot. I enjoyed it, but this is not the kind of book I would often read because it is sad. It takes place during the second world war. Prepare yourself for death, bombings, and Nazi life. But do read, it was very good.
This author engaged me in the story from the very beginning and never lost my rapt involvement with this book.  Beautiful writing, sad, but uplifting story.  It is a long book but it ended too soon.  I read 2-3 books a week and this is my favorite this year.
I normally shy away from reading historical fiction; I prefer sci-fi and fantasy novels. But this book is so beautifully written, I couldn't put it down. The prose, the imagery, I can't remember the last time I read such a poetic and well constructed novel.
i honestly didn't want this book to finish. These days I am  very fussy about  the books I read and if I don't like It I  simply don't persist. But with this book persistence wasn't an issue. I loved the story, the characters, the language - so many things.
Beautifully crafted story of courage and humanity in the face of terrible wartime destruction and loss. Writing is poetic and compelling. Characters are heroic, yet real. Moving, harrowing, touching, heartbreaking...one of the best reads in quite a while...
At first I was bothered by the jumping from narrator to narrator and jumps in time periods, but the story is fascinating and we got to know the characters well. In the end, I was happy I read the whole book. And it was nice we got to see them after the war.
Beautiful descriptions - believe-able characters and setting. It was slow for me at first, but eventually got into it. I'm not surprised this book won a Pulitzer as it ended on a depressing note. I'm still thinking about the way the author described things.
How could you not give this book 5 stars?!? It is simply brilliant, starting with the title. This is one of the most beautifully crafted books I have ever read. It ranks with all of the great classics. You have to read it to appreciate it. A work of genius.
This book had me very engaged right up to the end, which fell shockingly flat. This is one time I might have benefited by looking ahead to see how things turned out. The central mystery of the book, I felt, was never resolved, and that was a disappointment.
This book was our book club selection.  I loved every minute of reading this book.  the book is so beautifully written.  Seldom do I see such vivid description.  The plot is interesting and the characters come to life in the story.  I highly recommend this.
Wonderful writing - so many wonderful details.  It affected me a lot.  It was sad and terrifying in many instances.  I think we need to know how much people suffered from that war.  In depth descriptions of the people, the scenery, the war and so much more.
I liked his descriptive writing if gave you the feeling you were where he was describing.  I found the swapping from character to character in different chapters a bit confusing, I personally don't like that style of writing.  I was unhappy with the ending.
While the outcome of the war is known the outcome in the characters lives is not. It's an interesting approach to the characters individual stories which eventually intertwine. The handicaps of all the characters is fascinating to read as the plot plays out
This was a long story of WWII in France mostly and how it affected a number of lives, both French and German.  Descriptions were vivid.  The story jumped from one character to another, sometimes making it hard to keep track of characters.  Very interesting.
Even if you are a history buff read this book. If you are not a history buff read this book. Well written. Incredibly difficult to read just due to how savage this war was in general. Would have given it 5 stars if the ending had wrapped up a tad different.
Nice application of the alternating chapter device. It worked well for this story and probably gives a fairly accurate account of this historical period without the demonization of certain characters which are found concerning this particular era. Poignant.
I really loved the book and the way it is written. I would have liked the part of Marie Laurette and Warner to be a longer relationship and maybe more romantic.  I know it is a realistic novel, but a bit of Hollywood ending would have made it nicer for me .
A powerful story of tragedy and survival and what war can do to people. There are many interesting twists in the story that are somehow all pulled together at the end. This is definitely a page turner that will keep the reader interested until the very end.
This was a well put together book and not at all a typical war novel. What I really took away from it was the influence the radio had during that time period. Most of all it was a brilliant love story spanding over time and people. It was an excellent read!
I really enjoyed this book. It captivated my interest throughout. It's not often that I've read a book about WW II without an American perspective. I found it to be eye opening. I did find the ending to be a little bit rushed, but that is my only criticism.
The kind of book you wish would never end. Beautifully written, powerful story following two different individuals focusing primarily on their childhood and adolescence during WWII. A very different war novel, heartfelt and deeply resonating with humanity.
An amazing detailed story of WWII with chapters alternating between characters, places, and time, in both Germany and France .  A story of love, learning, hatred, of wealth and poverty, of cunning and despair.  A tale which the reader will not want to end.
I liked the the book but found it hard to follow. Jumping back and forth was confusing. Liked seeing the war from young Germans view, how they were not given A choice to join and how they survived even though they had to pretend or succumb to the Nazi way.
This was a selection by my book group and overwhelmingly given high marks by all but one member.  She  does not like the change of narrators and the changes in time and places.  Balance of members loved the characters, the writing and the story and I agree
Loved this book! Yes it's another book about World War 2 (which I love) however it's from a different perspective. The struggles of the was from both sides. The relationship that develops from both sides. And how a blind girl deals with the horrors of war.
Good to get background info on German and French viewpoints during WW II.  Interesting back and forth among main characters.  Plot sometimes hard to follow, but very interesting.  Amazing local travel competence of the blind character, Marie-Laure LeBlanc.
A very well written novel.  I always like stories about regular people stepping up because they are the only ones there to do so.  This book had superbly written characters that had their flaws that would normally be hidden beneath the word "hero".
The story of the two prominent characters coming together in the dark atmosphere of war and how the light comes on them in different times in the story.  The light meaning something different to all of the characters. A very different view of this history.
This is a beautifully written (if once in a long while, slightly over-written) book with compelling characters, a suspenseful plot, and an important historical setting (the years leading to and during World War II, with some later and much-later followup).
A lovely book. Chilling in parts that describe how the Nazis train young boys to be cold and heartless. Yet in the end, humanity triumphs. Wonderful evocative prose. I felt that I was walking through the bombed out rubble that was Europe at the end of WW2.
I could not Stop reading this book.  Several times I paused to reflect on the words written, the images iinvoked.  And near the end I cried whilst reading.  A great book club choice.  I won't soon forget the characters.  Well written.  Thank you Mr. Doerr.
The chapters are short but they pull you into the story and won't let you go. So many things are happening across different countries but then their lives intersect and this mosaic of stories becomes a beautiful picture. Fantastic read that stays with you.
Mr. Doerr's writing is so easy with just the right words to evoke complete pictures in your mind.  The short chapters go forward and backward in time, yet one is never confused with the two main characters.  A great book to have and pass along to friends.
A book of great depth about a time of bravado, fear, terror and tenderness. Poetry in paragraphs interspersed with tight suspense and disguised within the worlds of war both domestic and military. I wanted it to end and yet I wanted it to go on forever...
It took a while to get going but once it did I couldn't put it down. I would say for more of a world war 2 love story, read Tht Invisible Bridge. For a Great War story, read Ghost Soldiers. This was a little of each but left me wanting a different ending.
I enjoyed this book immensely. I found it to be highly descriptive and thought provoking. I am an Oxford comma girl and found the few run-on sentences to be annoying, but it did not detract from the story. Good, clean,World War II novel. Highly recommend.
Beautifully written, poignant and very human. The story arc both went where expected, then didn't, so some surprises, but also the satisfaction of following an expected path. A building momentum, lessons in humanity and open-mindedness. Wonderful, if sad.
The best book since "Life of Pi".<br/>I could not put it done, finished in 3 days.<br/>Amazing characters and story. Very realistic, balanced view of people on both sides of the war.<br/>Shows that survival and death is totally random in a war.
The two young people (main characters) seemed destined to meet, and yet they lived so far apart and in such different worlds. Doerr masterfully draws you into both and has you cheering them on to whatever success they can achieve. It was hard to put down!
Stunning book that helps us understand how to speak about the unspeakable horror of this war.  Doerr's depth of feeling for these characters brings them to life in a way that allows you to be with them and share their experience.  Thank you Anthony Doerr.
I hate that I gave this only two stars but it was very wordy and I had to skim over parts just to get through even though the characters were wonderful.  I am sure the author tried to convey each main characters background but just too long in developing.
Well written, very detailed and descriptive, weaving a connecting web painting the brutal picture of the second World War through the eyes and ears of some brave souls but, although worth the read, probably the point could have been made with fewer words.
Beautifully written.  A World War II book like nothing you have ever read. The author's story telling and imagery is something to be admired.  A slower read than other novels...but pay attention: this is artfully and skillfully written.  A beautiful read.
I have recommended this to everyone I can.  You will not be able to put it down.  My mother in law stayed up super late (which she never does) to finish it.  While I didn't find the outcome completely satisfying, this book captivated me.  It is a classic.
I loved the characters whom the author portrayed vividly. I felt as if I could understand what it was like to be blind, to be a young man or woman during WWII. It is a touching story of the power of  love amongst family & friends as well as of redemption.
too lengthy and at times confusing as the author switched years and events associated with the particular character, i.e Werner and Marie. some of the writing and insight into the characters was very good. I would not necesarily recommend this to friends.
I enjoyed every sentence, every word there. The only reason I gave it 4 starts is the last chapters. They are simply unnecessary. I would enjoy the book more if the author left some space for my imagination and let me complete these final chapters myself.
Just a marvelous well told story. I so enjoyed reading this, even with the heartbreaking situations as they came along. So many situations came to be for an awful lot of people  as a consequence of that War. I'm thankful for authors such as Anthony Doerr.
I loved this book! His writing is beautiful and it has everything you want from a novel- great plot, characters and writing. I just bought his most recent short story collection after I finished this. Also although it is 500 + pages it's a very fast read.
one of the best books I have read
Fast paced. Couldn't put it down.
Couldn't put it down. Great book!
A wonderful story, a must to read
I really enjoyed this book. The stories of the young blind girl and the young German boy and how they came together. The author did switch back and forth a great deal, but I didn't have trouble with that. I would like to read more of this author's books.
Ready to listen again, so much fascinating detail, suspense quiet drama.  Revealing of cruel things balanced with little miracle moments of salvation.  Breath-holding moments. Smooth, almost hypnotizing reading, suitable for each characterization needed.
A beautifully composed novel weaving together lives during World War II. The resilience of the human spirit comes through in the characters spinning through the desire for power and financial gain, horrors of war and deep personal loss.  An amazing read.
Mr. Doerr does not need my help.  His book just won the Pulitzer which says it all.  Wonderfully sensitive on a difficult subject. WWII and the holocaust. He handles the subject lightly while at the same time conveying the anxiety and trauma of the time.
I liked the book but it seemed to me that at tbe end, the author ran out of steam. A few bestsellers I've read recently are the same.  Nothing seems worked out or followed through at the end. Call me old fashioned but I like the end to wrap the story up.
you will want to keep reading it without stopping.  where is it going?  what happens next?  how will it end?  the author's voicessee of the people, the places, their actions and feelings make you feel like you know them and can picture them in your mind.
I really loved this book. This author has such a gift for describing everyday experiences...you can feel the breeze and smell the salt air  when you read! I just wish the ending were more satisfying...I wasn't happy with the way Werner's storyline ended.
This is a beautifully written book. The story is compelling, the characters are carefully drawn, and although it is a work of fiction, Doerr's research infuses it with verisimilitude..I urge you to put down whatever you are reading and pick up this book.
This was a well written story of multiple perspectives during world war two.  The book brought me to tears several times as the story of these individuals lives allowed be to feel as if I were there with them through this difficult time in world history.
Loved, loved the story up to the climax. The wrap up following felt rushed and I was disappointed for all of the characters. The chapter about the drunken Russians and Jutta added nothing to the story and should have been edited out. Speaking of editing?
I loved the history of the story and the telling of the story from opposing sides of the war. Also feel the book was very well written. I did find the conclusion a little weak and if left me wanting more, but even so I would recommend reading this novel.
A fantastic read. Masterfully written. Characters you'll fall in love with. I was afraid that the story would be too dark for me and, while it's painful for me to read about Natzi cruelty, it was well worth the read. One of the best books I've ever read.
I did not think that I would like this book... Just another book about World War II !  I recently finished "The Book Thief" and now this?  I found this book wonderful and inspiring. The writing is beautifully descriptive and poetic.  Highly recommend it.
I will start with what I did not like, which is little.  I didn't like the fate of a main charcter....but I see no way around it.  The book was well written and captivating.  I lost many hours sleep because I could not put it down and turn out the lights
I very much enjoyed this book. WW 2 novels are my genre of choice and this did not disappoint. I did not find the jumping of time frames confusing at all, rather I quite enjoyed them as they were all great lead ups. Worth the read and highly recommended!
This book and author will rank high on my list of Favorite books ever....A way with the written word that is hard to explain. I loved this story and feel good having learned from it. I must read more stuff from Mr Anthony Doerr.<br/><br/>DeWayne Bremer
This was a really good book-right from the beginning it grabbed my attention and never let go until the end.  Very descriptive writing, excellent characters, moving story.  The ending was very nice-which to me is important.  I would definitely recommend.
Couldn't put it down!  Really enjoyed it!  Sad but well written and a good story. I might have enjoyed it so much because it took place during my life but at any rate. . .I'd recommend this book to anyone. . .everyone (and, I have begun to do just that).
What a wonderful book!  I was skeptical, as I sometimes am when a book gets lots of "buzz" but this one really delivered.  An unusual WWII book that will pull you in right from the start.  No spoilers here...just read it.  You'll be glad you did.
Doerr's style is crisp and concise, but evocative at the same time; a difficult task.  I kept thinking of Hemingway's directness (It is a war story, after all), but Doerr has an ability to capture more of a scene's ambiance without using a lot of words.
This book is too great, you will not regret to buy it, it has a great rhythm to itself and not one moment of dullness to it. The author has a great way of taking out the crudeness of the war, but stil invoke desperation and nostalgia with such elegance.
This novel is one that you find yourself torn between wanting to read the next chapter to discover more of the story and wishing it would never end. It's beautifully written and it's easy to become lost in the story, and to fall in love with characters.
Powerful story.  Beautifully written with characters I was drawn to.  Like a previous reviewer, I also wanted to read it slowly so as to absorb every sentence. Desperately wanted the story resolved but at the same time hated to think of the book ending.
This book is absolutely incredible. The timeline and pacing are like no other book I've ever read--the jump cuts in storyline will leave you in suspense and awe. An astonishing creation. There were nights I found it impossible to put down. You will too.
I know I am in a minority with my thoughts on this book.  I did finish the book but I had to force myself to keep at it.  I realize it is a war story so it could not be a feel good book but I found it to be drawn out, depressing and hard to get through.
Not all "Best Sellers " are good books for my book shelf. However, this novel is outstanding and is my best for the past two years. It's not just the author's style but the storyline keeps you hooked so you don't want to put it down.<br/>Robert
A very nice read. The story is written in a little different style and concerns two lives that you know from the beginning must cross in some way. I looked forward to getting back to reading it each evening. A story of innocence and growth. Recommended.
It was very moving.  The falling action and denouement  were a little protracted as if the author tried too hard to tie up all the ends (not really necessary) for all the characters, but I found it very engaging,  mysterious, possible, and well written.
A  well written, very descriptive novel. The characters were not only well drawn but had an emotional equivalent as well.  However, way it was assembled going back and forth in time, was for the first several lines, confusing.  But I would recommend it.
Truly a beautifully told story. Although some might be reluctant to pick up this book because it was nominated for the National Book Award, you should know that it is very accessible and a great read. It is marvelously creative and the writing sparkles.
I loved this book and couldn't put it down, it led to many late nights! I don't usually read books about war, but this was excellent and really just about the stories of two children in different countries having to deal with the war. Highly recommended
Wow, I just finished All the Light We Cannot See and I am still in awe.  Mr. Doerr is a wonderful author. The book is so well written, I could not put it down. The history is so real and the characters make it come to life. I highly recommend this book.
Brutally wonderful book! Captures the history, but is a compelling study of two youngsters trapped in a world not of their making.  Incredibly powerful, the type of read that you are compelled to continue while not wanting it to end.  Deeply satisfying.
As historical fiction, it's very good. As literature, I find the metaphors a bit strained. This is almost a metaphysical novel in the sense that John Donne is a metaphysical poet:  there's an overriding conceit, and I find it handled a bit ham-fistedly.
This is an amazing book, I felt I was there with the characters and could feel their angst, fear, and hopefulness...this is surely one of best books I have read and I am an avid reader and have read many books in this genre...don't miss it, read it now!
I had trouble with the jumping around in time. This was an unique idea for a book about WWII. The story is captivating, however, it just wasnt a book that developed characters that made me care about them. The short chapters added to the choppy feeling.
What a wonderful story of family, love, redemption, and forgiveness. The story is simple, yet brilliantly weaves destinies of those who grow in wars not of their making, but who realize they still ave a choice - even a simple one. Could not put it down!
The writing is beautiful and the story flows back and forth seamlessly between two teens from France and Germany. This story is another sad WWll story but unlike most does not center around the unfortunate Jewish people. but others who greatly suffered.
One of my all-time best books! I loved the way it was written - short chapters moving back and forth between characters very quickly. It gave me insight into the impact of the war on the German and French people. Engaging story, extremely well written.
This book was written from a very different perspective of World War II than any other book I've read.  It illustrates what really happens on the ground during and after a war through the lives of children. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
Beautifully written. Good plot. Characters you really care about  The complete package! Warning: don't start this book if you have other important things to do - they will fall by the wayside as you spend every second you can spare devouring the pages.
I was captivated by the story from beginning to end; only to find the final pages created more questions than I had answers to.  I had a mystery on my hands.  This tale was simply delicious and stayed with me a long time after I had read the last word.
Great writer. His words are like a richly textured tapestry of images in vibrant colors and intricate designs. The characters come alive, the scents, sounds and feelings surround and envelope the reader. A very well written story, a real treat to read.
All the Light We Cannot See is a fine tapestry with depth, detail and nuance. The reader is plunged into the abyss of World War II one moment and flying above its pain the next, finding the warmth and tenacity of the human spirit during very dark days.
A refreshingly different point of view (or rather 2 points of view) of the well-trod subject of WWII.  We see the world of the Hitler youth and of the German forces as they are fighting a losing battle on both fronts.  Many very interesting characters.
This is a phenomenal book, well written to the point that the words on the page are visceral with imagery and ones feels part of the story. The depth of the words makes this a multi dimensional story that can be read twice and not interpreted the same.
Beautifully written and set in Nazi Germany , this book takes us through a journey through the 'eyes' of Werner the German boy and Marie-Laure the visually impaired girl.<br/>Each experience is unforgettable. The end however left me without a closure.
I was captured by each character and felt as if I knew them personally. I was hopeful, angry, happy, sad, scared and wanting to learn more. A must read for those interested in history and the lives of those who have lived, loved and suffered before us.
I am not sure what all the hype is about this book.  Of course it is not bad but if you want to read a real telling of peoples' experiences during the second world war read, Six Years to the Zero Hour by Karoline Krauss.  She and her family were there.
Enjoyed the story from the beginning and found it difficult to stop thinking about.  It was interesting from a historical view filled with intrigue and anxiety while totally immersing one in the emotional depth of children in war.  Great entertainment.
Gripping drama of what one is able to accomplish when things seems hopeless and insurmountable.  A testament to the inherent drive to survive and the humanity that shines through when things seem at their darkest. Found this book difficult to put down!
This is a must read, the best book I have read in years.  Thought provoking, absorbing this is a story that stays with you.  You will find yourself thinking about the story for a long time after you finish reading.  It's a story you do not want to end!
Beautifully written! Doerr's characterizations are superb; the plotting is perfectly paced; the conflict leaves the reader both loving and hating; the imagery is the best I've read in years. Treat yourself to a delight of the senses and read this book!
Wonderfully written.  The author spent 10 years writing this book and it shows.  I love how the author takes you into the characters' pasts and then brings you back to their present.  Great job.  One of those books you hug when you're finished with it.
Excellent story; a different perspective on World War II, about which many of us have read so many books. Did not feel like a 500+ page book--the writing was beautiful, the characters were vividly drawn, and the plot was fascinating. Highly recommended
Fantastic read because I cared about the two main characters - their choices and lives - immediately and deeply. I could not stop reading and hated finishing but was so satisfied with the ending. Has stayed with me. Recommend without hesitation to all.
This is a  novel of beautiful developed characters and exquisite detail. If you are looking for fast action and clever twists avoid it but if you are looking for an engrossing read that pulls you in and never lets you go, this is your baby. I loved it.
I initially had to adjust to how the book jumped back and forth to differ years, but found that it was very effective in the telling of this story.  Anthony Doerr made you feel like you were in the room with the characters of the book. One of the best.
This book carried me from the first pages with its lyricism and generosity of spirit.  Each character seemed real, war and the Third Reich the enemy.  Its touches of magical realism emphasized the ties we all share as humans in our struggle to survive.
The vulnerability of the main characters and their ability to survive, even thrive, in the darkest of moments of European industrialization and war shows strength and beauty of the human spirit. A compelling weave of lives that makes for a great story.
This is a beautiful book.  The writing is lyrical.  The chapters are short and the pacing tight.  The story alternates between the viewpoint of two young people as they experience WW2 and weaves in a mythical jewel.  I would highly recommend this book!
This is an incredibly moving story, one that will stay with you years later.  It's beautifully written, the characters come alive in the author's hands, and the plot holds your interest right until the end -- everything an outstanding book should have.
Taste, touch, smell, feel every word in this book.  Truly one of the best books I've ever read.  As the subject of this story is blind, the descriptions are wonderful.  The story is riveting.  The end of the book wraps up all the questions...I loved it
This is a very well crafted novel which is an excellent read. The author's character depiction is very good and he develops and maintains a high level of interest and tension. I highly recommend this book. I am sure that no reader will be disappointed.
It reads well because Doerr's writing style is imaginative, graphic and colorful. The story line is complex and interwoven but, it keeps your attention.  WWII viewed from the eyes and life experiences of German common folk was particularly interesting.
Good story, but it is too bad that his style is so jarring.  He uses sentences of one word or two words, and if we are lucky, a 9 word sentence.  For example: "A kitchen full of debris waits down the corridor. Hallway deep with drifts of ash. Chair overturned. Staircase ahead. Werner starts up."  I thought of a first grade primer: "Run Jack run."<br/><br/>As I read, I became increasingly frustrated with his sentence structure that got in the way and did not further the story.
Seldom do I worry too much about literary prizes, but in this case I am very dismayed if not disturbed ‎by this book; it is a story about two teenagers, a French girl and a German boy, and is set in WWII Europe. He is drafted into the Wehrmacht and she is in a family associated with the resistance. The whole book is written in a way to satisfy the expectations of that part of the current middle class ignorant about world event, world history and bred on a pseudophilosophy of political correctness and Hollywood morals. The writing is poor, it is schematic, the plot predictable. The most upsetting part is that the net effect is apologetic of German atrocities. In this sense the book is a slight to the true victims. I was always told to "never forget". But there is something worse than to forget - and that is to "remember wrong". 
Definitely enjoyed reading this book.  Well written.  The characters in the book were well developed and I had a hard time putting the book down.  I liked the style in which it was written... short chapters alternating between the two main characters.
A very good read. I enjoyed the take of the author on the verisimilitude between the blind girl and the orphan boy, but I felt there would be more connection  and interchange. I was amazed at how well the author described the bl;ind world of the girl.
It's a look at two lives and those who move around them just before and during WW2.  It's realistic in that the lives people led then were tough.  The story is quite intriguing and well written.  It's personal, like Farewell to Manzanar and Atonement.
When I first heard the story line, I was intrigued by one of the characters having blindness. The author did a wonderful job of description from a sight impaired individuals point of view. Love how the lives of the main characters were woven together.
I kept waiting for the magic, the magic that makes your breath stop when you read a book with so much promise. Granted the topic of war is never happy, but there should have at least been one moment, at least one and yet there were none. Disappointed.
I would read anything Mr. Doerr writes! His use of words is so beautiful and captivating that I found myself rereading some sentences that were just put together so perfectly I was amazed. Besides being written so superbly, the story is unforgettable.
Very much enjoyed and couldn't put down. Helps also to see how easily the German youth were brainwashed and/or forced into fighting for Hitler. How sad. Potential spoiler alert: would have preferred a different ending, but was more realistic this way.
I was hopeful when I started this book.  It did not live up to my expectations.  The story just didn't come together for me and the characters were not complete.  I finished it so it had enough content to keep me going but was disappointed at the end.
This beautiful book took me to a dark place in our history and introduced me to two characters, from each side of the conflict, who were kind and brave. The locations in France couldn't have been more real if I were walking those streets. What a gift.
A story of both the humanity and inhumanity of war, innocent joyful childhood and childhood ravaged by war. I give this novel 5stars, because it was brilliantly written evoking a range of all emotions regarding family, love, war, and scars left by war
A miracle of detail and allegory braid into a story that left me breathless. History, physics, biology, geology, and the mysteries of the human mind and soul all blend for a story that condenses the sky and ocean, no the universe into words on a page.
Doerr's plot & structure of his novel is brilliant. His weaving of science, with land scape & the intricacies of the  human fabric of his characters captures the essence of each of them in their respective place in the mosaic that this novel presents.
A beautifully written story about a young French girl who becomes blind, and a German boy who is a radio geek and how their lives intersect during WW II.  Despite their hardships, both characters maintain their  curiosity, intelligence and resilience.
Fantastic Read.  Grabs your heart and soul and won't let go until it rips your heart from your chest.  Even then, it remains long after gnawing at the part of you that remains aching for more.  Recommended for the reader who enjoys well-written books.
This is a very sensitively written book about about two young people during WW11 - a German soldier and a blind French girt. I learned a lot about France during the German occupation as well as the training of young German boys preparing to go to war.
A wonderful book about World War 2 told from the perspective of a young German boy and a young blind French girl.  Their parallel stories of the same time create a riveting tale.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to both adults and teens alike.
A beautiful book- evocative writing, characters you learn to love and care about. Skillful use of plotting so that the reader is always wanting to turn the next page, but not too quickly, so that the writing itself can be savored. Highly recommended.
A great story, beautifully and carefully written. Cannot recommend highly enough. If you like to read literary-level fiction but also desire a compelling narrative, look no farther. The title is perfect (check Doerr's website for a full explanation).
Just a stunning, heart-wrenching view of how war affects both sides in the conflict, which is easy to forget.  Every person has a point of view, and a story, joys and fears, no matter which side of the conflict they fall on. This moved me to my core.
I would definitely have given the book a 5 except for the ending. The 2 side by side stories are excellent, the characters are engaging, the plot is not predictable and it's beautifully written. Not sure what I expected but the ending was a let down.
An amazing book written about WW II, a young French girl and a young German soldier and how their lives intertwine.  It was fascinating and the descriptions of the area made me so curious I had to look further into the history.  I will read it again.
A very interesting story & I learned a lot concerning  the war in France. I found it fascinating how the young girl dealt with being blind in her circumstances of having to be independent and dealing with the war and being so brave without her father
Best book I've read in a long time! I couldn't put it down, yet didn't want it to end. Told from a unique point of view- actually two viewpoints- a young blind Parisian girl and an orphan boy growing up in Nazi Germany. Very strong narrative writing!
I loved this book.  The story flowed so well, and it was so well-written.  I loved all the details, the coincidences, and the plot twists.  I raced through it because I had to know what happened, but I believe I will be reading it again to savour it.
well worth reading.<br/>Some parts are difficult to read but well written & move along quickly.<br/>The people are courageous &  deal with  their occupation bravely.<br/> Whoever thinks this didn't hen needs to read this & be convinced otherwise.
Very interesting twist to the invasion in WWII of France, and to hear the story from different perspectives whether French or German.  How doing the right thing sometimes effects so many. And how each persons life can effect another without knowing.
The prose was beautiful and the story itself evolved with a masterful craft. I read this book while enduring the 2015 snowstorms, wind and frigid temperature. Certainly no comparison to war torn France but added a bit to understanding the suffering.
This book is not for those with an easily upset stomach. It shows both the best and worst of how mankind treats each other; from the never-ending, desperate love of a father to the horrendous atrocities of war.  I will never forget these characters.
Masterful, suspenseful, couldn't put it down. Loved how the lives of people were interwoven throughout the book, even if the characters themselves never knew it. Looking at WWII through the eyes of children coming of age was a total new perspective.
Against the backdrop of World War II, the intertwining story of a blind French teenage girl and a genius German boy is a reflection of the power of radio, of sensory perception and of the burdens of history and family. A fine and entertaining novel.
Many great phrases in this novel.  However, it could have been a 400 page book, too many times the author repeated  what we already knew in a different way.  I am glad I read it but probably would not have stayed with it without friends suggestion.
I enjoyed this book immensely. It was a great story and told in a way that was both gripping and philosophical. This is not just another book about the Holocaust. It really depicts what real people were feeling and going through during World War 2.
I found the first two-thirds of this book to be very slow...interesting, but slow, then the pace for the last third was very fast.  I loved the method of telling the story from different perspectives out of order and the writing was very beautiful.
I learned new things about the war in France. The author created characters that seemed so real. He describes scenes in ways that allows the reader to see, taste, and smell. Incredible! This book is like life. It doesn't always have a happy ending.
The book plays before and during WW II. Follows a French girl and a German boy over several years until their paths cross during the last stages of the war.  Nicely shows the complexities of decision making in a dictatorial system. Very compelling.
Good story. I don't read much fiction but I enjoyed this. I think there's someone out there who make this into a killer movie. It might actually work as an animated feature. Like the characters and the story. Nothing earth shaking but a good read.,
THE AUTHOR'S DESCRIPTION TO DETAIL IS OUTSTANDING- I HAD DIFFICULTY FOLLOWING THE STORY AT TIMES.  BUT THE ENDING IS WORTH YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE. BRINGS THE PAST UP THE PRESENT IN AN INTERESTING WAY,  I PLAN TO READ THE LAST CHAPTER SEVERAL TIMES.
A new perspective on WWII.  Characters highly developed and interesting.  Many interesting twists but I am always disappointed when one of my favorite characters is killed in the end, but it was not expected and  makes for a more interesting story.
Although I enjoyed the book very much, I found that a couple of the chapters were out of sequence.  Perhaps, when "they" put the audio together, they placed some of the chapters in the wrong sequence.  Did any of you have the same experience?
Beautifully written book - I will read it again.  Although it covers a long time frame, the very short chapters and switching perspectives made it a quick read, and the characters are totally engaging.  Made me look at WW II from a different angle.
I loved the vivid descriptions - throughout the book I thought I was there! The love of man and the beast in man are vividly displayed.<br/>  I thought the ending was a bit abrupt!  However. In retrospect it too portrayed life as it is.  How sad !
It was unpredictable and thoroughly enjoyable.  Reflective with a hint of sadness but courage and steadfastness throughout.  The bad guys were portrayed.. Or at least most of them.. To be quite decent people had the circumstances vp been different.
I read a lot but this is the first review I've ever written on this or any other website. I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. I just finished it and I am dying to start a new book but I know that it won't compare to this book.
To be honest, even 5 stars seem a paucity, a pitiful reflection on such a well-written, fully character-driven, descriptively cogent and humane...ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE provides a light to illuminate my feelings about the work or art itself...
This amazing book captivated me from the very beginning.  The characters were full of life - I felt I knew them somehow.  It has been a while since I read a book and was sad to arrive at the end.  This was one of those books. I highly recommend it!
This was a great book that followed the lives of two families during world war 2. I found it very fascinating. The end was slightly confusing about three quarters of the way in it jumped around about but then found its way back. Highly recommended.
This was an interesting book from the point of view of the German occupation of France and from the point of view of a young German soldier. I thought it lagged a bit toward the end, but am glad I read it.  It was good, but not great in my opinion.
The language is beautiful and fresh. The characters are remarkable and pull you deep inside and make you think and feel and understand. And with WWII as the canvass, the story unfolds like a volcano. Torpid and benign until Western Europe explodes.
well written with very interesting characters as well as interesting historic settings in Germany and France. The author develops each character in an interesting way though intertwined relationships between distant strangers from different worlds.
Absolutely wonderful until the end. I feel like I must have missed something, because I don't really understand what happened to the diamond. Definitely worth a read as the first 9/10ths are so good. Maybe you will enjoy the ending more than I did.
I can't say enough about this book. I loved it so much; it was one of those books that you would go to sleep thinking about and wake up ready to read more. I was sad to see it end. I won't give any of the story away because you must read this book.
I liked the strength of the father and his guidance and deep devotion and love he unconditionally displayed for his blind daughter.  The story was heart wrenching as many war stories tend to be due to the suffering and helplessness of the victims .
Wonderfully thought provoking!!!
It's a good book but a bit slow.
Great story but very depressing.
Absolutely incredible book. Although the book jumps through the years and in different countries from chapter to chapter, the total story is wrapped up well at the end. The characters are very deep and well developed. I highly recommend this book.
This was one of the most beautifully written and crafted books that I've read in some time. I will probably reread it sometime soon because it is the kind of book you want to come back to. And I think it is likely to become something of a classic.
Beautifully written. Characters come to life as does the chaotic world during WWII. Deft handling of people on both sides of the conflict. Most impressive is the author's skill at weaving symbolism through out the story. Definitely a masterpiece.
This book is devastatingly beautiful and sad. One of the best WWII novels you could ever read. The characters will live with me forever. As the movie "Inside Out" made clear, being sad is a necessary emotion if you want to change and grow.
Very good giving a detailed and more personal sense of what it must have been like to live thru WW2 as a teen. I wonder how much of that was researched versus the author's imagination. I found the end a bit less satisfying but certainly realistic.
One of the best books I have ever read. It is like you are inside the book and the minds of the characters. You are seeing all they can not. Very hard to put down. Not just another book about war. Much more about life and what makes it worthwhile.
From the first page, I found this a beautifully written tale full of intricacies and the drama of two children who come of age on different sides of the same war, of a father's love, and uncertain magic of an ancient relic. I couldn't put it down.
This book transports you into both the inner and outer worlds of it's disarmingly, flawed characters. Jumping through time and space with clarity and grace, it's impossible not to be drawn in. You fall in love with them as well as feel their pain.
This is a well written story about two very interesting children.  Very impressed with Werner's easy knowledge with radios and the blind girl's ability to cope with her blindness.  Was hoping for a better ending but the war did not allow for that.
I really enjoyed this book. It gives a glimpse of the hardships the French faced during the German occupation. I liked the main characters and the challenges they each faced. I was a little disappointed  with the ending, especially Werner's death.
A beautifully written story. As Doerr writes of Jules Verne: "Verne writes, like a sailmaker's needle through cloth (p. 445)." Were I to be as skilled with words as Doerr, I would have said the same of his written art. This is a must read!
This book is one of the finest novels I have read in a long time. I was unhappy to reach the last page. THIS book should be considered for a Pulitzer Prize. I VERY HIGHLY recommend it to everyone and have lent my copy to friends to read and enjoy.
This title came highly recommended, but did not quite deliver on its 5-star potential.  The back and forth movement in time was confusing and the relationship of the two main characters fell short of a satisfactory conclusion.  Good but not great.
This was a great book. It started off slowly, but stay with it. The author develops the characters so that you really care about them, and you will be moved by their bravery. There are many unexpected twists in the story, including a great ending.
Loved this story.  It was a great read and I really enjoyed it.  Loved reading a novel that had different perspectives in it (since it was told from the viewpoint of a young German boy and a French girl).  Powerful storytelling and very good read.
Beautifully written. Chapters jump back and forth between the experience of the two protagonists who live in entirely different worlds but within the same larger world of World War II. This book deserves the high praise it's received from critics.
Wonderfully written.  Hard to put down.  Easy to read, quick chapters which allowed me to put the book down when I absolutely had to.  Not surprised that it is on the best seller list.  I got into the book immediately, no slow start to this story.
A brilliant and moving book. Written with grace and power. Demonstrates the commonalities that cut across cultural and political boundaries. Avoids demonizing without softening the evils of war and ideology as they drag innocents into their sphere
I wanted this book to go on forever.....loved the characters and their stories. When I read a book this good, I am torn between continuing to read it because it's so good..... But in doing so, the end of the book happens. I did not want it to end!
The characters are clearly conceived, and deeply felt. Tragic and beautiful, I saw  pictures in the writing that I will never forget. Made me understand the losses of war in a more profound way. An excellent story, and compelling historical drama.
What a different story! I read a lot of books and this one was somehow very different. The characters were very well developed -- I felt I almost knew them. There were too many loose ends for me to give it five stars but, still, an excellent book.
This is a fantastic book. I can't imagine the amount of research the author did to be able to write so capably about France and Germany during the 1930s and 40s, about science, about minerals, about being blind. This book would make a great movie.
My heart is torn over this book. There were enough parts that were interesting and beautiful enough to keep me going (very long and sometimes drawn out). It jumps around chronologically but I found that to be a remedy for a long story and once I realized what was going on, I liked it. I would give this book 5 stars until the ending. AWFUL!<br/><br/>*Spoiler*<br/>As much as my inner immature romantic novel self hates it, I can respect an author who writes across the grains of predictable story telling: ones that don't dish you exactly what you want to happen.  However, unless it is a true story, I reserve the right to dislike a dissatisfying ending that seems to come about from writers block. It was flat, unresolved regarding the pivotal "sea of flames," and did not do two enormous characters justice in their deaths. I know that era was depressing, but my gosh, show some literary sensitivity for good hearted characters. Reward the reader for having hope and faith in the strength and perseverance of the main characters, don't just cut them down in a total of three sentences. I guess you could call it poetic justice and reality, but that still won't make you enjoy it. It became predictable in its despair. In its attempt to not be predictable. I don't regret reading it, but I'm angry for finishing it without a proper resolve for the sadness endured during it. Awaiting justice, and not even getting a creative explanation in its absence.
Everyone seems to love it, and so did I. I wish every time I read something like this that a happier conclusions might be found, and that the innocent survive, but it is a story of war, and the truth, happy conclusions are not always found there.
Such a turbulent period in history. Fiction that brings such personal, believable feeling to the day to day struggles of young people is truly amazing. Hardships and constant fear is described so realistically that the reader can picture vividly.
One of the most well-written books I have ever read. You will quickly find a character that you identify with and still appreciate all of the other characters, no matter how despicable some of them are. The imagery is pure magic. Well done Doerr.
Excellent read.  The story move between two main characters; a blind French girl and a German orphan boy, giving their perspectives of the war.  It was very well written and I became very involved with the characters.  It was hard to put it down.
Excellent book I would really recomend it..The writing was great I shall certainly read more of Anthony Doerr's work..I could not put this book down it really kept me up most of the night..I loved how he brought his charecters togeher at the end.
A wonderful book, wonderfully written so well so that you could actually 'see' what the little blind girl could 'see' through her enhanced senses.  The story is great....scary, but it depicts the times after the German invasion of France so well.
I loved the book but disliked the ending.  The story of these two young people caught in the events of WWII was very compelling.  I wish that the author would have given us more details about what happened to everyone once the war came to an end.
A well written book weaving the stories of many. I wanted all of the characters to survive. The incite into the lives of the Germans forced into war by the Nazi machine is important to experience. I was reminded of "Stones from the River". Enjoy!
One of the best books I've read in a while!! The style of writing is delicious,beautiful and to be savored! The story depicts innocence and love alongside the horrors of war.  Despite its topic, the book will charm you and leave you wanting more!
Wonderful book. The reader gets a sense of what was happening in Germany during WWII and the devasting effects of the war in Europe for all people. The writer spins a beautiful tale amid a very sad time in history. I strongly recommend this book.
"All The Light We Cannot See" is one of those rare books that captures both your heart and brain. It describes the lives and experiences of two gifted and sensitive individuals whose lives briefly intersect in Brittany at the end of WW11.
A Wonderful book....sad to reach the end. Learned a lot about St.Malo, and that area of France. But the real connection was with all the characters...just loved them and felt such a part of their lives....a beautiful read. I recommend it highly!!
A well written novel brining the reader into intimate contact with the main characters. You care about these people and feel the tragedy and brutality of war as it affects their lives. Even so it celebrates the human spirit and its possibilities.
This is a fantastic story about a young girl, a young boy and France and Germany in very troubled times. Actually the book begins in 1934 and ends in 2014 but most of it takes place in the 1940's during World War 2.  Anyone would enjoy this book.
This book caught me by surprise. A deceptively meandering tale that always, almost surprisingly, returns the reader back to the central theme of war and its effects on a diverse group of people. Beautifully written. Amazing character development.
The format was a little disconcerting at the beginning, but once I got used to it I was actually spellbound. The writing is profound and very poetic.<br/>I have recommended this book to many friends. It is definitely on my "Top 10" list.
A work that is at home among the finest literature in history.  This level of writing is not attributable to one man, but to generations of novelists, poets, philosophers and historians, as well as those who lived the experiences that are retold.
Beautiful story rich in content and character so much so that I felt as if I was by their side and living out the story with them.<br/>I was compelled to turn each page and did not want the story to end which to me is a sign of a terrific story.
I completely enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  It was occasionally a little confusing for me because the story telling moves back and forth in time.  Although fiction, I think from what I know of that time in France that it is plausible.
I really enjoyed this book.  I'm usually not a fan of fiction, but this novel was difficult to put down.<br/>I'm old enough to have some memories of the horrors of WWII, and learned more with the<br/>historical background covered by Mr. Doerr.
It's very well written and I like and don't like the story line. I like the way it weaves in and out but it's slightly depressing, I am not a fan of wartimes ESPECIALLY actual ones. I've only read half way so we'll see what I feel at the ending.
In spite of the sometimes dreadful setting and period of time, this is one tale I couldn't put down. Mr Doerr's prose are engaging and eye opening -- no pun intended. I was thoroughly engulfed by the imagery. A great book...award winning indeed.
I read a bit and then got uninterested and am currently reading the six wives of Henry VII. I seem to get interested in certain era's and when I am interested in them I cannot get into another era. but when i do i will try to pick this up again.
A different "take' on WWII as seen through the "eyes" of a blind French girl under the Vichy government and a young genius German soldier.  Gives a new personal perspective on a devastating time in Europe.  Well written and engaging.
So beautifully written...provided so many beautiful word descriptions to create mental pictures of the horror, the moments of beauty, emotions and the manner in which you could fathom what she was seeing without sight.  Best I have read in ages!
outstanding tale of two young people, boy and girl and how their lives are affected by WWII.  they come together briefly and then separate but not without touching one another's lives.  very appealing characters during a difficult historic time.
Previously I had read only Doerr's short stories. "Light" shows his talent at telling a sustained story over several years, and his characters are the light--luminous personalities drawn during the worst of times.  Lovely and enthralling
Such a worthy read. The story line is alternating the different characters which makes the reader part of the total scene. How two children can be involved in the German occupation and their very personal view on the world as they experience it.
I found it is hard to read another WWII novel, but this was very different.  I loved the characters, the  interesting connections throughout the whole story.  The ending is sad but the author made that acceptable  with all the ending connections
My favorite book for a long time.  With really two plots playing simultaneously it's two protagonists are both endearing and complicated at the same time.  When the two plots meld into one the book becomes all consuming. What a brilliant author.
A beautifully written novel . My heart broke for all the innocent people who lived during that time It reinforced my belief that there is a commonality among all people no matter where they are from. Goodness and evil can be intimately entwined.
Loved the imagery the author created with words. Recommend this to anyone who likes to read about WWII. Not everyone you meet is what they seem. Thought it would be a little more of a typical love story but it surprise lay better. Love this. :-)
I can't say enough good things about this beautifully written story.  The interchanging stories are so interesting and intertwining that you can't stop reading because you want to see what happens. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
It is the story of a young blind girl and a youth who is very talented with electronics and their meeting during WWII. We learn about underground mines, shells and other marine life, learning your way when blind and learning to live in darkness.
Good historical fiction from the eyes of a  German child! He grew into a man too fast and became a fatality of the war. Then in France  the reader follows the war from the other side through  a blind girl's perceptions and suffering. Great read!
A gentle narrative of the beauty and ugliness of human nature. In which the moral judgements of right or wrong are not as important as to feel hat even when faced with the most searing pain there is a reservoir to build meaning out of existence.
Really enjoyed the story and the descriptive writing. Having been in San Malo I could actually see it again through the author's eyes.  I would have liked the chapters to be a bit longer, however, as it skipped back & forth just a bit too much.
Well deserving of its awards.  The theme of innocence and purity against the bleak backdrop of war and death is superbly displayed.  Doerr's prose is almost poetic at times. Very moving, very satisfying, a book I'll think about for a long time.
Writing lyrically about horror and human greatness in response, about ordinary people coping with extraordinary courage, about how even those recruited to execute inhumanity don't have to lose their own, this writer truly gifts us with his art.
This was a most interesting book, I hated that it ended but like all books it must.  The author does a wonderful job painting the story with almost musical scenes.  I have been to San Malo but must now return to see if I can experience it anew.
I think this book is way overrated and doesn't live up to all the hype surrounding it. The story tends to drag and although the last part of the book was considerably more entertaining than the rest of it, I still don't think it was that great.
A little tough trying to get the connection between Marie and Werner, but once arriving at that portion of the book, it is delightful.  The book is exquisitely written and the lives of the victimized French and German people is heart wrenching.
Soul searching!<br/>I loved this book.  It had an interesting perspective that the young German youth were conditional to not feel emotions, but they could not obliterate the inherent goodness in some and those who marched a different drummer.
Beautiful, beautifully written novel following the lives of a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy  lead-up  period to and during World War II.  They meet just for a brief time, but their stories interact and entwine in compelling ways.
This is one of those books that while I am reading it, I am kind of amazed how people can create the story and characters and write in very granular detail. Really great book and an education is how tough humans can be during challenging times.
I had a terrible time figuring things out in the beginning. I struggled through this book because it was so highly rated. I was finally hooked near the last third of the book.  Still wish I had abandoned it, but I have trouble abandoning books.
Could not put this one down. I was completely engrossed in Marie Clare's story from the get go. I wanted so much for Werner's story to end differently but it was what it needed to be.  Beautiful yet heartbreaking, this book does not disappoint.
Great book. Recommended by so many I finally HAD to read it, and am so glad I did! The story lines were woven well and the characters were well drawn. I wondered how the author would wind them all together and he did so very well. A great read.
It's hard to write an in-depth review without spoiling it.  The best I can say is that elements of the story remind me of Cold Mountain and this is the best novel I've read since.  Hard to put down and the best fiction I've read in a long time.
I enjoyed the development of the two main characters in the book---A.blind French girl and an orphaned German boy are caught up in the horrors of World War II. Their lives, although very different , briefly coincide with life changing outcomes.
The timeline was a little confusing at first, but when I remembered to look at the chapter titles, it was no longer distracting. Very well written and an unusual story. Descriptions were clear and enhanced the book. Great characters!  Loved it.
Amazing writing.  Two stories representing WWII in France told from unique perspectives.  Each story was compelling, and deftly told.  The reader is taken back and forth between the two, plus a few minor story lines, using very short chapters.
The plight of Everyman to live the life presented ,even under the most discouraging circumstances, are beautifully embodied in the multidimensional characters of this powerful book. They plod. They live. They carry the glimmer of hope for all.
This was a very well written intense novel that followed the lives of two young people during the 2nd World War.  It chronicles their separate journeys--one a young German soldier and a young blind French girl.  Their journeys are complicated.
Fantastic book. This book is so beautifully written, characters so well developed, it is a joy to read. This is a must read book. You will not be wasting a moment of your time reading this book, it will stay with you for a long time afterward.
This was a wonderful read. The author does a great job of leading us to see through the senses of the character in a way that can't be limited to eyesight. It doesn't end the way you want it to, but somehow that's ok. Really enjoyed this book.
One of the best books I've read this year.  Beautifully told story with some uncomfortable content that we'd often prefer to forget, but even the pain and insanity of war is presented with such great prose and deep humanity.  Highly recommend.
Anthony Doerr recounts the horror of World War II through the eyes of a French girl and German boy.  I was sorry to reach the end.  Doerr reveals the unbelievable cruelty in the world while, at the same time, showing unbounding love and grace.
I'm not normally one for WWII books, but this blew me away. I loved the characters and felt like they were incredibly in depth. The overarching message of technology connecting us across borders and ideologies was fantastically relevant today.
Very engaging characters which humanized participants on both Germans and French in WWII. Learned much from the physics of radio waves and the biology of sea creatures. A little confusing jumping back and forth from time frames and characters.
A beautiful book.  Well written.  Haunting - I keep thinking about it after finishing the book.  Great character building and thoughtful writing.  Historically accurate as well.  Gives a different angle on a story we know but can never forget.
Had to get past the first few chapters and then really loved the book.  It gets a bit confusing towards the end when the author jumps around in time a bit too much.  Disappointed with the ending. But absolutely loved the story as it developed.
What a wonderful story.  A new perspective to WW2 that made me ponder the war through the eyes of children.  A few times I got a little confused when the author jumped forward and backwards in time.  But the story is definitely worth reading!!
Excellent read on ww II and it's effects on people who lived these years in Germany and France, especially the children who grew up during these times.  Beautifully written that gives readers insight into how each atrocity affects all of life.
I thought this book was confusing as it jumped from one main character who was German and a blind French girl. The author was knowledgeable about World War II and it gave the reader a look at ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. BAM
This is an amazing novel. Once I started reading I could not stop.  It is beautifully written. I felt I was there sharing  what was happening. The characters are so well drawn and landscape descriptions  so vivid. I highly recommend this book.
Fascinating story that alternates between the voices of Marie Laure and Werner, both of whom are deeply interesting characters. Though the two do not actually intersect until late in the story, their individual struggles are beautifully told.
I liked the way the characters intermingled.<br/>The two main people finally come together in an amazing way.  I was sitting on pins and needles during much of the story.<br/>And each character I met was given a peaceful end.  I liked this.
I'm not sure what I was expecting when I first began this book, but as the story progressed, I of course knew what I expected, or even more so wanted to happen. None of which did. I would recommend this book simply because it is a good story.
This was an amazing story. Historically accurate. It was interesting to get the perspective from the French and the German experiences. Everyday people, with all their gifts and flaws are thrown in to unthinkable situations. A wonderful read!
This book gives one a totally new outlook , not only of the second world war. but of what war is when it happens in YOUR world. Sad but wonderful read.  Leaves so much to think about at a time of so much trouble in various parts of the world.
Our book club read it mostly becase it was written by a local author and loved it because it was well written and about subjects that we all need to understand more about - blindness, determination, devotion and the devastation caused by war.
Somehow Anthony Doerr weaves a story capturing the entirety of human emotions - from the ugliest to the most sublime - as they are magnified in war while never losing the hope and honor and beauty of the characters.  I will miss these people.
Gripping tale of wartime in France and Germany from prospective of 2 young people caught up in war. With the terrible deprivation and horror. A spell-binding story of survival and hope.  Story jumps back and forth in time.  Still a must read.
Just returned from Paris and Normandy. This book is yet another reminder of what no human should ever forget. The human race is capable of such torment, savagery, love and peace all at once. What Must each of us do so that love and peace win?
This is not just another novel about Europe during WWII, it's a beautiful, powerful and insightful journey into the lives of two young people as they try to make sense of the world around them even as it's falling apart. Wonderful and moving.
I had heard so much about this book, all of it good, but still I was afraid it would be too dark.i thought the writing was exquisite, the characters well drawn, and the observations of humanness just perfect. The best book I've read all year.
This is one of those books that stays in your mind long after the final chapter. A timeless, well-researched tale of the effects of the horrors of War on citizens and soldiers on both sizes of conflict with many parallels in the 21st century.
Fantastic remarkable book!  I loved it! This is a must read --- I was enthralled by this book from beginning to end. There are passages in this book that I think I will remember forever!  Hope it will be made into a movie --- it is that good.
I started a book club and this was the first book the group chose to read. I am on page 121 and have no interest in the characters. At all. It has been a struggle and as a once avid reader I puzzled out why. Firstly, the chapters are so short it is hard for me to get to know the characters. Character development is my thing - I love it. It was difficult to get involved with anyone in the book because we jumped to another so soon. Secondly, the plot was slow. There was very little movement until page 78 or so. But, in all fairness, I am an action/drama/suspense kind of girl. The descriptions of things were tedious and tiresome. I was not driven to turn the page to find out what happened next.<br/><br/>I'm glad so many people find the book lovely, but for me, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
I love World War II books.  This one had some interesting characters.  I did not think some were so fully developed.  A lot of detail on certain points.  I wanted the one character to survive the War.  A good book and worth the time to read.
What a captivating and beautifully written book. I was hesitant to begin it as it involved WWII and a handicapped child (typical crowd pleasing topics) but I finally succumbed and once I began I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend to all.
Great detailed descriptions and a complex story led me to hang on every word. So many tragic personal stories result from wars and this is certainly a shining example. Having visited the area myself, this story was particularly vivid for me.
Extraordinary book. Touching and moving. The two main characters are full of emotion, depth and an overwhelming sense painful reality. This book keeps moving and one cannot wait to get to the end but with a sorrow that endings always create.
Excellent writing. It was unique and interesting and at the same time very sad. The author makes you feel like you are living in the story but the ending makes you feel like your heart was broken in a million pieces. Definitely worth reading
had to make sure i had plenty of time and nothing else to do when i wanted to read this book...i could not put it down after i picked it up.  Very impelling read and some historic war time information as well.  would recommend it to frineds.
A wonderful narrative with a lovely story, very strong characters. I enjoyed it since the beginning. I am considering going to some of the chapters once again, it will be worth. I have recommended, and even made a present of it to my family.
This is another beautifully written historical novel about World War II that can enlighten the reader about what it must have been like during the occupation of France.  It is one that will be in your thoughts long after you finish the book.
Of a time of madness in the world where countless unrecorded acts of bravery and kindness would have happened, a time that should never be repeated. There is so much light to see if we choose to look and listen.<br/>Thank you Anthony Doerr.
Great book. Had me laughing and crying all within a few chapters at a time. Very honest story and the visual imagery that doerr is able to create with his writing is truly amazing. Best book I've read this year and I read lots of good books.
I've read a lot about WWII but still gleaned some very interesting insights from this book. It is so beautifully written, and the technique of alternating the stories of the three major characters maintained suspense. I couldn't put it down.
I love stories with layers and depth of meaning and this book has it in spades.  It pulls you in from the beginning and beguiles you through to the end.  Shades of The Book Thief and Suite Francaise filter through.  I really remarkable story
Amazing stories thru the hard times of war.<br/>And a blind little girl in the middle of it<br/>And a fairy tale about a diamond along with thousands of killings.<br/>And the writing flows so fast and easy like  a heart beat.<br/>Amazing
One of the most beautifully written books I have ever read! This haunting story of two young people caught up in World War II France and Germany is a must read for all. I literally could not put this book down. It is no wonder it won awards!
This is a fantastic book that I enjoyed immensely. The author is one of the finest writers that I have ever read. You can think for hours about sentences that he has written in the book and wonder where in the world he found the imagination.
Every moment of this book was a treasure. So beautifully written, it was heartbreaking to end.  The perspectives of each of the characters lives during WWII was written to immerse the reader in their complicated, intertwined lived. Loved it!
This novel was a more difficult read with characters and story lines switching each chapter.  You definitely have to read a few chapters at a time to follow.  Good story but disappointing end.  Kind of a downer feeling book but entertaining.
Good novel...great lead up to end...good Surprising ending, but not satisfying (just because i wished it could have been different for the characters, not because it wasnt worth the read). It's definitely worth the time!! A great experience!
A very good book that held my attention to the very end.  By following the stories of the blind girl and the young Nazi soldier, you got a new perspective  on how the Second World War impacted lives.  I will be reading more from this author.
Beautiful novel. I was totally engrossed in both characters' stories and loved the writing, the historical backdrop and the literary devices throughout. I just absolutely loved this book. It has been years since I fell this hard for a novel.
Fantastic book. Let's see what the film will be like. I've seen the other reviews about Doer's previous works and they seem not to be great reviews tho' there are some good ones. Let's see if Doer can produce great works again like this one.
I really enjoyed the book once I got used to going back and forth between main characters.  It was so descriptive and well written.  I was a little confused about how it ended, but maybe the author was leaving it up to our own imaginations.
Beautiful story telling. Well developed characters.<br/>Dives into a time in history that is deeply complex<br/>and interesting but also very dark and disturbing.<br/>If you are looking for something inspirational, this<br/>is not it...
Very well written book.  The story telling in regards to WWII was just astoundingly interesting in regards to how a dictator treated his own people, and how the general population obviously (silent middle class) did nothing but stay silent.
The best book I have read in a very long time. It left me speechless.  The characters are so alive as one reads that they linger long after the book is finished.  Such an vivid view of life in Europe, especially France, during World War II.
I love historical fiction.  It brings great insight as to what could have  happened at that time.  Telling this story from two opposites made it most fascinating.  I will recommend reading this book when I present at my Book Club next week.
Not just another World War 2 novel but a journey into historical context thru the experiences, fears, feelings, doubts of a young German and  French blind girl whose lives merge and separate. The story is touching and beautifully written.
Excellent - one of the best books I have read with World War II as background.  The war is not the main theme of this book. The story is about a blind French girl and a German orphan boy and the war is the catalist that effects their lives.
Beautifully written. Characters, very real.  Descriptions, unique.  Didn't think I could read one more book about World War 2, but this book was so moving, engaging, so personalized that I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to be over.
Brilliantly told story that is poignant, historically accurate and fast paced. I love any and all World War II stories and this is right up there with The Nightingale. This is a worthwhile read you won't want to see end. I loved every word.
The writer developed a plot that was unusual and interesting.  I thought it was a very well developed story.  I appreciated the fact that he ended the book with closure of the main characters.  I didn't have to wonder what happened to them.
Many surprises; the characters had determination; one was so thoughtful after the fact about signing up for what he did.  I really didn't know what the book was about before I read it; it was interesting and amazing.  I highly recommend it.
This is a well written, well developed novel.  It incorporates all the suspense of a mystery, the intrigue of a war story, the sensitivity of a love story, and the factual details of historical fiction.  I would highly recommend this novel.
An excellent book.  It is a beautiful,  well written story. Particularly effective was how Doerr alternated by chapter the stories of the two main characters.  The story poignantly speaks to the horrors of war and how it effects all people.
Loved this book!  The development of the two main characters and the journey that we are taken on towards the German occupation of France during WW II is extremely well portrayed. Highly recommend this book for lovers of historical fiction.
I thought this books layout was too contrived and artificial.  The alternating chapters between the main characters was formulaic and unnecessary.  The addition of the timeline jumping around made the story It made confusing and disjointed.
it took me a bit to get into this book, but once the foundation was laid out I found it to be a very good read.  I did not find it to be a book I just couldn't put down, but a facinating perspective on so many beyond horrific circumstances.
Very interesting reading, it is a story of horrible effect the war had on humanity.Werner is a young German boy with a very good heart but he had to fight as German .The parallel story is about blind French girl ,she is exceptionally brave.
The word "perfect" comes to mind. A story so beautiful and alive that it will enter a dimension of your psyche and remain there. You seem to know the characters as aspects of yourself and people you have known. It is all magically familiar.
This is a fabulous book. It was my first Doerr read and now I am reading another. Doerr has a writing style that effectively develops the characters and the plot; as well as making the reader think about life in general. I highly recommend.
As brilliant and poignant as The Book Thief. Quietly and yet powerfully layers subtle<br/>character insights and maturing into an explosion of the realization of the enigma of<br/>being a human being. Truly wonderful. Thank you Mr. Doerr.
I wanted to say I love this book, but I found it difficult to follow. It took quite a while to find out how these two character find one another. I love to read and was sad that I did not love it. It was a read...but there are better books.
This was a beautiful story, almost mystical in its approach to the WW II experiences of its two protagonists. I finished the book with a deeper appreciation of ALL that life has to offer us during these brief journeys we imagine as our own.
Excellent. Couldn't put it down
Wonderful story.mjust wonderful
Like reading a remarkable poem.
Beautifully written.  Deeply moving to anyone who has ever experienced someone's memory of WWII.  God bless all of those who lived and died during that time including my father and all four of his brothers, one of whom is buried in France.
My first Kindle read, so I was on a learning curve!  A decent read with a slightly different slant for a wartime book.  Found the end rather "unconnected/rushed" - wondered if the author was "stuck" for a way to wrap it up.
This is the first account of WWII that has ever expressed to me how normal good people can get sucked into doing evil. It is beautifully written, and all the characters sucked me in from beginning to end. I had a hard time putting it down.
Another great story about people who were caught up in all the turmoil of World War II.  It's hard to imagine that people actually survived all the hardships they had to endure during the war.  This book definitely captivated my attention.
This is a compelling read.  I highly recommend this book though be warned, you may find it difficult to set down.  I sure did.  From my glowing reviews while reading, my wife began reading it and is having similar (enjoyable) difficulties.
Interesting study of World War II from the perspective of two youths entrapped in their difficult physical, emotional & environmental conditions. How they had the stamina to face & survive the challenges they faced was awe inspiring to me.
The book kept me up at nights, because I would want to read just one more page. It's beautifully written, and I love the way she interweaves the lives of the two main characters. As with any book about war, prepare for triumph and tragedy.
The author kept my interest with mystery and suspense continuously throughout the book.  Having been in a war<br/>myself the book stirs many emotions as I relate and reflect<br/>my own experiences.  Very insightful and thought provoking.
One of the finest books I've ever read.  I grew up in England in WW2, and I'll never be able to forget those days.  How beautiful the writing is.  And the plot.  And the wonderful characters.  I could wish it never to end.  What an author!
A reminder that for each death in that war there was an intricate life and a soul to be missed.  The struggle to exist as the world slowly subsides into madness.  Bravery cowardice, fear are all woven together to make the story come alive.
I wish I loved it. But I just thought it was so boring and you kept waiting for something to happen and it just never did.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the ending. The last quarter of the book was the best part. But it took forever to get there.
Great novel which made me excited about life.  Within the main story you had so many conflicts going on, and the ending was just beautifully done.<br/><br/>"open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever"
You won't be able to put the book down once you begin. It is a thrilling tale about both the French and German sides during WWII and what it was like to be a teenager during that time. It is captivating and a wonderful story worth reading.
This is an entertaining read and touches on some very serious subjects but I would not call it a realistic story.  It did show some teachings of the Hitler era but just enough to move the story along.  I would recommend it and a good read.
Anyone who was not yet born during World War Two needs to read this.  It gives you a moment to moment experience of occupied France and the Nazi armies.  The author weaves together plot, sub plot and character development.  Just wonderful.
I understand the movie rights for this book have been picked up by a major studio. I pray the screenwriters and director do it justice, because it is a marvelous story.  The author is a master of description and kept me riveted throughout.
Exquisitely written. I didn't want to put it down, but I didn't want it to end either.The final few chapters seemed almost a bit rushed compared to the earlier chapters in which the characters and story line were so thoughtfully developed.
An interesting point of view for this WWII story. The writing is beautiful and the author has woven many themes throughout. The symbolism is occasionally heavy-handed, but the book lends itself to discussion. It's literature at its finest.
LAyered, complex characters draw you slowly into the torments of an area of destruction. HAs a credible, sophisticated resolution of a tangled story line. Slow start but then I could not put it down. Good read triggering a lot of thoughts.
I did not know what to expect when I bought the book,  but once I started I had to keep turning pages. A refreshing and different perspective on the Second World War. Absolutely disturbingly times, but you really care about the characters.
A poignant, richly-detailed realistic story told in language so beautiful and poetic that it is lifted into something magical and mythic.  This book is like a delicious and nourishing meal; I enjoyed reading it slowly to savor every line.
Fabulous book about "little" people suffering during war.  Very well written & totally believable. Man's inhumanity against his fellow man is insane.  And it's so graphically depicted in this beautiful story of the good in people.
This book is stunning - the characters and the story line are beautifully written, the details tangible and the events paced perfectly. Heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time Could not put this book down. Absolutely a MUST READ!!
Overall I liked the novel and happy Mr Doerr did not end it with a clichéd conclusion.  Ordinary Germans did suffer during both wars as well and we tend to forget that fact.  I liked  the contrast between 1940s technology and present day!
I was completely engrossed, engaged , moved by this book. It was an unexpected reaction and I was especially moved by someone of the particular encounters and the beauty of the writing. I eagerly look forward to reading his earlier books!
Well worth reading, not a typical WWII novel, the details are exquisite, it all feels real. And while there are certainly bad guys, they are still characters with depth.  It is a relief to read a book that has characters that we can like.
This is a well written book but its subject and the way it is depicted is depressing and dark. The subject is a terrifying one but it is too sad and pessimistic.Its characters are very real and believable. This is a stark realistic novel.
A good story, well told. Excellent intertwined plot development among the several  characters which creates not only a good narrative, but maintains an interesting level of suspense as events and characters converge. In short, a fun read.
Descriptive writing that can transport you to what the character is seeing, feeling or going through.  Excellenta plot development and development of all the characters.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to everyone.
Heralded as the best book of 2014, I was sadly disappointed. The book was well written and the two protagonists were engaging but I felt the story dragged. I have spoken to others who loved this book. Perhaps my expectations were too high
There is only one complaint I have with this novel. It ended. Having read many novels about WWII recently, I wasn't sure I wanted to tackle another. The characters, the descriptive language & the story line were captivating. Don't miss it
This is the single most unique love story I have ever had the pleasure to read. The beginning is so entirely enthralling. I was captured from the opening. It didn't disappoint in the middle either and the ending was refreshingly original.
The book is well written and keeps you wanting to finish it. The problem I have with it, is how he neatly wrapped everything up in the end of the book. It's like he got tired of writing it and wanted to be done. That was a disappointment!
This book gave me some insight of a different culture and different history that is not heard often. I will read this again and I recommend this book to people who like reading about history. It was a good read with an even better ending.
Excellent book for those who love historical fiction.  So beautifully written with memorable characters and elements of feeling throughout.  The WWII background sets the stage for impending doom and hope from despair.  Highly recommended!
Very interesting way of developing the serveral main chacters in the book, I wasn't sure when I would like it when I started reading, but the more I got into the book the more interested I became in the various stories of the characters.
A really compelling and thoughtful read, providing a different perspective on a time period that many people know. I enjoyed the sort of fantastic realism that the author provided, that it was just open-ended enough to leave some wonder.
I loved this book, I've never read a book this big in less than a week. It really captivated my thoughts, I was not able to start another book for 2 or 3 weeks due to this story running through my mind. It's a great read, I recommend it.
Over all, a bit on the long side for me, but thoroughly researched and thoughtfully written. I read it as a task for my Book Club, not sure I'd have chosen it from a book store without that necessity, as it's definitely not a happy read.
I loved the story.  It had all the things in it that make a great read to me.  History, solution, and love.  Wars are so sad and terrible for all the people on both sides. These young people were so caught up in it's path of destruction.
I was not expecting such a heart wrenching tale of a time and war that many are now outliving and are soon forgetting. Thank you for allowing me to see a glimpse of the harrows of this war. Harrows that can be turned to Grace if allowed.
This is a well crafted novel which has a steady and easily approached path.  While the story ends as one would expect there are many turns along the way and a steady revealing story line which brings distant events together into a whole.
I loved the way this book was written. The words conjured up beautiful pictures in my head as I read. Marie-Laure's story was so heart warming. The writing even made you sympathetic to the "bad" guys!  I would highly recommend this book.
A historical masterpiece about a time in WW2 I had never read before. Lots of descriptive writing but not boring I felt I was there.<br/>Great character development. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about the war.
I wasn't ready for the story to be over.  Well written weaving of multiple realistic characters.  Outside of the central theme, a layer of thought provoking questions of the idea of fault during war when individual will is not an option.
Loved this book . Gives an entirely new view to the World War II events in France . You see the events through different characters eyes and gain new insights into how a blind person responds to their world . The ending is a bit abrupt .
Love this book. Every Enlightening of WWII and a good story.  Hard to put down and the chapters are very short, so it is a fast read.  They should have discussed the Jews more and not just the prisoners on trains passing. Almost 5 stars.
A must read. Great story and the characters are so believable. The human emotions and the sadness are something that is inevitable during war time, but I found myself totally rooting for the main characters on both sides, it's that good.
Even though the story of Werner & Marie-Laure was fiction, it seemed believable because it made me feel their pain. Anyone who lived through WW2 suffered greatly. The story was very well written & kept my interest all the way to the end.
Although a novel, the story is one not to be forgotten. Author brings the people in the story to life and the times to a memorable and unforgettable conclusion. Should be required reading for all who think war is the answer to a problem.
This book is about two young people on opposites sides of World War II that come together and give each other some happiness during an awful time in history. It amazes me how they both endured things that would scare anyone young or old.
Loved "All the Light We Cannot See" but had to return my original purchase as it was missing 30 pages at a critical point towards the end.  Pages from an earlier chapter was repeated.  Finished reading when I received a new copy.
One of the best books I have read this year.  Always great to read a well written book.  Loved Doerr's ability to describe things so well.  That was one of the appeals of the book for me.  I could visualize everything as if I were BLIND.
This book starts off sort of slowly but once it gets going, you won't be able to put it down. It is written beautifully, and it is a very unique and touching perspective from WWII. Another great historical fiction from this time period.
I expected more interaction with the two main characters during the entire book.  I was disappointed after reading an ongoing back and forth during the lives of Werner and Marie-Laire that there was not more written about them together.
This is one of the finest books I have ever read. The author's superb use of language to describe sensory details throughout completely draws the reader into this meaningful story. This book is so much more than a WWII historical novel.
The characters come to life on these pages. The perspectives of Werner and Marie-Laure and others are so human and give you the slightest sense of what it might have actually been like for some on either side of the war. Haunting story.
This book is the perfect combination of fascinating characters, compelling story and gorgeous prose.  I usually skim through overly descriptive paragraphs but this writing was so visceral, i enjoyed every work.  Thank you, Anthony Doerr
Beautifully written, poignant story set in France during World War 11 which centers on two characters, a blind young French girl, and a young, German genius, and how their paths cross.  I can see this being made into an excellent movie.
The inner perspective of the characters interwine with historical events provides both a learning and entertaining read.  The style of brief chapters of each character held your attention to want to urge you further to see what unfolds.
We had our book club today and all liked the book!<br/>Very good writing, we all had different thoughts & "likes"!!!!<br/>We have a diverse group of gals , different generations, All learned something from book & discussions!!
Book was instantly riveting. The characters were so vivd.  The interconnection of their lives, dreams and deaths was masterfully executed by the author.  History brought to life. Life that was both beautiful and horrific. Definite read!
Absolutely wonderful! A different style with the back and forth chapters but pretty easy to follow.  Great characters and beautiful descriptions of those areas during the war. I felt I learned a lot more about the war. Beautiful ending.
The author gave life to human emotions with superb clarity. His phrases whether they describe mollusks, birds or survival illustrated the great difference between emotional blindness and void and inner spirit that conquers the darkness.
The content was an interesting way to portray the Nazi occupation. The switching of characters stories became tedious after awhile. And the ending was anticlimactic and somewhat predictable. But still don't know what happened the stone.
A fabulous story of courageous French villagers as they cope with the evils of war in their own inimitable French fashion.  A stunning cast of quirky characters paint a deep , rich portrait of German occupation.  I couldn't put it down.
Worthy of all the great reviews I read before reading.  Truly one of the best books I have read this year.  Excellent plot, well written, fascinating characters, and some plots twists that caused me to go back and find more information.
What I most enjoyed about this book is the way it illustrates how our lives are interconnected with the universe and each other.  Even the most innocent of actions can have a ripple affect that is never known to the one who first acted.
I very much enjoy books of this era. Even though a work of fiction, I felt the author knew the characters personally and profoundly. The beauty of his words and the pain of the time will haunt me for a long while. Please read this book.
In the beginning it can be difficult to follow the changing perspectives and timelines but this story will both break your heart and give you hope. A hope that the human race can perhaps endure all the suffering it inflicts upon itself.
Emotionally wrenching and deeply moving, somewhat confusing organization of time sequences however. I do realize this is part of the writing technique of the book. The ending was abrupt and truncated and therefor rather unsatisfactory.
I was drawn to the primary characters and the compelling circumstances that bring them together.  The rich characterization is well developed, the story is deeply engrossing, and the intertwining of history and fiction works very well.
Beautiful writing. Great weave of interconnecting stories slowly, inextricably moving closer together. Political without being heavy-handed. A little slow at times and certain story lines feel unresolved. But all and all, a great read!
This is a very personal look at World War II from several people's perspective. It it a tender treatment of the interplay of lives and how seemingly random occurrences may not be random at all! Beautiful novel which I highly recommend.
I normally read legal thrillers. So this book is definitely outside of my usual. However, it kept and held my interest.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, even picking it up in the middle of the night... Yes,  it's that good.  :)
I don't read much fiction but this is historical fiction which was a real eye opener about WWII.  This book sucked me in right away and I didn't want it to end but it did finish up with a good conclusion.  I highly recommend this book.
Beautifully interwoven story of an unlikely couple in WWII who meet near the end of the book. The language is lush and descriptive and the story's short chapters and changing points of view kept me intrigued. I definitely recommend it!
I enjoyed the story line, characters and sequence of the book. At times the descriptions of scenery was more than I prefer, but the author's ability to describe the events and characters enhanced the story and connected me to the text.
This is a wonderfully written book.The setting is Europe during World War<br/><br/>11..<br/>during  World War II.......the setting is Europe/ Many different characters and a "back and forth" method of the activities of each.
I loved this book!  It is a well written depiction of the war through the eyes of two children; a brilliant German boy and a blind Parisian girl.<br/>I don't want to say too much and give away the plot, but I urge everyone to read it.
What a marvelous book...I couldn't put this book down. I love the way the author developed the characters. The story keeps you waiting to see what will happen next. If you like historical fiction and enjoy WWII, this is a read for you.
Loved the way the author developed the plot and characters one chapter at a time.  Amazing story about love, courage, good, evil, survival and the human condition in the face of adversity.  This one is worthy of adding to your library.
This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read. The writing evokes every person and place crisply, clearly, so it comes to life in my head as I read. A beautiful book about connecting to each other, about pain, wonder, healing.
I know it's a popular book, but I just can't get into the characters. Too much explanation about the maps drawn by the girl's father. I keep waiting for something to happen. Maybe at some point I'll pick up the book again and finish it
This book was so incredible, heavy, heartfelt, deeply sad, beautiful, heartbreaking, riveting... I couldn't put it down. Its a really important work about love, perseverance and ww2.  You must read it.  Still recovering from it.  Sigh.
I have an affinity for the events that occurred during the evil Hitler regime - I do not know why -  but I love that this book gives a human side to some of the atrocious events. Well written & worth a second read to recapture moments.
This is going to be a lifetime favorite.  Physical challenges are just that--challenges.  When there is enough love in one person's heart to build ladders and bridges for the beloved, that soul can soar.  A page-turner of a great read!
Lovely book, which should be enjoyed more for the author's wonderfully-descriptive prose and exquisite character development than for the storyline's implausible plot or its historical perspective.  Just a heartwarming, uplifting read.
Engaging read, vivid imagery and moving story of the lasting impact of war.  Heartbreaking but hopeful.  Will need to re read to thoroughly enjoy the language as the story was so compelling I missed some of the impressive descriptions.
A very well written book.  I could see in my mind the trauma and fear that the characters experienced. An excellent book for  people that are not familiar with what happened to the French when the Germans invaded during the second war.
Slow moving, interesting story. You read quite a bit until you realize it is a story about the stone. Many lives involved but they never really meet. The characters are pulled together by the radio broadcast and the power of the stone.
A truly remarkable story.  The two main characters are unforgettable; so real and so beautifully developed.  The author really captures the cruelty and  amazing resilience of humans beings in a particularly devastating time in history.
Beautifully crafted story with interesting characters. Each of the key players has a weakness and from that grows great strength. Much of the plot is tragic, but there is such an underlying optimism that the reader is drawn to the end.
This is going on my top ten list of favorite reads. Beautifully written, insightfully descriptive of characters and times past. It was satisfying that the author took us all the way to near present times with characters.  A must read.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters are very well developed, the horrors of wartime Europe told grippingly without subjecting the ready to direct violence of the  war, and the writing is first rate.  i highly recommend it.
I enjoyed this historic story about the end of World War II, which describes the suffering, and insanity of that time in our world. The characters were well formed, and that made me care about what happened to them. An excellent read.
A WW II story in which the central characters, a blind French girl and a young Nazi soldier. had a fleeting relationship but a more significant connection that characterized the complexity of the impact war imposes on innocent people.
There is nothing much I can say to add to the wonderful reviews of this book.  It was excellent and I will definitely read it again.  Beautiful, spare prose, but with such detail.  Unsentimental in the telling and yet deeply touching.
The way the author describes everything is so vivid. Unusual story set in scary times. This story makes us think sometimes we are just born into situations and we just go with the flow because we are supposed to.  I really enjoyed it.
This was an incredibly well laid out story. The way these two stories intertwine and spiral into one another is remarkable. The first WWII book I've read in ages that wasn't about the holocaust. Can't wait to share it with my friends.
Beautifully written - really enlightens you on the perspective of a blind person. Very sad in some parts but a unique story on World War 2 and the poor victims and consequences. A must read for those who appreciate historical novels!
The author wove an historical fact in a very intriguing and captivating manner. It was done in a sensitive way expressing the issues affected both sides of WWII, especially those not I power but affected by the monstrosity of it all.
I loved this book.  So beautifully written, so thought-provoking.  I am looking forward to reading more books written by this author.  I think books like this should be required reading for every generation, so we never, ever forget.
As a mother of two small children, I don't have too much time to read. This book is beautifully written and hard to put down. The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them. I would recommend this book to anyone.
This is simply a fabulous book.  The characters are interesting, the circumstances believable, and the dual story lines work.  So much has already been said about this book so I will not repeat the compliments.  This is a must read!!
Book was recommended to me by a friend who lived in Germany during this period.  I'm now eager to talk with her about how this book relates to her own experiences.  Thoroughly enjoyed the novel and have recommended it to many others.
Historical fiction has been my favorite for quite a while now. The ability to look into another time, another place, and experience that life for a while draws me in. This novel does so eloquently and honestly. I highly recommend it.
I was somewhat dissapointed because all the reviews were so glowing. I thought it was a good read and would recommend it but not sure I thought it was fabulous!! I was able to put the book down multiple times which is unusual for me.
Superb book, I thoroughly loved it.  Characters you can actually care about and feel concern for with two viewpoints headed to one destiny.  Highly recommend this book, it should become required reading in the High School curriculum.
This book was extraordinarily written.  The author gave impeccable detail to history.  The only reason I docked a star was that it seemed to lull at times.... Parts would drag and be dreadfully slow.  The last 150 pages are the best.
This was one of the best books that I have read in a very long time.  The chapters were short which made the book move quickly bouncing from one character to another in a time of great upeaval.  I will read more books by this author.
What starts off slowly turns into a book you can't put down.  It wii keep you reading well into the night.  It is that rare combination of exquisite writing and a well woven story.  I can't wait to read another book by Anthony Doerr.
Enjoyed the story told through the eyes of children and how they aged,grew and survived. Not sure I could make it through a war and come out whole.  So many emotions I read this for my book club and looking forward to our discussion.
I liked the book very much. Purchased it because of all the hype about it in the media. It's a great story and well written but a bit choppy with a lot of scenes changing back and forth.  For mr, it wasn't the page turner I expected.
This is one of the most descriptive novels I ever read!  I felt that if I closed my eyes, I was Marie-Laure!  I enjoyed the clear portraits that Anthony Doerr described and at times, I felt if I got lost, I'd find my way back safely!
One of the best books I've read in years. It's been a long time since a novel affected me in this way. Very touching. Very beautiful. Very haunting. The type of book that will stay with you a long time after you finish the last page.
For a world war II book it was surprisingly focused very little on Nazi's vs. Jews, which was actually a little refreshing (given our book club read several WWll books last year that did focus on that). Long book, but worth the read!
A beautiful written book, even with the technological language interspersed.  Although a historical fiction, the book infused an emotion of the horrors of war, but provided a perspective of the goodness of people in imaginable times.
This is a WWII book like no other that I have read. From the point of view of two teens brought reluctantly into the war and the tragedies only the war can bring. It is an unlikely story but nevertheless a wonderful and soulful read.
I started reading this, but it has not grabbed my attention.  If I get back to it, I'll write a complete review.  If you're looking for something to really draw you in, see if you can preview the book first to see if it's your taste.
Great story, hated the ending.
Amazing story. Told amazingly!
Very well written but wanders.
Slow read, but beautiful story
Best book I have read in years
Great read--timeless messages.
Great book, wonderful reading.
it took a little time to get into the flow of the story, but once i did, i found it to be a powerful, well-written and compelling account of the horrors of WWII as well as the strengths individuals had to have to live through these.
There are over 17,000 reviews for this book, yet I want to add one more. Because I would give out a6 if I could. Beautifully written, multi layered, thoughtful. Great characters and subtle. You won't find a better book anytime soon.
This was a beautiful book that made me quite emotional towards the end. A wonderful story about the interconnectedness of our world, and a stunning portrait of the lives of adolescents during a tumultuous time in our world history b
This is one of those books you almost wish would never end. Not only did the author create unforgettable characters, he wove in complex moral questions, beauty, and insight into an era we too often relegate to cliche. A masterpiece.
Gripping and well conceived this kept me interested the entire time. We don't often think of the relatively innocents impacted when aggressor nations lose wars and it was nice seeing ww2 from both sides. A beautiful story throughout
A very intense novel with a very gripping story. Hard to put down. The character and the story of the blind girl is very well rendered. The German boy has less depth, but shows how a fairly good person can get on a really bad train.
An amazing book.  I couldn't put it down.  Learned so much about WWII atrocities by reading about the lives of the 2 main characters who were on very different sides of the war, but how so many people on both sides were good people.
This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  You know the two main characters are going to meet eventually, but their separate journeys to that time are compelling.  I could visualize this as a movie.  Excellent writing.
Interesting and historical about an area most think little about for World War II....good characters, and good story with a structure that works well for the tale.  I enjoyed this book immensely, and Doerr's descriptions are lovely.
This was a beautifully written book with excellent characterization and compelling plot. I did not give it five stars because I found the shifts in time during the period of the French Occupation difficult to follow and unnecessary.
This is a beautiful book, one of those reading experiences that makes the reader better for having experienced it. The story of these noncombatants gives a true picture of the horrors of war without a single shade of sentimentality.
A story told in such a way that I didn't want it to end. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My only disappointment was I was looking forward to an author's description of research with some insight to what part of the story was based on fact.
World War II novel... Story of a young blind girl during the occupation of France.  She was left alone and survived the<br/>war carrying a famous diamond, which her father was keeping safe for the museum in Paris.<br/>A good read.
Wonderful book. The author is extremely knowledgable in art and science.  Yet all this is a framework to describe the abominable behavior of the Nazis in contrast to the courage of French resistance.<br/><br/>This is a must read.
I love stories that are set in WWII....This story was good..the characters were interesting...I got confused sometimes because it went back and forth from presenting day, to the passport and back again..but all in all a good read!!
You may say, "Not another Holocaust book! ". Like no other on the topic!  Anthony Doerr weaves a tale obetween two narrators that keeps the reader on her toes until the end. The fascinating connection makes it a great read!
Wonderful story seen through different people of a very difficult time in history.  The characters were terrific and I related to their lives.  The only weakness was how it all came together at the end.  Loved the style of writing.
Doerr weaves a wonderful, bittersweet story where each character's life ultimately crosses another's. At times, the stories seem too slow or too sad, but Doerr has developed some strong characters who make you want to keep reading.
I had a little trouble getting into this book, but once I was in I was hooked.  I've read many novels about WWII but none quite like this one.  A beautiful story with very human characters- flawed but most with redeeming qualities.
This was a book group choice.  When I read what the book was about I thought "oh no, not another ww2 book"  I was so pleasantly surprised at how engaging the book was.  It has been awhile since I've read a book I couldn't put down!
This book has a very different view of the war. I liked that it was told in several characters. I enjoyed reading it but was a little disappointed with the ending. I would still recommend it for anyone who likes historical fiction.
This was one of those reads that you don't want to end.  When it's over you feel very emotional because of the way the author brought the characters to life.  I would recommend this book to everyone who loves character development.
This book will leave you excited, scared, happy, sad, and any other possible emotion. It was amazing and much more than was expected. This is a new classic that everyone needs to read and talk about, so the story will live forever.
This is an amazing book by a talented writer. I recommend it to everyone who understands that there is a path to redemption in this world despite the chaos around us. The ending is one of the best I've read since The Great Gatsby.
An astonishing piece of work, full of wisdom. Although it is candid about the horrors of war, it also has a deeply ethical aspect which is very moving and important in our time. Full of amazingly perceived and astonishing details.
The inside-out of this story's perspective will encourage the reader to "see" beyond other historical fiction of WWII. While the story is a bit lyrically bumpy at tines. Hang in there; the "gem" will be discovered!
Parallel stories of characters who have nothing in common but who are destined from page one to come together. The beauty of the story is how the author accomplished this without the story being contrived or artificial.  Loved it.
I was pulled into each character's life and into the time they lived.  Loved the "back and forth" of each characters story and how the author skillfully wound them all together.  I'm sure I will be reading this over again.
Very good book. The storyline was great. I loved that they told what their lives were like many years later. Our book club agreed to read this. Although, am feeling somewhat overwhelmed with books about the Holocaust and the evil details. We need more light that we can see.
It was a beautifully written story paralleling the lives of two curious, brilliant young minds and how the WWII twists their fate and eventually brings them together in the most unlikely way. I definitely suggest reading the book.
I hate to write reviews which can turn into spoilers for the next reader. Hence no details of characters, plot lines etc.<br/>I do, however, recommend this beautifully written novel. It is poignant and well crafted and pertinent.
Children's experiences during the war from French and German perspectives. Each character has been fully fleshed out to provide the reader with a nuanced understanding of each one's relationship with the others. A compelling read.
This is a great book for those who want to get a look of how lives were back in the 1940s. It makes you want to appreciate the things you have now because back then they had nothing. The people they loved the most were taken away.
This took a while to capture my interest, but was definitely worth it!  The structure is kind of frustrating at first..  lots of back and forth both through time and with characters, but the story really comes together at the end.
A  Beautifully Written book,rich in details of the Parisians during the war.Great insight into a little blind girls who is almost totally independent,due to help from her Uncle.Also an interesting little mystery.A really good read
Outstanding.  Characters you could not dream up yourself! Great insight into the emotional evolution of German youth during Hitler era. I was slightly thrown off (maybe a little annoyed) at times with flashbacks and flashforwards.
I loved this book. The characters were wonderfully developed and I couldn't wait to get back to the story each time . Would highly recommend this author. This is my first Anthony Doerr novel and I am going to check out his others.
A beautiful and poignant story, truth for the heart even if not factual. Marvelously written, we care about all the people no matter their nation. The lines of good and evil blurred by human feeling and actions...tense and lovely.
Anthony Doerr has written a great novel, with memorable characters and an engrossing story.  The only drawback was the switch between different time periods that was a little confusing at times, but it was an enhancement overall.
Author could alter time and place so deftly that the reader always knew what was happening. A work of prose that is really poetic in many ways. Not a happy work, but at the end, leaves the reader comfortable in this/her own skin.
BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN DESCRIPTIONS OF DETAILED LANDSCAPE, EVENTS AND EMOTIONS.......BUT WAS IT REALLY NECESARY TO GO BACK AND FORTH FROM ONE TIME PERIOD TO ANOTHER?  THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DEVELOPED BUT THE ENDING WAS A LET DOWN.
Interesting how the author was able to develop the characters with only tidbits of information.  Jumping back and forth so rapidly, one would think you would loose track or have trouble developing the characters.  But one didn't.
This was one of the best books I have read in a long time.  The Girl on the Train does not even come close to this.  This has complex plot, wonderfully developed characters  and  flowing writing.  I will read more of this author.
A wonderfully told story, one which will stay long time live in my memory.I was particularly moved by the attention and the feeling for science and for learning. Also, to war as lived by many different people, including soldiers.
The scenery painted with words is exquisite. The story touching, uplifting, and sad all at the same time. Couldn't stop reading, and when I wasn't reading, I was thinking about it. Officially one of my favorite books of all time.
This is an interesting well-written book told from the dual perspectives of a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy before, during, and after WW II.  I don't read a lot of fiction but this book certainly held my attention.
Beautifully written, difficult story.  Complex characters and situations.  a book that I was not able to breeze through -- one that I had to digest, re-evaluate, rethink the characters and how events had formed, or changed, them.
I don't love fiction--I am too much of a cynic and am not easily surprised. This book was riveting, full of interesting plot turns, fully developed characters, intricately painted landscapes. Best book I've read since Life of Pi.
Loved this book. I have read a lot of books on this time period and was worried it would be similar to something else, but it was so well written and from so many perspectives. The way the story lines intertwine was so wonderful.
Beautifully written story that describes two sides of WW II. I loved some of the analogies and the language in general. The plot and characters kept me turning the pages, which lead to a satisfying conclusion. I highly recommend.
Lyrical peek at Paris in the midst of WWII.  What makes it unique is hearing the story from so many points of view.  Illustrates beautifuuly that our differrences are outweighed by our similarities.  Plus, i couldn't put it down.
The people in this story are so full of hope.  Terrible times of war but they keep dreaming of better lives.  They make what is<br/> brutal produce  better people.<br/>I recommend it for the wonderful descriptions and emotions.
Beautifully written account which follows mechanically brilliant Werner and blind, indefatigable Marie-Laure. Hoping against hope that the mystery of the diamond known as Sea of Flames will bring beauty with the life it promises.
The accolades for this book are completely warranted. A wonderful book, structured around parallel story lines that buld to a perfect ending. Heartwarming, intellectually challenging. One of the best novels of the year, for sure.
Beautiful and thought-provoking novel with reminders of the power of the human spirit and the compassion we have for one another. I thought I couldn't possibly enjoy yet another WWII story. How wrong i was! Absolutely spell-bound
Enjoyed the novel very much, good history lesson with a sad and touching story of the beginnings of two European teenagers lives...  Really makes you think of what the 80 and 90 year old people alive today experienced during WW2.
Excellent account of WWE and what the children on two sides experienced.  I learned so much about the Germans and the French and have a better appreciation for both. Touching and thoughtful character development and descriptions.
While the book has decent characters the pace at which it moves is ridiculously slow, I kept finding myself looking at the % complete and saying 50% what else could possibly be written to continue this.  Definitely not my taste.
One of the finest books I've read in a very long time,  The author helps you feel the emotions of the characters and weaves an original tale  set during a horrible time in history.  Would and have recommended it to other readers
There are no superlatives I can add to this book that have not already been applied.  I am glad that I read this book early on, and had given it to several friends and family, before all the acclaim.  Absolutely loved this book.
I am only halfway into the book. It is a beautifully written story about two teens in Germany and France.  One blind and loved, the other an orphan whose talent is recognized and his reality becomes raw in Hitlers Youth program.
This author has risen to be in the top ten of my favorite authors. This book is to be savored<br/>And while it may not be to everyone's taste it certainly will touch the heart of all who are blessed to cross<br/>Paths with it.
Mr. Doerr has created a descriptive masterpiece. From first to last page, I was captivated by the non-stop detail he used. I'm certain if Marie-Laure had the chance to read it, it would rival Jules Vern. Look forward next novel.
This is an amazing read and has resulted in my going on to more historical fiction.  The author succeeds in getting both the Allied and German perspectives of the war as viewed by young people who never anticipated being part of
Beautiful book.  The plot was rich, the story well developed the characters so deeply human in all the ways that make us human, capacity to love, ability to preserver and a desire to see beauty and truth in all area of our life.
I know when a book keeps me up reading into the wee hours of morning I am going to hate when it ends. Wonderfully, seamlessly written, it is filled with empathetic characters living and surviving and dying in the worst of times.
The beautiful prose and language makes me want to read it even more slowly next time. I usually deduct a star for crude language, but rarely, like now, I feel it has its place. The instances were brief and true to the character.
Terrific book, once I started reading I couldn't put it down. The author gives such detailed descriptions that the reader" sees" as if actually there.I would recommend for everyone for a new perspective in WW!! survival.
just such a well written story about a blind girl, her father who was a museum curator, the war, and a diamond. the characters were very life like and the plot keep you thinking. I still wonder about what happened to the diamond
Finished it today. I can see why it was a national book award finalist. The writing was beautiful, breathtaking even at points...I fell in love with Marie-Laure and Werner, the young main characters...Slow in parts but worth it!
Of all the books I've read this year, this is the one that will stay with me. The beauty of the language, the depth of the characters...all captured in such a way that you don't want to put it down, yet you don't want it to end.
This lyrical book full of intersecting lives that all try and survive the horrors of Germany and France during World War II. Expression With prose and imagery. Broken up in to caveats of storyline sprinkled randomly in the book.
The characters slowly come alive and important to you. The story is enhanced with stunning metaphors. Mr Doerr is subtly profound.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history and a good story with compelling characters
Beautiful images woven through a suspenseful plot spanning the years surrounding WWII. Informative, intuitive and engaging, the author takes you on a journey from darkness to light and everywhere in between. Masterfully written!
I really actually think it was a pretty good book, and nice story...but I didn't like the way it jumped around so much...past to present....person to person......and the ending .  But aside from that...it really was a nice story
A wonderful, epic novel spanning over 60 years. I was fully enthralled by the main characters and how their lives were intertwined. This book kept me turning page after page unaware of the time I was spending blissfully reading!
This book is so beautifully written.  The scenes of the Nazis during the war were horrific, but the author brought us back to the beauty in the world that only a blind girl could see.  Made me want to look around more carefully.
Enchanting. I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't put it down. The alternating voices narrating the story gave a sense of each character's path to their momentous, heartrending meeting. Now I would like to read Jutta's story!
Well crafted story told in lyrical prose. Sharply drawn characters that will linger for weeks. Relates some of the less told horrors of WWII "wired" together in multiple layers. One of those books you don't want to end.
I usually don't read or enjoy books about WWII, but the writing and story in this book were so good I was entranced. Loved the way the author related blindness not just to a physical disability, but to a psychological one also.
The horrors, heartaches and hope during this time period are experienced by the well-developed characters in this book. It gave me a better understanding of why my uncles who were veterans, spoke so rarely of their time at war.
This book was a bit hard to follow early on as it jumps from one time period to another, as well as one character to another. It was well worth hanging in there and sorting it out. A WWII period story from a unique perspective.
Anthony Doerr creates a wonderful and engaging novel of serious and sensitive perspective. The atrocity of WWII is captured with so many aspects of humanity ranging from the very best of humanity to the depths of lost humanity.
Interesting story but slow reading. Too many flashbacks without a reason for the flashback.  Writing seemed to be trying too hard to be clever. If the story had been told straight forward it would have been a much better story.
I love to read historical fiction and All the Light gave me a WWII story from Paris and the Hitler Youth when most focus on England and America. Very well written beautiful  characters and the climax came quickly a nd smoothly.
Wonderfully written. Slow and elegant start to the story that ended with a whirlwind that left my head dizzy. I love how the author deals with the atrocities of WWII, but doesn't dwell on them. It is a human story at its heart!
Really liked this book....would recommend to all!  It was insightful and covered a subject in history I like to study and understand.  WWII in Europe from the views of the young who lived through it was a different perspective.
I thought the story lost focus and was overwritten.  Also, this is the second time I've been asked to review this book and frankly I read it some months ago and don't feel I can recall enough of it to read an insightful review.
All the Light We Cannot See is one of the most engaging books I've read in years. I simply could not put it down until I had finished. This would make an excellent gift and I plan on buying it to give to a high school graduate.
Had some difficulty following the sequence of events, but since I am old enough to remember some of the www II history in Europe, I found the book both interesting and heartbreaking. Will probably read it again in a few months.
Some people don't like books that jump around in time. This book does that but it is not difficult to follow and it all comes together when their lives intersect.  It is a very good, well written book and I highly recommend it.
I was prepared to not like this book based on the description of the plot and setting.  Instead, I devoured Doerr's saga.  I cared deeply about the fate of each of the characters and thought their stories were masterfully told.
This is book about World War II from the perspective of two people Marie and Werner. It shows the face of survival when your circumstances are worse than even those in an already bad situation. The writing is beautiful to read.
Really enjoyed it.  Not the type of book I normally read as I am mainly a mystery reader, but I found the history in it, and especially the information about the German schools, and the different attitudes of the French people.
This book was tragic and beautiful. Each of the characters were very complex and it showed many sides of the struggles people faced in WWII. Wonderfully written and the story and characters stay with you after the book is over.
Unusual style of writing but was able to keep my attention as he changed the scene in alternating chapters.<br/>World war as we never see it. The war without the feeling of the violence of war.The human persons well presented.
Brilliant, gripping page turner.  Complex characters, both heroes and villains.  There is so much to absorb in this book, but raced through each chapter to get to the next that my wife and I think that we should read it again.
Very hard to get into. Don't know what all the hype was about with this book.  Descriptive writing style of author very nice at times but  overall story disappointing.  Made myself finish but wasn't easy- rather boring really.
A view inside the monster, WWII. Kindness and empathy were gnawed down to the bone. Wrong became right. The people and places in this story are so clearly visible. I can almost make my way from number 4 to the bakery and back.
I loved this book.  It was so beautifully written, with endearing characters, and wonderful suspemse!  The historical ape the of this book was an added bonus.  This is truly one of the best books I've had the pleasure to read.
This story 's description of life during that time was riveting.  A full look at the horrors of WW2  I liked the way the story didn't end when the war was over, so that we found out what became of everyone.  Very well writtent
A bitter-sweet war story carefully yet beautifully told.  Suspenseful in many parts. Told as seen through the eyes of a very young German Soldier and a bright intuitive young blind French girl. I will re-read it in the future.
It took me a while to get used to the switching of the dates and the characters, but after I was about 60% done, the reading seemed to go much quicker.  I am interested in Holocaust/WWII stories, so overall I enjoyed the book.
This story gave a good insight into what life would have been like for children in Europe before and during WWll.  The story of these particular two children was so compelling I couldn't put it down.  A turn pager to the end .
My 14-year-old grandson liked the book and said it backed up reading he had done elsewhere about world war II.  He said he did not learn anything new, but then he knows quite a bit.  He recommended that I read it, and I will.[
This story of the Nazi occupation was very well told showing the suffering on both sides in the war. I think this story is important to think about in view of what is happening with Isis in so many countries in the middle east
This was a hard and wonderful read.  It gave me new insight into the war, and into all aspects concerned with living through one.. Will it ever stop?  The characters felt like I could meet and talk to them, and I wish I could!
The writing in this book is lovely.  The plot is different and realistic.  Mr. Doerr has a good command of the English language.  My friends who read this book also enjoyed it and I would recommend it to everyone.  Chris White
what a great book!  this year many of the novels I have read have been a big "let down" but not this one. didn't want it to end! a different story of WWII and one that kept me entralled from the first page to the last.
Pretty good read. I was interested throughout the entire story. the characters in the story bring to mind many questions about human character, human conditions, and life choices as well as those choices that are made for you.
This story lead me through a part of WWII that I had not known before -- a story told on a deep human level, tying several lives together. Read, absorb, and ruminate about individual human strength in the midst of great folly.
Terrific story. So well written. I would find myself dwelling on the beautifully crafted metaphors.<br/>Some parts brought tears to my eyes. Characters were so well defined I could see them. Best book<br/>I've read in years.
A beautiful read. The characters came to life, and the complete physical and emotional devastation of war was gut-wrenching. Despite the sad nature of the story, the spirit of human strength and care was wonderfully portrayed.
Excellent book with rich characters.  Not to give anything away, but the ending of the book, while not your typical "happily ever after" ending, was practical and fit into the whole plot of the book.  A wonderful read!
Beautiful well written story.
Another novel on a WWII theme
Enjoyable to the conclusion..
Beautiful, lyrical, haunting.
The best book I've ever read.
Slow start, but stay with it!
The author's use of descriptive and figurative language makes you feel like you're right there with the characters.  It bounces back and forth between time periods, so it can be hard to follow at times, but I loved this book!
At first I avoided this book because the premise didn't seem to fit for me.  Then my sister-in-law suggested I give it a shot.  It captivated me from the start with beautiful writing and an intriguing story.  Simply loved it!
This book gave me such empathy for the young people on both sides in WWII.  Well written, it was so raw at times that I didn't want to read any more, but couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Thank you, Anthony Doerr/
One of the best reads of the year...beautiful writing, story well-crafted and interwoven...not just another<br/>WW2 story, but one that reaches out to the humanity in us all...I highly recommend this for your 'to read' list.
After reading the entire story, the ending was not what I was expecting - the author could have done a better job with that part of the story.  And, because of that, not sure if I would recommend reading the book to a friend.
I love WWII novels and this one did not disappoint. Great characters and storyline. It does however, move from present to past and back again often which is sometimes confusing. It will be a book I recommend and will re-read.
Loved it! Great story line, likeable and true to life characters as well as believable plot. For once, an American author who hasn't overwritten. A book I never wanted to see end. What a surprise! A sensitive and male author.
Beautifully written story of two young people who grew up during WWII - a blind French girl and a brilliant German boy. The story skips back and forth in time and between people and contains the mystery of a valuable diamond.
It is probably impossible to understand the experiences of people in war torn countries but this is especially amazing since the main character is blind.  It is just one more story that gives great insight to that experience.
I enjoyed this story very much. I like well written period novels, particularly ones that take place during WWII. It had been a while since I read one, and this was refreshing. I will look for additional works by this author.
And so we follow 2 children through World War II - a blind French girl and a small white-haired orphan boy.  We are given unique windows on the war that make us want to go backwards in time to reach out to these two children.
Finally a book with plot, beautiful writing, war stories that are at the same time plausible and not so awful that you can't get through them, and a feeling at the end that goodness can exist even when horrible things happen.
Each character was well portrayed. The story unfolded mysteriously and surely toward several different kind of heartbreak, happiness, and bleak acceptance. There were no happy endings but life went on--just as it always does.
I Loved this book. It is sort of a post review or look at World War II, describing just a little the life at that time. I really like the writing style. I would recommend "All the Light We Cannot See" for a good read.
Wonderful story with many great characters.  Although is is a World War II story, and of course has tragic events, it is not a depressing book.  Our book club read it, and we had one of our longest discussions in many months.
One of the best books I have ever read.  Just read it and immerse yourself in beautiful writing and an addictive story about WWII.  This is not your average book about war.  This one penetrated my heart and soul.  I loved it.
This was an "I can't stop to cook dinner - you cook tonight" - I'm reading and I am unable to tear myself from the pages of this amazing volume. Thank you Anthony Doerr for a book that is a gift of beauty and wonder.
The author has an amazing ability to express both scientific and technical information and sensitive feelings and thoughts.  The technique of going back and forth in time, rather than chronologically, was confusing at times.
"All the Light We Cannot See" is a great novel, a triumph of the human spirit.  At once very dark and uplifting; a treat for the reader as we trace the lives of two disparate characters into and through World War II.
The book was compelling.  The compassion shown to the blind girl, first by her father than by others, teaching her at the same time how to live her life, was inspiring.  Anything about this war or any war is a great sadness.
Beautifully written story of the horrors of WWII.  The characters are young and really well developed over several years.  The details of the war horror are told realistically without gore.  I highly recommended this novel!!
I am very clear that EVERYONE loves this book, and I did enjoy it.  However, there were times when I felt the story was so embedded in the beautiful language that the story could have done with a bit less beautiful language.
It's a great book, but to me besides the story, is the way it is written. The way the author describes everything and his word choices are great, specially since English is not my first language, it is very pleasant to read.
My only issue was the switching back and forth of time frames that had similar titles and within the Kindle this became problematic if<br/>I hit the wrong place on the page.  Otherwise it was a well-written wonderful book.
A wonderful book that I couldn't put down. The in depth descriptions given to the characters and the situations they were in made me feel like I was right them. If there is one book to read this summer I recommend this one.
My husband loved this novel so I think I was being distracted when I read it to not fall in love with it.  Not the writers fault, I was reading it at an airport and on the plane and I am not good at screening outside noise.
The story sounds dismal, at first.  It is not dismal but exciting and beautifully written.  Same WWII background, but perspective from the coast of Brittany and a heroine whose bravery has nothing to do with her disability.
One of the best books I have read this year.  In fact, I went right back after I had finished to start it over again to see what I had missed the first time around.  The characters are compelling, the prose close to poetry.
One of the best books I've read, it's on my lists of favorites.  So well written, the descriptions so vivid, I could see everything the author described.  Normandy was on my bucket list before I read this, even more so now.
Loved this book. Favorite read of 2015! In the same category as "Cutting for Stone" and "The Goldfinch". Incredible storytelling with fascinating characters that stay with you long after you finish the book.
There's good reason why this was on the best seller's list for so long.  Wonderfully complex book! Got a little long-winded near the end, but overall very captivating.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.
The book began at a slow pace, but steadily picked up and I ended up having to finish it as quickly as possible because I was captivated by the characters and plot.  Wonderful writing and well worth taking the time to read!
Skillfully woven stories are a gift to the heart, mind, and soul. This is one. The events, emotions, and characters are real and surreal at the same moment in time. Such a novel is rare, as rare as the hidden gem within it.
Great novel about a young blind girl and her life with her uncle during WW2 and the Nazi occupation of France. It splits its time with a young German boy who is forced to join the army and how he struggles with his choices.
This was given to me as a gift and also so my daughter and I could discuss.  What was great was some of our different interpretations due to the age difference, and the fact that she had it as an audio!  We both enjoyed it!
It is not just the writing, which is unique and superb, but the depth of the characters and their stories that make this a deeply satisfyingly read. Looking forward to reading it again for the sheer pleasure of the journey.
Absolutely riveting.  This was chosen for my book club.  Several found it too long, but I found it difficult to put down in the wee hours.  The parallel stories kept me very intrigued and I've recommended this book to many.
It has been a while since a book made me feel like a "first hand" experience due to the exceptional detail. Terrific character development and great attention to detail makes this book a wonderful WWII period piece.
This book took me to places and times, long past.  I found myself thinking about what was happening to the characters, all the time.  Excellent storyline and wonderful character development.  I would recommend it to anyone.
This is a long read, not because the book is long, rather that it is full of thoughtful pieces that I wanted to read more than once. The characters are so well written that we can see and hear them. DO NOT PASS THIS ONE UP!
An interesting and compelling book about a chance encounter during the war.  I enjoyed the journey of a blind girl surviving the desperate times and how her life is interwoven with history.  I especially enjoyed the ending.
The book follows the lives of a young German boy who is brilliant in fixing radios and a French girl who is blind.  The plot is good & realistic but it should have stop with the end of the war. I found that the end dragged.
Blind, young, dependent and female during the war of the survival of the fittest....this young girl learns independence due to her circumstances just as a young boy drives himself to independence to overcome his destiny....
There are tow main characters and their lives intertwine. It is very well written and draws you in. You become attached to the characters and can't wait to keep reading. It does't happen often when I can't put a book down.
The storyline and writing were good but switching from past to present and back and forth with the characters  was confusing.  I expected more interaction between Werner and Marie-Laure.  The ending was very disappointing.
I loved this book!!  I loved the way it went back and forth between the two main characters.  The view of the world from each character during the same time in history was so interesting.  I honestly could not put it down.
The writing was good.the story was good too but there was confusion  and I found myself turning back the pages trying to figure out the timing and how things fit in.I was disappointed in the ending.  I wanted more closure.
Characters are so well described.  The story is one of friendship, family ties, and survival during World War II.  The story builds to a poignant ending that had left me missing the characters.  Would definitely recommend.
Anthony doerr writes well.there were parts which were exceptional.  But his writing was in and out of elegance. He has just missed the mark With this book but I expect that he will arrive at exceptional in the near future.
What a fabulous read!  Loved, loved, loved this book.  The language is mesmerizing, the story spellbinding;  I did not want it to end.  If you love historical fiction that deals with World War II, you will enjoy this book.
Very well written.  I liked the multi levels and the repeated theme of the nautilus, shell, spiraling.  Many layers to spiral through.  One of the best books I've ever read.  Anthony Doerr is a an author I will read again.
Very good read.  I couldn't follow all the time, but managed to get it all together by the end.  Beautifully written...you could tell there was much work done to get the historical perspective.  I enjoyed reading the book.
A World War II story that is so much more. A magical read. The two independent stories are melded together in the most glorious manner. It is a sad, beautiful story. The characters will remain with me for a very long time.
This was a very compelling novel, beautifully written.  It shows the tragedy of World War II from both sides and uses all the senses in descriptions, especially describing sensations from the point of view of a blind girl.
This will be short and sweet! I truly loved this book. It was filled with emotions and I find myself choking back tears in places.<br/>Have since purchased another by this author. A truly well written piece of literature.
Brilliant and absorbing story of a 16 yr old blind French girl and a young German boy told in alternate chapters as WWII is breaking out. Deep insights into the mysteries of human consciousness and human nature.  Loved it.
Very interesting and well written.  I particularly liked the use of the two young people to tell the story, gives a different prospective than what is usually the case when talking about war and it's effect on individuals.
I usually review clean books, this does have some language and violence in it, there is also rape depicted by invading troops.  In the context of war, and soldiering, so definitely a PG-13 rating, not for young children.<br/>I had mixed feelings about this.  I really was rooting for a different ending, but in one sense that is how history works.  The reality is there are some very different endings other than HEA in the typical sense.  Reading the story from several different perspectives made it interesting and kept you hoping and wondering for the hope that comes from youth, even in the face of danger and hardship.<br/>I enjoyed reading and experiencing the different perspectives of the hardships, struggles, and fears of the two main characters, Marie-L., and Werner.  Very beautifully crafted and told.  From the horrors of the soldiers and youth, to the horrors of those who were occupied and living in war-torn countries.  Bits of humanity seep throughout the book. The 'realness' and humanity of the characters as they struggled with what was presented to them as duty, country, and their experience as they tried to escape and work for a betterment of their lives the only or best way they could within the confines of their country and circumstances.<br/>I read a library copy.
You want to have a reason to marvel at the wireless world that we live in?  This is a humanizing, incredibly easy read, about how the increased use of radio started changing lives.  Read it!  I'll bet you be glad you did.
I thought this book was well-written and a very good read. The characters were very real and interesting. I enjoyed it thoroughly. I found the two-page made a complex book even more readable. I recommend this to everyone.
This is more than a little interesting because I never received this book !  I know a friend loved it.  I have not read it  Maybe by writing this review someone at Amazon will be able to send me a copy !  Ruth Mary Harrop
What a wonderful book! There is beauty on every page. Author Doerr tells a spellbinding story while using metaphor, simile, personification, and all-around evocative writing. I loved every page and will re-read this book.
I chose this rating because I found the book hugely interesting in an historical and personal way.  The book was hard to put down and I thought of it often through the day; I always welcomed getting back into it at night.
A very unlikely story of how war effects different people. How they survive and how it changes them and molds their lives.  Both gently and violent. Hidden plots, and events to ponder. A thought provoking story and title.
Poetically written it puts on display the best and worst of human nature as the characters are swept along in the current of war. As their souls are tested by crushing adversity their search for meaning instructed my own.
This was a page turner, not in suspense but just because I wanted to know the characters intimately.  What a sad time for the nation of Germany.  What an inspiring story of resistance on the part of the French.  Loved it!
Excellent character development. Interesting twists in a tale of World War II that I have not seen before. The story was believeable enough to think that it had been at least based on a true story, even though it was not.
It is rare that the language, the style and the story are equally compelling. Such is the case with Doerr's book, All The Light We Cannot See. I recommend it to everyone and anyone who is looking for their next best book.
Loved this book!  You have to watch the dates at beginning of each chapter as the story covers individuals through the second world war, but it merges lives towards the end.  This is a book that I didn't want to put down.
Loved this book!  My only criticism is that it was a bit slow in some parts and often had a tendency to have some very long-winded descriptions where they were not necessary.  The ending was unexpected and perfectly done!
This is such a well written book! I loved the detail and the relationships of the characters. Love, courage, loss and survival! You fall in love with the children in this story and how fate plays a role. Excellent read!!!
This book carries you along 3 beautiful stories, while driving home a philosophy of life: you cannot control circumstances, only how you react to them. Living life means fighting the good fight, especially when it's hard.
A labyrinth for the mind and soul.  The author creates an intricate maze of characters, plots, and settings related to WWII.  A brilliant literary puzzle much like the tiny wooden presents that the young heroine receives.
I loved this book.  I could hardly put it down! The writing was so beautiful--so many unexpected similes and descriptions.  Andrew Doerr is an award winning author.  I look forward to reading other things he has written.
Poetic portrait of ordinary people caught in the web of World War II. Their aspirations change in the necessity of safety and well-being. Their motives are also borne of necessity. The tale is poignant and contemplative.
An incredibly well written, beautiful book. While I was hesitant to read yet another WWII book, this one had me from page 1. Great story made even better by the writer's wonderful gift of language. Plan to read it again.
Very descriptive.  A window on what WWII felt like for those forced to live it every day. A good story line. I liked the brief chapter format - I looked forward to the next time I would have an opportunity to pick it up.
Highly Recommend this book for everyone.  But plan on a nice slow read to allow yourself time to take in the incredible descriptions that Doerr provides throughout the book.  This book is a gift to your senses and heart.
A thourghly engaging novel.  This reader wondered throughout most of the reading as to how or if the French blind girl and the German orphan boy would finally connect.  When they do it is a reasonable, uncontrived event.
Initially very difficult to navigate due to all the changing perspectives and leaps back and forth through time, but I am very glad I persisted. The latter third of the book ties all the loose ends together quite nicely.
Fabulous book.Beautiful details of scenery, weather, events, people and emotions while the narrative describes the life of a blind girl and other children's  experiencing the second world war.  I was sorry that it ended.
I truly enjoyed this book - what a wonderful story.  Extremely well written, wonderful characters along with an unusual story that is memorable!!  It was highly recommended to me and I enthusiastically pass it on as well
I couldn't put this book down. At first I didn't like the ending, but after thinking about it for awhile I was pleased that Mr. Doer had the courage to end it the way he did. We never know what life has in store for us.
I enjoyed reading this book. It follows two separate lives, a blind girl from Paris and a German orphan. Their stories  which eventually intersect during World War 2. It's a good book, not a rest one, but worth reading.
I had been able to sit down and read more often. In the beginning it was hard to keep straight who was who and where and when everyone was. I think it would have been better to read the actual book versus on the kindle.
One of the best books I've read in a long time. Gave me a new perspective on the sculpting of Hitler's youth, and the horrific price of WW2, and the bravery of young handicapped girl, and the German youth who saved her.
A truly masterful novel. Touches every edge of your soul. Brings the pain and reality of WWII to life, weaving various narratives together with beauty and heartbreak, suspense and despair, evincing humanity at its core.
Very good book, though I felt it started a bit slow. I still gave it 5 stars because it is packed full of great moments. This was a different perspective of living during the Nazi era. I learned about living blind, too.
The first book I have read regarding war that brings home such a personal aspect from the point of view of each of these characters.  The kind of novel that must be read carefully as the writing is so beautifully stated
This is a fine novel set in WWII. Although the presence of war is strong, there are streams of light, unexpected and often quiet.<br/>The characters are still strong in my memory although I finished the book weeks ago.
This is now my all-time favorite book. The writing is beautiful and spare. The chapters written from Marie's perspective are almost uncanny in that Doer so successfully captures the sensory world of the sight less girl.
I loved all the science in this book, the classification systems as seen through Marie-Laure's blind eyes and the radio technology brought to light by Werner.  I enjoyed the way the author twined their stories together.
Rarely have I encountered a more sensitively written story.  The way everyday lives can be so radically altered and danger introduced by cataclysmic events is a purposeful tale from which we can all benefit, if we will.
Wonderful character development as well as great descriptive prose. I felt I was in the story observing the characters as they lived through this horrible time in history. I will look for more by this author. Thank you.
I really enjoyed this book but did feel towards the end that it was time to stop going back in time and just bring the story to a close.  It is a great book for discussion and leaves some mysteries to be wondered about.
Excellent story . I loved how all the characters had some tie in at the end.<br/>It was sometimes hard to follow the change in each chapter of who  and when . But a hard copy of the book would have solved that problem.
The storyline was at times hard to follow, as it jumped to previous times and current times and back and forth over again.  The story itself  was very well written, and I enjoyed it.  It is a good representation of war.
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Loved the characters, especially the strong female main character. I don't think I've ever said this about a book before, but I really hope they make a movie of this one!
THIS STORY IS A VERY GOOD PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN A WAR ZONE. IT GIVES AN IDEA OF HOW OUR BACK GROUND AND CULTURE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HOW WE FORM OUR VALUES AND BELIEFS  THAT GOVERN  OUR LIVES .
It's been a while since I've read such a well-written book. I found the writing style refreshingly different and the story inspired me to reflect on life and its various perspectives.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it.
This started out a bit slow for me, but in the end, I did quite enjoy it.  The characters are well developed and likeable, which made it fun to read and the suspense at the end was gripping.  Overall, a feel good story.
Amazing,outstanding thought provoking writing. This is the best book I've read this year. Fell in love with all the central characters and was moved by their experiences and growth. Recommend to fans of real literature!
Very well-written and memorable.  I will cherish descriptions in this book long after I finish it.  The characters are well developed, and when I hear Claire de lune I will envision a short wave radio in a French attic.
Loved reading this book.  The effects of WWII on the youth of Germany and France were written expertly into this book and while evil and suspense was "sitting" on most of the pages so was great love and bravery.
Wow!  Wonderful story and beautifully written.  About WWII and children who cross paths in the most unusual way.  Finished it last week but the story and characters are still on my mind.  A definite "must read."
A wonderful read about WW11 from the point of view of 2 young people.<br/>The short chapters helped me process the sadness, fear cruelty and hope of this book<br/>I learned to appeciate the use of radio during the war
Terrific book...have you ever wondered what it would be like to lose your sight?  Follow this French girl during wartime as she uses her other senses and intelligence and charms everyone she meets.  Brilliantly written.
i just finished it and want to re-read it. what an amazingly poignant story, set in the horrific theaters of WW2, paralleling the lives of two young children during that time. BEAUTIFULLY written. So highly recommended.
Great read I loved it
ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING!:)
For anyone who loves words, this is the book for them. Beautifully written. Set during World War II. Author describes his main characters so vividly and lovingly and with such emotion that I couldn't put the book down.
Beautiful book! I have recommended All the Light We Cannot See to all the book-lovers I know. It takes a bit to become immersed, but your patience will pay off, I promise! I was so sad when I had no more pages to read.
A story that will stick with you after it's been read.  At first this book seems disjointed but it comes together and is so beautifully written that<br/>I found myself reading over paragraphs twice just to enjoy them.
A book I couldn't put down! I enjoyed the way the plot switched between the two main characters as their lives' paths slowly came together and crossed. I got caught up in the stories and definitely recommend this book!
Somewhat confusing with the two stories and the back and forth within each story!  I enjoyed the beginning and end and was somewhat confused I the middle ... Maybe it was because the chapters were so short!  Good book!
I enjoyed the book: fascinating story, great characters. I liked the fact that the story skipped around a little, so we saw a hint of what was to come, which relieved me of much stress (I worried about the characters).
I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.<br/>The character development was thorough, with Mr. Doerr's word-smithing making characters and scenes completely visible.<br/> There is anything I disliked about the book.
Great book from beginning to end.  Unique perspective of war and the effects that it had on two beautifully depicted characters.  A beautiful tragedy that will leave you amazed, saddened, and heartbroken.  A must read.
A powerful story about redemptive love and inhumanity, resilience and the brutality of war, of what we invest our faith and energy in, of perseverance and the human condition. Beautifully written. I will read it again.
This book leaves behind the good versus the evil war stories of times past. It treats our human existence and relationship with war with a respect and tenderness I have rarely encountered! I highly recommend this book.
I can't say enough good things about this book, and yet I fear that anything I say about it could diminish it.  Read it for the story, of course, but you will discover so much more.  This one has the feel of a classic.
beautifully told story of people in two counties at war with each other and how their lives crossed; each person meets the enemy, and each realizes they could be friends and not the enemies they had believed they were.
This is a powerful story that revolves around children defined by the war.  I still think about them and all that happened to them to become strong within their limited environments.  This is a book well worth reading.
What a wonderful writer - beautiful prose - hard to put down - reading it alongside "When Paris Went Dark" (nonfiction - history) - and together I am beginning to get a 'picture' of the effects of World War II
All the Light We Cannot See was one of the best books Ive ever read. Although the subject matter is depressing, Doerr's writing style is engaging which illuminates the era and makes a lasting impression on the reader.
This was an incredible book - it lived up to it's promise as the #1 Historical Fiction for 2014 .  The characters were well developed and it did not sugar coat the horrors of WWII and the impact on so many good lives.
As an author I can appreciate all the research that went into this deeply moving novel. The writing is superb, the intricate plotting is amazing, and the characters will live with me forever. Well done, Anthony Doerr!
The descriptions in this novel are so rich, so textured, so gorgeous. The story- so unique- the perspective shifting between characters - all merging upon the same experience of war. I'm awestruck by this masterpiece.
A wonderful historical fiction novel, very well written. It transports you in time and makes you feel as you really know the characters.  People that against all odds overcome their fears and find good in one another.
I am not sure the chapters loaded in order?  I worked my way through it and think it is a good book.  Someone needs to check the order before it is sent out.  It is too expensive to have to go through so much trouble.
Love, regret, disappointment, duty, guilt, failure, curiosity, obsession, redemption -- the bonds we make and those we break, and the ultimate folly of war. Everything important about life lies in this beautiful book.
Exquisite !  The words are to savor. The story is brought to life in a way to understand a horrible moment in history. Full of individuals with each a heartache  I wonder how the author brought to the pages this tale?
This touching story transcends the reader to the time of war in which humanity peeks it's head.  It gives the reader a glimmer of hope that there are good people in the world in spite of their circumstances.  Lovely!!
Maybe I'm missing the boat. The tale of two young people during WWII. Yes beautifully written, but I didn't find the story that compelling. This is on many peoples Best of 2014 list, but I don't really understand why.
A superb job of weaving the stories of two peoples lives into this novel.  I can see why this book has done so well in sales.  It is a great read and well worth having in one's library.  This author has great talent..
This was a brilliant novel of WWII! I can't even begin to say how much I enjoyed it. For me a book has to have characters that I become emotionally invested in. And this certainly did it for me. I highly recommend it!
Can I have another star?  This novel is not only beautifully written, it is a compelling narrative filled with unforgettable characters.  I savored every description, every line of dialogue.  Definitely worth reading!
Beautifully written about a decidedly unbeautiful time in our history. I could easily see every character and demolished building. I knew the two characters would eventually meet, but I couldn't imagine the poignancy.
Wonfderful World War II story told from the perspective of two young people whose lives intersect. A tale of humanity within the horror of war. Fall in love with the characters and their lives. I couldn't put it down!
Stunning, wrenching, transcendent storytelling. Simply exquisite prose.  Characters so finely drawn and achingly human you will carry them close long after you turn the final page.  A work of art resplendent and rare.
A book that mostly takes place during WWII but from a different perspective than I've read. Extremely compelling characters who weave in and out of each other's lives and beautifully written. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Breathtaking...This novel was wonderful. A magical, twisting path that enveloped me like one of Marie's puzzle boxes. Recommended for anyone who loves a heart-wrenchingly beautiful story based within historic events.
I loved this book. It was only after I finished reading that I learned that the author won a Pulitzer - I was not surprised in the least. This is one of the best books I've ever read and would recommend it to anyone.
Really liked this book from beginning to end.  The plot was a unique perspective for me of France, Germany and WWII.  Characters were written super cleverly which made them particularly endearing.  Great read overall
I had heard about this book from others and finally had a chance to sit down and read it from end to end - a wonderful, thought-provoking and suspenseful story told with a great sensibility of characters and history.
I absolutely loved it.  In took me a while to get into the book, but once I did that, I could not put it down.  I loved all the characters, particularly the girl and the boy.  I have recommended it to all my friends.
Excellent book.  The only thing that frustrated me somewhat was the back and forth dates of the chapters; i.e. one chapter covered August 1944 and the next went back in time.  This back and forth happened frequently.
Such beautiful imagery of a time period I thought I was familiar with. A beautiful story of intertwined lives. This book is one of those that leave you wishing it had no conclusion. I wanted to continue reading more!
This was a realistically written story about a blind girl and her experience in France during the Nazi occupation.  I liked it because it didn't have a fairy tale ending.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
This is a thoroughly disturbing book to read. Although it finally restores your equilibrium somewhat by the end it does achieve what the author no doubt wanted to achieve by creating characters that were really dark.
A book of wonder tempered only by an ambiguous ending.  The characters are so vivid, you almost feel they are in the room with you.  Beyond the mesmerizing story is a philosophic treatise on intention, fate and hope.
One of the best books I've read. The storyline kept me interested all through the book. I thought it fell a little flat at the end like the author gave up on the characters, but maybe because I didn't want it to end.
While half way through the character development weaves intricate and compelling stories. They illustrate the twists and turns in life which are not always predictable and how people adapt or don't to new situations.
A beautiful novel that slowly captured my attention until I could no longer put it down. More than a history novel, more than a story, Doerr offers a window into a world that will fill you with a rainbow of emotions.
This book is like a beautiful poem that you would want to read again and again.  We can see the war as it appeared to many characters, characters with multi faceted dimensions, like the gem at the heart of the story.
The pace was very slow during the first two thirds. It picked up somewhat in the last third. I almost gave up reading several times. If it weren't for the advice of friend who had  read it and liked it, I would have.
Such heartbreak, brutalities, of war on all sides but yet the goodness, strength, the light that neither of the main characters could see in themselves were so magnificently played out in the end. Sad, but good read.
Stories of Nazi Germany are always difficult to read. The abject horror cannot be disguised or hidden. This book was a journey of the spirit and of enduring strength, determination, and love. I'm glad that I read it.
I'm upset with the way they portrayed the book to be. It was an overall good read, but I would have loved to see more of Werner and Marie. I thought the book was about their story, not about their lives individually.
Once the novel began (about 50 pages in) it grabbed me and I couldn't get the characters out of my mind. Haunting. The reader needs to understand the structure - time, place, character. Masterful. Highly recommended.
Beautifully written; both tragic and uplifting. Poignant tale of our interconnections and humanity in the midst of political & cultural insanity. Several characters,although highly symbolic, remain vividly memorable.
A remarkable book! I am at a loss for words to describe what I've read, what I've experienced through the story and visions of Mr. Doerr. This should be on everyone's must-read list! Unlike anything I've read before.
This is a work of art.  Not only is the story beautiful, refreshing and inspiring, but the writing is absolutely wonderful.  It edges on poetry.  Doer is clearly a talented writer and I clung longingly to every word.
One of the best books I've read in the last couple of years!  Loved the characters, and how the author jumps back and forth between them so you gradually see how their lives will collide.<br/>Didn't want it to end!!
Great story and beautifully written. It takes a little while to get used to the format but once you do it enhances the excitement as the past and present converge towards the conclusion. All in all an EXCELLENT read!
It's a bit confusing at first, because of the way it skips around in time, but it comes together in quite a moving fashion as it concludes. It really shows the horrors of war and it's devastating effects on families.
I would highly recommend this book as a fascinating read.  Hard to put it down.  I was a little disappointed in the end as I prefer to have the all the loose ends tied up.  But all-in-all I highly recommend the book.
What a wonderful novel!! So beautifully written--the characters were touching and believable. The war affected everyone in Europe. I liked how he deftly wove the story together as well as carrying the theme of light.
The author gets you to really care about the characters, which is one of the most important qualities of a book for me. Also, the shifting time frames and perspectives create an intense momentum that drives the plot.
Anthony Doerr is an equisite writer. I savored reading every page. Will read again. The story is a page-turner and renews one's faith in the power of each human being for good and sometimes for bad. Highly recommend'
My husband and I read this book last month for our book club, and we both enjoyed it immensely. I like the way the story jumps around in time and among characters. It's a hard book to put down once you start reading.
A fascinating pair come together in a doomed French town during WWII.  Each heroically strives to overcome the deck they've been dealt.  Both are people you wish you knew.  Read this book and you will know them well.
This is beautifully written and a charming if sad story. I have read lots of WWII novels and this is among the best. The characters are well developed and sympathetic. Loved the different points of view in the story.
Beautiful story of two people growing up before and during WWII in very different circumstances. It's fascinating to see where their two paths take them, especially when you begin to see how their paths will connect.
As gripping as The Book Thief and very similar in portraying the unremitting misery of war. I was confused by the end, and without spoiling anything mean - the miniature house? the stone? What exactly happened there?
All the light we can see was worth a read. Although it takes place during WW!! it is not gory but rather heart warming as it tells the tale of a French blind young girl and a German young man and their difficulties .
well worth reading for anyone interested in stories about the Nazi occupation  of France during WWII.  Characters were well balanced, showing the difficulties Germans and occupied citizens experienced during the war.
I liked the plot idea, the settings description was excellent but the character development seemed somewhat incomplete. But I enjoyed reading it despite some problems with the transitions and the rhythm of the prose.
This book was suggested for a book club.  I really enjoyed the story and premise and the development of the characters.  I would recommend this to anyone to read.  It's been on the best seller list for a long while.
Anthony Doerr has a wonderful grace with words. Once in a great while do I read a book that I have trouble putting down until the end. This is one of those few books which fits that description. Thank you Mr. Doerr.
Without a doubt, one of the best books I have read in a long time. It offers a view of the German occupation of France from the viewpoints of a German soldier and a blind French girl. I didn't want this book to end.
Outstanding summer read.  I loved every masterfully crafted sentence, every beautifully detailed character in this is epic world war 2 story of love,  hate, fear, suffering, joy, endurance, loyalty and perseverance.
Doerr enters the life of the girl, and all the other characters with real empathy for the roles and era in which they all lived. It is heart tugging because it is about the all too human dilemmas of war and destiny.
This the first book that I have stayed up all night to finish, only to mourn that the book was finished. SO well written!  Be sure to note the dates on the chapter titles because it moves back and forth within WWII.
Lyrical, intense, suspenseful! A window into WWII from a perspective that was intriguing and disturbing at the same time. I wanted to be the eyes of the characters and help them to see.  The story lingers inside me.
Brilliantly, poetically rendered work of art.  You enter the world of sightless Marie and war torn Werner - and each possesses you.  Life as it is.  Not falsely sentimental, yet brimming with life affirming moments.
A book that satisfies all the senses, filled with richness and warmth. A story that weaves a journey through the rages of war, twining the lives of families who would have never met if not for the war.  A must read.
Absorbing story, Excellent insights and intriguing writing style.  Author induces reader to examine historical period In a very personal way, and experience the ironies of the world in general and war in particular.
This was a really good book. A really great book in parts - in fact, for a while it was a bit of a life-destroyer because I couldn't put it down. However, the denouement was overly long, so I knocked it back a star.
I found this novel to be beautifully written and couldn't wait to pick up reading it every evening.  A few pages moved me to tears (which is rare for me) and I found the story to be incredibly moving.  A great book!
Wonderfully written and a page turner! He did some amazing research on this era...Hitlers invasion of Paris and many areas in France are brought to life through the feelings of a blind girl. Good work Anthont Doerr!
The author uses light as a metaphor for hope, beauty and goodness that existed within the main characters.  How Marie-Claire was able to survive the darkness of war is a miracle.  A lovely story beautifully written!
Just a lovely novel.  I am elderly and live alone, for a while I had some friends.  These people are so worth investing yourself in.  I also thought the ending was brilliant .  I thought yep, thats just how it goes.
Based on the amazing reviews of this book, I "sold" it BEFORE I had read it.  I looked forward to every word.  At this point, I am on page 260, and every page is torture for me.  I do not like the format the author uses with choppy chapters.  I feel the book has barely progressed from the first couple chapters.  Although the author is descriptive, there is almost little or no dialog so far.<br/>The emotions and scenes he describes are beginning to be repetitious--as though he is characterizing the same emotions 50 different ways.  Frankly, I am annoyed that I bought the hardcover.  The author uses words to keep us puzzles, confused, and detached.  Will finish it, but not happily.
I believe I will read this book every year and see something new. The characters are intriguing and draw you into their world. Characters that we think we should hate become human and I find myself extending grace.
I have just discovered Anthony Doerr; now I know what was missing in my life. I am working my way through all his books and loving them. This is the one that got me started and it is simply stunning. A masterpiece.
gripping alternating narratives of Marie-Laure the blind girl, her father, Werner the orphan, student, electrical whiz, soldier and Rupert the Nazi officer. Beautiful descriptions of nature and human relationships.
A very special book that will stay with me a long time.  Yes, it had some stock genre elements, though I sharply disagree with critiques that suggest that this rich and complex novel is essentially formula fiction.
Such a rich tale of historical fiction. I loved all the symbolism: radio waves, precious gems, war and love. This story is intelligent, emotional, real and deep. I have been completely moved by it. A work of art...
Excellent read.  The lives of the characters merge together, not always happily but their lives held a meaning for each other.  Sad times in which, I hope, civilization has learned.  Creative writing and analogies.
We selected this novel for our literary society. During the course of the month, this book was selected for a Pulitzer prized for fiction. This book will be considered a classic for probably the next hundred years.
I loved everything about this book. The characters were charming and easy to fall in love with and the author's descriptions of the locations made it easy to picture. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone!
It is always  lovely to read a book so beautifully written, with characters that you care about, and a story that holds your interest. This is that kind of novel. I recommend it to anyone who loves good literature.
A slow start but soon you are pulled into the two main characters and the parallel stories. How immersed in the smells and hunger and fear of occupied France!  Stick with it - this is surely your best read of year.
Great book, written from a unique perspective about WWII. Beautiful thought processing and lots  of wonderful descriptions.  I would recommend this book to everyone I know.  Gives  me reader so much to think about.
This is a wonderful literary work that focuses on the lives of two young people, and it keeps you reading until it is finished. The historical perspective is more interesting than any history book. Loved this book!
An enjoyable book filled with feelings and memories of childhood. Imaging how WWII was viewed and experienced by children as the came of age during the height of the war was very powerful. Definitely a page turner!
This is a artistically written book. I could envision the people, places, scents, this characters' emotions, everything; it was alive for me. This is the best novel I have read in ages. It brought tears to my eyes.
So rarely are we presented with a book written with such imagination, made even richer by a broad vocabulary.  I recommend this book to anyone craving, desiring the opportunity to loose oneself in a book. Loved it!
So well written; the author knew details and facts that must have taken quite a bit of research.  I read it fast because I was so into it; now I need to go back and read parts again.  I will read this author again.
This is a truly astonishing novel, crafted by an astonishingly talented and intelligent author. It will live in my memory for many, I hope, years to come. I intend to read more of Mr. Doerr's works. READ THIS BOOK!
Among other delights, very readable prose.  Especially liked the short "chapters," often containing a complete story within a story; and liked the non-intrusive method of employing flash-backs and forwards.
One of the three best books i have read on kindle along with The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt.<br/>a Beautifully written account of how ordinary people cope with awful circumstances.
I love to read a writer's first published book. This one did not disappoint me! New writers often have original ideas. This one had a very unusual  but totally believable character.<br/>Hope he will write another!
If you are interested in World War II this is an amazing wonderful book.  You will learn so much information that you have never heard before. It is beautifully written and the characters are wonderfully described.
Tender story of the brutalities of WWII told from the viewpoint of a blind girl who sees all and a brilliant orphan who naively gets swept up in Nazi atrocities.<br/><br/>Well worth the read. Highly recommended.
A really great read. The characters are so fully developed they seem utterly real. The author does a great job of building suspense as the lives of the two main protagonists converge. I hated to see the story end.
Hard to get through but we'll worth reading. Shows significant research and tells of life during WW II from the aspect of two children forced into the adult world around them.<br/>This will haunt you for a while.
It is a most moving novel. I visited Saint-Malo and saw how they had rebuilt it and the destruction caused by the war. I remember the guide telling us the story, but this  novel made it real. Horrifying, but real.
Such a moving book about life, connections and forage. It combines the weakness and the strength of humankind. Great historical reflections draw us into a truer appreciation of the comforts of our existence today.
The two tales that were intertwined were both intriguing.  I did not<br/>object to reading every other chapter about the two groups of people<br/>involved, but it is frustrating for events not to be in sequence.
A beautiful and touching story.  I felt like I bonded with the characters all the way through and was sad yet relieved it did not have a Hollywood ending.  I highly recommend this story as it was hard to put down.
Couldn't get enough of the principal characters.  Wanted a better life for all of them.  Story is engrossing and requires you pay attention to the nuances, the personalities, the environment.  Wonderfully written.
A little slow getting started and tricky as dates would switch back and forth, but the tenderness and humanity of the lives of two children in Europe in the midst of WWII, made for a compelling and beautiful read.
This was an excellent audio book.  Couldn't wait to keep listening to the story!  Captivating story of relationships during the War & affects on the people of Paris, as well as children brain washed by the Nazi's.
One of the best books I've read this century. Pulitzer and Nobel Prize-worthy. The author made me feel the characters' emotions, thoughts, hopes and fears, and it seemed like I was there sharing their experiences.
Good historical book and easy read but not so enthralling that I cannot put it down; however, I'm quite busy with elderly parents and a grandchild, so I don't have a lot of uninterrupted time to just sit and read.
A very unique story line. An eye opener into the way Hitler built his Your Force. The book was two stories in one that came together or made sense in the end. I must admit I held my breath many times! A good read.
To say this is a novel of WWII is not sufficient. It is a complex tale, although very readable, of humanity's web capturing disparate beings and behaviors with a view toward protecting hope and banishing cynicism.
Good historical story about the horrors of the Nazi occupation of France, excellent insight into the life of a family and especially the blind daughter at center of it. Language is sometimes overly descriptive....
WWII will remain a mystery to the souls who fought, and lived, and died.... Their stories come alive in this beautifully written story of the intersection of the blameless and the evil and those who carry both....
Although there is much written about Germany, France and WWII, I found the characters totally captivating. The story is set in an amazing time! I enjoyed the scientific background researched and used in the story.
Mesmerizing. Each voice pulling together gossamer threads until theIr endings join and release, like a 7th chord resolving. A dream made from a horrible time, truths shown, beauty found. We should thank Mr. Doerr.
I loved reading this book. It is gripping and extremely well written. I found the story extremely unusual as it showed characters on both sides, who you could like and dislike. Deserves to be on the Times top ten.
This was a very moving tale of a blind girl and her journey through and after world war 2. A German boy and his sister and their journey as well. I will remember and and definitely re-read this book in the future.
I am not always a fan of internationally written books about countries I am unfamiliar with, but this one was so well and beautifully written, it was so so easy to read and I was absolutely caught up in the story!
A beautifully written story about the lives of two young people and the places they find themselves during World War ll. Their lives intersect at a brief point in time, but the consequences are enormous for both.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a very human book, accurate to the condition of our souls. It opened up the minds and hearts of the players beautifully and stirred longings for more -- for more connection.
This was a wonderfully written story.  With all the books about World War 11,  this is a refreshing way to read  about the war which makes the characters become friends. Loved it and will read more by the author.
I knew little about World War II before reading this book. It didn't address the battles but more the hardships faced by two teenagers from opposite sides. I loved reading it. Well deserved Pulitzer Prize winner!
I never write reviews and wouldn't think to write one about a book, but I am absolutely speechless after finishing this masterpiece. I have nothing to add except that you must read this work and see for yourself.
This is one of the most fabulous books I have ever read.  Historical, immediately captivating and poetic in its prose.  That hardly does it justice however.  It is brilliant in its originality and just every way.
Good civilian war experiences.  Not much connection between the two main characters which was a surprise and somewhat disappointing.  Still an interesting and fast reading novel.  I like the way it was organized.
Unusual plot, fascinating characterisation, in many ways the best novel I have read in my life despite infuriating chronology - which nevertheless has its point.  Amazing combination of history, myth and fiction.
I enjoyed this inventive story of the last days of WWII in France.  The writing is beautiful and the characters are very new and interesting.  Great job showing the horror or war without hand feeding the readers.
One needs reminding of the impact of war in families and individuals. This book tells the tale of several people in a nice manner. The pre wwII period on Europe is always fascinating and this book handles it well
We read this for my book club and it was a ton of fun! Our club is generally on the slower side and we have a hard time finishing longer books, but this book was more like a movie and kept it on the lighter side.
It was a good book but am I the only one who felt like it dragged in places and when the book finally climaxed I felt like it rushed to get to the end. I did enjoy it I just left feeling like "that's it?"
I was leery of the book because I thought it was some typical guy/girl romance novel.  It surprised me.  The fact that human goodness can persevere in the most horrible circumstances makes this story a must read.
This is the kind of book that sticks with you long after you've read it.  Tragic, full of hope and so well written that the scenes unfold in your mind like postcards, you will recommend this book to your friends.
Alternating between the main characters, the story unfolds during WWII, from a very personal vantage point.<br/>Well written, intelligent, engrossing.  I kept me busy from LAX to JFK.  And I am not finished yet.
This story was moving, engaging, and thought-provoking. Historical fiction at its best...a beautifully written story that follows the lives of two different characters through WWII and beyond. Highly recommended.
It is an engaging book.  I do not think it deserves as much praise as it is getting.  Maybe it is the style of storytelling - but I found the constant back and forth between parallel plot lines to be distracting.
This was the second book I'd read in 15 years. It has motivated me to start reading again. The writing is amazing... perfectly paced and engaging. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is my lack of comparisons.
An intimate glimpse into the lives of rich characters brought together momentarily. The prose is evocative, the story lines woven unexpectedly prompting tears, smiles, recognition, sadness and hope. Read it soon.
Although I had a good idea how this novel would end, I thoroughly enjoyed the writing that took me to the conclusion.  Excellent story, told with great skill.  True page-turner that did not disappoint in any way.
I LOVE TO READ AND DO SO A LOT. I NEVER BOTHER TO WRIGHT A REVIEW BEFORE . IN A LONG TIME A BOOK  WAS SO GOOD.  I WANTED TO REWITE THE ENDING.  IT TRULY TOUCH MY HEART. I DID NOT WANT THE BOOK TO END.<br/>MONIKA
Beautifully written.  The story was intriguing and kept my interest.  I wish the two characters had met earlier in the book.  Yet, the novel<br/>was excellent to the end.  I would definitely recommend this book!
A beautifully told story of two strong young people during the discouraging and painful atrocities of WWII. I loved the alternating character narrative. A book about feeling and thinking and surviving. Grips you.
This is a fascinating book about a blind girl who lives in France during WW 11.  The plot is full of twists and turns involving not only the French in the War but some of the Germans also.  I highly recommend it!
Loved it. Compelling story line(s) that unfolded beautifully. Was one of those books I was truly sorry to have end. Would happily to read "companion" novels that delve deeper into a few of the characters.
This is an excellent book!!! I wanted to use it as my choice for book club but it is so popular there are 45 people on the waiting list at our library. I highly recommend this for anyone. Thank You Anthony Doerr!
Amazing story of two unlikely children - one blind and the other an orphan in Europe during WWII.  Their lives cross in several surprising ways.  They both make contributions toward freedom, also in unusual ways.
I loved this book, I could not put it down.  The story was touching and suspenseful, it had everything, great story and characters.  This story stays with you long after you have finished the book. Great reading.
The book was not what I expected......I cannot begin to imagine how much research went into the writing of this novel.  How does one put his or her self in the world of blindness.  A different and exciting read.
I very much enjoyed the read, but it's definitely not an emotionally uplifting book. So well written, but I'm torn w/ the star rating just based on my own personal preference for something a little more hopeful.
I found the characters so real to me.  When one died I actually teared up.  Beautifully written with such engaging people.  I have recommended it to most of my friends.  One of the best books I've read in years.
Wonderful story line, beautifully written.  The imagery and descriptions are amazing.  This tightly written story, alternating between two main characters, quickly grabs you and keeps your attention through out.
Just finished reading this bittersweet book. The author weaves a magical story with beautifully developed characters and scenes. I'm sure it will eventually be made into a movie, but it won't be translated well.
While this book is very ell written and engaging, I found I could only read iin short sessions because I found the content very disturbing. Havng said that, I thinki it is an important read that all should read.
Very interesting especially if you like fiction based in real history.  Captured the mood of the horrible events.  Sometimes, however, the pace was plodding.  Stick with it though: there's light in the darkness.
Great historical novel honestly could not put it down. FYI I love historical novels my gf couldn't get past the first 20 pages said it was boring she likes murder mysteries so hope that gives a little perception
This is a good read, no question.  Yet I felt I was being manipulated at times, as if the author wished to delve into many genres: historical fiction, psychological thriller, popular fiction.  Still a good read!
Beautiful writing and a mesmerizing tale, with somewhat a flawed structure and ending. I loved it and was also frustrated jumping around so often between time periods. Would be happy to read more by this author.
It has been years since I have read a book this good.  The writing is wonderful, the characters are multi-faceted (and few), and the story line is wonderful.  I just wish I hadn't read it so I could read it NOW.
This was the selection for our book club. I had been wanting to read this book and although I was not disappointed there were a lot of characters to keep straight. There was a lot of WW2 history which I enjoyed.
Wonderful story of what happens to two children growing up during WWII in Germany and France - one a blind French girl, the other an orphaned Greman boy whose life is changed by his genius with radios. Loved it.
This is a story of how devastating war can be to the fighters and the survivors. However, it also makes people strong. The ideology of leaders takes control of the citizens lives and leaves them haunted forever.
Absolutely the best book I've read in a long time.  Beautifully written!  It gave me a real feeling for both sides of the conflict, German and French, in a very personal,  human way - authentic, ordinary people.
Practically poetry, this book flows like music, or maybe more in tune with the fire vs water theme in the book, like small waves gently lapping at the shore of a lake. Will read everything he's ever written now!
Just loved getting to know the two main characters and was dog earing all over the place with the beautiful writing.  Just well done..cried like a baby and rejoiced like one as well.  Well worth the read..bravo!
Great story about a blind girl and her father during WW2 in Paris.  It is sensitive, loving with unexpected twists and turns.  The character development and the tragedy of war reveal themselves here beautifully.
Beautifully written, suspenseful and affecting.  The multiple points of view are handled masterfully.  Characterization is outstanding.  You really care about what happens to these people.  Just a terrific read!
Fantastic book.  I was awed by Doerr's depth of knowledge about so many different and seemingly minor things and I was spellbound by his ability to weave everything together into one complete, breathtaking tale.
This was a great story of love and hate, tragedy and triumph. I've read many war-era books. This was the first written so well that I actually felt sympathy got all the characters, on both sides of the conflict.
A story so compelling, you just can't put it down.  So many deeply created characters that you identify with in their good and bad choices.  I didn't want the story to end and now I can't stop thinking about it.
Lyrical, historical, magical, beautiful - difficult to find the adjectives. The characters become real and stayed with me for a long, long time. They were so human - so loving, so honest. This will be a classic!
This is an interesting story about a German boy and a French girl growing up prior to and during World War Two. It shows how much people suffered in Europe during the war. The main characters are well developed.
Loved it. Absolutely beautiful writing. Will read more of Mr. Doerr's books after reading this novel. Unique story and plot, though the background story of WWII is certainly a familiar one, gave new perspective.
Poignant and refreshing story of a dark period in  European history through the eyes of two children--one a willing, then unwilling perpetrator of destruction, and the other a victim of it.  Beautifully written.
Doer blends several stories together in short, gem-like chapters that carry the reader forward to the end.  beautifully and fully realized, this novel has many facets of hope and heartbreak.  highly recommended.
An exquisitely written story full of love and details and some dread. For the most part, it nudges the horrors of war rather than plunging into them, so you will finish with the characters foremost in your head.
Well written and thought out fiction tied to a part of our world history through the "eyes" of a blind French girl, this book will capture your imagination and keep you coming back to the pages of Doerr.
An interesting read, even if one has spent much time (as I have) reading novels that cover the WWII era. The title is multi-metaphoric and the underlying message -- that there is infinite value in looking beyond eyesight to find the truth -- is well-formed and communicated through the two protagonists, one of whom is blind, and the other who devotes his life to building radios and listening for and to transmissions broadcast through the air waves. The stories, recounted in parallel through much of the novel, do end up converging, if briefly, and it feels good as a reader to finally "get them together."<br/><br/>My only criticism, and it will likely raise the shackles of most readers, is that it isn't the most poetic or erudite writing ever. It is told in an English that the average 7th grader could easily absorb, not demanding of us any real work in the way of sentence structure, vocabulary or intricacy of form. It's reading lite, which is probably what has boosted sales and chatter. But in the end, I suppose it is better to educate more people rather than less about the events of the war, and to leave the poetry to the poets. So, to everyone who just wants to read a good story, enjoy!
This is an incredible read.
This is as good as it gets!
I really enjoyed this book.
I read the first 100 pages and this book really had my attention.  I loved little Werner and his genius with electronics.  Then the book went downhill fast.  The story involves multiple characters which, normally does not create a problem for me.  What impeded this story the most was chronology.  Flashbacks are fine in any story, but Doerr continually moves from 1930 to 1940, to 1944, 1945, 1941, 1944, 1945, etc.  The chapters are incredibly short which starts to feel like a patchwork of journal entries with no sequential order.  It took me three weeks to read this book because I could barely stay awake.  If the editor could take the book apart and reorder the pages to run chronologically, the chapters would be more cohesive and interesting.  In addition to the rambling nature of the story line, there was a sense of incompleteness that cannot really qualify as mystery.  Somehow there is a good story in this book, it just needs a better editor to flesh it out and to square up some of the historical errors.  Don't even get me started about the ending that isn't really there!  I'll suffice it to say, I had no clue the book ended until I went to the next page and saw it was the Acknowledments page.
Engaging from the beginning, there is so much to like about this book, including to appreciate what is like to be blind.<br/>Historical fiction at its finest, I highly recommend  'All The Light We Cannot See'.
One of the best books I have read in a long time!  What a poignant story!  Amazing characters living in a terrifyingly complex pre and post-war world.  I loved the way the characters lives intersected - genius!
Not for a long time have I read a book where I can get totally engrossed and lost in this rich imaginative and heart breaking yet poignant story. One of the best books I have read in a long lifetime of reading.
Loved this story of the blind girl and her journey through very trying war times...Also gives you an insight on many lives effected by this horrible war, and what the were forced to endure. Heartwarming read...
I loved this book.  It took me into a world I could not imagine.  I learned.  I lived and suffered with the characters.  Very believable story line. Excellent writing transports the reader.  I highly recommend.
All the Light We Cannot See is beautifully written. The short chapters help it move quickly, yet I still found myself slowly savoring the paragraphs, like a rich piece of chocolate or a cup of wonderful coffee.
If it hadn't been a book club book I probably would not have finished it. I'm glad I finished it though, it was a really slow start. The style of writing was frustrating. Most folks in my book club did enjoy it
The short chapters alternate between characters and times. In the beginning I used post-its to keep track of where I was but it is so beautifully put together that it becomes easier to follow. A beautiful book.
This well written novel transported me back in time and it's many beautifully developed characters seemed to live in my head. I devoured the book and sorry to see end. I suspect it will haunt me for along time.
A gritty novel of WWII - interesting presentation through the impact on two ordinary children as they go through the war on opposite sides of the conflict.  Great for book club discussion or personal pondering.
I chose this rating because I never like the endings of books.  I always feel I need to know more. This book makes you realize that everyone in every war on any side are all victims and that no side is innocent
This book is almost too well written.  I felt as if I was in the room and on the road with the characters. I would have given the book five stars, but I didn't like the ending.  It seemed to be much too sudden.
I didn't read the entire book due to time constraints. I don't feel I can make an adequate judgment about the book. What I read was interesting, however. I did think that the very beginning could be a bit less.
Great wordsmithing and plot, but not a fan of divulging plot before storyline progresses. It almost appears that chapters were written ,then tossed in air and assembled in random sequence of hitting the ground.
This book is beautifully written and so descriptive you feel like you are right there with the characters - smelling, tasting, and feeling what they feel. The two story lines keep the pace fast and interesting.
One of the best books I've read this year.  I have read many books on the Holocaust.  This one was a refreshing different looks at the struggles people endured during this horrible time.  I highly recommend it.
A beautifully told story that kept me wondering what would happen in the end.  Maybe closer to the truth about Germans during WWII than some others, not that I would excuse the atrocities they heaped on others.
I've yet to find anyone who hasn't been thoroughly engrossed with the story, enthralled with the the words, and moved by the fate of the characters.  It's without a doubt the best i've read in a very long time.
This novel is complex. I found it hard to follow at first, but it gradually captured.me. It is very sad in its story of two unfortunate children caught up in World War II but it is a rewarding story in the end.
I am still in the process of reading this book, while it is not a page turner in the traditional sense the plot and characters stay with you and settle into your own world, this book has depth and intelligence.
This book is wonderful! I'm still reading it but I can't stop reading it.The characters are so well-developed and the writing makes you feel as if you're actually witnessing the story as it unfolds. Great book!
If you only read one book, pick this one. Moving, eternal, triumphant. You can read the plot in other reviews. Just know this book will stay with you forever. Love, loss, humanity all portrayed in riveting way.
Anthony Doerr's words hold you in their spell till the last page and beyond. The lives he weaves are rich and strong, and a tribute to the strength of the human spirit that we each have if only we look for it.
A very fast paced novel of France and Germany in World War II and two different families trying to survive the horror of the war.  Excellent writing that encourages readers to find more of Anthony Doerr books.
The best book I have read in years. Doerr creates a story in multiple timelines, with multiple points of view, and brings the reader down beautiful, painful, and poignant converging paths. Don't miss this one.
Wonderful characters you care about, interwoven plots, lots of historical references, very suspenseful. this is a perfect book club read because it is hard to not love this book and there is lot's to discuss..
All the Light We Cannot See is breathtakingly and hauntingly beautiful. I am powerless to adequately describe the experience of immersing oneself in this book - each reader needs to discover it for themselves.
A very well-written and well edited book, illuminating into sharp focus the effects of the war as seen through the lives of the two main characters.<br/>I couldn't put this book down. Very highly recommended.
It was slow getting started with so much detail, but it was very interesting.  Lots of info about WW 2 that I had forgotten.  Sure a good lesson in living with so little and not complaining.  Patriotism rules.
I rarely cry when I finish reading a book. But I cried at the end of this beautifully written book. I will miss the characters and following their lives. One of the most lovely books I have read Ina long time!
While there were very interesting facts about WW2, it was boring to follow the people concerned as each chapter alternated between characters. It took me a long time to finish it as it didn't hold my interest.
This book was an "assigned text" for a writing retreat. I am so grateful for the assignment.  Written with gripping detail, about lives lived through the brutality of war, it captured my imagination and heart.
Fabulous historical fiction. Imaginative story with great description. I loved the characters and was invested in what happened to them. The book definitely did not end the way I predicted. Highly recommended.
Very good plot and story line.  But it feels as if the story falls apart at the end and your left with a giant void in the midst of a once beautiful dream.  I feel as if the book didn't tap its full potential.
I did not particularly care for this book. Of the many novels written about life for youth during the war - survivors of the various countries under the wrath of Hitler - this was not particularly interesting.
Great book. Thoroughly enjoyed it. It really held my interest. I thought it was well written & have told my friends they had to read it. It cleared up some history questions that I had, even tho it was fiction
This author is very brave in his writing, and the stories are all seamlessly woven together. I read it in pieces over a couple weeks, but I had trouble putting it down once I got to the last third of the book.
Not really my style of writing. Couldn't figure out the connection of characters till almost the end. I stuck with the whole book because it had been highly recommended to me. Would not recommend it to anyone.
Worth all the recognition that it is receiving on "best seller" lists. This is a love story for the ages, even though the lovers only know each other for less than a day and barely touch. Unique story telling.
This book portrayed the great war so intimately for me, way beyond what a history book could do. I loved the intertwining stories of Werner and Marie Laure. And all the light symbolism is eminently satisfying.
I've written this sentence three times because my words will not do this novel justice. A masterful sea of prose that allowed me the privilege to experience the swells, calms and storms in experiential detail.
A beautiful story of war, cruelty, and love. Kindness and gentleness that survive, even beyond death. The author patiently develops the narrative and carries the meaning forward from the 1930's to the present.
You will never forget Marie-Laure or Werner after reading this book. They are beautifully developed characters and reminders of the millions of people whose lives are turned upside down when nations go to war.
I loved the story couldn't put it down. I recommend this book but couldn't give it five stars because the author dragged the book out. I feel the book could have been great if he didn't keep repeating so much.
It took a few chapters for me to get hooked, but then I couldn't put it down. I could really imagine life during the war and found myself rooting for the different main characters.  I was sad to reach the end.
Enjoyed meeting the characters thought that they were developed as interesting characters....Story was thoughtful and brought together in a beautiful ending to the book.  Would recommend this book to everyone.
I liked it because it is extremely  well-written and focuses on France and their difficulties with Adolf Hitler, rather than focusing just on the Holocaust.  A lot of substance with a lot of moments of light..
A poignant story about a blind girl in occupied France paralleling a young German soldier who is recruited at age 13.  This is a must read; one of the best historical novels I've ever read during World War II
This is a treasure. The story is complex & profound.  Doerr is a masterful storyteller with a compelling command of words, phrasing & language. One of the best reads of the year.  Doer is worthy of his prize.
This book is for everyone to read and understand the atrocities committed during wars...mam against man. Real memories from those that will never forget.<br/><br/>This is a book selected for our book group.
My fiancee and I were blown away by this story. It was just enough history to make it historical fiction and I have never read a book with more interesting characters. A real masterpiece and not to be missed.
Book club book  Really enjoyed this book.  The chapters are concise and quick so you end up saying "Just one more chapter" and the next thing you know, you're finished.  The story is very interesting.
One of the best books I've read in years.  The writing is sublime and vivid, as it personalizes events in WWII from the perspective of a very young German orphan and a blind French girl during the Occupation.
This book was a suggested to me and I hesitated before buying because I don't usually like war stories.  I am so glad I sampled and bought it.  It was a great story  very well written and I really enjoyed it.
All the Light We Cannot See is a sensitive recount of harrowing events in the lives of individuals from France and Germany during WWII. The unique part is that the author makes those lives eventually connect.
How interesting to read about WWII from the points of view of several children growing into adults as the war begins. Their stories wind together and interconnect making for an elaborate and intriguing story.
I would not typically be attracted to what would be described as a war novel.  However, this was an exceptionally well written version of how the war played out on both sides.  Great book well worth the read.
I loved this book although I thought it went on a little too long.  The writing was beautiful. The iost wonderful images and characters.The story was important and sensitive and I wanted to read all the time.
Beautifully written with verbs doing most the work. Story jumps around its timeline to the reader's bewilderment sometimes slogging through piles of descriptive narrative. The ending begs many more questions.
Interesting story about 2 lives that come together during WWII.  I was not aware of how technology was used for both good and bad.  Writer gives depth to the characters that make you feel for their situation.
Found it difficult to put this one down.  Left, though, with a few questions - particularly about why Frederick's parents would be so vacuous about his situation and where was his father in the whole picture?
One of my favorite books of all time.  Amazingly descriptive - you forget that one of the characters is blind.  The life of every character is so delicately intertwined.  I will read this over and over again.
Exquisite writing with vivid imagery. Doerr is a master of callbacks. He spins big arching loops with both themes and characters that reinforce interconnectivity. This is a must read and must read again book.
It is a more challenging book to read but it has much symbolism throughout the book. It really is necessary to read it twice. The author's style is captivating to the reader. The ending pulls it all together.
This one was difficult to read for me and others in my book club. The constant movement between times, characters, etc. was challenging. It did pick up and we all mostly like the last 1/3 - 1/4th of the book.
Beautifully written.  Lives interwoven like an extraordinary tapestry of colors recording how each touches the other and the world around them held together by the background of history and the natural world.
Beautiful story. Doerr is an exquisite writer. I loved the short chapters and the dual perspectives. I found the movement back and forth in time distracting. Nonetheless, one of the best books I've ever read.
Extraordinary people and savage people and war.  Some sad endings; some troubled, but coping survivals.  If the stories of the blind girl and the fair headed boy don't touch you, I would be greatly surprised.
A story of the survival of soul and heart during WWII. Beautifully written. The setting and theme perfectly chosen to engage the reader into sharing each struggle to retain one's humanity in an inhumane world
I have touched , sensed, breathed through this compelling lovely  story ..  I miss the characters already - the rich mysteries of human drama woven through  the magical natural world.. Thanks Anthony doer ...
I liked the story and the character's but, I felt there were too many descriptions during the story. Some of them made the book come alive but, I got bored and moved past them to get to the meat of the story.
Excellent book.  Only problem was that there were multiple phrases in French/German.  Would like to have seen the english translation.  I had to plug the phrase into a search engine to find out what it meant.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It gives new insight into a part of World War II that you do not normally read about.  I highly recommend it.....lots of history wrapped into an intriguing, suspenseful story.
Like city of thieves and the book thief, this novel uses world war 2 as the backdrop to tell a beautiful and lyric story with vibrant, interesting characters you really care about. And the end is satisfying.
Not much to say:  Jenna Frye said it all.  The book was mesmerizing, believable, evocative.  Of course I wanted everything to tie up like a "Hallmark movie," but it was much more satisfying this way.
The book gets better toward the end. I read it on a kindle and it was confusing  to go back and forth from 1940-1944. I would recommend a paper copy. The profoundly beautiful ending chapter is deeply moving.
This is the best book I have read in a long time.  It was different, interesting, mysterious, and dynamic.  I will re-read this at some point.  Every book I have read since, I compare to this five-star book!
Awesome read.  I read a lot but I've had to use my dictionary on quite a few words.  I love that! Marvelous  intertwining of stories. Very interesting background take on WWLL with personal fictional stories.
All though I enjoyed it up to the half way point, the end of the book was as I figured it would be, sadly it also has a "Titanic" Hollywood ending... Complete with the old lady...and a blue stone....
"ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE" was hard to put down, sometimes it was stressful to read as it was living in a time when Nazis rule your part of your world. But all in all I enjoyed the book very much.
I totally recommend this book, beautifully written, unpredictable, honest outcomes, a real page turner.<br/>I fell in love with the characters and felt their pain, anxieties and hopes  all through the book.
I expected a good book but I was pleasantly surprised that it was far superior to that. The story was superb, and I must commend the author's  writing ability. Not only a good story but also fine literature!
Terry Tempest Williams has given me a new look on life….on everything broken, including our own little planet.She shows us how all life, even the prairie dogs, deserve our precious care.  Otherwise, we lose.
An incredibly well written, complex book that mirrors the best and worst of those experiencing world war 2, and truly unique main characters caught up in events and circumstances that are hard to comprehend.
A very good story about WW-2 describing development of the Nazi movement among young Germans of "Hitler's Youth", and telling about occupied France and the resistance tactics of many French citizens.
Excellent book, somewhat sad, but realistic in depicting wartime France and Germany.  Not certain if I fully understood the ending, and do not want to state my question so I do not spoil the book for others.
I enjoyed this novel it's about a young German boy and a young blind French girl during world war 2...it's very engaging. You feel very strongly for the two characters. I would say pick it up and read it. JB
What a wonderful book.  Beautifully written and researched.  How lucky we are not to have lived through the Second World War, with all the appalling choices (and lack of choices) people were then faced with.
One of the best novels I have had the pleasure to read, and there have been many. Doerr's mastery of setting and mood is exceptional, and I loved the characters. I predict a Pulitzer in this author's future.
I enjoyed the way the book moved around in time. This showed different perspectives than the typical WWII historical novel. The connections between seemingly unconnected characters made it a compelling read.
I loved everything about this book. The characters, the setting, the weaving of the story and the characters, the traveling back and forth through time. It's really brilliant, thought-provoking and poignant.
An excellent novel. It managed to show another aspect of WW2.<br/><br/>It is beautifully written. It has a well thought out and interlocking tale which works.<br/><br/>It is an incredibly compelling read
Fascinated by the authors use of brief but highly descripted chapters.  It shows that one doesn't need many words to describe a character, a scene, a feeling.  Beautifully written, disturbing, unforgettable.
Poetry in novel form. Beautifully interwoven stories of life during and after WWII. This book painted such a clear world. Felt like I could see everything. Which is ironic when Marie-Laure could see nothing!
I sorta liked it, but I found it was not what I expected.  I wanted more suspense, therefore, I put it down but, but then I would try again.<br/>The book was okay, but I probably would not re-read it again.
So beautifully written that I never wanted it to end.  Sweet, believable children forced into adulthood in a world of horrific people and times.<br/>I have told everyone I know that they must read this book
Way too many words.  Couldn't figure out why the author kept shifting back and<br/>forth in time.  Didn't seem to have any relevance to the story.  Did enjoy the story<br/>of the blind girl and her father.
Beautifully written with many thought provoking lines.  The ending is disappointing at first and then it sinks in.  Its life, no ending, nothing special.  We just come to the day when our eyes close forever.
This is yet another time of war and takeover.  Sometimes, when the author goes from one character to another it is unclear.  I liked the  human emotions shown by the people involved.  Parts are frightening.
Certainly not predictable, has many twists and is full of surprises.  The story line is subtle, interesting and beautiful. I love this book and was sad to say goodbye to the characters. I may read it again.
The writing is magnificent and draws the reader in. Although alternating person narrations can sometimes be difficult, this was easy due to the brevity of each chapter. The characters were richly portrayed.
A very gritty tale of a French girl and a German boy trying to survive through WW II.  I usually get bored reading long books.  But I had to find out how this story would end so I keep going for 500+ pages.
Wonderfully imagined characters and circumstances, all fitting perfectly in the twin settings of a German confronting war with his doubts and a blind French girl and her family struggling to survive the war
This book brought WWII history down to a personal level.  The two main characters' stories are mesmerizing--the book takes them from young childhood to young adulthood. This book is certainly a page turner.
This is one of the best written books in recent times  The story exposes some  of the brutality of the Nazis during their occupation of France as seen by a blind girl and a German orphan boy.  Very well done.
Beautifully written about a tragic time in history. Characters are well developed and historical descriptions place the reader there. I learned a great deal about what was happening in that time in history.
A very well written book with an interesting way to follow 2 or 3 story lines at the same time.  Glad I did not have to live through what our ancestors went through during WW II and hopefully we never will.
This book hade enchanted with its detailed descriptions and character development. I told<br/>A friend to pretend she's blind as she gets oriented to the setting and alternating characters in each chapter.
Mr Doerr's prose is beautiful and his descriptions are so vivid and full of feeling.  The story is really remarkable and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I came to really care for the characters, which says a lot.
Absolutely beautiful book about suffering, loneliness, love, beauty and all the light we can not see. This book also took me intimately back to a time in European history that I'm still amazed even happened
Reeling from the sad beauty of this as I write this.  I just finished this and I'm gutted.  So vividly written, so heartbreaking and moving.  I'm sad the book is finished and so grateful for having read it.
Well written and interesting - I loved the parallel lives and the way the author showed the horrors of war to everyone involved.  I felt compassion for most of the characters regardless of their allegiance.
Very well written, but didn't see the need to jump back and forth in time.  Thought the story could have been a loot shorter; nonetheless very good but not a book, in my opinion, that  most guys would enjoy
This is so very well-written. I fell in love with the characters and I so wanted a happily ever-after. But this is real life after all.<br/>How terrible war is when you view it at this very personal level,
This was one of the best books I have ever read.  I couldn't put it down.  I felt transported back to Europe during WWII.  Anthony Doerr captured the emotions and the political climate of the era perfectly.
I admit it took me awhile to get through this book.  The short chapters made it a tad difficult for me to follow the characters.  I did like the detailed descriptions the author would use - very imaginative
A great story, well-written with very well-developed characters.  Though long, it was easy to read because of its short chapters highlighting a particular character.  Would love to see it made into a movie.
Very well written!  Plot and characters well defined by what is seen through life. Once again the backdrop of our unpredictable world of conflict and what we sense and understand without the sense of sight.
Wonderful read. You will get to know and understand the characters as though they were your best friends. You understand how they felt and why they dd what they did during their difficult times during WW II
WWII was such a harsh time to live in Europe for people on both sides.  This book follows two children, one from Germany, one from France leading up to, through and after the war.  Definitely worth reading!
it was an incredible novel which made me feel the pain that all of those innocent people endured during War Time- The story line was exceptional and all of the characters came to life for the reader- Bravo!
I was enthralled with the story, but confused by many of the sentences. Many seemed unnecessary to the story. I will remember the book. It was quite a story, how all the characters came together at the end.
Fascinating account of World War 2 realities for those unfamiliar with certain parts of this history.  It reminded me of The Book Thief in that most of the narration was from a young person's point of view.
Intelligent, poignant, beautifully crafted. A true work of art. The reader is drawn into the sights, sounds, and textures of the setting. But above all, we are drawn to the heart and soul of the characters.
Absolutely astonishing, both the story and the writing. Do not miss this powerful novel. Read the synopsis from Amazon, then just read it. You will not be disappointed. I can't stop thinking about this one.
This is a 5 star rating all the way.  A very well-written novel loaded with great historical information and wonderfully interesting characters to match.  My first book by Anthony Doerr and it was a winner.
Excellent.  Am rereading it, it is that good; if for no other reason than the visuals I got concerning the war, and the characters involved in this war.  His writing is beautilful; his story just marvelous.
I enjoyed this beautiful book and had no problem with the length of the chapters.  My mother thought it started a bit slow (I did not), but like me, she ended up enjoying it.  FYI- have your tissues nearby.
This was a book worth savoring. I made myself read it slowly because I didn't want it to end even though I found it so good that I wanted to keep reading and reading without stopping. I highly recommend it.
This is an uplifting and wonderful book, really touches the heart, and also reveals the tragedies of war and the influence of fate upon our lives.  i liked this book very much and would highly recommend it.
Exquisite. A beautiful story that reflects the many victims of WW II. Putting this one into the category of all-time favorite books and don't really feel I can write a review that does it adequate justice.
I enjoyed the story of two young people caught up in WW2-one French and one German.  The ending was somewhat anticlimatic.  However, it is possible that a sequel might help to follow the two after the war.
Astonishing. This book and the poignant way it is written is a triumph. I loved everything about it, the way it weaves between the lives of people each effected by war in their own way it really wonderful.
A beautifully crafted book and an intimate visit to a world of love, hate, fear and compassion at a time few of us could fully understand.  A beautiful example of the English language at its most poignant.
Two sides of WWII seen through the experiences of two very young people: a German orphan and a blind French girl in St. Malo, which was heavily bombed. People, setting, plot, history--it all comes to life.
Enjoyed reading this book very much. Love the era and I enjoy reading books about unusual people. The writing was wonderful and kept me interested and yet was able to put down and get back to which I like.
nice story, yet ridiculously tedious... ,  whole paragraphs are losing common sense and logic and connection  , that deprives fun to read and enjoy the story..  Good learning vocabulary material  though ..
I was reluctant to read another WWII novel, and worried that it would romanticize the blind character, but I was drawn right in and found the two main characters (and the other characters) very compelling.
An interesting and thought provoking approach to recounting the many tragedies experienced by people on both sides of the European Front during World War II.  Beautifully written by an accomplished author.
And those who would understand them.<br/>The story is much enhanced by understanding of the military backstory. Without it, the jumpy timeline might be hard to follow.<br/>A beautiful well written story.
She was so well loved and so cared for, yet when left to herself she managed to sue I've. Not sure I liked the writing style but characters were presented well and happened in a most tragic time in history
This was a wonderfully engaging s. It was hard to put down. The characters are fully developed. It's easy to root for all of them. Well, most of them!  It is easy to recommend this book. It was enchanting.
Totally different aspect of World War 11, from two perspectives....a  very talented German boy and a blind French girl and her father....I can see why it won the awards it did. Very enjoyable.  Susan Young
The word pictures used to describe events or people or birds, or places or objects were so vivid and carefully drawn. They were so perfect yet unexpected and unusual , always capturing the essence of each.
I was a child during the second world war. I really liked the characters on both sides being portrayed so well. I found it very interesting  and spell binding. I will look for other books by Anthony Doerr.
It was difficult to put it down. I visited that area many years ago and it was brought back to me do realistically.  The story deals with choices people are free to  make and those that are forced upon us.
This book shows that, in spite of the hatred and the horrible circumstances, people can still make the choice to be good people.  One never knows when a simple gesture of kindness may become a ray of hope.
Amazing story that will have you on edge about what happens next. I got a little confused with the time periods flipping back and forth but a moving and beautifully written story nonetheless.  A must read!
This book answers the question of what the war felt like from all sides. No winners, no victors, only sad loss after sad loss. Yet, through it all, we glimpse the human spirit of caring and of carrying on.
I don't often read fiction but this a highly satisfying book.  The writing and story lines are outstanding, giving you a vivid sense of time and place.  You'll enjoy "All The Light We Cannot See."
All the Light We Cannot See is a story of converging lives and extraordinary times.  This novel is amazingly well written and engaging.  I could not put it down. This book is destined to become a classic!
Wonderful!!!! I couldn't put this book down. The two principal captured my interest from the beginning and the storyline was unpredictable and haunting. This is one of the best books I've read - loved it!
This is a real page turner. I read it on holiday, and wished it would never end. It is a beautiful story about World War II seen through the eyes of a young German boy,  and a blind girl living in France.
One of the books I will always keep.  The characters are so real and so fully developed.  The story is heartbreaking, but beautiful.  You will have tears and if you don't, you mustn't be truly reading it.
Great story about two lives converging briefly. But the plot is secondary to the lyrical writing. Listen to it or read it, but you must get this book. I haven't read anything nearly as beautiful in years.
I adore this book's equally interesting dual plots coming together in what's a truly chance encounter between protagonists.  Really brings home the realities of war, and its effects on youth on all sides.
the portrayal of France and French resistance during World War II Nazi occupation is riveting but it focuses  heavily on the sadism of the Germans and what it does to French civiliansl.Well worth reading.
The faraway voice and music touched two young lives, as if by magic. The loss of sight and enduring fatherly love sustained another, until fate and searching for life's meaning  brought them all together.
It's been a while since I've found a book so engrossing that I could barely put it down. These characters will stay with me a very long time. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a wonderful story.
Loved this book! It was an instant hit among my book club and it's written so beautify and fairytale like. Defiantly a different perspective on WWII that everyone should hear even if the story is fiction.
This is a book that truly takes the reader on a journey through time... Complete with lessons in life, history and humanity. The light that passes through the pages of this book make it worth the journey.
This is an excellent novel about occupied France and Germany.  It makes clear the complexities of the decisions that people make under difficult circumstances.  You get to really care about the characters.
Great novel.  The characters are well developed.  The shifts in time didn't bother me.  The last 20 pages were unnecessary but didn't detract from the experience.  I have recommended this book to friends.
The story is so intricately written, and the characters are almost palpable. The writing is beautiful, lyrical at times.  "All the Light We Cannot See" is a testimony to the human spirit. Loved this book.
Enjoyable story that brings you into the reality of war and the experiences of several families. The author has a poetic way with words that truly allows you to envision the writings from start to finish.
The characters are interesting and well defined. The story is over written. We could have cut one hundred pages or more and not lost anything. The time shifts added to the story and increased my interest.
I enjoyed the book but I am not fond of flipping chapters back and forth between actions of characters.  I understand the rationale for it.  It was a good book and I'll remember it far longer than others.
Loved the book.  Started a bit different for me but as time went on, I could not wait to read it.  Loved the characters and the descriptions used by the author.  Will look at his shiort story book next...
There were moments I found it emotionally difficult to  continue. But I was captured by the relationships between the people and how it would all come together. It's not an easy book,  but worth the read.
At times beautiful. Metaphors both enlightening and distracting. The story . . . Was there a story?  More like a long dark journey without a destination. A page turner at first--I was ready for it to end.
Anthony Doerr is a great story teller. I enjoyed reading this book and hated to put it down. It's hard to imagine the hardships people experience during war time. You won't be disappointed with this book.
Very unusual organization, I will re read this book - at least parts of it to make sure I understand it's entirety. My sister did not like the ending, but I liked it. Just felt it was somewhat incomplete.
Found myself "seeing" the events and emotions through the characters eyes.  The author does a great job looking at the historical events from the perspective of young people who lived the history.
If you enjoy the World War II genre, you will like this book as I did.  The author tells the story of two lives being lived simultaneously, a German boy and a French girl.  A hope-filled and moving story.
Best book I read last year!  So interesting being told the story through the children's eyes.  Great story about a time so much has been written, but a totally different perspective. Page turner for sure!
the main characters, a blind little French girl and a german orphan boy caught up in a terrible war. I feared for them all the way through the book. So well written! One of my top ten authors from now on.
This book was slow starting but filled with description that one can be with the characters feel their fear. The author describes each so well that the reader becomes part of the story. Could not put down
An absolutely beautiful book that is sometimes sad & sweet but at other times harsh and bleak. Very well written with characters whose stories will stay with you long after the final words have been read.
A very interesting premise.  How does a man deal with being caught between the needs of his wife and his own morals.  I also was caught being sympathic to both of them and unable to make the best decision
So beautifully written I could not put this book down. Such a wonderful story! Amazing. Highly recommend this novel! This was a most recent read for a book club I belong to, and was so glad it was chosen.
A beautiful book that was a pleasure to read and think about. The way the book jumped from the past to the present and back might have been confusing but was not.  It made me want to read more of his work
An engaging book.  Looked forward to my free moments when I could enjoy this writing.  It was interesting to see how each character achieved their road to survival during personal or brought on adversity.
I only purchased this because the reviews were so good, but I just did not like it all.  I wanted to stop reading it, but I paid for it and thought that it must get better because of all the good reviews, but it just never got any better.  Way to wordy and I am rather sorry that I wasted so much time reading it.  Would not reccomend it to anyone!
A beautifully written account of how two teenagers--a blind French girl and a conscripted German boy--cope with their situations during World War II and how their lives connect.  brave and very touching.
This is a don't miss it book.  It provides a unique take on WW2, both sides, the characters are utterly alive and human.  the good, the bad and the ugly behavior that a terrible leader wrought on Europe.
I enjoyed this book but did not find it "the most beautiful book ever" described by a friend. It was an interesting story of the intersection of two peoples lives and what preceded their meeting.
The book surprised me.  I loved it that the author delivered me to a place I didn't expect.  Both main characters had sight limitations - even though the type differed.  Wonderful. Engaging. Suspenseful.
Beautifully written poignant WWII story written from the unusual perspective of a blind girl who learns to conquer her fear and find independence in the most heroic of circumstances. Couldn't put it down
A great read and hard to put down.  This story is about  World War II from the perspective of a blind teenage girl and a genius teenage boy.  If you like historical fiction then you will enjoy this book.
This is an elegantly crafted, beautifully written book. It left me with a deeper appreciation of the impact of war on the human spirit and the moral issues raised by conflict, told in an engrossing tale.
I was very disappointed.  I heard nothing but good things about this book and the era is right up my book reading alley.<br/>However I found it to be slow and I just couldn't get into it though I tried.
I really liked this book but the end kind of confused me. I think I need to read it again but I still highly recommend it. Similar to The Book Thief, I expected not to like it but found myself loving it.
Sad and true. Beautifully written. I lived through the period and have visited Saint Malo. it gives some insight into the Hitler Youth :those who embraced it enthusiastically and those who had no choice.
A touching story of coming of age during WWII and the good in all of us. . And of living with a disability and turning it into an ability. Brilliently written, kept my attention and interest. A good read
A bit long, but quite beautiful.  A collection of interwoven life stories during a very interesting period of history. Great evocation of the tragedy of war and its impact on the lives of the characters.
Great historical fiction in WWII. Enjoyed it immensely, other than the flip-flopping, short chapter technique.  I thought that a bit like a children's book, but other than that, great research and story.
Lyrical, touching story about two exceptional children coming of age and enduring the horrors and heartbreak of World War Two in France and Germany. While they meet only briefly, that meeting is destiny.
This is a beautiful story about a brutal time.  The protagonists shine through and their observations, feelings and experiences humanize WW2.  Great tempo, suspense, and beautifully developed characters.
The author has a wonderful way of telling a story so that you love the characters and hope it never ends.  The words are beautiful and poetic at times.  Easily one of the best books I've read in a while.
This novel is compelling, jarring, and one of the best I have read in a long while.  Doerr turns even horrible situations into poetry with his style and choice of words.  Simply a beautifully told story.
Wonderful story with great characters. Interesting twists while sharing some great history. Highly recommend this book for those with an interest in history. Very enjoyable, suspenseful and a great read.
Loved the book but hated the ending. Very anti- climactic.<br/>Great writing. Never boring and held my attention. It is about a young German boy and a young blind French girl growing up in World War II.
I wanted to love it but it just missed the mark for me. It was so detailed at times I felt bogged down by it. It took me until almost half way through the book to really start getting into the storyline.
Beautifully written. You will fall in love with all the characters for different reasons. This was historical fiction without the dryness one might associate with the genre. This book will stay with you.
Loved this touching glimpse into a time with many emotional angles and characters. Didn't want it to end..I would recommend this book to anyone that would love a sensitive, thrilling, and emotional ride.
This was one terrific and moving novel.  It pulled me in.  The author had a wonderful ability to weave the stories and lives of the characters together.  This has been added to my list of favorite reads!
Read this on my kindle, so I couldn't page back to see the year addressed...can't justify the flashbacks. Werner, Marie, Papa, Frederick, Etienne, live in my heart w the frozen prisoner abused by cadets.
I love books that move forward and back in time and this one was excellent. I also learned new aspects of world war II because the characters' experiences were new angles on the often familiar narrative.
Beautifully written and engaging ...a different slant on wartime stories<br/>including France and Germany in the '30s and early '40s..two strong<br/>characters emerge and draw you into their worlds....
Beautifully written and touches the heart in its descriptions of its two young characters and their ordeals during the second World War. All written through the viewpoints of the innocent and the guilty.
This book is a treasure. I absolutely loveed it. When you can be so engaged with fictional characters, while at the same time learning,about important historical eras, you know you've hit on a great one!
I truly enjoyed this book.
Fantastic novel.  I couldn't put it down.  Suspenseful, always leaves you wondering.  An interesting perspective on a war that's been widely written about.  Very compelling and we'll written characters.
I would have given it 5 stars if the first half of the book hadn't been so slow, but I loved the ending!  Those who stick with it will understand why all the information in the first part was necessary.
This book was well-written. Beautiful imagery and an imaginative portrayal of this independent young girl who is blind, and the wonderful relationship she has with her father, and later her great-uncle.
Written from the perspective of the heart.<br/>A beautiful reminder of what it means to be human, to love, to lose, and above all else to hold fast to hope.<br/><br/>A book to cherish and read again.
The book was selected for our September book club read. I liked how it was written from the European experience! Wonderful characters,  fast paced movement covering their lives during and after the war.
I've read & reread this book 4 times now. Each time I've come to develop a new appreciation for the richness & depth of the characters & the story. Beauty, love, strength & grace in the midst of horror.
This suspenseful novel is centered around a blind girl living with her father and uncle in Normandy during the end of WWII. Her story and that of her German counterpart make for a tender and great tale.
absolutely beautiful. Sometimes I just reread sentences or paragraphs because they are so lovely. I am reluctant to read it because it means I'll be getting closer to the end and I don't want to finish!
I liked this book a lot. It was an interesting twist on WWII in Europe. It looked at human stories on both sides and the challenges that each side faced and how they tried to cope with their situations.
A close up in-depth of how different people experienced World War 11, and a special insight into Hitler youth.  The characters all intersect over the plots development.  Very good, couldn't put it down.
Very interesting and moving book.  Loved the perspective that switched back and forth between the characters from the time they were children until they were adults and finally their universes collided.
Well written, well developed characters and held my interest to the end. The plot is sad as are all "war" based stories, but I still enjoyed it very much.  Would definitely recommend to friends!
This shows so clearly the terrible way war affects innocent people and how young people can be formed to fit a mould of hate and destruction.  There are many stories about WWII.  This one is a standout.
Very confusing at the beginning trying to pick out what time period and people was referred to. Wish it was a straight story. I<br/>thought it would never end, especially at the end. Not my cup of tea.
I loved this book!  I found myself absorbed in the interwoven stories of the various characters.  For me, the sign of a good book is that I care about the characters.  Wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
This is by far the best novel I have read in years. The characters are well developed and the storyline is interesting with surprises and twists to keep you surprised. I had a hard time putting it down!
Well written and brilliant composition. A touching and at times poetic war novel telling both sides without all the horrors of WWII.<br/>Although the "girl" is blind, there is plenty of light..
Perspective on the  uncountable eons of existence as well as the nuances of detail and feeling of individual<br/><br/>Time is the true subject of this.  Book. Putting all I. An unsettling perspective.
Writing is okay, nothing special. Plot is contrived and designed to seem like it is profound, when in fact it is sentimental and a bit silly. Many much better books about that period in history to read.
I was skeptical at the book description and first several chapters... but then I was hooked on this tale of Werner and Marie-Laure and World War II and couldn't put it down until it was done. Fantastic.
This was a good read. I found it started out slow. The jumping back & forth in time was a little confusing. It picked up towards the middle. Some of the characters were interesting and some unnecessary.
A new approach to World War II which raises issues to contemplate regarding humanity and ethics of contemporary life.<br/>One of the most beautifully written books I have EVER read... and will  reread.
The book started out very strong, but after a while my interest started to flag.  The story was intriguing, but the last quarter of the book was almost boring.  I was disappointed in the ending as well.
Probably my favorite book of the year. Beautifully written. The characters in this book were so extraordinarily developed that you fell in love with them all. What a wonderful story. Absolutely loved it
Time spent in Germany and France during WW2 was mesmerizing.  The plight of the children, German and French, was exquisitely drawn. A Frank reminder of the horror of war, eased by some beautiful moments
A very touching and realistic story! I had a very hard time putting it down! A side od WW2 that I've not seen before! The people are strong yet soft and very loyal! It opens new vistas for the timid!!!!
Doerr has told an amazing story about two young people from different worlds, trying to survive circumstances beyond their control during WWII.  Poignant, captivating, riveting, and well worth the read.
The story is really well written.  I enjoyed how the author set the story up for the reader, alternating each chapter between the two main characters and how it all came together at the end.  Well done!
A wonderfully written story of the horrors of WW2 and how the courage and lives of a young blind French girl and a gifted Russian boy soldier are tested and changed during WW2. I couldn't put it down..
Enjoyed the writing, which was artful without being overly artsy. The author did a masterful job of sketching in the two major characters while making me yearn for the time their lives would intersect.
For  his intelligence and sensitivity. The  portrayal of  a  blind girl who was schooled by her loving father. His influence played a major role in her life.<br/>Heart wrenching  and a wonderful read.
A compelling story that describes war from the inside out. The author made the characters so real. I was disappointed that the puzzle of the stone was left undone. Congratulations on a brilliant novel.
I am not a fan of stories that keep flipping back and forth between characters aand times. Although the theme made you think about the same event can have totally different effects on different people.
This book is a very good read. Excellent character development. Not a unique story, similar take on the war effects as the book thief and The Reader. If you like those books you will like this one too.
This book had some profound sadness in the story but the beauty of the writing and the amazing main characters was so wonderful.  I felt incredibly enriched by the story and the characters in the book.
A well worn subject with a definitely refreshing warm view through children's eyes.  It is partly nostalgic, partly hopeful and partly hopeless.  It brings the characters to life and makes them family.
A very clever, suspenseful, and imaginative story about a teenage German boy and a teenage French girl during WWII, as their stories slowly converge over the course of the narrative.  A thumbs up from this reader.
Good review of what it was really like in Europe during WWII.  Well written but main theme seems to change to often.  Somewhnat hard to follow all the characters, but holds you to the end.  I liked it.
Very slow to get interested in. It took me about 200 pages which usually I would have just quit reading but since it was for book club continued. Timing sequence was very confusing  I do not recommend.
Character development was terrific.  I could picture these people and felt the tension that era held for both sides, civilian and troops.  The convergence of the characters and plot line was excellent!
A unique look at WWII, the humanity and inhumanity of man, thru a blind French girl, a budding German engineer, their families and relationships. Tony Doerr's masterpiece shall stay with you for years.
Beautifully developed characters, and great use of words to conjure up the scenes. Sometimes you could almost smell the sea, or the coal. One of those books that draws you in and you are sad to finish.
Exquisitely written and completely captivating. I slowed down so that it wouldn't end. A emotional, yet historic account of a tragic time in the world brought to life by dynamic characters and writing.
This is the best book I've read in a long time. Placed in WWII, the story follows a teenager blinded in childhood, and an orphan who is indoctrinated into the Nazi party. Lovely, if melancholy, ending.
A heart warming and breaking prose of many different lives that intersected during WWII.  I enjoyed the way in which the author describes how the seemingly trivial actions can effect lives years later.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Beautifully written and a compelling story. Two very different perspectives of WWII- and not just different from each other, but from the perspectives one usually reads.
The characters in this novel haunt my daydreams and night dreams.  They are so beautifully drawn.  If you enjoy the WWII historical setting, Paris, Saint-Malo and France in general, this one's for you!
This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Doerr develops his characters and their situations.  I  intend to read his other books and hope he continues to live up ti<br/>all the Light.
I loved this book!  The characters were so interesting and, even though it jumped around in time and between characters (who was telling the story from chapter to chapter), I easily followed the story.
A splendid novel, rich in language and character development. For those who will never be able to read enough about the hardships and atrocities of World War II, put this novel at the top of your list.
I was not able to put this book down. It gave such an insight to the characters and how the war effected their lives. The author had an amazing way of weaving the story to tie the characters together.
A book it is hard to put down. It speaks of our human condition, broken and in need of redemption. It leaves you pondering life and the struggles we all face to find meaning in the midst of injustice.
Read this with your heart.  So beautiful, so sad.  The dignity of life, the trap of humanity, the randomness of location that defines what happens.  The heart understand more than what words can covey
An excellent novel for all ages.  It transcends war, misery, hopelessness and death.  The characters are lovingly developed by the author over the course of this novel and in the end humanity triumphs
Beautifully written, I enjoyed this book immensely. However I was left with the feeling that the author lost his way in the final chapters, leaving the reader with a mild sense of an unfinished story.
Loved the way the book is written. There are so many books about the Holocaust but this one is different because of the wonderful characters that are not the typical ones one reads about. Lovely book!
Excellent story and writer did a superb job of alternating between the two main characters. The chapters were short so it was easy to go back and forth between characters without losing track of them.
Much of the time, especially the last chapter, I felt as If I was floating through time/the universe/space as I read. So much revealed in such compact sentences - beautifully and passionately written.
It was good to read about World War II from a young German boy's and a young French girl's points of views.  They were in totally different situations, but dealt with their situations very heroically.
A great story about WWII in France.  The chapters jump back and forth between characters and times in their lives.  You have to pay a good deal of attention to follow along.  Otherwise, a great story.
Loved it...loved the history. ..I was born in the 30s......someone dear to me still living served in WW11 US Navy.......May we in U S never forget the cruelties...the brain washing of German children.
This novel depicts the power of the human connection and how it can sustain and provide hope. The major characters are so emotionally strong as most of us would probably hope to be in such dire times.
One of the best books I have read in a long time!  The storytelling was compelling.  Loved each character's flaws and strengths. The enter twining of the two characters towards the end was soooo good.
A lovely, sad story---and a way of viewing history most of us have not<br/>experienced (thankfully)!.  I read this before the book made it to the<br/>Best Books list.  I have told others to read it.
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  The writing is magnificent and the plot is unique.  The characters draw you in immediately.  I also liked it because it was unpredictable.
Mr Doerr does a terrific job of building his characters, tying them together and then twisting their lives together.  His ability to describe a scene and the feelings of his characters is just superb.
Beautifully written tale weaving the lives of  children's together where they sometimes don't do was expected of them and this causes difficulty.  Strong character development .Finished book at 2 am,
This is the best book I have read for a very long time.  It offered many new insights into the lives of people involved in war and their efforts to do what they thought was right for their countries.
The writing is beautiful. I liked the nuanced perspective on the war, the imagery and the characters. Having a German grandparent who was a solider in Russia, I was interested to hear Werner's story.
An interesting and well written story of a young German soldier and a blind French girl in France during World War II.  I couldn't put the book down and it was a very good read!  Highly recommend it!
A fascinating story well told. Though it switched sites and characters regularly there was no problem "keeping up". I was completely submerged in the story and found it difficult to put down.
This is a truly beautiful novel, about a blind girl and a reluctant fledgling Nazi during World War II.  Their lives briefly intersect, with profound consequences. The writing is vivid and evocative.
Excellent. Extremely visual. Marie-Laure's journey is filled with moments of suspense. Werner's journey is filled with discovery and reflection of purpose. I highly recommend this book to my friends.
I enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See.  Especially I liked the focus on WWII technology and learned a lot about the historical period.  The character development and sense of place are both terrific.
Simply one of the best books I've read in some time.  Beautifully written story told from two very different perspectives during WWII.  If you enjoy good writing and characters, give this one a read.
This is a beautifully written story set during one of our worst times.  Yet it remains hopeful, creating characters on both sides you can't help but fall in love with.  I highly recommend this book!!
This is one of the BEST books I have read in a long time.  The characters were well developed.  The ending was well written and well thought out.  The author showed an excellant knowledge of history.
once you got the hang of the format, chapters of different years and different characters, the book was most engaging to year.  characters well developed, having a life of their own.  excellent read.
This is a book you will not soon forget once you have finished reading.  I read all of the other reviews before purchasing the book and there really is nothing more to add except this is a must read!
Great book. Written well and shared some of history that was new to me. Enjoy everything this author writes. She has insight and clarity. Easy to read and characters that spring to life on the pages.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. At first I could not see how the characters would connect. The author does an excellent job of moving back and forward in time and bringing a sad story to conclusion .
The book starts a bit slowly then pulls you in. The characters tug at your heart. I kept setting it down the last 50 pages just so it didn't have to come to an end. Just wonderful. A very human book.
This is a very moving story.  You can see the effect of war and cruelty from the viewpoint of a German child and a French child during WW2.  I found it to be well written and absorbing, but very sad.
I absolutely love this book!  So beautifully written.  I had never heard of it nor the author,but when I read the first page of the sample on my Kindle, that's all I needed.  I bought it immediately!
This book was outstanding! Beautifully written. I haven't enjoyed a book this much in quite awhile.Gave the reader  a creative perspective of the lives in and behind the front lines in world war two.
I hadn't been drawn into a book in such a way in a very long time. And now ill just take a day to reflect on the story and all its parts before I search out another story to read. I highly recommend.
It's so good, I want it to be a movie and I don't.  It's so perfect and real.  Out of all the possible endings I went through, this one showed me that Doerr knew what he was doing from the beginning.
Kind of confusing how it went back-&-forth in time.  Short chapters made for easy reading when you were tired at night.  Would make a great movie- almost seems like it was written by a screen-writer.
this novel doesnt read like most but is easy to follow. i enjoyed this and especially all the adjectives!!! i just downloaded another book by this author and look forward to reading thru the weekend.
An exceptional book. The writing is beautiful; the story lines are skillfully interwoven; the characters are so exquisitely drawn. World War II is a vital backdrop to the stories and ideas presented.
Beautifully written portrayal of what was to me, a previously unfamiliar part of World War II. Absolutely poetic in language use painting vivid imaginings. I can't wait to read more by Anthony Doerr.
So thought provoking, so beautifully written.  Werner, Frederick, and so many like them.  May we never forget the tragedies of war, the mob mentality and the beauty and strength within an individual.
I heard great reviews for this book and was excited to read because I love world war 2 books. I was deeply disappointed in the story. I felt that the story was choppy and some parts were unnecessary.
This book grabbed me by the lapels from the moment I sampled it and didn't let me go until the end.  Beautifully rendered characters, gorgeously described setting, and an engaging structure and pace.
I picked this for our Book Discussion Group and we had a very lively conversation around the topics discussed. This is a beautifully written book with lush descriptions and an interesting story line.
Great read, I loved the characters. For about 25 pages towards the middle of the novel I felt the plot dragged. Looking back I see this was a brief breather before the compelling and riveting ending.
This was one of the best novels I've read this year, and I read a lot. I loved the characters and the movement in time. It was one of those stories I didn't want to put down and I didn't want to end.
While the story was well written, it was much too slow-moving for me. I also found the ending unsatisfying.
Incredibly written using the technique of alternating main characters in alternate chapters. Such a good story of wwII, minus the gore. The characters were well developed and played realistic parts.
This is a great story and I would recommend it.  Near the end I had to set it down for a few days.  The story turned suspenseful and I really didn't want it to end.  Overall I'm very glad I read it.
Loved everything about this book...the poetic prose, the lyrical story telling, the eye for details, the gentle humour and the wonderful plot line. I plan to read more of Anthony's work as a result.
This book was a little slow in the beginning, but it sure picked up quickly and was a great read.  It takes you as an actual person to experience the effects of the war for real.  Very good history.
Like a fine wine, this book is complex. It is not a simple chronology. The reader must do some work to keep the dates and places straight and eventually connect them, but it's well worth the effort.
The book was recommended to me by someone to whom it was also recommended.  The two people I recommended this book to also like it a lot.  It's just wonderful, one of those books you hate to finish.
This is a very large book and I'm still trying to get through it.  It goes into many relationships, but is worth the read.  I started reading it when we were in Paris so it was especially enjoyable.
Beautiful prose, often poetic.  Interesting parallels between the protagonists and Verne's protagonist.  Doerr masterfully weaves the separate story lines together to enrich the texture of the book.
Fasinating story of two distinct characters written in an alternating parallel style with a different perspective during WWII.it held my attention from cover to cover.  I highly recommend this book.
This was a great story. A new wwII perspective. The only thing that could have been improved is the transitions between time periods. Felt that was a bit difficult to follow when reading on an iPad.
I loved this book it was hard to put down.  It does bounce between the two main characters and different timelines but the transition was smooth and I was never confused.  The ending is bittersweet.
Brilliant work. One of the best novels I have read in years. Poignant, engrossing, thought-provoking. The writing is exquisite. The further I read, the slower I read because I didn't want it to end.
A great read!  Fast paced and keeps moving forward. Good insight into what it would be like to be blind.  The characters all share that sense of not having full control over their lives and actions.
Set in France during WWar 2, this is familiar territory to most readers. What is new is Doerr's characters, his engaging plot and the emotion he evokes. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. You will too.
This is one of those books where I was torn on whether to read it fast because I wanted to see what unfolded or slow so it would last longer. I'm sad that I reached the end. It was an engaging read.
This is a good novel as you become engrossed in the people and their stories.  It is neither fast moving or pedantic, rather it sucks you in and keeps you engrossed.  Has some good historical facts.
Has all the elements that I crave: great writing with descriptions that transport you to another time and place, great characters with depth and vulnerabilities, historical elements as a foundation.
I enjoyed this book so much! The two main characters are courageous and lovable, and the background history of the Nazi invasion of France teaches the reader to understand this sad, horrendous time.
Lyrical,moving,exploring emotions of those experiencing war from all dimensions.  A book you can't wait to finish but don't ever want to end. The author builds suspense and holds the reader waiting.
Gripping story of personal heroism during WWII, cleverly weaving stories of a French blind girl and a talented German orphan with great detail and beautiful writing.  I could not put this book down.
I read this in just over a day. It was impossible to stop. I dreaded where the plot would go as much as I craved to know. The characters are few and rich and real. I can't wait for the film version.
I just loved this brilliantly written book.  Written from so many perspectives of interwoven lives during a horrifying time in history.  This book clearly deserves the honors and awards it received.
Like sailing in a boat on open water.  The story is unpredictable yet draws you in and makes you care incredibly for the characters.  A once in a lifetime read.  Beautiful, elegant, emotional prose.
This has to be one of the best novels I have read in eons...and I read alot!<br/>I like the fact that it has some real history behind it and I was so touched by<br/>the individuals.  A must read!!
Wonderful story and told in an incredibly interesting way.  I was captivated all the way through to the last word!  If you are looking for a well written, intriguing story, this is the book for you!
This book is very interesting.  The characters kept my attention the whole way thru.  I love stories that shows the lives of people so affected by WW 11.  I will be reading more of Mr. Doerr's work!
We read the book for Book Club.  Thought it was a great read and very entertaining.  Remarkable how the father cared for his blind daughter.<br/>Liked the way the book tied the characters together.
I really enjoy historical fiction.  This looked at WWII from several different perspectives.  Not about big battles and winners and losers as much as the effects on the those caught in the struggle.
Meandering perspectives on service ---to country and to one another. Transistors, trauma, tiny models, mollusks and bird life enrich the reading experience and humanize Doerr's remarkable characters
Brilliant, this is the book that I will remember for years to come! It could be ten stars and should be required reading for all who want to understand  our past so that we will not ever repeat it.
The characters were alive on the pages and so was the setting in time. Doerr conveyed love, respect and a sense of responsibility during a time of great horror in our world. It is a very good read.
One of the best books I've read. I truly loved this book. All the characters were beautifully developed. The story carried me along and concluded in a wonderful way. I was sorry when I finished it.
One of the most beautiful novels I've ever read. The writing is mesmerizing and soulful and provides a most unique perspective of character and WWII. Just like its cover and content, it is a jewel.
I haven't read a story that had me wanting to see what was going to happen, but afraid of what might happen as the plot progressed. It was very much worth the time it took to get through this book.
This book captivated me by the imaginative concept of the fathers creating a model of the town for his daughter.  Well-written,  I found I could not put it down.  The characters became real for me.
Another story of pure survival in the face of unbelievable hardship.  Two remarkable children, in different parts of the world, dealing with a world completely out of control.  Beautifully written.
Work of epic proportions...contrasts and struggles of life during wartime well captures. Inspiring story of a blind girl surviving one of the most catastrophic events in human history... Well done!
Excellent book, one of the best that I've read this past year. I highly recommend. I could not put it down resulting in some groggy mornings without enough sleep. Beautiful writing, gripping story.
Beautiful, ugly, comforting and terrifying, tragic, heroic, cruel and kind all skillfully woven into a spellbinding story about one of the darkest times in modern history.  I could not put it down.
It's not the soldiers. The civilians who suffer through conflict drive this book. And so much of it follows those who are young--protected and not so much. Loved to learn what happened to them all.
The writing was first class and the characters well developed.  The title really sums up the feeling of the book-some are blind and some are able to see, whether or not they have the gift of sight.
This story is so beautifully written with incredible imagery for all senses. Visual and olfactory senses are piqued with the author's descriptions. I will miss these unique and profound characters.
Loved the juxtaposition of the German military's point of view with the events that were occurring in occupied France spanning world war II,but took a while to get into the first third of the book.
Historical fiction of the highest quality. Better than reading history because it brings the events to life  with the memorable characters and beautiful words in a way that historical texts cannot.
So heartfelt, the imagery was potent. The author brought to life  what a young blind girl in the midst of war felt. The relationships woven into the story are warm and enriching in a cold cold era.
An exceptionally well written novel that is worth reading despite the overwhelmingly sad challenges that the characters endure. As is the case with finishing a good book, I now miss the characters.
One of the finest books I've read!  The quality of Doerr's writing style spoils me for lesser works!  I simply sat and wept as I finished the work, it is SOOoo like life is, for most of us!!!  REAL
First half seemed to go slowly jumping back and forth between the two main characters. It then picked up and I found it very enjoyable and was surprised by ending. Entirely different then expected.
Brilliant piece of historical fiction. This well written novel set in Europe during the second world war has an engaging narrative, complex characters and many twists and turns. Highly recommended.
It was a thought provoking story  line. A  very heart wrenching story about people with very strong' and determined personalities. There is a lot to be learned from them. It will not be forgotten..
Anyone who likes history. An intriguing tale of lives that connect in tragic times and reveal quiet bravery. I couldn't put it down and would have loved to read 1000 pages more between 1944 & 2014.
Twisting story of children growing up in WWII, one French, one German. Lovely story, sad but lovely ending. Not terribly violent or sexual, which is a refreshing change. Well enjoyed, well written.
This was a good read on a tough subject (WW2). Definitely a page turner. The characters are well developed and the story provides an interesting perspective. I would definitely recommend this book.
I normally get bored with descriptions but the language in the book is beautifully done, I couldn't get enough. I love the two different stories and following them through time until they converge.
It was hard to put this book down. I loved the rich details and the way the loose ends were gathered up at the end. People who enjoy historical fiction or World War II fiction will enjoy this book.
Wow.  I loved this book right up until the end.  I couldn't put it down.  t suppose that intellectuals will love the ending, but I needed more closure and the ending left me cold and disappointed.
The historical value of this book and how well-written it is made it a must read. The characters were so well developed and complex, you felt connected to them and their lives. Such a good author!
I couldn't put it down yet it is a long book.  I  kept making time for it and so happy that I did.  It is unusual to read a story from the point of view of a blind person. The story is compelling.
Obviously, an important book. I'm glad I read it, even though I had to power through the last hundred pages or so. It's a good book, but it did not move me like Sarah's Key and The Book Thief did.
Really enjoyed the book. Loved the content with WWII surrounding the plot and the images brought up by the deaf girl and intertwined with the german boy----just really well presented and creative.
One of the best books ever. A good story, even without the diamond as an incentive for the search.  I especially liked the young German orphan.  Wish the lovestory could've been more finely drawn.
The sensory descriptions in this book are amazing.  You can feel smell taste and see what the characters are experiencing.  The plot is good.  This is a must read for those who like WW II stories.
A must read! Captivating! The prose produces vivid images and the reader feels present on the scene observing all that takes place.<br/>Would love to see a movie made if it would follow the book.
Great story, style, and structure. First fiction in some time that kept me reading and wondering how the multiple story lines would converge. Gifted kindle version to 2 people, highly recommended.
Didn't want story to end.  Wonderful, well developed characters.  Story very well thought out.  Got to know how much more of an SOB Hitler was, and the damage he caused to so many beautiful lives.
I loved everything about this book! I wanted to know what would happen next but kept re-reading sections because they were so beautifully written. One of the best books I have read in a long time.
I just loved this novel.  It was  beautifully written.  As a German American married to a Jewish man it spoke to so much of what I have tried to tell our three daughters about the history of WWII.
A lyrically written story of survival, war, the human spirit and finding joy among the ruins of chaos. From beginning to end, it gives you flashes of memories and descriptions you will not forget.
I loved this book so much! Although I usually can't focus when I'm reading long books, this book made me read on! I really recommend this book for anyone who is thinking about reading a good book.
I loved this book. The beautiful language will make you want to slow down to linger over each sentence but the compelling plot will make you want to read faster. It is a wonderful problem to have!
This is an exquisitely written book.The characters are real and the story is compelling. Mr. Doerr wrote about very hard things, war, abandonment, loneliness, and disability. I highly recommend it
I did not finish this book. It's well written and has a great story. However, mid way through the story was drowned by endless description. Finally, I was not interested enough to finish the book.
I loved this book. A young blind girl survives the brutality of World War II,despite her disability. The author's descriptions of the small town in France are wonderful.You feel like you're there. War changes all of us. We find strength we didn't know we had and sometimes we find something within us that wasn't there before . . . a "truth," a conscience, a cause. <br/>
One of the best books I ever read!  Brilliant use of language.  It's like reading poetry.  The characters are fully developed and you become completely attached to them.  Go out and buy this book.
Thoroughly enjoyable read
Great book great service!
Good read but a slow read
best book I've ever read.
I am tired of WWII books.
This is a touching story.
Kept your interest, loved the historical content and was endeared by several of the characters.  The author wrote in a way that was easy to keep up with going back and forth from present to past.
An excellent written story filled with thought provoking concepts that blurred the line of good and evil among nations,individules and how circumstance determined individual behavior not nations.
This was one of my favorite reads of the year. I loved the converging stories. The desperate situations on both sides were obvious, yet humanity shined through.<br/>I highly recommend this book.
This started out as a lovely story. Unfortunately, it moved a little slow. I got impatient after about a quarter of the way in and switched to another book. I will go back to reading it, I think.
Wonderful book?  I loved the way it was written and the way the author progressed with two main characters throughout the book until the story lines crossed.  I really didn't want the book to end
Arrived in excellent condition.  A story with well-drawn characters that transports the reader to World War II France. Skillfully structured and engrossing story about enduring the losses of war.
Incredible story, beautifully written with incredibly real characters living and surviving in historically arduous times.  A powerful and compelling story but also quite painful at times to read.
This is a wonderful novel -- a great story and the writing is lyrical and imaginative. I wouldn't be surprised to see that this is one people are reading a hundred years from now. It's that good.
I like the presentation of the two main characters in their separate environments. Still reading so looking forward to the events that will lead up to their encounter and subsequent relationship.
This book is a pleasure to read. It is interesting, provides great character development and excellent descriptive language. The author stitches together different characters stories beautifully.
I wasn't sure I wanted to read another story about WWII. However, the way the author introduced the two main characters kept me reading. I was curious to find out how their lives would intersect.
I loved this book, even though at times it was hard to follow or decide how the lives would intertwine.  It brought a cold reality to the war that was fought and the people involved on all sides.
Captivating! Not a history buff but this book has intrigued me and I want to know more! A very bittersweet story and speaks to the ability of humans to adapt and survive in horrifying conditions.
I loved this book. Anthony Doer rises to the level of my favorite authors. He has a marvelous grasp of the use of the English language--his writing is brilliant--his characters beautifully drawn.
An amazingly tender love story between two teenagers whose backgrounds could not have been more dissimilar; all during the horrors of World War II. One of the finest novels I've read in a decade.
Captivating and spell binding. I haven't been immersed in such a great narrative since Ken Follett's Winter of the World. Full of beautiful metaphors that capture and question our very existence.
Loved this book.  The short chapters going from one character to the next made me want to keep reading.  The way they finally came together was unexpected as was the ending. Definitely recommend.
Fantastic story.  The characters were well developed and interesting. I couldn't put the book down. The author presented the struggles of Jutta, Werner and Marie-Laure during the war brilliantly.
This book drew me in almost immediately. I was intimidated with its length but before ii knew it  it was over with memories of all the characters swirling in my heart. Highly recommend this book
One of the most enjoyable books I have had the pleasure to read. So special for one who was born in the time of all this conflict making one wonder why wars are really the answer to world peace.
World War II through the eyes (no pun intended) of two young people, one French and one German. Both the story line and the prose are engrossing and have a sense of beauty in the worst of times.
What a fabulous book - so well written - engages the reader fully. Rich in descriptions and portrays a world most of us have not experienced but can feel through the eyes of the lead characters.
The writing was fantastic but it did seem repetitive, especially at the beginning. I am very glad I read it. Was a very graphic image of the war years and how those who lived managed to survive.
One of the best novels I have read in quite a while. Extremely well written and structured. The movement of alternating character events kept one waiting to see how they would all come together.
War is hell..for the children, an abyss of unknowns. And in this most unusual story about Nazi horrors, we feel the pain of Marie-Laure ...we see with her blind eyes. The writing is liquid gold.
I liked the character development and the parallel narratives. Well written and well paced. I felt like I was there with Werner and Marie particularly during the bombing. Definitely a good read.
This novel is amazing. Historically correct and interwoven with both sides of the combatants of WWII, the story line and themes combine to make it a really good experience. Definitely recommend.
Enjoyed the different style of writing...<br/>I didn't give it five star because of how it ends.....I don't care for "cliff hangers" unless it says up front that the book is in a series
Such a wonderful twist on the WWII theme. I loved the rich development of the characters. The plot was excellent and the ending was appropriate. One of the best books I've read in quite a while.
Well written, wonderful story. It brings that era and place to life. And reminds us that war is fought and endured by people, all sorts of just everyday people.  I recommend this book, for sure.
As a fan of historical fiction, and especially WW II, this book talks about France and the devastation there.  Horrifying, compelling, and hopeful all at the same time!  On par with Sarah's Key.
Don't understand why the frenetic jumps over time and back. Extraordinary research into so many disciplines. I am a big fan......hope he has the time and energy to research future books as well.
I think this may well be the most beautiful novel I have ever read. "Beautiful" is not a word one would normally use for a novel; one might say "beautifully written", but it is appropriate here.
It was a powerful story with a little different slant on the lives of those who lived through it.  It was thought provoking and captivating in every way reading a book can be.  Phenomenal book!!
A powerful depiction of the war as experienced by opposing factions.  A very captivating story told through the eyes of children who witnessed first hand the horrors of the that time in history.
Excellent book, I hope a movie is made from the book. Takes place during WWII, lots of history and some little facts I was unaware of. So glad I read this book as I love history in a story form.
The writing beautifully connects the actions of the characters with descriptions of nature. Seems well crafted and researched. The manipulation of time by the story line seems just a bit forced.
Excellent book that captures your attention and weaves a fascinating journey through the voices of a young French girl and German boy during WWII .  A book to be read and reread again and again.
As does a fine wine, this story provides complexity and depth that changes, spreads, and leaves one yearning for more.  Not just for the warm intoxication, but the satisfaction of the adventure.
A luminous, lovely novel. A bit long, but a page-turner nonetheless. A war story, poignant and well-wrought. And a love story--not just the romantic kind, but all kinds. I didn't want it to end.
This author has a way with words that stands the test of time people will be recommending this book a hundred years from now I'm left amazed at this authors talent. Fabulous is an understatement
I liked that the characters found their inner strength to take action in alignment with their beliefs after seeing the results of not being true to themselves.  Good and sad and satisfying read.
I have read many amazing books but this surpasses them all! The imagery was so beautiful, one has not suffered until one has endured the hardships of war!! Wonderful book did not want it to end.
Heroes and heroines; cowards and thugs; a mystery wrapped inside a mystery; the sorrow, heartbreak and loss that comes from war. Brilliantly written; made me want to meet many of the characters.
The story is a true depiction of the tragedy war.  The writing so skillfully portrayed the motivations and emotions of the characters as well the descriptions of the settings. I loved this book.
Beautifully written gorgeous and flowing. The characters are wonderful and the story so magical and tragic at the same time. I didn't think I wanted to read another WWII novel but so glad I did.
This book was griping and intense and suspenseful and inspiring and sad (oh, so sad) and heart-warming and wonderful all at the same time.  I plan to try more of Mr. Doerr's books in the future.
This is an interesting story of two lives woven together by war. Personally for me, there were parts of the book that was dragged down by too many details. On a whole it is an entertaining read.
Amazing book--- lyrical yet intriguing!  Our book club loved it so much we actually all agreed on rating it one of our highest scores--- a highly unusual move in the 20 years we've been together
The best book I have read this year.  Beautifully written, moving, full of interesting and well-developed characters, and historically interesting.  I am so grateful for this reading experience.
Absolutely superb. The story is so strong and there is a life lesson for all to read. I could not put the book down. It is also a good historical insight into life of a Lighthouse Keeper. Enjoy!
Extraordinary and powerfully written, this book is one of the best books I've ever read. Sad, lyrical, hopeful and heartbreaking, it captures the power of love and longing like exquisite amber..
This is the sort of novel that I can pick up and put down but never stop enjoying it. Good summer beach read. The chapters are short which makes it a fast paced read and the story is thoughtful.
A delightful read you won't want to put down.  The author takes you on a gentle ride between characters and between the years, back and forth, forward and backward you go with ease and pleasure.
Wow!  What an awesome writing projecting the life under the control of the Natzi.<br/>Amazing how it makes the reader feel what Jutta felt!<br/>Warning!!!  This book will keep you up at night.
Good read. Story well told through the eyes of two main characters before they meet and interact. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys books taking place during the second world war.
This is easily one of the most well written, moving and emotion packed novels I have ever read, and I read a LOT. Don't hesitate, pick it up, read it, get lost in its perfection and just enjoy.
This book probably encompasses every different view of the Second World War! It was amazing to see how the lives of different people could be tied together in such a intricate and creative way.
I liked how this book was structured, back and forth between the opposite, parallel universes of the main characters and a surprising common thread between them.  This one was hard to put down.
Amazing story entwining extraordinary characters in a way you would never expect. Got more and more consuming the deeper you get into it. Very well written. And a tale you will not soon forget.
An intricate, fascinating, many-layered and brilliantly written novel. The prose is so immaculately written, it seems simple; it is, instead, simply exquisite. I literally couldn't put it down.
this book had me falling in love with the characters. i felt like i was right there with them, suffering with them. this writer started from the end and brought you back to that and i loved it.
This book offered a unique perspective on World War II. It told the story of two children, an orphan in Germany and a blind girl in France. It is masterfully written and impossible to our down.
This is an inspiring read. The tenacity shown by all affected by invading troops and the struggle to lead a "normal life" is very moving. Our freedom is a blessing we must never loose sight of.
This is the best book I've read for some time.  I particularly appreciated Doerr's way of crafting the written word, and the way the writing made me think and consider the meaning of the title.
I would realistically give this 3.5 stars as it was a wonderful read capturing the horrors of war from both sides without huge gore but the last few chapters dragged the story out unnecessarily
One of the best books I have read, the writing is beautiful, the story is engaging, poignant, the characters well developed. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fiction and great writing.
This was a wonderful story full of history, well written characters, and with heartwarming stories of love. Everyone in my book group loved this book and usually we are divided in our opinions.
I often find myself at odds with gushing reviews of prize-Winning novels. This book was selected by my club and frankly I had avoided it. It is beautiful and captured me from the first chapter.
It took me a while to "get into" the book.  Short chapters that are not sequential years bothered me a bit.  I am a big fan of WWII novels and although this is good, I have read better.
What an easy read that held my interest throughout.  When I had to put it down I was anxious to get back to it.  Wish all books were this good.....I would be reading all day and half the night.
The first WWII book that I have read that made me feel what it must have been like.  I have read many others and this one was so well written.  Love the characters.  Wish I could have met them.
This was a really fabulous book -- so good that I immediately had to reread it. You cared about the characters, were kept guessing as to what would happen. I strongly recommend it in every way.
This book is beautifully descriptive. The author transported me to the time and place of the story. I loved the pacing and the resolution of the story. It was one of the best books I have read.
Hard to imagine that there are new things to be said about World War II, but this beautiful and imaginative books does so.  It's not predictable, and it creates its own wholly believable world.
Love the writing in this book, descriptions of people,mollusks,diamonds, days, nights, so wonderful that you can imagine these u ages in your head.  I loo forward to more books by this  author.
I could not put this book down. It's the story of a French girl and a young German soldier and how their lives came together  at the end of the war. The storyline is spellbinding, and riveting.
This is one of the best books ever written...from the development of characters, the structure, the writing, the research, the positive moral statements.  It should have been best book of 2014.
I admire this book a lot--wonderful setup at the beginning and interesting character situations. The author goes successfully back and forth in time as well as between character points of view.
I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the WWII perspective from all of the characters but especially those that were teens and too young and innocent to understand what was going on around them.
Super happy with the fast shipping and quality of the book.  I ordered this as a gift, and the recipient was extremely pleased to receive it.  Can't wait to read this myself.  Thanks very much!
Not only is the story powerful, but it was written in a most intriguing way that it kept my attention every second. Doerr describes feelings and scenes brilliantly. I was spellbound throughout.
The book was slow in the beginning but got better as it went along.  You need to like WWII history to enjoy this book.  Gives good insight on what was going on in northern France during the war
I had a hard time getting into this book. The constant switching back and forth between the 2 main characters was hard to follow at  times. The novel did show what life was like during the war.
A somewhat contrived Holocaust tale featuring two rather unbelievable protagonists. But the story pulls you in and certainly underscores how terrible war and its effects are on ordinary people.
I liked the parallel lives between the two youngsters.  However, I thought their lives would have become more connected than they were.  I guess I expected them to interact more than they did.
From the first page to the last, the author weaves a journey that draws the reader into a journey full of twists and turns that ultimately end with fulfillment of a complex and enthalling tale
Wonderfufl description by author of colors and activities. Presented a sensitive side to both Germans and French,. Excellent read.<br/><br/>Tears. Not a cookie cutter ending. A must read!!!!
One of those books you will think about years later. Something you read Will trigger a ash back relating to what you are doing or seeing in the present. I t is a book that gives understanding.
This was a novel I could not put down. The lives of young people from both sides of war.  The viewpoints and what each character endured created a riveting story though the subject of the war.
This was a very good read, however, I did wonder about some things. Like how could anyone make or carve a whole town so intricately and yet so very small.  All the same I couldn't put it down.
I  cried long before the end..for the beautiful story,  and because I knew it would have to end as it did. Read this book. It will haunt for a long time as you ponder its multilayered meaning.
This novel is engaging from the start. The development and weaving of characters through the years kept driving me to stay up way past bedtime to see what the next chapter unfolded.  Wonderful
A beautifully written fictional story of those growing up during WWII and the German occupation of France.  Heartfelt and poignant, you will be rooting for characters on both sides of the war.
I found it repetitive writing for many chapters. I would have liked more concentration on the little girl. I have it on my kindle - so I don't know how far I am to the end - but I can't wait!!
Took me a while to get into it but enjoyed it by the end. Very skilled writing, compelling story line that unfolds cleverly. Great insights into both French and German perspectives during WW2.
This book was engaging for me clear up to the end.  I love historical fiction.  The author's use of words and imagery made me feel like I was there experiencing everything which was happening.
One of the best novels I have ever read! The author writes that letters become words, and words become worlds, and that is certainly true in this brilliantly written novel. Highly recommended.
I liked this book. It was well written. Good story; however, I wish the girl and soldier could have gotten together earlier in the story. Seemed very well researched as to French WWII history.
This was a captivating story. At times it was hard to follow but overall it kept you interested. This was not a hurry up and read book. It took a lot of thought and it had messages throughout.
Powerful and emotional. Gives you a feel for the loneliness suffered by so many during WWII.  Doerr brings the main characters together while still giving a feeling of their individual plight.
I truly found this book to be inspirational.  Set in the period of WWII, it dramatizes the struggle of the human spirit to survive during this difficult period of history.  A real page-turner.
This novel is a wonderful, sensitive look at World War II primarily through the lives of two teenagers caught up in it.  I loved the character development and the twists and turns of the plot.
I wanted to like this book more, but I did not. Kept waiting for the stories to intersect, but then finally did, it was a bit anti-climatic. It did make me want to see St. Malo, France though!
I bought this because of its recent award, and enjoyed it well enough but didn't connect with it as much as I hoped to.  The writing is good, but there were no passages that stood out as being so delicious you had to say them aloud.  The story is told in short little chapters, which is probably advantageous for the many people these days with attention deficit disorder, but I really like to steep myself in a book, and I think the choppy chapters interfered with that.  For me there was also no "Kaboum" moment when it all comes together, when you realize the larger significance of what you're reading.  There were a few moments that aimed for synchronicity -- the nazi soldier who listened to the old radio shows, the blind girl whose grandfather broadcast them -- but for me it wasn't enough.  Having said that, it was an enjoyable enough read, which is why I give it three stars. I also think it is one of the few books that might make a better film than a novel, as a film would rearrange the scenes to make them chronological (one suspects) and create a little dramatic suspense.
Intriguing look at WW11 through the eyes of a couple of young children, one German, one French, seen from both sides of history.  Slow moving, but the last /14 of the book leaves you hopeful.
Compassionate story of young adults experience of war, could be any war, no matter which side and having little to do with ideology.  The "oh, what he could have done"  sentiment is haunting.
Beautifully written, visually stimulating WWII story. Fast read<br/>and compelling for all ages, especially post war babies. Characters come to life and have much depth. Memorable<br/>read.
Truly enjoyed this multi-POV historical fiction narrative. Poignant perspective on the war. Thought provoking & inventive, with interesting insight on the serendipitous chaos of circumstance.
The author puts the reader inside the minds and emotions of the characters and as the story unfolds the reader becomes more and more involved to the point of not wanting to put the book down.
Singular look at how war affects the lives of ordinary people. Beautifully told with a plot that winds to a crescendo dragging the most interesting characters along for an unforgettable ride.
An amazing story with wonderful central character. It certainly provoked a lot of  thought in relation to how those with disabilities deal with war and disruption. A beautifully written work.
I was captured by these characters right from the start.  The stories that told the personal side of World War II framed the story and the lives who lived it.  I could not put this book down.
A book for those who love the language- full of lyrical word imaging but difficult to read as the theme is war and it's effects. I'd to read something in a different genre by the same author.
Wonderfully told story, gripping and in some chapters, absolutely edge-of-you-chair-exciting.  Highly recommend this wonderful novel about WWll and the people it effected in Germany & France.
Some of the flashbacks got mixed into different time lines and were a bit confusing. The story was interesting and the characters were well developed. Very interesting perspective on history.
Amazing story from the perspective of people caught in such a horrific event: World War II.  We cannot lose the stories and devastating events of this time if there is any hope for the world.
The best novel I read this year. Sensible, thrilling, wonderful. Brings together a handful of subjects I love: music, science, adventure, literature, destiny and the joy of life and learning.
Just plain gorgeous.  The writing is fabulous, the characters human.  Well worth the awards.  It takes a bit to get into with the short chapters, but once you are in, you cannot stop reading.
A spellbinding story of WWII Europe - France and Germany.  The seemingly unconnected souls come together for a somber climax as the war ends and Europe mends - but do the souls?  Captivating!
A beautifully written novel, but not a whole lot actually happened. It's basically a character study in an interesting period setting.  I suppose I just like my novels to be more enthralling.
This was a "page-turner"  Don't read it while you have something very important to do as the book is difficult to put down.<br/>It is absolutely  the best book I have read this year.
Very enjoyable book. I really got into the characters. Was disappointed in ending which was like author decided he was done writing and had had enough. But author probably planned it that way
Enjoyed it very much! Liked the use of parallel stories - moving ever closer to an encounter. Loved the father's teaching of his blind daughter so that she would learn to be more independent.
One of the best books I have read in a while. It is full of suspense and wonder. There are lots of interesting characters who are well described. You really get to know everyone in this book.
A great book! Most was a rich, evocative story but there were what appeared to be some hasty plot twists resulting in an ending that was a little disappointing... But still an excellent read.
Wonderfully written. Definitely had an impact on me. Beautiful characters throughout the novel. In the darkest of times, literally and figuratively, we must remember the light is still there!
I think the author did an excellent job of portraying the personal difficulties experienced both by civilians and soldiers in Europe during World War 2. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.
A poignant study of love, devotion, courage, redemption, and the triumph of the human spirit.  Very well written and a beautiful story of a young girl's blndness and the blindness of wartime.
Spectacular character development; you will fall in love with the people in this story.  I could not put it down, yet I wished I could stay within the pages a bit longer when it was finished.
Great writing meets wonderful storytelling. The plot lines wind together beautifully and tortuously on a collision course sharing the pain of war and the simple beauty of humanity maintained.
After realignment historical fiction novels, this is something a little different. We have a mix of genre's...mystery, action, love story mixed with interesting characters. An excellent read!
This is a gripping novel about people's life during the war. The author explains things in such detail you feel as if you are a part of the story. It teaches many life lessons...a great book.
Exquisitely written, with deep and unique characters, a picture of individual life during the horrors of war and what comes after. Wisdom, love, privation and suffering, agony and redemption.
This story carries the reader through the events with some of the best writing I've read in recent years.  The poetic quality and the insights shared are merged seamlessly with a great story.
this was so well written, I felt compassion for the characters whether they were meant to be hated or loved. such a captivating and lovely story all centered around a tragic historical event.
Anthony Doerr is a masterful storyteller. This is an engaging, insightful look at the complexity of a changing society and its effects on the featured characters in the story. Very well done!
This book is a riveting story that takes place during WWII. The author's craft of writing is breath taking. This is truly a thought provoking book about war and how people are affected by it.
Great book ! Very well written with a wonderful blend of history and characters. From the beginning of the book , you can anticipate the two main characters destiny to meet . Wonderful read !
Totally human perspective of life in Europe during WW11.  How the war personally impacted the everyday citizens and how young men were recruited to Hitler's army. Fascinating and troubling .
This showed how people can be brainwashed, also the greed of humans.  It also gave you an understanding of people with handicaps and how they have to deal with that every day of there lives.
This book was ordinary.  Not horrible but not great.  I read it for book club but I could have put it down at any time and moved on to something that was written better and more interesting.
It was hard to get into and to keep all of the characters in order for the first couple of chapters.  After I got who the people were and where they were placed I very much enjoyed the book.
I LIKE HISTORIC NOVELS, THIS ONE WAS VERY INTERESTING. I THOUGHT THAT SEVERAL STORIES WERE TAKING PLACE AT THE SAME TIME.  iT WAS NOT UNTIL THE END THAT I REALIZED HOW THEY ALL WERE RELATED.
I didn't care for the ending, but it was a great book. Characters and the plot were well developed and thorough! I loved the details, and how attached I became to the characters.
All the Light You Cannot See was enjoyable on every level...mentally, emotionally , and spiritually! I re-read the final chapters several times simply because I did not want the book to end!
I'm about 3/4 of the way into this fast paced book and love this author.  The characters are developed fast but with thought.  I can't wait till they meet each other and to see what they do.
One of the best books I have read this year.  Felt as if I were really getting to know each of the characters and loving each one. Look forward to reading more that Anthony Doerr has written
I would use the descriptive word intriguing, it immediately came to mind.  Also, you get to know the characters and care about them.  Not without sadness, it's realistic.  I enjoyed it alot.
Not only was this a great story, I loved the storytelling craft the author displayed on every page. Not one of my senses was left wanting for details as the uniquely creative story unfolded.
Loved every page of this book and found it a page turner.  Because I lived thru this period of time, the story was especially compelling.  I was not surprised that it won the Pulitzer Prize.
My comment reflects the Audible version.  I began reading this on my Kindle and thought it would be a great Audible book.  Boy, was I wrong.  The narrator was too flat for this kind of book.
I have read too much Non-fiction about WWII to appreciate this I guess. I can't believe he won a prize for this!  There were so many things that did not make any sense that it made me angry!
I loved the story, the language, the imagery the characters that this book brings to life.<br/><br/>It seems to me to be the type of book that would appeal to everyone. I highly recommend.
Once you get used to the back and forth of the story in each chapter, it's really an enjoyable book.  Don't give up on it in the beginning, I almost did.  It turned out to be a lovely story.
A well constructed novel which skillfully combines the stories of two young people through World War II.  Although I thought I knew how the stories would merge and conclude, I was surprised.
This was a great book that I savored.  I normally don't have a lot of patience for a lot of description, but the descriptions in this book were exquisite.  I also cared about the characters.
This should be a must-read for anyone who enjoys fiction. It was completely out of the realm of the type of book I usually read. And I loved everything about it. Characters were mesmerizing.
Great novel once you get used to the literary style of the author and read into the symbolism that is present. Easy to get lost in all the stories that are occurring, but lost in a good way.
wonderful story re  WWII from both sides.  Interesting telling of two young people's experiences which eventually is merged.  No wonder it was listed on the list of books for so many months.
I love this book. It is well written and the plot moves along. I couldn't wait to see what happened at the end, but then was disappointed when it was over because I loved reading it so much.
Beautifully written saga of 2 families caught up in the pre and after war conflict of WWII in Europe. I  highly recommend it . It is a long read but the story is so enfolding you won't mind.
I really enjoyed the characters and the variety of perspectives from such a complicated time.  It was very close to 5 stars based on the excellent historical narrative and interesting turns.
This was beautifully written, but the characters never truly develop. It's chapters are short and bounces around a little too much to really pull you in. In short, I'm happy to have read it.
I love this book. So many stories have been told about lives affected by World War II, but this is a fresh one.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the short, well written chapters, and the shifts in time.
This was a bit more than the usual WWII novel. Engaging characters and plot development. However, I felt the author could have told the same story with fewer pages, therefore the four stars.
The juxtaposition of a young French blind girl and a brilliant German orphan boy as they travel through their childhood and reach young adulthood and their inevitable meeting is enthralling.
If you love historical fiction (especially WWII), you'll love this book! It goes into the characters so fully that you feel totally connected to them and their lives. I highly recommend it!
Man, I was bored out of my skull! I never finished reading it because it was so slow. The majority of the book was details of things that didn't move the story along or intrigue the reader.
Wonderfully written book! The character development is well done and the imagery amazing. The plot is well crafted, the book is engaging and entertaining. The best book I've read this year!
It was quite nice to read a "different" take on WWII and how the lives of the young were affected.  I enjoyed it all the way, and when the journey ended, I wished I could read more.
Certainly deserve the Pulitzer. It is full of surprises and the most beautiful writing imaginable. Like war, it alternates between horror and beauty and the good, great kindness of mankind.
I'm always reading books and once finished think: wow, that was alright. Then off to the next one. This book feels like it made a lasting impression and is worth re-reading many times over!
Too much back and forth between stories of each main character all of which are converging upon each other as the book comes to a class<br/><br/>It was just too much jumping around for me
Interesting juxtapositions in this book.<br/><br/>Lovely characters in the worst of times.  Intriggering how a person's voice can reach out on the radio and forever alter anot her person.
I was hooked from the beginning. This is a touching story, filled with pain, disappointment, joy & remembrance of how life can change in an instant. Highly recommend it. Beautifully written
If you like " Unbroken", you will like this book. While the story lines are very different, they both share the same thing. A very compelling story of suffering and man's ability to endure.
I thoroughly enjoyed this compelling tale of lives overlapping as two souls divided by country and belief systems intertwine, separate and are lost to each other only be rediscovered again.
Enjoyed this book.  I like historical fiction as I'm always learning something new about history.  There are two main characters, and the chapters alternate with their story.  Well written.
Really beautifully written and riveting novel.  The descriptions are so precise, you feel you can "see" the action, which is in itself interesting since the main character is blind.
Remarkable insight into an aspect of the WWII story we have not heard as much about: France's occupation. The characters are complex and fascinating, and woven together with great lyricism.
This book is a masterpiece and a joy to read.  The language of the book is elegant, and the story is so good that there are plenty of reasons to justify reading '... just one more chapter.'
It is a very interesting book.  Haven't read a good page turner in a long time. The second  world war always draws me in.  I guess I just can't believe humanity and the dark side of people.
This book was wonderful! It drew me in, made me like the complicated characters, taught me something... I'm glad I bought it in hardcover because I plan to hold onto it (or pay it forward).
Excellent writing.  It is some what predictable as you know the main characters will need to meet.  And one character needs to be redeemed.  Depressing because war is senseless and useless.
A tale of radio, war, parallel lives told with great care and respect of the words and situations. More touching than expected. Historical references that stir the mind and soul. Excellent.
This book draws you in and holds you tight to the very end. In fact, I'm sad that it's over, but look forward to reading it again. Master storyteller and rich historical details.  Loved it!
The author has great descriptive ability and a wonderful imagination for both wonderful human qualities and deplorable ones. He must have done a lot of research to put together such a tale.
Gorgeously written, and characters that are heartbreakingly real.  I loved the entire novel, didn't want it to end.  The story offered so much insight into a horrifying time in our history.
I especially was attached to Werner since my husband was into radios since he was a small child. The struggles that these people went through was so awful but it showed how people survived.
This author was so creative in how things were described. I loved having multiple stories going on at once so that I could get different points of view throughout the war. Highly recommend.
This is a rare, thought provoking, intellectual book.  There is not just one hero but many.  Who is the villain? I have had a few books that I would read again.  This is one of those books.
A page turner with just enough history to keep history buffs interested. I was happy I read this book. If you like historical fiction, mystery and hint of romance, this is the book for you.
Wonderfully descriptive.  I could see the characters and their surroundings.  Human experiences during a terrible period of history and how we are all connected  if w  look for the threads.
Beautifully written and engaging. The back and forth in time got a little confusing, but worth it for the backstory. You really got to know these characters and cared what happened to them.
Best book I have read in a long time!  I did not want to put it down. The author wove the times, places, people, and the air waves into a seamless story of a very difficult time of history.
wonderful book.....riveting story that winds thru the small chapters......the characters are interestingly portrayed and you get to know them all!  You will love this book from page 1......
I found this book to be about touching relationships,both happy and sad. I did find I had to pay close attention to the dates as the story goes forward,then back. I really enjoyed the book.
LOVED this book!!  Read it with a book club.  Everyone gave it rave reviews.  Interested in World War 11 stories?  This one will keep you reading and wanting more.  Love the Amazon pricing!
Another reviewer has described Doerr's eloquent writing far better than I can; all I can say is that I enjoyed the writing much as the story. The characters fully come to life on the pages.
This book will stay with me for a long time. Doerr's poetic writing and memorable characters will visit me in my dreams. Certainly it is among the best books I've read in at least a decade.
I liked the intricate development of the characters and their devotional attachment to family.<br/>I would recommend this book to anyone interest in historical fiction, particularly WW II.
If you have any interest in WWII, read it-<br/>If you have any interest in families and friendships, read it.<br/>Beautifullly written and a wonderful story of love and hope and endurance
My favorite of my recent books.  Can't wait to discuss it at book club.I found the whole story riveting, whether the blind girl or the soldier and the coming together  I reccomend this book
Beautiful, luscious, compelling!  One of the best books of the year!  Recommend especially to book clubs, but also to everyone looking for a riveting story written with incredible richness.
This novel takes the reader into the soul,mind and heart of all of the characters. It is created by a genius with words. Not to read this book would be one of the big mistakes of your life.
Interesting way to tell a story. Many thoughts going from past to present and then present to past.  The ending left me a little blah but overall was an exciting remembrance of World War 2.
Such a different story on World War 2.  I'm tired of reading about World War 2 but I liked meeting these 2 and seeing things from a different view point in both the characters.  Refreshing.
Two unusual and  beautifully written characters growing up and then caught up the tragedy of war. A different perspective of how WW11 affected two young people and how they chose to behave.
One of the best books I've read all year!  The story is amazing and now I want to visit Saint Malo!  The characters are amazing and the book is a page turner that I just couldn't put down.
Well written story about two characters' s lives that are part of each other. I liked the shorter chapters that alternated for each character as well as changing time from present to past.
I have read a ton of books that center on WWII but this is the best. Beautiful writing, a story so good and one that just gets so inside you you start reading a page a day to make it last.
This book pulls you in and holds your interest. It is interesting how the author alternates between the stories of the vsrious main characters who are seemingly disconnected until the end.
A fun read.  Sensitive treatment of the complexities of the intersection of different cultures made vivid through the lens of war.  Glimpse into the range of feelings of opposing people's.
This is an excellent book, exciting, suspenseful and all the people are interesting whenever they appear.  It won a pulitzer prize and other awards, so the feeling seems to be wide spread!
Beautiful writing. I would definitely recommend reading it, but it wasn't necessarily a page-turner for me--it took me quite a while to finish it. Nonetheless, a great read. Very poignant.
The best book I have read in years.  Did not want it to end.  Can't believe how I got so wrapped up in it.  Not light reading, which I usually do.<br/>This is a great book!  So realistic.
An amazing story told in a brilliant style.  This is a book hard to put down.  I never read books twice but I think this may be one book I could read over and over.  Most highly recommend.
Brilliant, inspiring, informative- one of the best books I've ever read. Books like this make me long for a category division in the historical fiction genre, like non-romantic-literature.
I know most people have raved about this book; I kept trudging through it hoping it would get better - maybe it eventually did.  I was halfway through when I finally said "enough!"
The characters are incredibly believable and memorable.<br/>Werner never really abandons jutta's ideals<br/>The radio transmissions change everyone<br/>Attention to detail is astounding
I had to reread it to understand where the Flame of the Seas went. On the first read it was sort of confusing but it got better towards the end. I really liked it and I would recommend it.
This book brought a different set of characters to me.  This was not  a  war story.  It gave the different reactions of people during horrible circumstances.  A book everyone  should read.
What more can I say than while I was reading this book, it won the Pulitzer Prize for literature.  One of those books that you often stop and reread sections because they are so beautiful.
There are heroes, victims and villains. Sometimes, as in war, there are no clear lines. Sometimes, we are all three. This is a wonderful story of war and it's victims, villains and heroes.
I could not put it down. Two barely intersecting young lives, one French, one German. Two who stand for all the innocence and potential lost to fates they had no part in, for one more war.
Perspectives from a blind French girl and a German boy and how their paths cross during WW2.How the war limits their choices but how they hang on to their humanity despite huge challenges.
Mystical and almost magical in the improbable connecting of characters on all the dimensions that matter...and interweaving the time of war with literature, science and human limitations..
Excellent descriptions of pre WWII and of France and Germany.  Amazing that a blind girl could accomplish what she did and that she could survive so well.  What a wonderful father she had!
Really great story, highly recommend.  Thought it was going to be just another tear jerker WWII book, but touched upon so many issues/thoughts that are still relevant today as it was then.
Kept me reading past my sleep time.  Although it is fiction, I can imagine that these very incidents happened.  Loved that all of the characters had an ending and we weren't left guessing.
Great story, could not put it down. Wonderful historical novel with vivid descriptions of the world warIII events and well developed characters. Would recommend it to adults and teenagers.
Beautiful book, although sad. One of those books that keeps you thinking about them long after you're done. One of those books, you can't wait to continue reading when you have to drop it.
A wonderful book!  The story told from both sides of the war was both interesting and enlightening. We forget that some Germans faced some terrible things too during the course of the war.
what a beautiful book. I hated to let It go.So many different themes so artfully presented. war, love, determination, internal growth. It is a must read if you love a great story well told
I bought this as a Christmas present for half of my relatives. WWII was never as immediate for me as in this book. The ending felt contrived, but doesn't detract from the rest of the book.
One of the my best reads  and certainly one of the best books of 2014 for its outstanding writing and storytelling. Book deserves all five stars and should be on everyone's must read list.
I liked the way the author intertwined the events and lives of the characters. He takes you through separate lives that continue to move toward a central meeting point.  Very well written.
Don't miss this book. To me, not the most cheerful book, rather magical, draws you right in. Good history of what should not be forgotten. Man is a cruel  animal.  But over all, uplifting.
At first I found the structure of the novel a bit trying, as it cut back and forth in time.  But once I got used to it I was able to concentrate on the story.  It was sad, but very moving.
This is a book to read and savor and then think about for a long long time!  So gloriously and poetically written.  I am so glad I saw this book mentioned and ordered it!  A real treasure.
The book was beautifully written.  I would highly recommend  the book.  I wasn't satisfied with the ending of the book, but that doesn't take away from the author's  story-telling ability.
Excellent read. I lost sleep over this book because I couldn't put it down. The story line is so true to life, I could imagine it actually taking place. And who's to say it didn't, really?
It was so vivid and beautiful but sometimes a little difficult to follow especially with multiple lines between dialogue.  I loved the intertwining of stories that came together so nicely.
This is a book I will remember, I love how the past and present and characters were interwoven.  The characters are well developed, and the writing is simple, detailed, poetic all at once.
Good book.  A good read.
Beautiful, moving story.
Great story, weak ending
Slow start, not read all
Excellent book !  Terrible what war does to children and men alike.  We need to cherish our oneness, celebrate our differences as well as the fact we are all so much alike if we only see!
Started this book just before a visit to Normandy.  Great timing!  Found jumping from one time back and then forward a bit challenging to follow at times, but the story was well worth it.
A somewhat far fetched but very captivating story wonderfully illustrating how WWII brought out he best and the worst of human traits.<br/>This great read cost me a few sleepless nights.
More stories of life in Germany as World War II progressed.  What they were forced to endure is unspeakable!  Laura, even though she was blind, stayed strong through those horrible years!
I loved this book and highly recommend it.  I haven't been so taken with beautiful writing like this since the last Steinbeck novel I read.  This is a gifted author and a wonderful story.
Lyrical prose, beautifully developed characters.  A wonderful glimpse into how the German people were conflicted and how the rest of Europe suffered during the war.  Well worth your time!
Very interesting story . The writing style of two stories running together can get a bit confusing at times . Also the two stories do not converge until late in the book and only briefly.
Doerr unspools a beautiful vision amidst the horrific setting of World War II. His simultaneous portraits of a young French girl and a brilliant German boy are heartbreaking and poignant.
Was very deep, powerful, moving .  Left me with very emotional deep feelings to think about, that it really was not that long ago all of this " happened" really makes you think...
Excellent visual images in the creative writing of this book. I enjoyed the character development as there were introduced and followed in the book. A tremendous additional  WWII reading.
I enjoyed this. I can't imagine all that everyone went through during WW II!  The story jumped from present to pAss and back again,which, at first seemed confusing.  But it came together.
Thoughtful book on so many levels - the horrors of war, the non-limitations of a disability, and what it means to be human.  The only book that's made me cry in recent memory.  Beautiful.
I liked this story...took a bit getting used to reading back and forth on the two main characters and their stories but in the end was quite satisfying.  I recommend it but with patience.
The novel is interesting and well written but I found it slow going. Plus I had difficulty feeling any compassion for any of the German characters which reduces character empathy by half.
this book captured my interest quickly.  I hated to put it down when I needed to do something more productive.  Loved the intrigue, the characters, and the sense of what will happen next.
This story will linger in your mind Long after you've read the last word.  Emotional and intellectual exploration of the highs and lows of the human spirit. Take your time enjoy this one.
Anthony Doerr reminds me why I love to read. When you give yourself up to him and let his descriptions and characters inside you, the pleasure is immense and the experience unforgettable.
An impressive look at World War II from the perspective of technically talented German boy and a French girl who must learn to live in the radically changing world after losing her sight.
Interesting and informative story involving a blind French child during WWII and her relationship with a German boy.  This story will capture your attention and provide an enjoyable read.
As an Aussie friend put it so succinctly yesterday upon giving her my verbal review:"It sounds like it just was not 'life affirming'."  Couldn't have expressed it better.  Initally, the author's writing flows easily, and draws one into thinking "what a story teller the author is" - keeping the reader turning pages through all hours of the day and night, but in the end the story falls flat and just fails - including the mystery of the stone whose value could have provided so much good in the end. Each of the main characters had all evolved and were each in a postion to really add value to life and to each other, yet they were either killed off or perhaps worse, end up in a grey zone - just "going through life" not happy or sad, but rather just "existing". Perhaps for Mr. Doerr life is simply a journey to "get through"....hope, happiness are momentary at best.  I believe life holds so much more.  I prefer the hope and promise of life to come opposed to a life whose light will be forever diminished by one's past.
Wonderful book--the author did a marvelous job of switching between times and events. I didn't want the book to end; he helped us to see the dilemmas of the people on both sides of WWII.
This is a marvelous novel.  It was chosen by our book club and the discussion led to an even stronger appreciation for the beauty of the writing and the "can't put it down" plot.
I thought the characters were interesting and I liked visiting their thoughts. The author has a distinct way of introducing and revealing his characters. I really like the writing style.
I highly reccomend this book.  Once you start you'll be possesed by the author.  Story  riveting to all readers.  You'll appreciate having your eyesight .  A very moving story.  Read it!
This book had my attention and would not let go.  It shows all the damage that war brings to the innocent people who suffer through and how a war changes the destiny of those it affects.
I really enjoyed it!  Historical fiction intrigues me.  Reading stories of individuals that lived through times of the past and learning of their perspective is something I really enjoy.
A tale of war, poverty, unconventional families and loss of vision, yet not a tale of poverty of Mind. Unseen waves of sound and sight, always present, lift darkness. Riveting and sweet.
Beautifully written. Just when you think you've read all you can about WW2, this beautiful, poignant novel comes along with a different perspective-haunting, compassionate and brilliant!
This is a lovely and touching story about two children of the Great War and how their lives touch and intertwine despite all the profound ugliness of that terrible era. Not to be missed.
I think this book and a just a few others has touched me deeply in my very soul.  Not a feel good sort of way but how life works out sort of way. This book is a great historical fiction.
I loved this book. I loved the characters: especially those gentle souls that stayed true under the harsh realities of life. I also loved the writing and the way the stories intertwined.
this was a really interesting, vivid read. I really enjoyed it. Gave me an interest in WWII where I didn't have too much of an interest before. Made me hunger to know more about that era
An amazing read!  History told through interesting blend of characters.  A book that you cannot put down, author uses illusions to "light" in the darkest places of the human soul
Brilliant writing, moving, and interesting  I will look for other books by this author.  We should all endeavor to appreciate the light we cannot see, in ourselves  as well as in others.
The best contemporary historical fiction I have read.  Unique writing style such that words and images explode off the pages.  I must go back and start all over again to better savor it.
Did not like the way it eneded but that is life i guess.  So well written I could not put it down.  You could see them coming together but I would like a fairy tale ending of him living.
This is a novel about children who lost their childhood to the war. It takes place in Germany as well as in France. It is a very moving story about love and loss and ultimately survival.
This was a good one. A blind girl, a boy with many questions concerning life and an excess of intelligence, WWII, the Germans - it is a satisfying read.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The story is told from opposite sides of World War Two in an eloquent and fascinating manner. The language is extremely rich and the story sweeps you away.
Artistry with words as an important reminder of life in Europe during WWII. Characters come to life, never to be forgotten. Time switches are a bit challenging unless you read regularly.
This was such an interesting story from so many perspectives. It makes one really think about the good and bad in humanity and the ties that bind us all. It was full of hope and sadness.
A marvelous book, and I found the author's mechanism of telling parallel stories in short chapters very interesting.<br/>And it certainly portrays the horror that was World War II well.
Doerr brought the suffering and the hope of individual people to  reality.  The characters were so alive throughout the book.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Loved it
Great book.  Hard to put down.  Great read.  Loved the story of Marie Laure and Werner and how their lives come together.  Set in France and Germany is WWII.  Highly recommend this book.
This is a story about a girl in France and a boy in Germany during WWII. It is not a typical war story nor is it a love story. Read it for yourself, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
This is by far one of the finest novels I've read this year. It is truly an anti-war novel. It is both brutal and beautiful. The writing gripped me from the very firt line till the last.
What a beautifully written novel!  Great story, characters so richly imagined that they actually come to life.  I am going through several of the stages of grief.....I finished the book!
An interesting look at WWII from both sides.  The characters may be fictional, but the horrors they experienced were very real.  Werner was a German soldier the reader will come to love.
I was looking for a novel that was easy to follow yet captivating and this was it. The author's style is quite beatiful, had to control myself in order to make this novel last me a week!
Beautiful prose. Characters straight from Dickens. Moving. Plots set in world war 2 are not my favourites but the lives of ordinary people kept the plot more than interesting. Loved it!
I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even after having high expectations.  I have recommended it to many friends already as a thoughtful book with beautiful language and characters to savor.
Couldn't put it down - read into the night. At times we find we are in the past but suddenly in the present - a good insight into what it was like to be in WW2 and the nature of people.
I simply did not want this book to end. The changes in time added to the suspense allowing you to get to know each person and the perils of war. The ending was unexpected yet inspiring.
Beautifully written almost lyrical story about an impossible time in history. All the light we can not see in life in the worst of times but can find if we pay attention. Extraordinary.
One of the best books I have read this year.  I didn't think they could do another book about the 2nd world war and it would be great, but Anthony Doerr accomplished it.<br/><br/>Mary
I absolutley loved this book! It was so moving and you could feel the characters really come to life through the Authors words. Excellent read. I highly recommend it. I give it 5 stars.
While the story line was captivating, the skipping around between characters and time periods made it difficult to pick up and read just a bit. Better if you could read it continuously.
I loved this book. The writing style was beautiful and I felt for the characters throughout. I have recommended it to others and we will be enjoying/discussing it in our bookclub group.
Beautiful imagery and characters that become real. Mature, clever, intelligent, emotional and deeply thought-provoking. A testament to the adage that grief is the price we pay for love.
Sometimes books make you think; sometimes they make you ache.  This book does both.  The images and characters will stay with you long after you have finished reading the last sentence.
The language in this book beautiful. The connections between the characters are revealed delicately and serve to give us hope in a world that is at once cold and cruel, warm and loving.
I have read 2 volumns of Anthony Doerr's short stories and really enyoyed them.  All the Light We Cannot See is a different take on WWII and the characters stories were very engrossing.
Very well writen book. I loved the very short chapters.  Anthony Doerr must have done a lot of research about blindness, the war, and the little town where most of the novel took place.
One of the best books I have read in a while!  Great story and not predictable!  I love to be surprised and now know how the book is going to end! It was also nice that it ended well:)!
Ever since I was a clerk in a middle school library, I have liked reading about the Holocaust.  This book was so interesting.  I think 8th graders should add this to their reading list.
very interesting and thought provoking. The story gives thoughtful and emotional insight to WW II from the view point of French and German citizens who might have lived through the war.
One of the year's best novels! Very interesting plot and great, well-formed characters. Some terrifying passages, in which the reader actually begins to feel what it's like to be blind.
I was disappointed in the ending! Liked the short chapters and how the author switched back and forth between the two main characters however.  Liked the historical aspect of the story.
I purchased this as a gift and have not had a chance to read it myself (although I hope to soon).  The recipient told me the book was excellent and I am recommending it on her comments.
Doerr carries U along gently thru the air in this ethereal tale of a brilliant, but frail German boy thru WWII thru radio waves with his blind female French counterpart.  Inspirational!
Beautiful book with beautiful writing.  I understand why this was so highly touted.  Reads fast, interesting twists, and really interesting subplots.  Worth both the money and the time.
One of the best books I have read in the last year. The author draws you into the story's characters that by the end, you feel you may know them better than some members of your family.
What a unique, beautifully written book.  I have just finished it.  I need to digest it, but I suggest reading this book in as few sittings as possible.  There's so much to contemplate.
This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I hated to put it down.......couldn't wait to see where the characters ended up. I will highly recommend this novel to others.
This book challenged my sense of time, I needed to watch the dates to know when things were happening. The book detailed the war through different vantage points which held my interest.
This is a wonderful piece of literary work. The book held me spellbound until the eventful and somewhat disappointing end. Would recommend strongly for anyone interested in WWII history
Must-read this book!!! It was a unique story of a youth in Nazi Germany. Also as you'll in Nazi occupied France. The story has mm any twists....he is talented with radios..she is blind.
Beautifully written story of two young people on opposite sides during WW II. The narrative is wonderfully descriptive with a delicious twist that keeps the pages turning until the end.
Engrossing story.  Beautiful writing.  Believable and likeable characters.  A thought provoking novel of WW II from the view of ordinary people caught up in events beyond their control.
Well-written, interesting view of the impact WWII had on German and French families. Intriguing inter-connectedness, and satisfying resolution. I may explore other books by this author.
well written. great twist with the cursed diamond story. although I'm tired of reading WW2 stories, this one was not terrible, and didn't give me bad dreams. great book club discussion!
The story of Tew incredible people in a very difficult time and Their Journey through life. One was very short but he is living through the memory. It is difficult to put the book down
I loved how the story of Marie-Laure and Werner travelled...rather danced simultaneously....until.....<br/>Perfect for anyone who enjoys historical fiction<br/>Didn't want it to end.
I enjoyed this book. However I found.d it slow and sometimes hard going, in other words, I had to force my self to read it, as it was a book club choice.<br/>I was glad I finished it!
Really interesting story.. Disappointing ending - I expected a romantic connection between them.  Insight into what German youth experienced under the Nazi regime  Enjoyed  thoroughly.
Unforgettable, painful, beautifully written!  The reader experiences what a French blind girl is going though at the same time as what a young German boy is going through during WW II.
It took a while to lay out all the characters but then it flowed nicely and everyone meshed. Great storyline about how good can still occur amongst everything being wrong in the world.
This was a fascinating trip through yesteryear.......the descriptions were vivid and tender.  Great trips through time with flashbacks and forecasts. A new lesson in love and devotion.
Very authentic feel to what it would be like in an occupied country on both sides of the war.  Really cared about the main characters and how they dealt with their fears, loss, trauma.
This story is a poignant look at lives during WWII. It is beautifully written and takes you to where the characters are geographically and on their journey through life and its events.
A very readable, beautiful book. If you enjoyed The Book Theif or The Boy in Striped Pajamas you'll enjoy this book. Told poetically through the eyes of youth on opposite sides of WW2.
I thought this was going to be an amazing read due to all the raving reviews.  I found this book boring, slow most of the time.  It was very difficult to finish.  Read it fit yourself.
Agree with all written.  A remarkably good story that gives great insight into what is was like to be a boy in Hitler's Germany and a girl in Nazi controlled France.  Recommend to all.
Great book, well written, good history about WWII .  Takes place in France. Characters in the story are well developed and very interesting. Both male and female roles are represented.
Beautiful imagery. This is such a heart wrenching and realistic portrayal of a how a young French girl and young German boy survive when WWII invades their lives altering them forever.
Beautiful book about two young people and their struggles during WWII.  Very descriptive and imaginative, sorrowful at times.  Enjoyed reading this book and would definitely recommend.
Marie-Loure is a young girl who is blind. A genius boy named Werner ends up in the German Army. Interesting but hard to follow at times. I skimmed the last of the book. Too many words!
A beautiful story of 2 diverse characters, a blind French girl and a German soldier during World War II.  Well written and developed.  I read it on Kindle but bought a copy for my son.
Having met the author in Stanley,Idaho and own his other books, I was enthralled with his character development in this novel. He has a winner and I hope more to come. Thanks, Anthony!
A beautifully penned story and not at all schmaltzy, which is what I had most feared before I read it. A splendid look at a specific aspect of WW2. Anthony Doerr is a gifted wordsmith.
I like the fact that the author had such a good understanding of the two main children's view of what was going on around them.  Seeing WWII from what they went through was compelling.
I couldn't put this book down!  Could do nothing else but read this for 2 days.<br/><br/>While the tone sounds dark, and tragic situations abound, the overall message is one of hope.
This book was the kind that I couldn't put down at the end, but at the same time was sad to finish. The characters will stay with me long after the book has gathered dust in my Kindle!
It was an amazing book, I loved it. Extremely interesting, you will rarely find yourself bored. Once you get into it, you will not want to put the book down until your done reading it.
5-star, 10-stars, a million stars for this incredibly well written, thoroughly researched book.  Best descriptions, explanations, scenarios ever produced on the day to day-ness of WWII
When a writer has visual control with words for the reader, then the book is written well.. An absolutely enjoyable work that both my husband & I read with the same satisfaction level.
All The Light We Cannot see is one of the most wonderfully  written books I have read.  Doerr's gift of words  lifts the story of an ugly war into a limpid loveliness. I was spellbound
I had to read it non stop, pausing only for routines.  I enjoyed the writing, history and science.  Recommend it to anyone who loves a suspenseful story with well developed characters.
This book took me on an amazing journey visually and emotionally. Tragic, but I couldn't put it down. Great attention to detail and beautiful visual details that captured my attention.
This is a perfect book. The characters, the story arc, the descriptive language, the historical accuracy, the pace, the poignancy - all are in perfect balance. I truly loved this book.
One of the best books I have read in 2014.  Suggest reading Hotel at the Place Vendome first, as it happens, by chance, to set the scene for this one (they are totally separate books).
Wonderful story! Hated to have it end!<br/>Will be reading his other works.<br/>Can't wait for the movie. The book and the movie are and will be better then "The Book Thief."
A beautifully told story, captivating accounts of WW II experiences of two youngsters; a French girl and a Grrman boy who connected before they departed. I can read this over and over.
Great read. The characters were so well developed by the author that they were real to me. Great story that I highly recommend to anybody who likes reading WW2 novels or anything else.
A wonderful but sad story of world war two. A story of courage in adversity. Perseverance and love between family and perceived enemies. Well written and I share the story with others.
I enjoyed this read.  Very clever telling it by eyes of a blind person., and from the innocent people that had to endure the war.  Would reccomend to anyone who likes historical books.
One of the best novels I have read in recent years -- beautifully written and sensitive portrayal of the horrors of World War II.  A gripping story -- you won't be able to put it down.
I really enjoyed this book. I like WWII stories and this one was a very different perspective that of 2 kids in different countries who eventually cross paths.  This was a page turner.
What a depressing book!.  Since I found it on my doorstep, I read it,  but so sad....would like to read something by him, in a less hopeless book, because this was extremely wellritten
I recommend this book. It is well written, has some historical value and doesn't get boring even when nothing is happening. I enjoyed it and will look into another book by this author.
A wonderful book. There are so many books written about world war II, but I loved the different perspectives in this one, especially the young german soldier.  It was all so believable
Beautifully written story.  I could not put it down! The characters all merge together in an intriguing mixtures of sadness, longing, gear, hope and love. I jgihly recommend this book!
I enjoyed this book very much. Excellent character development. I feel like I knew them. The story was well told and I loved the back and forth of time and people. Hated to see it end!
Author carefully tells the tale of how the lives of war time enemies intertwine and profoundly influence each other even when they play the roles expected of them of their countrymen.
Beautifully written. This book is for sure a new favorite of mine. After I have finished reading it, I still am thinking of characters and their stories.  I highly recommend this one!
Very interesting story with unknown details about the War but too many changes in time between past and present which makes it difficult to grasp the chronology of the story at times.
I liked how each character was developed and introduced then woven together to create a picture. I was profoundly touched by the experience the characters had each having a unique perspective.
Loved the story...the heroics of ordinary people.  The author managed the plot and characters well to bring everything to a big crescendo at the end.  Very suspenseful and satisfying.
No spoilers here. I loved the book for many reasons: the time and place, the well-developed characters, and a believable storyline. Overall, it was one of my favorite reads this year.
I listened to this on Audible, but am impelled to get the hard copy.  The writing calls out to be read and re-read, such is the quality of the language.  It is also a wonderful story.
Beautiful writing, multi-layered story, interesting history.  A little slow to begin,developing the characters, but absolutely stunning middle to the end, Can't wait to see the movie.
This book kept me reading.<br/>If you like war/ history/ books then this will fit the bill. I'm glad I read this book and wanted the characters to continue after I put the book down.
This is such a beautifully written, thoughtful book. It shows how lives are intertwined and how ones actions have ramifications long after they occurred. I highly recommend this book.
Wonderful characters,symbolism,prose.  Good to know strong writing still exists.  In a time when anyone with a pen can  publish and call himself a writer, it's a relief to find a gem.
This tale is so well told that I sense the author was hesitant to let it go. The elegent words float on the story and lives like the souls there whether one believes so or not. Bravo!
This is a well written, well told story that I read into the wee hours of the night until I was too tired to keep reading.  I highly recommend for any and every age and gender. Bravo!
Symphonic writing. Doerr writes by interweaving themes with counterpoint and on multiple levels. The complexity is wonderfully presented and leaves the reader with much to contemplate.
Beautiful book, superbly written and difficult to put down. A "must read" and with it comes a flood of memories never to be forgotten. The futility of war is brought to stark reality.
Captivating story of a French family caught up by the Germans in WWII.  It's a hard book to put down, especially at bedtime when it's time to turn off the light!!  A real page turner!
Very well written book. It was sometimes difficult to keep all the characters' plots in mind as they came together. Really good images created by the writing. I felt like I was there.
A deep,feeling, often poetic insight into war, blindness, and the struggle between good and evil, innocence and barbaric reality.  A must read for anyone from the post war generation.
A story of a blind French girl, a German orphan and how their paths cross during World War ll. The prose is so beautiful that I found myself re-reading many parts throughout the book.
This was an amazing WWII novel about three children, one in France, the other two in Germany, and how they all connected at the end. I would recommend this to anyone. Excellent story!
A slow read... But one that when finished, you can't help but feel a sense of longing for the world he created in his characters as their lives intertwined with the impact of the war
Wonderful descriptions that make the story real. I appreciate that the author tied up all the loose ends and finished the story. I had a very satisfied feeling at the end of the book
I absolutely loved this book ! It kept my interest on several levels. The locale both Paris and St. Malo are places that I have visited more than once. The story kept me in suspense.
A good, solid novel of World War II that hints of Steinbeck's The Pearl. Perhaps overly long for this kind of novel; the last 100 pages or so feel like filler. A good book club book.
Terrific story, beautifully told, most in present tense, which draws the reader in with description of events of the second world war from very personal viewpoints of opposing sides.
Anthony's writing is excellent. The history in the novel, i.e., occupied<br/>France, was very meaningful. Not difficult to understand the authors<br/>winning of the Pulitzer Prize!
Beautiful story.  Anthony Doerr writes so vividly.  I felt like I was actually in the story.  It's a story that shows the goodness and evilness in people, but that love is strongest.
Beautifully told story which illuminated the many hardships endured by Europeans during World War II, while also illuminating the power of the human spirit to triumph over adversity.
I would have given the book a 5 star , for it was very well written, but it was so depressing with so little hope. The only thing that kept me reading was my hope for the characters.
Excellently written book. A unique insight into the lives of characters in the Second World War on both sides, particularly France and Normandy. Engrossing, with a captivating plot..
I have read this a second time for a new book club. Such detail and warmth conveyed about such a difficult time and the passage of time. This is a wonderful story and I recommend it.
Drop everything and read this book. It is tightly written. Plot,  characterization, and pacing are masterfully done.  It is deservedly #1 best seller-- I predict it will be a classic
I loved this book. Really short chapters makes it easy to pick up where I left off. Love the way it is written and flows. Follows two main characters, making it easy to follow along.
I found it Intriguing that the German youth Pfennig saw through the Hitler realm for its insensitivity to human life after his-encounters with his German friends and French captives.
Doerr tells this story with beautiful language and somehow made me want to read on despite the tragedy and loss he describes.  If you like historical fiction, this is worth the read.
This is a beautiful novel, well-written and interesting subject - a 12 year-old blind girl in Germany opposite a German boy who is inducted into the Reich. I thoroughly recommend it.
I quickly understood why the author was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for this book. It is an enticing read from the moment it begins until after it ends. Well worth the time. Loved it!
Nice writing style. Loved the two main characters  the book held my interest although it didn't quite go where I expected. The ending felt a bit flat but otherwise highly recommended
A beautifully told tale set during a terrible and horrific time. Anthony Doerr captures love, hate, loyalty, cruelty, sensitivity, power, greed, and the strength of the human spirit!
Such a beautiful story of love and the horrors of war.  The character development helps move the plot along and you can't help but be drawn into the story by them.  A very good read!
This is an excellent book.  I enjoyed the author's craft in pulling the themes from different characters together.  I've read WWII a stories before, but this was one of my favorites.
One of the best novels I've read about WW II  in a long time. Beautifully written. Difficult to put down while wondering what was coming next. First time I have read a work by Doerr,
I laughed and cried. Such rich history and what a story! I usually read murder mysteries so it is unusual for me to read something like this. I will certainly recommend it to others.
Beautifully written and constructed novel about the fate of Saint-Malo in France during WW2 through the lives of two extraordinary children. Made my top 5 list of best reads of 2014.
This is an amazing angle from the eyes of two children to see the impact of WWII.  So well written and the characters grow on you so that it's hard to put down.  Highly recommend it.
Loved the writing and the story.  Felt like I was there and experiencing it along with the characters.  Lots of WWII stories but this is unlike others I have read.  Hard to put down.
I am sorry to say this was not one of my best reads although I stuck through it  until the end it was hard going I found it a very sad read ,  I will not be reading this author again
Great book about a era that deserves more attention. You get to see the war from two sides from the perspective of two reluctant , innocent participants. I hated to see the book end.
What a wonderful story about a time when Germany was in such turmoil. So well written. I had a hard time putting it down. Will definitely watch for anything written by Anthony Doerr.
This novel revels goodness in people even in the most horrific situations.  Very difficult to read especially since have read a lot about Hitler's reign of terror.  Was well written.
This novel was very well written. It takes you to places far away and times long ago and makes them seem real. The attention to detail and the description of emotion was exceptional.
If this book was 200 pages shorter, I may have given it four stars. The author is extremely long-winded in telling his story. Many reviewers praise his prose with all its poetic imagery. Mr. Doerr is an excellent writer but I didn't care for his particular kind of writing when he would go off the deep end in metaphors that didn't always carry any meaning. However, there were wonderful moments of creative writing throughout especially when he wrote about Madame Manac, Marie-Laure and her father and great uncle. I loved all the stories and chapters about them but all the chapters regarding Werner and his German cohorts were boring. Certainly the ending was a great disappointment as it began to end for so many more pages and so many more years. I was expecting so much more after investing so much time in reading this well-regarded novel. What exactly was the author trying to say? Something not very enlightening. That goodness has the potential to dwell in each of us. Yes, this was an overlong story to convey this message.
Sad to say I cannot give this book a better rating.  The initial part of the book was interesting and superbly written.  I felt drawn in by the two stories of the main characters growing up during World War II ...although so different, so alike in many ways.  I knew at some point they would come together and I assumed the author would make a wonderful ending surrounding this.  SPOILER:  Not so......they do not come together until page 400 and  are together for less than 10 pages. The German soldier later relates he thought Werner was in love ...... there is not enough in those 10 pages to lead to that.  The main characters needed more time together to make this a truly good book. Why did the author build us up so much only to let us down in the end?  The father was so much a part of the girl's life and the story but the ending simply says he died in prison.  The last few chapters of the book just seemed like an afterthought ..... like the author ran out of steam at the end of 10 years....a very anticlimatic ending.
I came to see everyone in the fullness of their being. I wanted to know how they lived out their lives. By the end I understood that every life contains so much light we cannot see.
I LOVED this book!!! The story held me captive all through. Tense at times, and always wanting to know what was going to happen. Well written..I would definitely recommend this one!
The book is built upon characters that I have not normally encountered during WW2. In my mind it was good to observe the similarities of Nazis and Isis.<br/>Touching and reverting!
The best book I've read in many years.  Having had a dear friend who survived the occupation of Holland, it was especially interesting.  I hated seeing the amount of pages decrease.
This is a beautifully written book.  The language is gorgeous and the story holds the reader through to the end. I appreciated the intimate look at the lives of people in war times.
Phenomenal, evocative, important book. I started it while in Normandy so the events rang especially true, but even without a feel for the locations I would have loved it. Beautiful.
I was afraid I would not like the book, that it was going to be much add and no substance, but I was very pleasantly surprised and very thankful to have read such a wonderful jewel.
Excellent book. Liked the way the story line developed. Could hardly put the book down. A bittersweet story in a backdrop of German occupation of Paris and its countryside in WW II.
Once I started reading this book I could not stop.<br/>The language is beautiful and the descriptions vivid enough to taste smell hear and feel.<br/>A new favourite in my library.
Sorry, but there isn't an option to rate at half stars.  A really good book, but not quite a 5 star in my opinion.  Wonderful blend of personal story plus the history of the period.
All the Light We Cannot.See.is.beautiful and moving on so many levels. It is an.account of the.German occupation of France.during.World War II, but it is so much more. It is the story of love of family, loyalty to country, dedication to meaningful work, and a constant search for the light, wherever it may be.  It reads almost like a memoir, but one told from the points of view of several main characters as it bounces back and forth between what is happening to Marie-Laure, a blind French girl, her museum locksmith father, her shell-shocked uncle, Werner, the young German engineering prodigy, and his younger sister Jutta.  Every time the author returns to one of these characters, he reveals another layer of depth and complexity, often surprising the reader in the process.  As we slog through the trials of World War II with these characters, we often long for a simple, happy ending, but life -- and literature -- are rarely that predictable.  Engrossing historical fiction that is well-worth the time it takes to read it.
Beautiful prose.  Difficult to put the book down.  The author developed his characters so vividly you can almost picture them moving across  the pages I didn't want the story to end
Beautifully written, great storytelling, and thought provoking. This is why I read books. The pure joy in wonderful words. I highly recommend this to all historical fiction friends.
Incredibly well written and researched.<br/>The plot is addicting and the writing is mesmerizing.<br/>One of the best things I've read in a very long time.<br/>I'm sad it's over!
Read two thirds of the book last summer and couldn't finish it.  Read it again for book club and really enjoyed it.  That taught me a lesson----about making judgment calls on books.
Didn't end the way I'd hoped it would but still glad I read the book. Writing is more flourished than I am used to and therefore took me longer to read than books I normally choose.
What a great story.  I love historical fiction and this will be one of my favorites.  I enjoyed how it gave the reader a look at the War from various points of view and perspective.
Very compelling.  Could not put this book down.  So many books have been written about the human condition during WWII, but this one has a totally different set of issues and ideas.
Amazing story, and so well written. It's not a page turner, but the language and word choices compel you to want to read every word- no paragraph skimming here! A story to remember.
My dad was a crew member of a B-17 bomber that flew over Europe. He never talked about it. I wish I could talk to him now. It is a history lesson about people not so much about war.
A great story beautifully written. If you have a passion for the written word, this book is for you. The author does such a great job with description I felt like I was really there
A blind girl's love for her father and his protective love for her results in a German soldier finding her, looking past their political differences and dying for her. Awesome book.
This is my favorite book of 2014. The writing was superb and the story unforgettable. Stop reading the reviews and download the book on your Kindle now. You will not be disappointed
The author must see things that most of us cannot.  Then somehow he puts them into words so the reader can see them also.  A humbling and extraordinary experience.  Very, very good.
Painstakingly and flawlessly crafted. Heartbreaking and uplifting by turns. Not light reading but highly enjoyable. For serious readers. Deserving of all the praise it has received.
Very good book just heart breaking to read. I loved that the book did a full coverage of the characters to the present. Did not leave us wondering about their lives, except for one.
Pure poetry!  So well written it must have been channeled from above. .. liked the blend of horizontal and vertical story building. . It truly wove the story together. A must read!!
This book is outstanding, the writing is masterful. The story that was woven together in unexpected and beautiful ways is hard to stop thinking of long after I turned the last page.
the story so incredibly well done wanted to pull me faster to the end than I was prepared to do as it was so beautifully written I did not want it to end.  My best read of the year!
one of those books you remember reading for a long time. Character development is excellent, contains suspense, at times heart rending descriptions of violence but not put downable.
So enjoyed reading this book.  It is very heartfelt, beautifully written and gave me a very different perspective on the World War II period in Europe.  I highly recommend the book!
As others, I've heard the rave reviews of this book. It is beautifully written. However that is where the praise stops for me. Towards the latter half of the novel, we start getting odd jumps in time--the story jumping forward, backward, from one character to another...and then there is no resolution, no closure. I don't know if this is artistic license to illustrate how those that suffered during the war never got closure, or if it's just poor planning. The two ladies at the end, perfectly poised to wrap everything up...and yet they don't. Frederick's story feels very much like a random tangent that has no point. Some characters are introduced and worked up, and never developed much beyond that. There are a lot of what feel like loose ends, their "endings" feel like they were just put there to say they ended. I didn't love this. I've made the mistake in the past of forcing my way through a novel because of rave reviews and critical acclaim, and I just didn't like them. This is another for that bookshelf.
Written extremely well.
Excellent, a must read!
Magical; heartbreaking.
the most boring book I've ever read.
I really enjoyed a fresh vantage point of a World War 2 account.  I was enchanted by the spirit of Marie-Laure and conflicted for Werner.  It was an informative and enjoyable read.
A really good, well written story.  The book flowed and was enjoyable.  The theme of the blind girl put a new perspective not only on the war but life lived with such a disability.
I just really didn't love this book. Read it for a book club. I like the characters but the ending left me with meh. Sort of the same feeling I had at the end of the movie Titanic.
A touching account of how war devastes common lives. Written masterfully as the novel weaves through the lives of a blind girl and an orphan soldier on opposite sides of the fence.
This is a wonderful book showing how people were effected on both sides of those in the 2nd World War.  If you are a reader, or not, you will enjoy this book, keeps your attention.
Pulitzer Prize well deserved.  A riveting story that kept me page turning well into the wee hours of the morning.  I highly recommend that people don't let this story pass them by.
Wonderful book. Follows the lives of several characters who you become engrossed with. Not all happy as the story takes place during the end of WWII but kept me reading to the end.
Really enjoyed this book - we'll built characters and plot.  Interesting from a historical perspective.  Fascinating to understand WWII from both the French and German perspective.
Wonderful, heart felt book.  Could so identify with each character and their situations.  Would highly recommend it but only if you have time as it is extremely hard to put down!!!
A lyric story that puts personal faces and stories into one of the most pivotal historical events of modern times. Beautifully written. One of the best stories I've read this year.
Amazing story of a blind girl at a very chaotic time in the world.  Gives a very good feel for people both Germans and French, rich and poor, young and old at that time of history!
This is a beautifully written story.  I started a little slow but then I could not put it down.  I learned a lot about the ordinary people behind the scenes in a major world event.
Excellent book and learned a lot about what the French and German civilians went through during  WWII. A slow beginning but hard to put down half way through! I would recommend it!
Very engaging. Likable characters. The shift between time periods before and during the war helped create suspense. Enjoyed the short chapters that focused on different characters.
Heart-breaking and horrific events of WWII Europe line up perfectly for a luminous moment in time when two young people cross paths just in time to save each other. Gorgeous prose.
It is a well written and delightful srory intermingling a inquisitive German orphan and a blind French girl with the historic bombing of St Malo France during the 2nd world war !!!
It was a good book Kept you interested all the way through. Good character development. I didn't give it 5 stars as I got a little confused as to where the diamond really ended up.
Wonderful story; masterful weaving of story lines,  characterizations, and suspense; leaves the reader with just enough questions to make it intriguing; a touching, powerful story.
I REALLY LIKED THE BOOK ESPECIALLY AS I GOT TOWARDS THE END.  SOME THOUGHT MIGHT THINK IT DRAGGED ON TO LONG AND SEEMED BORING AT TIMES.  I REALLY LIKED IT SO I GAVE IT FOUR STARS.
A quiet, but gripping story.  A beautiful portrayal of living with physical blindness while seeing so much.  I couldn't get to the end soon enough, then was sorry when it was done!
This is a wonderful story, and St. Malo is on my list of places I want to see.<br/>The ending was a little too "tidy" for me, but I still would highly recommend this book.
One of the finest novels I've read...ever.  Doerr tells this gripping tale with intelligence and emotion using expertly written prose. This story was hard to put down.  Five stars.
Anthony Doerr is a marvelous wordsmith. Engaging and poetic, the narrative of the lives of a blind French girl and a young German soldier was difficult to put down. Excellent read!
This is not the kind of book I would usually read, but the story captured my interest very quickly. It isn't an easy story to read, but then it is about a terrible time in history.
A beautifully written book. Very easy to determine which antagonist was the focus!!  I am a sucker for a happy ending. Still I 'm not sure I got it  a little long. But I LOVED IT,!
Interesting, sensitive, beautifully written.  Doerr's characters try to find their way in a world gone mad, each touched by the mysterious musical broadcast from an unknown source.
Gorgeous, dense details fill this historical fiction about Germany and France during WWII and the ways we are all connected. The characters and their stories will break your heart.
it is entertaining and easy to follow. Having seen the story line of the two main characters develop together really makes you wonder about your own interactions with other people.
I never even finished it, I really tried but it was getting so tedious. My brother had seen how highly recommended it was so we both read it this summer and were both disappointed.
I've never read read a book so compelling it's like you were in saint malo yourself and could feel how anthony doerr describes everything in it. Can't wait for his next masterpiece
Absolute heaven!  Re-read several lines. A book to settle in to and savour.  The story is masterfully told creating a crash collision of characters in a world beyond their control.
A wonderful story. I couldn't put it down and was so sorry when the book had ended. I went on Facebook to recommend it to all of my friends. You won't be disappointed in this read.
Well written with detailed character development. A bit long and sometimes tedious, I am glad I chose the audio edition. An insight into the lives affected by the Second World War.
I just finished reading it. I almost gave up on it, couldn't get into it initially. I persevered and still had a hard time getting into it. The time periods flipped flopped a bit and it was confusing. I did a lot of skimming and skipping just to get through it. I am surprised it got 4 and 5 stars. There are a lot if interesting tidbits about WW2 and how they lived and survived back then. It was interesting too how  Marie -Laure , the blind girl adapted to her surroundings. The end fell flat  for me. I don't get what happened to the Sea if Flames- that unusual diamond- that was pretty pivotal throughout the entire story. I wouldn't recommend this book, but obviously it's a personal taste as many have read this and really loved it!
The narrative contrasts were effective; museum setting vs training camp for Nazi youth, poor children vs the elite, etc. The tension of the story kept me involved and sympathetic.
I commute 2 hours on the train each day, so I read a lot. This is one of the best novels that I've read in a long time. Rich characters with and interesting and suspenseful story.
Very well written.....able to keep reader's interest due to suspense author builds all through book....had to have done a tremendous amount of research which shows in his writing.
I honestly don't know what I was expecting, but it really is an incredible book full of twists and turns, and it's impossible to not get highly invested in it. I highly recommend.
It took me a while to get into this book, but well worth the read, and time. Wonderful story of war, perseverance, and bravery told through an unexpected and unique point of view.
was beautiful at times but i did find some of it quite boring for me the nightingale was more absorbing - i found the characters were interesting but it was all too lyrical for me
Even if you've read 50 WWII books, you need to read this one,  the writing is beautiful and the story is completely different than anything you have read before. A beautiful read.
Excellent read. A well written heart rending drama of historical fiction. Seemingly real people involved in the horrors of WWII and its aftermath. I'll try another by this author.
Beautifully written, compelling characters.  This book give the reader a new sense of life during WWII and how politics and circumstances bring people to make good or bad choices.
This is the best book I have read in years.  I was sorry that it ended.  The descriptions, the style of writing and the characters were fagnificent.  Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous.
Eloquent, powerful, moving. I didn't want it to end. The characterizations are beautifully rendered and absolutely believable, and the plot structure remarkable. Incredible read!!
Sometimes I would come across a sentence and be blown away by how well it was written. I would go back to re-read something just for the pure enjoyment of how well it was written!
Having just returned from St. Malo, Paris, and the Normandy beaches, the book had great connections for me.  There was not great happiness but there was always hope in this story.
One of the best books I have ever read. Not just plot and character development, historical perspective and coming of  age in WW2, but beautiful poetic prose. I cannot say enough.
This is an extraordinary book! I am a retired English professor and I was mesmerized. Anyone interested in seeking to understand war and the human condition should read this book!
The prose was exceptional and communicated the sights, sounds, tastes, smells which made it worth reading. The last few chapters seemed disconnected but perhaps that was intended.
What's to say that has not already been said?  Every page of this story is fascinating. This is a book that I will reread.  There's  just too much to think about on first reading.
A wonderful lesson in history and humanity. Anthony Doerr's storytelling is riveting and enthusiastic. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this book and recommend it to everyone
Loved this book. Shows some of the horror the young people suffered during that awful war. The courage  and bravery were amazing. Highly  recommend this book. Kudos to the Author!
This book is a reminder of the human toll taken by all those who live through war: men, women, and children. In the end the author offers us hope and the promise of enduring love.
Difficult to keep characters in focus with all the back and forth chapters. Great descriptions, especially in regards to father and daughter and how they coped with her blindness.
One of those books you can't put down.  Beautifully written with an insight to WWII from a very different perspective.  I hope it will be a movie as this is a story worth telling.
An extremely well written account of WWII as seen through the lives of a German boy and a French girl.  They travel parallel worlds which intersect only briefly then spiral apart.
I loved the way Doerr wrote this book.  The story is sad but I knew it would be since it's about World War 2.  I can't remember reading a book that was so insightful about people.
This was the best book I read in 2014.  So beautifully written!  A wonderful, original story that captivated me more with every page.  Perfect for book clubs or private enjoyment.
I loved this book.  The character development is fantastic.  The story reminds us of the millions beautiful of lives that were and continue to be altered from their paths by war .
I didn't want to read another WWII book but had heard this was excellent, so I decided to give it a try.  Wow...what a writer.  I immediately purchased another book that he wrote.
A good WWII novel that makes you feel you are there and portrayed the most wonderful, unforgettable story of how the these people came together.  This writer weaves quite a story.
A light, quick reading.  Nicely done story.  Self determination, discipline and Faith are the themes.  The story again demonstrates a loving and caring GOD without a doubt exists.
Beautiful prose and endearing characters in a wonderfully interesting setting.  Perhaps 100 pages too long, and the ending is a bit anticlimactic, but still an intriguing journey.
While there is no shortage of books about WWII, this novel is unique. Well written with well developed characters and a captivating story. I was saddened to finish it. Great read!
Great book!<br/>  Couldn't put it down.  Stayed up till 2 am to finish it.  Wonderful character development, plot, and view of how children on both sides were affected by World War II.
It took a while to get into the story but then I became really invested in the lives of these two young people and their differing experiences during the World War II time period.
One of the most beautifully written novels I have ever read. This must have been a labor of love. I am in awe of such incredible talent and grateful that he undertook such a task.
I loved this novel. Could not put it down. I loved the way the author wove the stories of the lives of the boy and girl together, slowly bringing them together.  Amazing writing..
Heart wrenching simple story of people's lives that magnifies how terrible and unspeakable war is. What it does to cities, our surroundings but most importantly to people's lives.
Given all of the media hype surrounding this novel, I would describe it as "much ado about nothing."  The is a story that frankly should have come out some 20, 30, 40, or even 50 years ago. The time period alone never fails to invite another writer who wants to capture some special story with either the Holocaust or World War II serving as the backdrop and it grows tiresome. How many fiction books have been written having to do with this specific time period?  And the story itself is very slow.........Matter of fact, if you're the type that makes a decision by page 50 on whether or not you will continue to read a book, then you will most certainly drop this one. It just takes too long to develop and I grew bored with it. The writing style is impressive overall but not enough to have kept me intrigued. I struggled to finish it. I don't think it all merited the Pulitzer prize.  I'm already trying to remember it since I last read it about four months ago and I've already forgotten 90% of it.
Really enjoyed the characters and the history.  Sometimes the chapters seemed too short and jumped back and forth between the characters too much but overall I really enjoyed it.
Beautifully written. This is not my usual genre choice, but I was more than pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this novel. Excellent book. Would highly recommend.
A beautiful and powerful narrative of lives swept up by WWII.  Werner, the young German, and Marie-Laure, a blind French girl live in parallel worlds that intersect dramatically.
Told almost like a fairy tale complete with monsters, the Nazis, menacing everyone we care about, this novel still conveys exquisite beauty and ultimate satisfaction for the soul.
A well written book from a different perspective of those who have to grow up and fight a war at the same time. Sad and touching and revealing and most of all, a well woven tale.
Well written and graphic in it's message of the consequences of war, yet it shows the strength of spirit in the participants and their inner desire to do what's right. Good read!
Masterfully crafted.  However, for today's reader of current writers, we get impatient with slow plot development and complex time shifts.  Certainly Doerr is an artist of words.
An entrancing novel set in France during and after the German occupation. The stories are powerful the characters unforgettable the descriptions poetry.  I didn't want it to end.
I really enjoyed this book - first book I've read by this author, but it had a good storyline, and was easy to follow the switching back of forth from current to past timeframes.
Superbly written. The history of children being prepared for Nazi Germany in WWII; their feelings, thoughts, beliefs, friendships and manipulations. Could not put this book down.
Doerr is able to describe the characters in meticulous detail. I felt I was walking beside Marie, taking in every word of Papa. History, love and tragedy in a way that binds you!
I absolutely loved this book.  Beautifully written, fast-moving, painful and poignant, each character longs to live out their dreams.  Set in war-torn Europe during the Nazi regime, I was right alongside each of the characters.  One of the most compelling and moving books I have read in a long time.
This book is amazing.  Has to be one of my all time favorites.  It is so beautiful and poignant and sad and hopeful.  This is a must read for anyone who likes historical fiction.
Beautiful, haunting in a good way, with plot twists and turns and characters you fall in love with and want to protect. I haven't stumbled across a book like this in a long time.
Unlike the author, I find it difficult to put in words the excellent review  it deserves. The characters so real, I find myself thinking about them even after finishing the book.
Two teenage children try to survive the terrors of war in parallel struggles, one French and one German. The characters are memorable, for either their beauty or their brutality.
Story was interesting but too gritty, and probably too real for me.  Others would probably like it better.  It was well written, I just didn't care for much of the subject matter
I loved this book.It was so beautifully written. The two lives of a sensitive blind girl and brilliant young boy during WWIi was told with compassion.  Highly recommend this book
Anthony Doerr's writing is captivating.  If you're a fan of historical fiction, then you simply must read this WWII book. The character development kept me captivated throughout.
Set in Paris in the 1940's and told through the eyes of a blind girl, this book is a treasure. I loved it and hated for it to end.  Do yourself a favor and read this lovely book.
It was very good and quite informative.  World War 2 destroyed many lives and changed the world forever.  This book is another example of the effects of the war on young people..
Great story.  Author is very descriptive and makes you feel like you are right there with the characters.  Story is very compelling and ending brought it all together.  Loved it!
It is very well written and very interesting. Of course it is extremely dark. I'm ready for some levity. It is written with lots of character development and I enjoy more story.
Excellently written story of young boy and girl growing up in the WWII years.  Relish the rich words and phrases constructed to entertain the reader.  Good from start to finish.
Brilliantly detailed, easy read, superb writing and storytelling...love the short chapters, as well. Makes the characters truly come to life. One of my most favorite books ever!
Absolutely loved the book . A nail biter towards the end. Hated the cruelty, however in general  the writing is wonderful, sensitive and descriptive. I definitely recommend it .
The characters are wonderfully drawn. The plot draws you in and holds you. I did not like he use of flashbacks so much. Brilliant portrayal of the horror and uselessness of war.
A wonderful recommendation by friends and book club members! Mr. Doerr has a marvelous imagination and draws the reader into his content in a unique way. A page turner for sure!
The book was well written and it was a captivating story. It took me a while to follow the changes from one event to the next but as I continued my reading I was able to adjust.
Great character development, adventurous fast moving plot that held my interest throughout the whole book.  I hated to see it end, but liked how the author tied it all together.
This book is fantastic. I read it in in two days, I just could not put it down until I reached it's conclusion. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fiction.
This was picked by my book club.  One of the best I have read.  Such a touching story set during WWII of two lives that cross paths.  One from France and the other from Germany.
The book was inspiring, while being realistic to great hardship of World War 2. The characters were interesting and made me feel like I should appreciate what I have a lot more.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I read it with a book club and it lent itself well to discussion. Every member of the club agreed it was a book they would definitely recommend.
Really really good read. I do read a lot of 'fluff' but this book you could lose yourself in. I would tell any reader that this is an excellent book to<br/>sink your mind into.
The kind of book you want to re-read just to read the wording again - I kept going back to re-read paragraphs because his writing is so beautifully descriptive.  Good story too!
Highly Recommend!!the author writes in such a way that one feels one knows each of the characters.Doerr,s use of language is fabulous - so many thoughtful metaphors and similes.
This book was chosen as the January selection for our book club. Intensely visual, physically and emotionally pounding, it reads like memoirs intertwined across war torn Europe.
Tough to get a rhythm going with this book because of the way it is organized. Cute story that gets very intense at the end. I would recommend the Paris architect over this book
I just want to keep reading this book, even though I finished it. Such powerful and beautiful writing with a truly fantastic story. I loved every detail. Can you make it longer?
This is the best book ive read this year, it is a bit more of a girl's book than a guy's (i thought for sure a woman wrote it, wrong!),  but i enjoyed it all the way to the end.
i loved this book right through the middle. Toward the end, it seemed to drag a bit, and I'm not sure doing the postscript was the right choice, but it was the author's to make.
Great character development!<br/>Amazing perspective on seeing the world thru the eyes of a young blind girl!<br/>And a crystal clear vision of the horrors that war really is.
Really enjoyed this book. Chose it for Book Club and they loved it too. My dad was at Omaha beach during WWII and talked about the coast villages so I could imagine the setting.
The author made you feel as though you actually knew the characters and were living with them through their lives.  This was a wonderful read that I hated to see come to an end.
Excellent and  Illuminating weaves a story from one we know and brings it to life in a most intimate way. Memory lives and souls too traveling in frequencies we sometimes feel.
One of the few times I was disappointed to finish the book.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  It took a little bit to get "into" it, but then it was hard to put down.  Loved it!
I too am a survivor of WW 2, and also a survivor in Spirit, like the blind person in this marvelous book.  Highly recommend it to anyone who dares to read it.  Hebeltje Dykstra
Beautiful, well-written book. I came away with a real understanding of the German occupation of France. So well done from the point of view of the young girl and the young man!
The complexity of life, of war, of intelligence, of relationships, of love. No simplistic resolutions. Heartbreaking and inspiring. Beautifully written. I'm sorry to finish it.
Fantastically written, detailed, and interesting. Great story which weaves several characters together during a significant time in history. Always kept my focus during a trip.
Beyond the interesting story line and characters,  I enjoyed the author's symbolic use of radio waves and ocean themes.  One of those books where you want to re-read a passage.
this was the best book I have read in a long time. The characters are well drawn and the story is imaginative and beautifully structured. Anthony Doerr is a master storyteller.
Very well written. Captivating. Couldn't wait to pick it up every night. Richly developed characters whose stories are woven together with much texture. Interesting denouement.
Well-written story, very captivating. Best book I have read in a long time.Very descriptive, yet not tedious. Could identify with the characters, and they were very believable.
Well written and hard to put down. Anthony  Doerr proved a great book can be written without heavy peppering of foul language and voyeuristic sexual content. It is a must read!
I enjoyed the book even though at times it seemed to slow down to a crawl. The historical references helped in providing an understanding of the times and the life experiences.
Compelling story. Shows the complexity for German youth to respond to the Nazi regime in a moral way.  Also paints an uplifting story of ordinary people showing true character.
For me it is the type of book in which I lose my sense of time. The prose is exqusitely crafted, with beautiful poetic descriptions that add rather than detract from the story.
This novel deserves all the accolades it has received.  Wonderful characters, interesting story lines and inspiring message, heartwarming and poignant. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The intricate entwining of characters, history and intrigue make this book a must read. Visual images abound through detailed descriptions and precise language. Loved the book!
I was disappointed in this book. After being on the best seller list for so long I thought it would be better. It was very well written and interesting but dark and depressing.
There's no point in me writing a long review when so many others have reviewed this wonderful novel. All I can say is I loved it for the same reason as all the other reviewers.
A deeply moving novel about a blind, French girl and a German boy trying to survive the devastation of World War II. This book will thrill. Did not want it to end. Wanted more.
A book I could not put down nor get out of my head.  So beautifully written, that I could have highlighted passages on every page.  Cerebral, arresting and well worth the read.
Loved it. Love the way the two stories run in parallel with common themes. Enjoyed the perspective of the blind girl's story. Some beautiful writing in places, A gripping read.
Beautiful, like a whisper or giggle in the late evening. All the characters come alive with such wonderful memories. Shadows are everywhere yet sun shines throughout the story.
This was a very touching, heart felt story. I could not put it down. I have the privilege to have never lived in a war zone but I felt the horror it must have been. Great book.
One of the best books I've ever read. I found myself rereading passages to slowly savor the images and feelings presented. This is not a good review, but the book is excellent!
A historical type novel of human patience, kindness and endurance amid the backdrop of World War ll.  I enjoyed it very much and plan to read it again.  It's that kind of book.
I expected a different type of read namely the inteaction between the two young people.<br/>Our leaders should read to understand the devastation of war on entire family units
One of the most compelling books ever.  Extremely well developed characters and plot.  Difficult to read sometimes, but a book everyone needs to read. The writing is excellent!
Absolutely one of the best books I have read in years!! The prose paints a picture and transports the reader back to a tragic time in history.  I could not put this book down!!
A well researched book, with a story that is a bit convoluted but still hard to put down.  And everyo ne else in our household that has read itr fewels it was exceptional, too!
At the. Beginning it was not what I thought  but as it went on I was taken in and felt as trapped as they<br/><br/>seemed to feel.  It actually scared me .  Great characters!
I could not put the book down, some nights reading until 1 in the morning.  I could feel the pain and anxiety of the young German boy and the young french girl.  Outstanding...
Very easy reading with two remarkable protagonists. This is my favorite time period in history to read about and I see how Doerr was chosen for the Pulitzer....most deserving!
Hard to put down once started. An incredible insight into how war touches the lives of all involved and what each character learns from their experiences. Beautifully written.
Overall, it is well-written and enjoyable. Certainly worth the read. I'm not sure about the ending but upon further reflection it makes sense considering the underlying topic.
Good book.  Learned a lot about France during the war and what it must have been like for young people and old alike.  Especially through the mind of a blind girl.  Very good!
The characters in this novel are multi dimensional and totally believable.  If ww11 interests you then this is a book that will give you a new view of the time and the people.
Didn't expect to enjoy this book but needed to read it for a discussion. I'm thrilled I read it; I couldn't put it down. I'm looking forward to more from this terrific author.
Beautifully written. I tend to read a lot of nonfiction, usually reading very quickly. With this book, I read slowly, savoring the lovely writing and the emotional flow of it.
Engrossing, beautifully written  World War II story. Fear, dread and denial are palpable through well-drawn characters who refuse to lose hope and ingenuity. Highly recommend.
The story provides insight into human motivations for behavior.  It is a thoughtfully told story of love and loss, sacrifice and courage, and the constant choices humans make.
A hauntingly beautiful book about a blind girl in Paris at the start of WWII and her chance encounter with a German boy during the German occupation of Paris and its' suburbs.
An artistically woven story between the eyes of the semi-willing soldier and insights of the sight less girl. Meeting through another sense arouses the feelings of the reader.
This book was a bit hard to get into in the beginning, but well worth the effort. The way Doerr tied each character's story together was flawless and captivating. A must-read,
This is the kind of writing I would like to be able to do. Beautiful descriptive writing that creates scenes that you feel a part of--I haven't read a book like this in years.
The book keeps you on the edge of your seat, but la tiring in its jumping from one circa to another. Plus you really never find out what really happened to the mythical stone!
Hard to put down.  Made me very emotional at the end.  I really want my kids to read this book to know how the life was like for someone close to their age during the wartime.
Questions about love, loyalty, war and the meaning of life are raised through beautiful cHaracterizations of two very different children-one French , one German , both humans.
Beautifully written with detailed descriptions and very well developed characters. Although a very long book,the short chapters and style of the book made it hard to put down.
This has had great reviews but sadly I have not been able to finish it.<br/>almost never not finish a book but this one I cannot grasp.  Maybe I remember the war too vividly
Told in short, choppy chapters, which makes it more difficult to follow the characters.  Be aware, this is a story set in World War 2, and the descriptions are very detailed.
Gripping, suspenseful and intuitive.  The characters are well developed, the writing crisp.  Even if one has grown tired of novels about WWII, this is worthy of an exception.
There are so many reasons as to why I loved this book - it was well written, captivating from the start, and written in a way that you could imagine every aspect of the book.
I have very few "favorite" books. I tend to find some worthwhile material in most books I have read. "All the Light We Cannot See" is now one of my favorites.
Very well written story of the times during World War II. The tale of the young  blind girl, and how it intertwines with the life of the young German boy. I enjoyed the read.
This story is very intriguing and interesting  intertwining of characters throughout the book keep you interested. An interesting time in history and definitely a great story
Beautifully written of the World War II years.  I blind young French girl and a young German boy conscripted into the Nazi Army and how  their paths cross.  Hard to put down.
Very well written.  Interesting and creative story.  The characters were so alive for me.  Deserved the Pulitzer Prize.  Will definitely check out other books he has written.
This book is very well written.  There were some dark scenes, but it set during WWII, so that was expected.  If you are a fan of historical fiction, you will really enjoy it.
Writing style is very detailed, but flows. An interesting story about a young blind girl during world war II in France, and a young boy in Germany.  Both struggle to survive.
I know this has received some great reviews, and I wouldn't say I didn't enjoy, I did like it. It was an unusual story. But it did take me some time to get through this book.
This story bounces around a lot but is one that I had a difficult time putting down. Enjoyed reading about the different impact the war had on both the German and the French.
Can't say enough good things about this book: well written with interesting characters, interesting plot, exciting.  It truly has something for everyone, men and women alike.
The storyline sounded better than it turned out. The last third was when it got interesting. Almost didn't finish but reading for bookclub. It just never grabbed my interest.
This exemplified solid writing and varied and indepth character development. Doer gave the reader an interesting dual perspective of the two sides of war. Truly a great read.
The author takes one into a different world, a place where people hear and feel more than they see.  It's a tale of goodness in the middle of a war.  Fascinatingly beautiful.
I love most books based on WWII, but this story outdid itself! The intertwining of three lives was amazing! I almost want to reread this to see if I catch more the next time!
I really liked the book.  So many of the authors jump back and forth form the present time to past events.  I prefer a simpler time span.<br/>But I liked the book very much.
I din expect much of the book when I started reading.. But the emotions are captured in so much details.. That it almost visualizes the scene..<br/>Really enjoyed reading it
There was a gentleness about this book that touches one's soul. The story telling was a little interrupted. It was clearly the authors style but it kept disrupting MY journey
Short one star because there were many places where he went on too long with descriptors - it would begin to feel like he was trying to come up with every possible adjective.
Thoroughly enjoyed every page.  Highly recommend.  I felt compassion for the young German soldiers who were swept into the military.  Good human beings on a terrible mission.
WWII from a totally different perspective. The lives of ordinary/extraordinary children exposed to war and the unexplainable horrors. The ability to survive against all odds.
This book is like a long poem. Incredible story married with fantastic verbage.  Touchs on the human story of European war stories. This is a real change from most WWII books
Beautiful reflection of life in Germany between the wars and during WWII from the persepctive of children affected by things they cannot understand or control.  Easy to read.
It isn't too often that I come across a book that I cannot put down. This World War II story is one that I won't forget and will recommend to all my friends who love to read.
I love this story because it portrays the feelings of those who are not so fortunate as I am.  I admire how well they can handle life no matter what is happening around them.
Beautifully written with compelling characters and shifts in time. Marie-larue's story of overcoming the challenges and letting go of fear is a testament ti the human spirit.
I've read many books with WWII as a back drop but found this one to be unique & very imaginative.  I also loved the format of short succinct yet beautifully written chapters.
A tragic story of the human capacity to endure during war and atrocity.  Beautifully told and intriguing as the tale weaves between past and present.  I couldn't put it down.
I'm not the biggest fan of WWII novels, but this was a bit different as it didn't really focus on "the war", but was more about how the war impacted individual lives.
I really enjoyed this book. The relationship between the locksmith and his daughter was exceptionally brought out. Werners story great too, but not as thoroughly fleshed out.
One of those books you do not want to put down nor do you want it to end.<br/>The author has a magical way with words. One of the best books I have read<br/>In a long time.
One of the best stories I have read about this era. His character development is excellent and following these characters gives a new perspective to a war much written about.
I have ready many books on the war and this told such a different story. I loved how each chapter alternated between the two main characters. Excellent book, so well written.
Loved loved loved this book. It was a little hard to follow at first but once I got the hang of the writing style I just couldn't put this down! Beautiful story well written.
This is an excellent novel. It covered a time of great tragedy with good taste and did not dwell on the tragedy. The main characters were developed with empathy and kindness.
marvelously written- you could clearly envision  Marie and Werner's feelings and plights.I would read another of Mr. Doerr's books no questions asked. He's a talented author!
Excellent reading! Would of liked the ending to to have more of a punch! Would recommend this book to friends and will keep a copy in my library with my other favorite books!
Beautifully  and lyrically told story  of the impact of World War II from the view point of one young French girl and one young German boy. I lived it from beginning to end .
Couldn't put this book down! So well written, with incredible characters and plot.  Had to get more of his work immediately after finishing and I've just started About Grace.
One of the best books I have read in a long time!  I couldn't but it down!  A good opportunity to look at Hitler's German troops as well as<br/>the French on the other side.
Enjoyed the historical novel.  Loved the way the author devoted a chapter to each of the characters and completed the book by telling what happened to each of the characters.
I especially enjoyed how this book flowed: two separate narratives and characters, moving inexorably toward each other, and the descriptions were really moving and excellent.
A good story about life for both sides of countries involved in World War II.  Wish it had a happier ending but historical fiction is realty and that always doesn't end well.
There is a reason this is on the NY Times Best Seller list.  I had resisted reading it because it seemed kind of depressing.....not so.<br/>A wonderful, well written novel.
I've read many, many WWII books, but this one held itself up amoung the others.  The writing was beautiful, and the characters were developed quite well.  Really enjoyed it!
I couldn't put the book down, nor has anyone else been able to do so once they have started it. Beautifully written. Sensitive. I wept more than once. Don't miss this treat.
It took awhile for me to get into the book.  Changing character stories and times was a bit distracting for me.<br/>About halfway through I began to really enjoy the story.
Thought provoking and nostalgic. Heart-rending. The kind of book where you occasionally find yourself looking off in the distance and putting yourself inside the situations.
There is a lot of references to things only French or German speakers would easily understand, that was tricky to completely get a picture in your mind of what was going on.
This book is wonderful. It's like a good song that's the kind of song that you make everyone listen to because it has a kind of magic that you know that people need to hear.
Really made the hardships suffered in WWII come alive, and yet always with hope for an end. A love story too. And a wonderful description of what life is like with no sight.
This was a brilliantly written book that is one of the best I have read about World War II.  It was touching and horrifying and thoroughly affecting.  I highly recommend it.
The most beautiful writing I've ever encountered. Such a fascinating story line with interweaving plots spun like a magnificent web during the most history-rich time period.
It's been a long time since I read a more captivating and engaging book. Beautifully constructed and artfully written, it weaves you together with the characters. Wonderful.
Very well written. You falling in love with both of them and although it's not an action packed book the distress of their constant life is enough to keep the pages turning.
The author shows the reader the hearts and minds on so many fronts. The choices made by so many and the reasons for the choices: love, greed, selfishness, desperation, hate.
This is the most powerful anti-war book I have ever read. Doerr seems to have chosen every single word of this novel with care. I would recommend this to any serious reader.
Wow, what a beautiful and absorbing read. Hard to put down and great storyline!!  I highly recommend this book, even if hist fiction is not your preferred choice of reading.
This is a beautifully written book.  The author alternates chapters on his main characters who eventually meet; a device that works very well.  I highly recommend this book.
Beautifully crafted, well written and vivid characters.  I thought I never wanted to read another WWII novel but this book proved me wrong.  Intelligent and skillfully told.
Not since Cold Mountain have I read such a well written novel.  This is the real deal - Doerr creates an insular world of exquisite beauty and absolute terror.  A must read!
This was a beautifully written and very touching story.  A bit slow to start but the characters are so well developed during the book that it becomes impossible to put down.
Characters to care about.  A great story which moves quickly. Hard  to put down.  It puts you in several worlds from mines in Germany to the life of a museum worker in Paris
I don't usually read historical fiction but I was so sad when this book ended...I wanted to continue reading forever! This is a story that stays with you long after the end.
I loved this book and it was 500 pages that I wished I could of kept reading forever.  I loved both main characters and their stories. I loved how their lives crossed paths.
The character development drew me into the story. I like books where alternate stories are told and then converge together. Read it in two days, did not want to put it down.
This is one of the best stories of the year!  It reminds us how important history is and that we should take time to have it come to life in characters such as in this book.
Good book. Interesting characters. Personally I did not like the switching of the times - current-  flashback  No continuity or easy flow. To abrupt which made it confusing
One of the most captivating books I've ever read. The characters jump off the page and become your friend. The deep connections the author creates makes for a moving story.
I love the way the author wove the parallel stories together, giving the reader insight to both French & German war experiences. It kept me enthralled throughout the novel.
Excellent book strong character building and great but sad story line. I really enjoyed the carry over to present of what happened to each of the major players in the book.
I had trouble getting into the book initially, but I did continue and enjoyed it very much.  After I finished reading the book, I did go back and read a few chapters again.
This is one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  Interesting structure, historically interested.  It is one of those books I felt sad to finish.  A wonderful read.
Very different book then I am used to reading.  Was recommend by a friend.  Can not say it was my cup of tea, but it was eye opening to the real life struggles during WWII.
We're reading it for our book group,  I think it's going to be a really good discussion.  I was pleased how the author made lives come together, along with material things.
This is an excellent story of a young blind French girl and a young German boy who's lives cross during WWII. A profound and heartbreaking tale told with great sensitivity.
One of the best reads I've had in a long time. Most of the chapters were short 2-4 pages and the stories moved quickly until the plots crossed near the end. Enjoy this one!
At times, it was a war story.......at times it was a human interest story.....at times it was a love story.....and at times it was sheer poetry.....  A marvelous read......
The book was a little slow at the beginning. I kept reading and it did get better. I would recommend this book which is about French and German kids growing up during WWII.
One the best fiction books I have read in a long time.  It captures World War II in a way that makes you feel the experience from very different, but very human viewpoints.
Great story winding together cultures, trials, fear and rebuilding - the characters came to life for me.  Read it, you'll be transported to another time and numerous lives.
Beautiful. Subtle, well crafted  imagery. Interwoven stories of a young french girl and young german boy toward the end of WWII.  Read slowly and savor the wonderful prose.
I really enjoyed this book.  It was intriguing, enlightening, and very well written.  I couldn't put it down and stayed up late into the evening reading for several nights.
i really enjoyed this book.  My only problem with it was the jumping back and forth between years and characters.  At times, it was hard to keep track of what was going on.
Loved this book!  Story line really pulled me in, most especially the sweet love story of a father for his blind daughter and the wisdom he showed to empower her so.  Linda
The language does justice to the depth of the story. This is quite simply an amazing work...the kind that story-readers dream of reading and story-writers dream of writing.
Beautifully written and reflective of deep knowledge of many things, including the ways of the heart. A bit confusing at times, but a splendidly satisfying read nonetheless
I must admit that I had a bit of a hard time getting into the book at the beginning.  I'm so glad I stuck with it.  What a beautiful story.  I can't stop thinking about it.
A beautifully written story. Keeps you on your toes and wondering what could possibly come next. Storyline is perfectly balanced to keep the juggling all in the air at once
well written, captivating, and a fresh view, how innocents got caught up in a horrific world.  I'm usually reluctant to read yet another WWII work, but glad I did this time
If you enjoy books that ring true and are historically based, you will love this.  The characters are vivid and you will stay up all night waiting to see what happens next.
Five stars are not enough.  It is the best book I have read in a long time - beautiful language, intricately woven plot, fascinating characters, ones you really care about.
Full of twists and turns. Interesting history on lighthouses..never realized how lonely it could be. Sad, but I enjoyed it..even though I wanted to scream a couple of times
Well written, finely documented. Make both the german side and the french side of the war dreadfully real. The characters are so believable and touching. A wonderful story.
One of the best novels I've ever read. I found myself thinking about the story when I wasn't reading the book, wondering about them and about what was going to happen next.
One of the best.  Good reflections on the social aspects of the culture and era.  Hope for the future  through random acts of kindness, often unseen due to current events.
Powerful book, lots to ponder while you are reading it and also after you're done.  You need to sit on this one for a bit to fully appreciate all the author has given you.
Did not like the ending. Story seemed to fizzle out. Werner was the only connection to all people and his demise ended it. I do not enjoy a story that skips around in time
Story of hope, conflict, fear, sacrifice, cruelty---so many emotions, and set in a time when simply surviving depended on adjusting to the world as it exploded around you.
This is a must read.  You will not be able to put it down once you start.  I want to read more of Doerr!  Getting Shell Collector next.  Great American writer of our time!
Took me a while to be pulled into the developing story and rhythm of the book.  The writer is very talented and excellent use of work usage and structure.  Excellent read.
Great story and character development!  Does get a little long but you are waiting to see what happens.  A different view of WWII through these wonderful young characters.
Brilliantly written and conceived book. Couldn't put it down, but didn't want it to end. Prose is lyrical and it is profound in its attempt to portray and understand life.
I really did not under and this book. Perhaps I did not look deep into the double meanings, but that is. Not why I read a book anymore and this one was a chore to complete
When I care about the characters and am motivated to think deeply about their choices and feelings, I am happy to have spent time reading the book.  This is one such book.
I wasn't riveted, but interested . . . I felt for the characters and enjoyed the story but I wish the 2 stories came together sooner, because I knew they eventually would.
a captivating read, characters you care about, history that makes you think, thought provoking and light and heavy at the same time.  An excellent book and enjoyable ready
I found this difficult to read:  too much jumping from character to character, time to time, place to place.  I think the reviews have been over done.  I was disappointed.
The humanity in war, if there is any, is featured in this WW2 novel. Started slowly but I kept returning to it because I wanted to be there when our hero and heroine meet.
WAYYY too verbose.  This reminds me of a couple of other "award" winning books where the author goes on and on and on.  Gee, maybe he's getting paid for each word.
Such a great story with wonderfully realized characters. Not something I would usually read, but I loved it. It's the kind of book that will stay with you for a long time.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author skillfully brings you to another time. It is a very romantic book, even though it takes place during the Horrific Nazi invasion.
I am puzzled by the meaning of the gem in this novel, which I think would be an engrossing story without it.  Is it a symbol of greed, materialism, evil (as in the Nazis)?
Loved the twists and intersection points between lives lived in great turmoil and upheaval. A bit soft of an ending as I was expecting more between the staring characters.
Gripping story, descriptive characters. A different approach to a WW11 story. Story goes back and forth between time periods and characters and weaves everything together.
Beautifully written tale that intertwines fascinating characters with captivating historical fiction! Couldn't put it down and recommended for anyone who enjoys the genre.
So sad to have it end. This novel has many layers. The author is so talented, it just leaves me in awe. He teaches his readers. Best book of my year, and I have read many.
Very clever use of timelines, weaving the characters and their stories around each other<br/><br/>And I was surprised that I would feel sympathy toward a German soldier.
A brilliantly written story of the last part of WWII in Europe.  The author uses a unique technique to parallel the Europe and French people he characterizes in his story.
I loved every word. Simply fabulous! I got the list of amazon best sellers. This book was number two. Number one was excellent but I believe that I enjoyed number two more
There are not many authors who can extend a sentence to almost a full page and never lose your attention or feelings for his prose. Beautiful writing and a terrific story.
As with many of these suspense type of novels, the reader may at times feel that some incidents seem too contrived, but overall an interesting book that held my attention.
An entertaining historic novel-but complicated by too many characters and skipping around in hisstory. Wonderful despritions of France and various charaters. Shelby Rector
Wonderful characters, interesting jumps back and forth in time and locale, and captivating story:  this is a good read. I think I'll be buying a few copies this Christmas.
Different point of view of World War II story.  It was well written from 2 different points of view, although you knew they would be tied in at some point.  Very readable.
A story of a boy and a blind girl,a walled city in Brittany, France.About radios and a hidden jewel. I loved the book and found it very exciting and a good history lesson.
Long, drawn out. Lacked relational intensity among characters. The ending was blazed. I was expecting more time between Marie and Werner. The research however is spot on.
Found the story fascinating and unpredictable.  This is the first I have read from this author and I am almost afraid to try another for fear that it will not measure up.
Superbly written with  an incredible use of time and space. His description of war-ravaged lives is the closest I have come to understanding the pain of children in a war
This book left me thinking and pondering well after I had finished, and wanting to read again. Gorgeous prose, intriguing plot, and important subject. Highly recommended!
I liked how the story gave two sides of the war and how it changed two youths prospective as the war goes on. It shows two sides of the coin and how really it's only one.
I couldn't put it down and I  was reading reading reading only to be sad when it ended! Definitely needed a sorry like that right now. Also very creatively tied together.
Beautifully written look back to a dark time. The story through the helpless eye of these 2 children, is tense and horrific, while maintaining the innocence of their age.
Excellent book. Short chapters made it easy to start & stop. Liked the story being told from two perspectives. Could have ended a bit sooner for me, but overall wonderful
Haven't finished the book yet, so I could change my mind, but it is a compelling story.  It jumps around quite a bit, both in time and place, but it isn't hard to follow.
Beginning is a little slow but I think that was required to make you care about the character so much. The last hundred and fifty pages are impossible to put down though.
Wonderfully written. To "see" a war through so many eyes offers a rare opportunity to understand what happens when so many lives, limbs, and souls are sacrificed.
This is a beautifully written novel about two characters caught up in the horrors of WWII in France and Germany.  They are both heroes in a way.  I could not put it down.
A look at WWII from two vastly different protagonists; one a blind French girl whose bravery inspires a brilliant young German boy to give into his own inherent kindness.
The book is absolutely wonderful! I was just disappointed because the corners of the cover were slightly smashed upon delivery. Otherwise, I am very happy with this book.
I really enjoyed this book and the writing was excellent.  I had the pleasure of doing the whisper version as well as reading it which I thought was extremely  well done.
I loved the story and wanted so much for him to be successful, it broke my heart, but that is life and that is war. Enjoyed the characters and the beautiful descriptions.
A lot going for this novel. Excellent writing, a memorable story without any cheap hooks. All told, this book is what a lot of bestsellers these days are not: literature.
So many books on the terror and bestiality of war. Yet this one captured me with its beautiful story of victims and perpetrators struggling to hold on to beauty and grace
One of the best reads for 2014.Great duel characters set in the Nazi era. A German  boy and a blind French girl.And how their lives are on a collision course.A must read!
Heartbreakingly beautiful.  This book will stay with you for a long time.  This is how children are turned into adults overnight during and because of the cruelty of war.
An amazing book. Drew me into that world with every page. A book to read a second time, but I think it might take s person of a certain age to truly appreciate this story
One of the best novels I have read in a long time.  Lovely prose, engaging, unique characters, and a page-turner of a plot.  Makes me want to read all of Doerr's writing.
Another reviewer mentioned that the characters stay with you long after you close the book....so true.  I loved this story it worked the magic of mythology to perfection.
The poetic use of language stands on its own,  add to it a mesmerizing plot and tightly drawn characters, history, science, and an entire universe unfolds for the reader.
It was very well written. However it was very predicable that the two main characters would meet and have some type of relationship.  It is probably a good book club read
One of those novels that stays with you for a long time. The two protagonists came alive for me, one unexpectedly. This won't be the only book I'll read by Anthony Doerr.
Very well written and engaging.  Hard to put down.  This was one of the best books I've read this year.  Most of the others I can't even remember but this one stands out.
So beautifully written.  Incredibly moving.  Never to be forgotten.  Would never hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  On top of all that, it is an educational experience.
A story which weaves together the lives of two young people, aided by imagery that makes the settings come alive, make this a memorable book.<br/>I couldn't put it down!
Beautiful story...great story-telling, engaging and touching. Describes the harsh realities of the war through the two young people who suffered through it. A great read.
My only regret is that there are only 5 stars to give it.  A moving vivid page-turner and a side of war I'd never contemplated.  I loved every single second of this book.
I'm only about 100 pages in but I'm already hooked! The structure of the chapters and how it flips back and forth between Werner and Marie-Laure is extremely interesting!
This book was reviewed in the New York Time in early May 2014 - I read it immediately and was more captivated by a new novel than I can remember - thinking back, other relatively recent close call's were Michael Faber’s 'The Crimson Petal and the White', Kurt Anderson's 'Heyday', Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptonomicon', and Iain Pear's 'An Instance at the Fingerpost'. I have been pushing Doerr's book on friend (almost obnoxiously) for monthes and NOT ONE hasn't been enthralled - which I really can't say of the my other listed favorites. I recall one reviewer back in May (thought it was the NYT) saying he felt that with 'All the Light' he had already read the best book of 2014. To my mind, this was an accurate prediction. I have been gratified to see it creep up to top sellerdom - it well deserves to outlast the over hyped Goldfinch and Gone Girl. Neither can hold a candle to All the Light. I am jealous of those who have yet to read this amazing book.
The good within us and the circumstances of our surroundings play out in a story so well told that I waited two full days to read the last chapter not wanting it to end.
Very descriptive. A bit slow but very different characters. Jumps around often from different characters, often very vague in what is going on and that can be confusing.
Excellent book--enoyed following the characters as they survived the German Invasion of France--each in their own way.  Human nature is remarkable on what we can endure.
Amazing & complicated, but worth every minute to better understand the human cost of WWII.  The beauty of good people  prevails... a beautiful book to read & understand.
Loved the story but was a little disconcerted by how the story jumped around in time.  It was very interesting to view the war from a young German soldier's perspective.
One of the best books I read in a long time, and beautifully written.  We can have some faith that evil in our world will be overcome by the better side of human nature.
If you like historical stories, you will love this one. Easy, fast and interesting read. A great story of determination and perseverance in difficult and horrible times.
The writing was lovely, and I had no problem keeping up with what year they were in, as some have stated. However, I felt the ending was rushed, it left me dissatisfied.
I was anticipating more of a love story so was somewhat disappointed. Certainly glad I continued reading because it was a wonderful story and exceptionally well written.
Harrowing, beautiful, thought provoking. The intensity of trying to survive with them is such that it is not until the end pages that I cried for 'what could have been.'
I loved this book from the start, and just wanted to read every spare moment in my day!  I think it was very well written, and the character development was really good.
A very moving story, as are many stories about the personal experiences of people subjected to the traumas of war.  I did love the way the author brought it full circle.
I liked The Book Thief very much and was delighted to find another book based on the WW2 era that was well worth reading and had interesting and entertaining characters!
This book was amazing.  The story passed between a young French girl that is blind, and a young German soldier.  Such an enthralling read.  I highly recommend this book.
This book took a little while to get into, but once there, I found it hard to put down.  I love historical fiction, and this was as well written as any I've encountered.
Couldn't put it down. Powerful, beautifully written. Characters are perfectly developed, story line is expertly weaved. Will remain in my top 5 favorite books ever read.
An intriguing intimate portrayal of the personal struggles of both members of French and German families and how they connected during the greatest conflict of our time.
Awesome book and wonderfully written.  Not always pleasant, but great read for those of us that want to know where we came from and how hard our ancestors worked for us.
I heisted reading  this book, fron the description of a blind girl and a war was not to appealing ,boy was I wrong. It was well writen and an intreging story. Wonderful!
Beautifully written, incredible story and character development.  I would read this again and again.  Have been on a WWII kick lately and this one is by far my favorite.
not done reading yet but will definitely finish it, a good read.  Probably more people should read this type of book we forget too so how life was in the past, out past.
Wonderfully written book. Although it was set during WWII it isn't a "war" book in the usual sense. I got to explore what the French and German citizens endured.
Fantastic read.  Sad, sad story, but well worth reading.  Strongly recommend.  It gives a clearer insight into the maneuvers behind the men practicing the Nazi programs.
To me it was a new and different perspective on WWII.  It was both mythical and very realistic with an emotional depth that resounded for a long time.  A beautiful book.
Kept me interested throughout<br/>Great character development<br/>Story depicts atmosphere of 1930's and 1940's<br/>In. Europe very well  I will recommend this to all
Well written and memorable.  It reminded me of "The Book Thief", which I also loved.  The war machine does grind and all the innocents are consumed or nearly so.
Beautifully woven story.  It was unpredictable and reaffirms our faith in human beings.  A timeless story of friendship and perseverance through a tough time in history.
Easy to read, engaging--great descriptions.  I liked the short chapters and going back and forth to time periods.  The ending left the reader with many questions though.
Good read. Excellent character development and a very poignant story of innocent people thrust into a very dark world created by modern history's most vile megalomaniac.
A story of beautiful scenes, descriptions, characters and sorrow and strife.  A great read.  A story that does not ever end, but travels on like the light we cannot see.
Gripping story.welldeveloped characters. Some parts a little murky, but I would definitely recommend it to those readers who really like to get to know their characters.
I really enjoyed the short chapters, the wonderful way the author gives one glimpses of the future ot the story, and the character development. The story is captivating.
My mother was born in Paris during the occupation...this book really made me understand what my grandmother went through, trying to keep my mother and her siblings safe.
Writing was delightfully authentic and natural, unburdened by sensationalism. No magically perfect ending. Characters were appropriately flawed yet sublime. Will reread!
Captivating.  One of the best books I have read this year. It started somewhat slow but about half way through I really did not want to put the book down for any reason.
Loved this book by Anthony Doerr....exceptional writing, fascinating plot, well drawn characters....kept my interest from beginning to end!  YOU should read it too!  :-)
I enjoyed this book because it took you through two lives during the war - a French girl's and a German boy's and described their daily life's activities during the war.
I thought I was done with WWII novels but this one proved me wrong. The delicacy with which the author brings both main characters to life in our minds is extraordinary.
This book was written very well.  Loved the way doerr writes, the way he uses words.  Not that great of a story but still thought it was beautiful.  A feast for the eyes
Arrived in better condition than expected. I bought the cheapest one $7, used, but it looks and smells brand new. It arrived yesterday evening and I cannot put it down!
The author has done justice to a difficult time in the history of this world by portraying it through two different, yet similar characters. The book is just brilliant!
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it. It was however very sad. The author did a great job of portraying the difficulties of the time for all concerned.
Great story, memorable characters, moving portrayal of humans caught in the crushing machinery of war. Beautifully written. The language sings. This book will move you.
I felt pulled along by the beauty of the novel's language, even as I was horrified once more by the brutality of war. Ravishing and devastating. I'm sad it is finished.
Beautifully written.....descriptions almost like reading poetry.  I enjoyed the plot though, with French and German names, I had a little trouble following it at times.
To understand people and war, everyone on the planet should read this book. It's utterly amazing in both simplicity and complexity. This book will stay with me forever.
If you love historical fiction then you have got to read this book!  Excellent writing!  The chapters are short and easy to read!  You will fall in love with this book!
Beautifully written, but at times hard to follow as it jumped both forward and back in time. Well developed characters, and a story line that draws you in. A good read.
A fantastic book! I am just sad that I finished it because I so enjoyed every minute of reading the story.  Thoroughly engaging in every respect. I highly recommend it.
It took me a few chapters to get hooked, but once hooked, I could not put this book down.  Vivid imagery to put you in the place and time of each characters experience.
The writing technique of switching among the characters to tell the story was interesting. This is also one of the few books I have read that was set in WWII in Europe.
The book seemed long but I was able to put it down and later pick up to read later and know who or what it was about by the chapter headings. Lots of life in this book.
I struggled to put my kindle down... It's so well-written, and I enjoyed reading it. I hadn't heard of this book before; I bought it on a whim... and I'm SO glad I did.
A great about life in Europe during WWII through the perspective of 2 children.  If you like this topic, you will enjoy this book.  Best book I have read in a long time
I loved how the story was written, alternating the characters experiences and showing a connection between the characters. I would say the plot completed a full circle.
Amazing book. Couldn't put it down. I did get lost a bit when it hopped from different years but the story itself was so great that it didn't take away from the content
It was a terrific book though sometimes painful as it involved children and war. Overall if it was very engaging and more than once went to bed early to get back to it!
I enjoyed the writing in this book and the story was good as well. I found the jumping around on the timeline a bit confusing but it does come together well in the end.
I was rapt. Such beautiful writing! I love how he wove the story to take us from Germany to France, through childhood to adulthood, seeing the war through so many eyes.
Good character development, but have to like going back and forth between characters in very short chapters. Loved the ending as it was fitting for the time in history.
It is a delight to read this fresh approach to WWII literature.  The writing is lyrical.  The characters are unique but believable.  It is a great pick for book groups.
I could hardly put this book down. The author did a great job of alternating characters and plots and kept it moving. There were no slow parts.  Excellent and provoking
Captivating. Well written. Realistic characters that carry you through the effects of war on common man. How duty to country can be branded on the soul of the unlikely.
I enjoyed the writing as well as the architecture of the story. It was particularly interesting how the author tied the communication (radio) to the current technology.
Wonderful heartfelt story.  Beautifully written.  The character development in this book is fantastic.  This is a must read, I loved every page and was sad if was over.
Wonderful book! Great story with interesting points of view. Very well written. The storyline in addition to the layout of the chapters makes it impossible to put down!
Great book ... though I expected a lot from it and it didn't truly deliver for me until I was well into the book ... I would recommend this to everyone!  Enjoy enjoy!!!
So beautifully crafted! I couldn't put this book down. Doerr's writing supersedes that of many popular novelists.  The research that went into this novel is impressive.
This beautiful book got me through two days of the flu. I was so sad for the book to end. Beautiful story and characters that will  stay with you long after it is over.
Told from several points of view this was a very engrossing description of France, Germany and the artifacts of those countries and how they were collected during WWII.
An amazing story of how lives intersect each other. You had a real sense of who the characters were and what it was like during that time period. I couldn't put it down
I thought it was a wonderful read - actually one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  Not only was it extremely well written, but also thought provoking.
I loved the book, beautifully written, the first couple chapters are hard as you are going back and forth....then<br/>once you get into it, it captures your heart.....
Moving, excellent characters and imagination, well written.i got very attached Tao Werner and Marie-Lauren and their parallel lifes meeting in the infinity a of the sea
Beautiful writing. I could not put this book down. So glad I found Anthony Doerr. I'm going to read more of his books for sure. . I'm recommending it to all my friends.
this was one of the finest books I have ever read. the writing is marvelous, each sentence was like reading a poem. the story was superb,  I highly recommend this book.
This has everything. Lovely writing-illuminating history-page-turning plot--characters that will live on when the story ends. I hope it will be made into a movie, but it can't be as good.
I can't believe the great ratings this book has received from all sectors.  The storyline is so choppy and the characters are not well developed. The only reason I continued to read was the hope that the plot would come together. Hence, the two star rating. The ending was so disappointing.  I felt that there was no real resolution to this story.
Very beautifully written.  You can pick any chapter and read it like its own poem.  The story isn't just about the characters during a war it is about more, much more.
great book.  starts a bit slow but picks up as your really get into the characters.  Hops back and forth in time, but not really confusing/annoying.  Highly recommend.
I really wanted to love this book but it just wasn't what I expected.  Very confusing and unnecessary references to the astrocities of the war and very strange ending.
Seldom impressed, but not this time.  Characters raised with brushstrokes and relief, this story of the great calamity of our century hits home.  Let it wash over you.
Beautiful imagery. Enjoyed the different perspectives and time frames which somehow all blended together perfectly. Sympathetic characters. Well written and I enjoyed.
Really enjoyed the story line and the development of the characters.  Quite often I could picture exactly what everything and everyone looked like.  Highly enjoyed it.
The novel was interesting but at times I looked forward to the ending.  Using big words doesn't make the book better.  I really wanted to love this novel but I didn't.
This book goes on my all-time favorites list. I couldn't put it down.  The story weaves itself together in a perfect way.  It's keeps the past present in so many ways.
When I started reading the sample, I did not think that I was going to like it. By the time I was at the end of the sample I had to find out what happened to the girl.
This is a book I would never have read if it hadn't been a book club selection.  It is a painful book to read, but so beautifully written that I didn't want it to end.
The writing is exquisite; the theme leaves you breathless.  It is rich with physical descriptions and with the interior of the protagonist.  It is an exceptional read.
I really liked the book.  The story was compelling and the characters came to life page by page.  I would certainly recommend it to anyone who loves historical novels.
I was not at first interested in another WWII novel but the story sucked me in and I don't like violence, but the author frames it well so it was not disturbing to me.
I enjoyed this well written story. The style of telling each chapter from a different point of view kept me mesmerized. I got caught up in the lives of the characters.
Fascinating plot twists, characters caught in desperate circumstances, children using their survival instincts to escape evil Gestapo thugs. Suspenseful story of hope.
Characters are well developed.  Interesting angle makes one think about all those boys and how young they were.  There were real people on both sides of this conflict.
This book held my interest throughout.  It has a somewhat complex plot and I was particularly interested as the plot developed how the 2 main characters would connect.
Riveting account from WWII era in France. It was a  little hard to jump between years some times unless you pay close attention to the chapter titles and years listed.
This was an absolutely fascinating book from start to finish. One of the better reads I have had the pleasure to enjoy. Courage...the kind of courage few could fathom.
This book was, in my opinion, very interesting and well written.  Only the ending was a bit disappointing---it sort of fell flat after much tension<br/>and excitement
A character portrayal of two youth during the war living in Germany and France. The story of what connects them and the atrocities of war. Mitchnerlike in descriptions
I enjoyed the book but probably would have preferred a different ending.  It was fine, I just would have liked a little more interaction between Marie Laure and Jutta.
Anthony Doerr has a beautiful command of our language, very compelling.  This was my "day time book", too hard sometimes to read at night.  WWII is still vivid for me.
This is a great read.  I found the charachter development to be really strong and the story style creative and interesting.  One of my favorite books that I have read.
One of my more favorite novels in recent years.  Great character development and imagery.  The story itself was like a puzzle.  Heart warming and sad at the same time.
Vocabulary and descriptive writing superb.  The story was such a different take as a story on World War II. I found  it heart breaking and refreshing at the same time.
I loved reading this book. It left me sad, happy, hopeful and fulfilled. It is so well written that I knew I was part of every character and wanted them to go forever.
Highly recommend. The author creates a sense of the mystic while at the same time capturing the characters of two amazing young people caught up in the horror of WWII.
Beautifully written with superb descriptions and evocative passages. The story tugs at your heart even though the ending is not like a fairy tale but lovely nontheless
A big wonderful book about so many things...love, war and precious stones to name a few. I can't spin words into magic like this author but you won't forget this book.
One of the very best books of the year if not of the last decade. This was an original read that hooks you in and captures your attention. I didn't want it to be over.
incredible perception of the German infiltration from both sides.  Moral Courage is shown for both young victims of this war.  Beautifully written and hard to put down
Well written and enjoyable. One of the best books I have read in 2014. I recommend it to anyone who appreciates character development tha flows through the entir novel
This is a book that succeeds on many levels: a suspenseful plot, characters one cares about, lyrical writing, thoughts about large issues, and more.  Not to be missed.
Beautifully written and constructed.  Two parallel stories which will obviously come together, but which do so in such an  uncontrived way that it he book is seamless.
I would recommend this book to everyone. We have a plethora of World War II books. This one is at the top! Character development is very rich. Description is beautiful
Great book, I wish the younger and people and people at the White House could remember how our GI's  were treated in world war II , They should read the book Unbrokern
I thoroughly enjoyed the book - especially reading from two different perspectives - German and French.  Mr. Doerr's narrative looked into the souls of the characters.
I got a bit confused with this book, but finally was able to figure out all the characters.  The ending was rather superfluous.  I lost interest when the war was over.
The spirituality of this book and the beauty with which it is expressed in the lives of each character is deeply moving. I do hope it receives the National Book Award.
A very lovely well written book. I had heard a lot about it so I was expecting the world.....I set my expectations too high!  It was a nice read but I did not LOVE it!
I waited through about 80% of the book to see the paths of the 2 main characters converge and when they finally did it was lack luster.  I was hoping for so much more.
Well written story that really brought out struggles of WW2 from both the aggressors and the victims to heart.  In war time all are victims. Good mystery involved too.
Great concept, 2 characters beginning as children to the buildup of WWII, one German the other French.  Masterful how they connect. Well written.  I enjoyed this book.
A warm story set in WWII, with tentacles of tragedy, love, commitment, and family commitment. A rich summer read.  The title us subtly descriptive of the story thread.
Fascinating story of vulnerable people caught in an awful war. Their heart rendering stories leave you desperate for a happy ending, which of course is not realistic.
Well written and good characters.  Good job detailing what it was like for two children to come of age during the war, one French and one German.  Well worth the read
The flow of the novel took some time to get used to, but once I did, I really liked it. I wish there were more conclusions for some characters, but overall I liked it
A cleverly constructed story of two teenagers facing the ravages of World War II. Done with a very light touch, which is good. But not a deep exploration of the time.
Evenly paced story of two characters from both German and French sides in the war.  Interesting way the author weaves the two unrelated protagonists stories together.
I don't really care for WWII-based books, but I read this on the recommendation of a friend.  If you enjoy the genre, it is excellent and I would highly recommend it.
The story flows smoothly and captivates your interest. The characters seem to jump out of the pages. Beautiful story about family, love and struggle. Highly recommend
I could not put this book down. I appreciated the author's ability to weave character's individual stories together and allow the past catch up to the book's present.
A must read!  Brilliantly written, tough emotional parts to digest at times.  You will definitely want to have indepth discussions with other readers upon completion.
This story is wonderful.  It weaves time, points of view, and a thrilling mystery together.  I am sad it is over and envy the reader their delight when they begin it.
This book is one of the best I have ever read. The plotline is beautiful and the author is very articulate with this masterpiece! I recommend to any avid book lover!!
Beautiful, flowing style of writing. a different perspective on the invasion of Paris during the Third Reich. The characters were well developed and defined. I really got involved.<br/>I thought this book worthy of  4 and a half  stars.
I  really liked  this  book  it  takes place in  wwII  and is from  two different  perspectives of  two different  people,  a  sory  of  struggle  loss  and  survival
A blind girl a poor boy live a life through the ww11. A unique  diamond a friend a uncle found few characters thought provoking parallel meanings so enjoyable to read
One of the best historical fiction books I have read. Very powerful and enlightening. I hope that high school history teachers can bring this book into the classroom.
The writing was very good but for me, the book was very long and plodded along.  I read it because of book club but I doubt I would really recommend it to my friends.
Stories intertwine to form an interesting, if somewhat what tragic, novel.  Compelling characters, war as the backdrop,  and well conceived writing.  Worth your time.
I could not put this book down. It is written so beautifully! A thrilling ride through others "eyes" in 1944. Thanks so much for sharing your gift of writing! Wow....
I loved the book except for the ending.  I felt that the byplay between the two sides was so well done.  Even the ending which could have been stronger was realistic.
I felt that one of the main characters wasn't developed as much as it could be. Would give the book three and a half stars if that was an option but have read better.
Each character comes alive in the reader's mind and we grow to love them.  The settings often described by a blind child and later a woman are tremendously evocative.
Wonderful book! Well written, keeps your interest. Gives a reflection of both the German Soldier (child) and the free world French girl. I highly recommend this bood.
Interesting dichotomy with small or handicapped characters having more strength than physically superior...very interesting in that time of history...solid must read!
Well constructed story. Not too sentimental, but tender. Fantasy and reality well entwined.  I would recommend it to anyone who has some memory or connection to WWII.
I've never read historical fiction much, but this book pulled me in immediately. It's heartwarming and heart wrenching all at once. I'm recommending it to all I know.
A magnificent book.  Beautifully written. Superb!  A refreshing view of what it must have been like during WW2 through the eyes of these very deep central characters.
A literary delight - poetic prose that breathes life and limb into compelling circumstances and memorable characters -/one if the few books I would consider rereading
An excellently written story not about war but about the intricacies of lives within war. I would recommend this book, this tale, to anyone sensitive to human nature.
One of the very best books I've read for a long time.  Great character development, a unique way of looking at war and the moral issues that war poses to individuals.
Beautiful book! You don't want to stop reading but you dread the moment when you will finish it. It is no wonder that this book is on the top ten books of 2014 lists.
Very well written. Compelling and well-drawn characters. A different and interesting viewpoint of WWII in Europe. Looking forward to reading Anthony Doerr's backlist.
I have recommended the book to friends.  You fall in love with the main characters (well most of them).  I could barely put it down once I got to the last 100+ pages.
Wonderfully well written story of the complicated lives of those young people living in war torn France and Germany. Beautiful descriptions and character development.
Really fascinating and moving story of two separate -  yet connected - individuals being swept up by war. Fascinating and heartbreaking read, it was hard to put down.
This was an excellent read.  Great, well-developed characters.  Interesting story and surprisingly not stale or a retelling of something I've read before about WW II.
I was engrossed in this novel from the beginning.  Looking at WWII through the eyes of young people as they matured was a new perspective and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Beautifully written with a compassionate eye toward all human aspects of WWII, Doerr leads us through French and German towns and countrysides in this haunting novel.
Anthony Doerr is a gifted writer who weaves a compelling story wrought with intriguing, interesting and complex characters.  It's a beautiful book highly recommended.
I have to admit I did not like tags beginning, but I got to know the characters and wound up really liking. I think it's fascinating seeing the story from both sides.
Such an amazing book!
Brilliant.  Loved it.
Delicious and hopeful
I liked this book and thought it was well written.  It had me wanting to read each night.  I felt like it gave a very different perspective of the war.  Typically you get the Jewish concentration camp version, but this was interesting to get the point of view from a German soldier and a French girl (who wasn't sent to a camp, but lived through the war experience in a town occupied by German troops).  I gave this book 4 stars rather than 5 stars because I was disappointed in the ending (probably would have given it 3 1/2 if I could have.  The whole book worked towards these two people coming together and then nothing really came of it.  A lesson was learned, but nothing good came of that either.  Even the opportunity for Marie-Laure to tell Werner's sister what he had done for her was interrupted.  I would have been fine if either one of these things happened, but because they didn't, I ended the booked feeling annoyed.
A compelling read!  The book displays the cruelty of World War II as it affects children and families.  The plot is well-developed and the prose is very descriptive.
Enjoyed the story and the main characters. It was enlightening to see how people of all ages from France and Germany coped before and during the war. Very enjoyable!
I loved this book. I love the way the author can take characters from either side of a conflict and make them human. Tells a happy and sad tale what war really is...
A book about the the 1940-1945 War, without judgement...<br/>About people (Germany and France) and their struggles to cope with life in these dark years. Beautiful!
Beautifully written, focusing attention on the much-delayed Allied landings on Brittany, long after Normandy.  Very sensitive development of the two main characters.
It didn't end the way I would have liked, but it was a well researched story.  A little dark but a very good read.  I haven't read anything this good in a long time.
Very well written.  The author kept you turning the pages; could not anticipate what would come next.  Well researched.  I will be looking for more from this author.
The best book I've read in a while. A beautifully structured narrative that gave the reader insight into a different perspective of war through the eyes of children.
I liked the book but have to confess that I was not in love with it when I started. I was past middle of the book until I felt engaged. Beautiful and touching story!
One of my all time favorite books. After reading this book I found it hard to get interested in other books because they just didn't measure up. Don't miss this one.
Wonderful, amazing, multi-faceted, gripping, sensitive, war-torn, elegant.  Finished it and immediately started reading it again.  One of my favorite all-time reads.
wonderful story written very well about a blind girl and a German boy during world war II. Following the different story lines really kept you guessing. A great read
This was is one of the finest books I have ever read. It humanizes the horrors of war torn France through the lives of two young people.<br/>It is a beautiful read.
Really enjoyed this book. Gave a realistic picture of France during WWII.  The plot was intriguing and kept me wondering what would happen next. Very glad I read it.
Great characters & stories that wind into one. Gives one an appreciation of WWII from all perspectives. From a reader who never buys books--this was worth the price!
Thus author does a bang-up job with a time in history that may be quite familiar, but tells it in a fresh way. I  enjoyed the book and love the way the author wrote.
There are so many better books that deal with World War II. After reading this book I was surprised<br/>that it was selected as one of New York Times 10 best books.
An incredible journey. So beautifully written. Capturing and alluring yet I've learned more about World War Two than from any other book from details in the stories.
I enjoyed this book and was interested to read the other side of war from the prospective of the ordinary person and their suffered and rose above their predicament.
Wonderfully written novel<br/>Two frame stories, carefully intertwined unravel as you progress through this well written book.<br/>Captivating. A pleasure to read.
Excellent!  Creatively written!  A story of the great difficulties and horrors of war and yet the magnificence of the human spirit.  Hope many are reading this book!
Could not put it down. The characters, their stories, the way they were interconnected was so deep and clever. Books like these are a rare find as out their authors.
I loved this book; beautiful characters, plot and an important message.  I would have given it 5 stars except that the last few chapters seemed a little superfluous.
Captivating story - beautifully written. Quite a page turner, and  great way to learn about that period of history. Great character development. HIghly recommend it.
A delight to read .  I. Felt like I was living with the characters in the book.  I loved the way the ending gave closure to the story and answered all my questioned.
I was totally absorbed in the characters and story development.  The author did a phenomenal job with both and his use of descriptive language enhanced both as well.
I couldn't put this novel down.  It was wonderful!!  I love novels that have a historical background,  These characters were amazing.  The story gave me new insight.
One of the most exceptional works of fiction I have read.  Doerr has written a book which will stand for a very long time.  A wonderful story and beautiful language.
This is a very enlightening book during war time.  Would recommend it highly, and even though it is a Novel, you learn a great deal from it.  Difficult to put down~!
amazing story woven around several protagonists during the years surrounding WWII. Well constructed novel that draws you in to the lives of the fictional characters.
I loved every page of this book.  Its a story from 3 different characters and their experiences with WWII.  Different than any other WWII book I've ever read before.
excellent weaving of narrative and characters.  A more then satisfying conclusion and an invitation into a deeper conversation with the reader's own inner narrative.
This is one of the most beautiful books I've read!!!!! Such a graphic portrayal of ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances!!!! Lovely,lovely,lovely!!
Riveting story. Beautifully written with poetic imagery intermingled in the prose. Worth a second read, soon. This novel quickly made its way to my "favorites" list.
Thoughtful, deep novel about life in Germany and  France through the feelings of young people caught up in the second world war. Best book I've read in a long time.
A story so touching - so beautifully written that it is difficult to tear oneself away for even a moment  and just plain wrenching To reach the end of this story 😰
Beautifully written, poetic, and the best plot I've run across in quite some time.  I'm recommending it to my Book Club because it would be a great book to discuss.
A wonderful story told through the eyes of many characters.  It is one of the all-time favorite books I've ever read.  So very well written! Don't pass this one by.
Loved the author's descriptions and how he moved through the story moving back and forth from<br/>The main characters . Very well written!!  Hats of to the author!
The best book I've read in 20 years. A magnificent story of two lives that intersect during WWII. I finished it then immediately started to re-read. What an author!
Brilliantly written. Doerr uses vivid analogies that arouse all your senses. The two seemingly parallel plots intersect beautifully. I didn't want the story to end.
Well written World War II book seen through the eyes of a blind girl and a German orphan who became a soldier and how their paths crossed during the siege of Paris.
Every book about astronomy that is well written may often not add a lot of new information, yet it helps one  understand the the process better with better insight.
If you enjoy language, this book is for you.  The story as well holds your interest.  You wish more for a happy ending but in those times,it was often not the case.
This book follows multiple story lines over the course of several years, yet although the chapters are not always in chronological order you never seem to get lost.
Such a beautiful story. I felt I was there with them the whole way. It's always interesting to read WWll stories. This one is well documented and storied. Loved it.
Enjoyed this book! I read it in 2 days, which I don't do very often. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I didn't love the ending. Definitely worth reading!
I am moved by such an elegant telling of wonderful story.  It reminds me of a line from a prayer the medicine people of the Andes say, "open my heart so I can see."
Such a wrenching story.  Beautifully written.  The two main characters that are finally. Brought together by sound waves which had different meanings in their lives
This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.  The writing really drew me into the lives of the well developed characters.  I couldn't put it down!
A great story.  The author makes some curious vocabulary choices -- as if he used a thesaurus to substitute a fancier words for common ones -- all a little bit off.
Interesting story of two young children (a blind French girl and a promising young German orphan) during WWII.  It's fascinating to read how such "enemies" connect.
This is a view of WWII that is difficult to fathom for those of us a generation behind and a continent away.  So much suffering and so much courage.  Very humbling.
Enjoyed book slow going first half but  Enjoyed the second half so much more  would recommend it to others liked looking at the war from the viewpoint of both sides
This book leaves me with so many questions about how people deal with the unbearable.  Very creative, captivating tale with characters that you want to get to know.
For those of us who miss literature, those of us who return to Faulkner, Fitzgerald, O'connor, Sewald, etc., here is an effort at literature.  Thanks Anthony Doerr.
Unique perspective on how World War II affected the lives of those on both sides of the conflict and those living in occupied areas as well as serving in the field.
Great book!  A new slant on the WWII boy meets girl theme.  Very suspenseful at times.  I enjoyed the transfer from chapter to chapter involving the main character.
Rich and thoughtful writing ; beautifully paced. Wonderful characters, each giving us an insight into how they make sense of life.  A pleasure from start to finish.
Loved this book...... the wonderful descriptions took me right along with the characters without having to stretch my imagination.  Highly recomend this book.......
It was okay, not great. I understand why people liked it -- the story is very moving -- but it's sluggish at times and the resolution is no where near satisfactory.
This book is so descriptive, from beginning to end.  You are constantly imagining and thinking, sometimes confused.  It goes back and forth but always interweaving.
Doerr is an amazing wordsmith!  I am lucky to live in the same city as he does.  I am planning to read more of him.  "The Shell Collector" is wonderful too.
This book took awhile to get into.  It was a very interesting story of what it can mean to be blind and how effective propaganda can be to indoctrinate young minds.
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  The characters draw you in and the story will move you to tears.  I was sad to finish it.  Highly highly recommend
The book switched back and forth with characters and you have to stick with that until you get further in the book.  A bit of a twist towards the end of the novel.
Captivating story of two young people caught up in the horrible events of World War II Germany and France.  Good characterizations and incites into human bahavior.
I highlighted many descriptive passages in this gripping story.  The writing is superb.  Great insight into why we do what we do under extraordinary circumstances.
Story very good.  I did not like the reversing of chronological order of some chapters which required that I reorient my thinking for a short chapter of narrative.
A beautiful story about human kindness and compassion as contrasted to the egregious societal deterioration that evolved in Germany leading up to and during WW II.
One of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It is charming and very poignant. Can't say enough good. All the raves about this book are accurate and well earned
Loved this book. Historical novel, page turner. Great insight into each character. Made you feel the immense turmoils of the war times and the years that followed.
Beautiful Imagery and outstanding use of unusual vocabulary! Really stretched my thinking about lots of different illustrations of light and how we view the world!
Very nicely written. Interesting story and special characters.<br/>Another angel of this war that so many stories have been told about it. Could be a bit shorter.
It was very well crafted. It was a sensitive and warm style and showed a mature and deep understanding of human character. I loved the high quality of the writing.
Recommended read by a couple of book clubs. Multiple time/ era changes so my brother in law decided to make a map of the characters and the times for more clarity.
Stunning. Truly one of the greatest books I've ever read. These characters and this beautiful story will live in me for a very long time. Thank you, Anthony Doerr.
I could not put this book down.It is superbly written and tells a poignant story that you will never forget. Do yourself a favor and read it.  You won't regret it.
Excellent writing -- the descriptions are so good you feel like you are in the scene.  Very good plot development, that left the reader guessing, right to the end!
I was intimidated when I saw over 500 pages, but I could not put the book down.  I could actually empathize with the people in this story.  A very talented author.
I lived during the time of World War II.  The cruelty of the Nazi regime is not exxagerated.  This novel just tells of how it affected the lives of 2 young people.
I did not enjoy this book. This is not my style of reading. Had so many great reviews..I do not enjoy books about the war...<br/>I will stay with my mystery books
I could not put this book down! It was a beautiful story with great character development. It made me think of parts of the war that I had never considered before.
Brilliant writing, vivid details, thoroughly readable and relatable, but after all those exquisite details the book ends suddenly and without a feeling of closure.
This book grabs you from the first page...the story is intriguing, the imagery profound and the characters developed and interesting. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it
The story sets up slowly but is complex without being complicated. Very visual in descriptions using beautiful language. All the strands weave together in the end.
A thoughtful and compelling book .i particularly enjoyed Doerr's description of the main characters and what motivated them coming from such different backgrounds.
So many reviews to read by this book, deserving of many honours!  Check out all the awards...<br/>to my mind, as good as The Book Thief by Marcus Zusak.  READ it.
Beautifully developed characters. Although the book covers many years they flow together like a moment.  I was swept into the war from an entirely new perspective.
The story pulls the reader into Nazi Germany so well that one can hear the sounds,smell the smells and feel the emotions. I have already recommended it to friends.
Some aspects of the story were a bit unbelievable, but the main characters were unforgettable and I am still  "re-reading" the story in my head.  Loved it.
Although the action takes place during the 2WW, this is not a book on the war, but rather a book on how people behave during war.  The story is truly magnificent.
This author transports the reader to scenes one could never imagine on one's own knowledge of the war years of the 40s. this is an enthralling, well-crafted tale.
I had the privilege of hearing Anthony Doerr speak in Columbus, OH.  He is a very interesting man and a wonderful author.  The book is amazing historical fiction.
A remarkable novel that combines the personal and private pain of the war with the broader implications for society - time becomes another character - magnificent
Wonderful duel narrative! Love historical fiction and the perspectives were so interesting with the blind French girl and the German boy. Very thought provoking !
I loved this novel--it certainly held my attention till the very end and especially enjoyed the partial setting in a place like St. Malo. Doerr is a great writer.
It took me a while to get into this story, but once I did, I was hooked. I loved the sense of place and strongly identified with the characters. Great WWII story.
All the Light we Cannot See weaves the lives of uniquely diverse, interesting and challenged people into a fable of hope amidst destruction -- a mesmerizing tale.
Beautifully written!  I did have look up more words in my dictionary than usual. A thoughtful look into the lives of the French people during the Nazi occupation.
Did not like at first how short the chapters were but them they got longer and added more detail. Love the character of the blind child who really saw everything,
Very interesting especially the relationships between the French and the Germans. The cruelty of the Nazis were awful. It also shows mans resilience to adversity.
It is a mystery with an account of the second world war that shows aspects not usually seen in media or other accounts.  It was most interesting, and suspenseful.
WW2 as the world turns for the characters so marvelously created. I have so enjoyed the read. Recommend it to those who like a bit of historic truth in the novel.
Beautifully written, wonderful story. Different perspective on WWII, mainly through the eyes of children/teenagers, one German and one French. Highly recommended.
I have read other books about the Holocaust, but none that made me feel like this one.  It is well written and leaves you feeling as if you might have been there.
Liked that each chapter was about a different character.  Gave me some incite into What the youth of Nazi Germany endured as well as orphaned children of the era!
I cannot think of another book that so beautifully captures the raw emotion of the second world war with such beauty. These characters shall live with me forever.
an absolute heart breaking story,  a must to read it makes you so aware of the sorow, hardship people have been through, you just cant want to put this book down.
Great historical novel.  Some of the story left questions unanswered.  Our book club enjoyed the book.  It made for a good discussion.  Good discussion questions.
The book was slow because of all the going back and forth, but you got use to it soon enough.  The people were complex partly because their lives were so complex.
I needed a little more for the effort. Great story but never really grabbed me and made me want to read it like some books. Took too long and left me unsatisfied.
Extremely well written.  However, I do object to authors who try to impress with extensive use of difficult words.  I was constantly using the dictionary feature.
This book will be around forever! It's will become a classic! Beautiful images, thought provoking, excellent character development, and that stays with you story.
This book was a beautiful, poignant telling of a harsh and ugly story. Mr. Doerr has a gift and is generous in sharing it. This story will haunt me for some time.
A remarkable and moving story, told brilliantly, with some of the most evocative writing that I have come across in any novel that I've read in the past 10 years.
Great book!  One forgets the suffering of ordinary citizens during a war, and the horrors of occupation.  This was a beautiful<br/>story of humanity at it' best.
The author's written descriptions of the surroundings are poetic.  The short sub-chapters and the pacing are perfect.  It's a delight to read each and every page.
Found the flipping back and forth between the character story lines difficult at first to follow but as they're developed they became intertwined and fascinating.
A little long and choppy but a very good story, The character development is excellent.  Some of  the short chapters make the story not flow as well as it should.
Excellent book, very beautiful. Skillful way in which the two main characters gradually moved toward each other. Not your typical World War II book but very good.
I could not put this book down. Riveting from the very start. The prose was beautiful and the characters and plot well developed. I did not want this book to end!
This unexpected plot and execution held my attention. Good characters and a very unusual and intriguing story of two young people caught up in the horrors of WWii
I was so sad to have this book end  the story of two children from different countries and different world come together in one place in time<br/>Worth the read!
An amazing story (stories really) written in a most colorful prose...particularly ironic given the blindness of the main character.  I highly recommend this book.
The book is beautifully written, poetic.  The author was able to bring the characters to life and to show their humanity even in the most trying of circumstances.
It grabbed me from the start and held on to final chapter. It's well written, character's are meticulously developed and plot development flows at a perfect pace.
I could not put this book down.  So beautifully conceived and written. A touching tale about two children in a world of intrigue, war, hate, and ultimately, love.
I really enjoyed this book.  Wonderful characters and story.  The lives of a blind Fench girl and a brilliant German orphan during WWII is beautiful and very sad.
Sublimely written. Great story, beautiful glimpse into human relationship, and all set within one of history's darkest moments. Wildly impressive. Read this book.
An intriguing look at WWII through the perspective of the young who had to grow up and face the horrors of war.  Engaging flashback technique throughout the book.
Excellent book.  It highlights how bleak it must have been through the war years in both Germany and France from the eyes of children growing up through that era.
a beautiful, lyrical, yet honest recounting of World War II's effects on two particular people, with a range of well developed supporting characters. A must read.
Crisp writing style, and plot woven well.  The story of French non-combatants in World War II is told well and the indoctrination of German youth was interesting.
This book is beautifully crafted.  I wanted to keep reading but didn't want it to end. It's a shame cover doesn't invite picking up as it will deter many readers.
The characters enveloped me in, not only their story, but also in the way I actually felt their life, feelings, as they experienced such significant life changes.
I like the style of writing. The story alternates between two characters and jumps from the past to the present (which would be World War II for the characters.)
Excellent character development and plot surprises, but became very tedious in the middle.  I almost gave up on finishing it,but the ending was worth hanging in.
Slow start but I loved the intimate view on the war. A very good view on how the war impacted people in general. Good read, a little sad but very well explained.
His descriptions were so rich you could picture each character.  I found it slow going here and there, but kept on going knowing that I'd be rewarded in the end.
The author clearly expressed events and tragedies, pulling the reader in and not letting him go till the end. I also had to look up several words, which I loved.
Not a terrible book but I didn't like it as much as many people did. The last quarter of the book could have been written in 5 pages. It dragged on way too long.
One of those you can't put down. I found myself reading all day Saturday and into Sunday morning to finish it. I haven't done that in many years, felt wonderful.
Should be requiredReading for anyone wanting to go to war- it lends humanity to the romanticized notion of war and the trail of destruction it leaves in its wake
Most of us only know of WWII through Fathers and Grandfathers. This brings it to life and makes the reader aware of the horrors to the innocent people of France.
This is a book you will remember for a long, long time. The characters are wonderfully drawn, the story moving, and the history important. I recommend it highly.
Will read it again sometime to understand further the complexities of the people and times. It was really interesting to see the convergence of all the cultures.
Very well done.  Doesn't fall into the stereotypes of characters as many WWII books do.  These are complex characters that continue to draw you into their lives.
An incredible read, could not put it down. Seeing a side of humanity and wartime struggle from many perspectives, not "happy" or "sad". A picture of life in WW2.
Very well written.  The ending is a little weak, but the book overall and the story is excellent.  One of the best books I have read in the last two years or so.
One of the best books I have read in a long time. The writing was excellent. The characters were well drawn and realistic. The author is a master at description.
I enjoyed the book but It took a while for me to get through it.  The author paints a detailed picture with short sentences. I had to take break often to absorb.
What I liked most was Doerr's talent for painting pictures with words. Using words in an uncommon manner. Also the interweaving of time made interesting reading.
Highly imaginative, nostalgic and reflective on life as it was ... And may be still.  Recommended for romantics, the curious, and those who wonder, what is life?
Two very interesting characters who should never interacted but then, circumstances caused it to happen. It also shows the goodness that can be hidden in people.
A very interesting novel.  One you want to keep reading and not put down.  I highly recommend it.  Great discription  of the sufferings of people during wartime.
Well developed characters during a war that changes their souls. Anthony Doerr weaves a tale that connects his feelings of war into a perfect veil of aquamarine.
A magical tale with the lesson that there are always two sides to every story.  I Just loved it and hope everyone who reads it finds it as great a read as I did.
You may be transformed into this minds eye of fictional history so clearly that you may forget your cares and woes.<br/>My thanks to this author, Anthony Doerr.
it was an interesting read, the characters are fleshed out and the visual sense I got from the historical setting was amazing, I could actually see myself there.
Deep profound and excellent, if you like historical  stories go for it. It is one of those stories that stays with you and make you appreciate your life as it is
One of best books I've read it long time.  Keeps reader enthralled right to the end.  Written with such skill that reader can actually be in that time and place.
One of the best books I've read.  Beautifully written.  The characters demonstrate the toll war takes on people, especially those with a conscience, like Werner.
This a beautiful story, well written and flows easily from one character to another. I usually don't like novels about wars but this one really held my interest.
Interesting, engrossing for much of the book's considerable length. The final chapters were less easily interpolated into the world into which we had been drawn.
A wonderful cinematic historical fiction piece that lets you understand how insignificant you are in the universe, yet your potential of importance to the world.
The story of lives of all kind of people in Europe during World War 2 especially that of young French girl that is blind and a young German boy is very talented.
Once I started this book I couldn't put it down, and I didn't want it to end.  I loved the characters and how they were carefully woven together to the very end.
I just finished this book and believe it may be one of my all time favorites. I stumbled upon this one and the haunting, gorgeous writing has forever changed me.
The story is magical and horrifying.  The characters are so subtly drawn.  The ideas especially those contained in the final sections are ingenious.  I loved it.
This is a wonderful book about human capabilities, both for good and for evil. The language is often poetic; the characters are memorable. I recommend it highly.
An incredible novel that gives a uniquely personal view of WWll. The intertwining of characters throughout this novel is fascinating. Highly recommend this book!
simply a wonderful book.....brings the tragic events of The War to light, how it affected EVERYONE, not just military....sad, but wonderful....amazing author....
Real life goes on. Have the courage to accept what cannot be changed and the resiliency to continue to try as long as possible to be better today than yesterday.
Loved it, although thought it was very sad. Was very interesting how all of the characters were tied together. Amazed at bravery of some and brutality of others.
This book is well written, although it did take me several chapters to become totally engrossed. It is a story of survival, love and family. This is a must read.
I enjoyed this  book-heart breaking description of the effects of that era on so many people and for so long; irrevocable changes in such a short amount of time.
Superbly written with a wonderful story line. However, for me, the ending fizzled and left me disappointed. Why the author chose such a bland finish is baffling.
I enjoyed this book.  the authors use of descriptions were very vivid and made me feel I was actually there and seeing through the eyes of that sweet little girl
This book has such a well written and poignant storyline. I found myself being emersed in each characters story; I couldn't wait to turn the page and keep going.
I rarely stop reading a book before I finish-- but that's what happen with this one---It never got my attention-it just kept repeating the same thing again and again
One of the best novels I've read in a long time.  This author is amazing - and thorough.  We know  Saint Malo well and I could picture myself there.  Well done!
It took awhile to figure out how the story is being told - but the writing is terrific and I will undoubtedly buy another book by the same author Anthony Doerr.
A splendid historical-based novel of the day-to-day survival of WW II by French and German citizens, mostly children....in the beginning.  An incredible read!!!
Excellent portrayal of the lives during the German occupation of France in WWII.  Fully developed characters and interesting plot turns.  Certainly a good read.
Well-written! Amazing character development throughout the novel; bonds and long lasting  relationships that are powerful and bring the reality of War to light.
I think it's a very compelling story and I really enjoyed it. It is written beautifully and had a moving plot. At halfway through, I couldn't put the book down.
Great story line- well developed characters that really got you thinking about these characters and what they were going through.  I highly recommend this book.
This book exceeded all of my expectations. Beautiful, unforgettable imagery. Absolutely transporting. I'll enthusiastically seek out other books by this author.
A touching story of two young people caught in the uncertain and tragic time prior to WWII and wartime.  Interesting subplots are artfully woven into the story.
Finished this book in 1.5 days. Couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end. The ending seemed a bit rushed but I loved the whole story. Definitely a re-read
I enjoyed this book so very much.  Shifting back & forth between the two main characters was brilliant.  It's a great story that is told in a very creative way.
Great read, well defined characters.  I marveled at the strength of such young kids and felt compassion for there loss of innocence.  War is not a pretty thing.
A very touching novel with interweaving lives during world war 2. The characters are fully realized and one becomes very sympathetic to the two main characters.
I definitely recommend this book. It's a light easy reading fiction novel, but at the same time a very hard to put down book. It kept me engaged the entire time
Not since Grapes of Wrath have I been so moved by a book. A beautiful aching story that forces you to care. Should be required reading for high school students.
Fresh perspective on an era that has been written about thousands of times. Loved getting to know the many layers of each character. Fast read for a thick book.
We are brought into the lives of people on both sides of the war.  We see that everyone suffers, no one is exempt.<br/>It is sad and glorious at the same time.
I absolutely loved this book.  I read through it so fast and I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  I definately recommend this book.  It is a great readl.
I loved this book!  It had everything - suspense, interesting characters, historical setting, perserverence, friendhship and love.  What more could you ask for?
This story took a few tries to set the hook.  Once set, impossible to set down.<br/>I both read and listened, completely transported to another time and place.
I ordered this for my Kindle.  I really am enjoying it but I am only at 20% into it.  But so far very interesting and good read.  It is our next book club book.
Excellent read by an author whose words come to life.  Doerr has a way of telling a story that makes the reader feel the raw emotions of each of the characters.
So much has been written about WWII but this story weaves it's way into your heart and soul. I could not put it down and I was sad when it ended.  A rare treat.
Classically written in the prose of Hemingway with the detail and precision of Michael Crichton. Two stories weave an intricate plot with wonderful parallelism.
This novel was the first for me so I cannot compare with his other novels. If this novel reflects his usual style,  I will read other novels written by Mr Doer.
Loved this story, where everyone was a victim during a calamitous time in the 20th century and yet was able to find some meaning and purpose for their existence
A very well written and developed book.  I run a book club and this was our monthly selection.  It lead to an interesting discussion and the members enjoyed it.
I was also skeptical about reading another WW2 book, but it is wonderfully written. The characters are complex and realistic, the plot well woven I recommend it
A well written story, even though it moved slowly at times, and the back and forth between different time periods in the main characters' lives was distracting.
Anthony Doerr captures the human element in startling prose. The story is brutally true to itself, unwavering and haunting. This book is nothing short of magic.
This is a novel that is hard to put down once you have started reading it. It is well written and sounds like a true story. It is one of the best out this year.
A beautifully written book following the two lives of pre-teen and teenagers in Europe during the thirties and forties.  Really enjoyed it! Book club next week!
So nice to read a really well written book. The story is not a predictable formula like so many books. The characters are three dimensional and very believable.
This is undoubtedly one of best WW II historical said have ever read. Highly recommend for adults and younger readers. This story would make an excellent movie.
Well written, enjoyable read.  Recommend reading it.<br/>Young adults would enjoy this book as well as adults.<br/>WWII story about blind girl and German boy.
Wonderful, complex story with finely drawn characters written in the most beautiful language possible. Couldn't put it down. It's on my short list of favorites.
I loved/love this novel.  I learned something from it and was engaged by the story lines.  It's one of the best books I've read --- it keeps coming back to me.
a perfect book, beautifully written, profound and infinitely sad. if i have ever read a book that was so enjoyable and the prose so perfect - it was this novel
Absolutely loved this book. Great story of two young people face war not only externally but internally and how their seemly differently lives are intertwined.
One of the best books. Doerr is a master story-weaver.  Seamlessly travel through WW2 to present day from the viewpoints of 2 teens.  Enthralling. A must read.
Effects of war movingly portrayed based on amazing research detail. . .I sensed the endiing and found myself stalling to finish. . .sign of a captivating read!
The subject matter was interesting, as was the character development.  The language and descriptions were so well done I could envision what he was describing.
Very poetic read. So insightful as to the lives of all people during the Second World War. The characters are well developed in short chapters. Loved the book.
Great book! Well written, capturing, pure enjoyment. Makes you want to travel (again) to St. Malo. Those of us who're interested in WWII will love it even more
A World War II novel told from a French and German perspective.  This book would fall under historical fiction and is woven so amazingly well. Lovely, but sad.
Beautiful writing. Original way to look at WW II through the eyes of two very different characters that somehow become connected in the end. Very moving story.
Magnificent book, would HIGHLY recommend. This is a fantastic book, Doerr is a great writer, love this book! Magical, thriller, historical all rolled into one.
Definitely Pulitzer Book quality. I enjoyed the back and forth chapters alternating the young French girl and the young German man with some random characters.
I very much enjoyed this novel except I would have preferred the end be less realistic. It's well written and after I got in to it, the story held my interest.
Amazing story telling. It brings me to a place I feel I've been and don't want to leave. I highly recommend reading as well as referring this incredible novel.
I really enjoyed this intriguing story and it still leaves you wondering what really happened and all the "could haves" and "should haves"..!!!
Beautifully written, haunting and engrossing.  I dreamt about these characters.....I was so sad when it came to an end.....I cannot recommend it highly enough.
This is an excellent book. I enjoyed all of the different characters. Would recommend to anyone that likes a good story with a plot with many twist and turns.
Beautifully written story of characters surviving through world war 2. They did a great job of getting you invested in their lives. Would definitely recommend
It was a bit of slow going for a very fast reader. BUT, I did want to find out how it ended. I kept at it, and in the end I am glad I read it. Nicely written.
I loved this book. It gives a whole new outlook on the war. What a strong, wonderul woman the main character is. I walked in her shoes through the whole book!
Love showered by the father on  his blind daughter equipped her to face incredible challenges--a very different war story with a hauntingly beautiful quality.
A wonderful read.  Doerr writes in such a descriptive and interesting way and he completely draws you into his characters.  I enjoyed every page of this book.
I read this really fast for me.  I got to love the characters and when it started to wrap up I was really sorry to see it end.  I would recommend this to all.
It took me a while to get into this book. But I loved it. The beautiful way it is written, the characters and the development of the plot are worth your time.
I know I am in the small minority here but I had to push myself to finish this book.  It is certainly well written but the plot really dragged along at times.
"Great book": when you know what's coming and still can't put it down. Interwoven stories and the historical context of war and destruction and its aftermath.
I couldn't put this book down. It's heartbreaking and fascinating.  I feel like I would know these characters if I met them on the street. What a lovely book.
Bought this book for my grandmaw because this was what she wanted very fast shipping and the best price I had found. She loves the book and can't put it down.
How technology changes our world.  It seems it gets easier to forget the past even though we are now capable of recording our every step on Social media etc..
One of the best I have read. I'm sure other reviews are better written adn more in-depth but let me just add that the novel is well written and very readable.
Doerr is a master at helping his readers experience the sights, sounds, and feelings of the characters in his book. I enjoyed this read from beginning to end!
This has been a most interesting book to read.The characters come to life and you can almost be there with them.Different emotional challenges for the reader,
Loved everything about this book. The author has an incredible ability to describe ability to describe a scene as if you were there experiencing it firsthand.
Beautifully written and beautifully plotted. I couldn't stop turning the pages. Loved the suggestion of the magical -- but I don't want to give anything away.
A beautiful and poetic narrative. Good people surviving and dying but creating an existence.  New and moving story of mankind dealing with the madness of war.
The characters will haunt you long after the book is finished. I found myself researching many of the locations in the novel and the role they played in WWII.
Every character feels real. Everts scene lives. When you finish it all  becomes part of your lens through which to connect with the world. Poetic and lyrical.
Good descriptions of sites during the war--all sides.  Very good characterizations of each person.  I especially enjoyed the point of view if the blond girl..
It was not only a remarkable story but contained a lot of history.  It was amazing all that a young blind girl could do and learn. She had a fantastic memory.
Excellent read.  Characters were all filled out so you could see the reasoning and motivations for their actions.  Setting the book between Germany and France focusing on the children and effect the war had on their life's was a different twist.<br/><br/>Definitely will advise friends to read this book
Great read. Quick chapters that were perfect for bedtime reading. A beautiful, engaging story that reads like a fiction despite Nazi Europe being all to real.
Although the author uses the writing trick of switching back and forth between his main characters, it works here. The effects of war are vivid and memorable.
this book is beautiful without being cheesy. With a realistic and perfectly crafted story, it will hook you in at page 1 and you'll enjoy every sentence of it
This book will appeal to anyone that is interest in WW2 history, science, physics and personal relationships. It is one of the best books that I've ever read.
An enjoyable read, start to finish. Great story and characters. THIS is the kind of absorbing book experience I look for when perusing book lists and reviews.
This was a very enjoyable read for me.  Doerr's style is very engaging and eloquent.  The ending was not what I would have liked, but then, it's just a story!
This was an excellent book.  I was intrigued and pleased with the easy prose and interesting take on a World War II story.  Loved it and I recommend it highly
For anyone who loves historical fiction with wonderful characters. A tale of war, the great destruction of both cities and man, and the humanity we all share.
Beautifully written, all The Light We Cannot See, reveals the failure of The Nazi mentality in the face of perseverance, intellect,<br/>compassion, and love.
Well written but one needs to read the beginning for a while to keep track of the different time zones.  The ending was hasty.  Beautiful prose almost poetic.
My second Anthony Doerr novel; extremely well written story line. A bit repetitive, I wish the book moved faster toward the touching and wonderful conclusion.
Thank you very much.
Perfect in every way
What a moving story!
Loved this book!!!!!
WOW  a very good book.  I'm not really a fan of WWII books, but this one was fantastic.  This will be one of those books that I read again from time to time.
Reads as easy as any novel and as  beautiful as any poem.  Captures youthful dreams and desires and deftly molds them into cherished memories of a long life.
Enjoyed the history.  The structure of the book kept my attention and I didn't want to put it down.  Enjoyed following the characters and enjoyed the ending.
I have been stuck in a rut! I haven't enjoyed any fiction in a while...only nonfiction. However, All the Light We Cannot See had me from the start! Gripping!
All the Light You Cannot See has well developed characters living through the dangers of World War II.  The plot is interesting and the writing is excellent.
Incredible story that makes you feel like you're watching a movie. Overall really great book. Recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the nazi history.
Amazing story.  Outstanding word crafting (so glad I read it on Kindle so I could use the dictionary -  many uncommon words that were perfectly descriptive).
Wonderful writing and trip through WWII from various viewpoints.  War is such a waste. It all stems from wanting. We would be better off with a zen approach.
Wow! I just finished it...and I can still barely breathe because of the beauty of it. Thank you, Anthony Doerr, for opening up my soul. Your prose is prayer.
The characters are well drawn.The universality of war's agony whether one is French or German, English or Russian.The strength and power of the human spirit.
Richly woven tales of the ugliness of war, the incredible sacrifices and hardships of prior generation along with the endearing resolve of the human spirit.
Riveting page turner, different than any other book I have red about experiencing WWII. Worth the length of the book, and easy to read as the Kindle version
I so enjoyed reading from the two main characters perspectives at their very young ages.  The trials and tribulations both endured.  I wanted it to continue
Masterfully written. I felt the love of the father for his daughter. I celebrated the discovery of new worlds and the meaningfulness of a fight for freedom.
Overall a wonderfully written book that kept me engaged throughout. Only complaint is when reading it on a Kindle it was hard to keep track of the timeline.
Beautiful and heartfelt narrative only an outstanding and skilled storyteller could accomplish. Long but worth reading. Highly recommended to all passionate souls.
Good story about WWII from a French perspective.  All nicely interwoven with family values.  Nicely dove-tailed plot.  A feeling of non-fiction.  Good read.
I am about 1/2 way through the book. Setting, 1934-1944, Paris and Berlin, mostly. Another perspective on life in Europe during those years.<br/>Recommend.
The most beautiful book I have ever read. A wonderfully detailed yet fast paced novel that delves into the complexities of human emotion in the face of war.
Enjoyed this story! A friend from France told me how it was during the German occupation and the story seems accurate...sadly for BOTH sides during the war.
The story goes back and forth between time periods and I found it a bit confusing.  However the story kept me reading to try to find out what was happening.
Great book!  Very sad though so have some tissues ready. I love the characters in the story. First book I've read by the author but won't be the last I hope
One of those rare books that combines beautiful writing, thematic elements, and a page-turning plot all at the same time. Perfect for a book-club selection.
The book was extremely well written. I felt like I was experiencing the same things as the characters.  I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend it.
It's a book that all generations need to read and learn the process of destruction that lead to that dark time in our world's history so we don't repeat it.
This is a moving story of WW2 showing the tragedy of the war and how evil men caused so much pain and suffering to ordinary people who triumphed in the end.
Although a little confusing to start, this book easily trnsports one back to that horrible era and does provide loads of "light" so that we can see.
Well written book that shows some of the incredibly difficult decisions that must be made to keep ourselves whole even if it will harm us in the short term.
A riveting story of how WWII determined the lives of two young people and how the intersection of their lives for a brief moment created an unusual outcome.
A great novel.  Beautifully written, woven with metaphors and symbols, and yet at the same time  it's a  page turner.  Follow the characters as they spiral toward a single vortex.  It deserves a Pulitzer in my opinion.
A real page turner.  Many sympathetic characters and a plot that has a unique point of view being being weaved from multiple sides.  A great book club read.
One of the greatest books of all times.  The language is brilliant.  The story is filled.with the beauty of the human spirit. A modern classic for all time.
Beautifully written. A touching story about the life of a young German boy and a blind French girl during the German occupation of France. Highly recommend.
This book is one of the best read I've read in years. Shows the toll of war on humanity. I read the writing took the author 10 years to complete. Well done.
I very much enjoyed this unusual and captivating story. Interesting, I particularly loved the perspectives from two children thrust by history on two sides.
Very well written story.  The characters come alive in your mind and you can visualize the many different settings in the story.  Was very hard to put down.
Poignant. Beautifully written. This novel and the individuals portrayed will stay with you for a long time. A loving tribute to the human survival instinct.
See above the basis of evaluation written about the fragmentation that compromises rambling descriptive attempts to protract a story about a material object
I generally like the page turning quality of mysteries.  This was a page turner without being a whodunit.  Great sense of time and place.  A fantastic read.
Beautifully written.  Elegant and engrossing.  Deeply, deeply moving.  Sad to have finished it.  I would recommend this without a single bit of reservation.
The book was excellent and I would highly recommend it. Throughout the book there was so many descriptive scenes. I would love to see it made into a movie!
Great story content. Sometimes the author seemed to take too long to get to the point. ("come on...get on with the story...enough about the mollusks!!)
Maybe I'm missing something but I didn't love this book. I was moderately engaged. I'm not upset I read it but wouldn't feel like I missed out if I hadn't.
All The Light We Cannot See will be read in schools and colleges for years to come. It transcends the "good read" category, moving into literature.
Excellent character development; historically interesting and insightful. Often hard to remember the correct chronology of the story - sometimes confusing,
Great characterisation ....really got to know the characters.  Something lacking in this book...it did not have "soul" and became somewhat tedious.
This is a historical fiction novel full of beautiful prose. The imagery is so intense, yet so simple. It's like no other WWII historical fiction I've read.
Great story about the rise of Germany into  World War II. Interesting to read about the background of the Hitlers elite race and the willingness to follow.
I am happy to get one more book that is stick in my heart. I will go back to this story in my dreams. True story about everything...<br/><br/>Alex Lokhin
Excellent. The author places you in each setting, acquaints you with each character, and successfully shares all the beauty of life and the terrors of war.
I am suspicious of novels which are too popular. But this one is truly beautiful. Well wrought, moving, both tragic and optimistic. It as nard to put down.
Be patient as the story develops. Many times I put the book down thinking I would give up. By page 260 I became hooked and I can now say I loved this book.
Beautifully written book! I loved the imagery, the character development and the foreshadowing. One of my favorite books of all time. I plan to retread it.
One of the best book I have read.  I am a bit of a WW11 buff so I really enjoyed the French and German point of view.  I have recommended it to my friends.
This may well be my favorite book --ever. I loved the story, the characters and their development, the use of language, the imagery, the ideas--great book!
I found it hard to put this book down.  Both the story and the writing of it are compelling.  The characters are authentic and the events are believe able.
Ex cellent read about a worthless situation. So much has been said about WW 2 but this is a good new way of looking at the tradgedy of the whole situationk
What a wonderful read!!! Learned so much, made me think about the times, the people, the "mood" of the times and how people reacted to those times!
Best novel I have read in years.  I am a retired English teacher; this should become a classic for sure along with works of Hemingway, Wharton, Fitzgerald.
Exquisite weaving of a tale of survival and loss. Why war? The hunger and desperation is palpable. Unique in its point of view. Well Worth it. A good read.
I hated to see it end and will read it again, something I rarely do.  Beautifully written and I will remember it as one of the best books I have ever read.
Well written prose. Sentences evoke vivid imagery. Themes that run through the book are timeless, but the closure is not a neat and tidy fairy tale ending.
Touching, tragic and full of love for family, courage, cowardice and the far-reaching consequences of our choices when we are spiritually or morally blind.
This is a well written, captivating story. It resonates on many levels and weaves stories within stories. In the end it just a fabulous read to be enjoyed.
How can words take you to so many places simultaneously - and by 'places' I mean emotions and time, metaphorically and historically? This work is inspired.
I Could not put this book down and did not want it to end.  It was great to read a story about two children's perspectives of the war.
Well written story about two characters who experience WWII in very different ways.  The author weaves their stories together like a finely stitched quilt.
A very well written book both that somehow feels light and airy even when dealing with difficult and hurtful subjects.  I look forward to Doerr's next book
Exquisite writing, memorable characters, I hated to finish.  Captures the heartbreak of war through a story so vividly told I feel like I know the players.
Incredible writing. Genius. One, if not THE best books I have ever read. Spectacular in its scope and depth of feeling for the people and the times. WOW!!!
I would recommend this book to anyone with a soul. It is a heart rending and beautifully written story that seems to give the ultimate perspective on life.
A  masterpiece.  A book about caring not killing.<br/>I  will recommend it to my children and my grandchildren.<br/>I put it down only to eat and  sleep.
Really well written. I enjoyed taking my time with it. Recommend to anyone interested in the WW II period and the perils of being a civilian in war time...
This book did not disappoint. What a privilege it is to be able to read such an amazing story. This is one of the best historical fiction I have ever read.
Not just another WWII story.  Though sad, it is a story of survival well told. It also reminds us of just how recently the incomprehensible war took place.
A beautiful story, well written with terrific imagery and emotionally satisfying. The characters will stay with you long after you've turned the last page.
A heart-rending novel giving a personal view of the tragedies and love born in Germany and France during WWII.  Believable characters in a compelling plot.
Very interesting perspectives illustrated. As an instructor of visually impaired children, I found the character, Marie very well depicted. Excellent read.
It was a little hard to get into, but then I couldn't put it down. Riveting portrait of the fear felt by ordinary citizens, French and German, during WWII.
Sweet story that spans history and geography, family and war, natural history and man made dramas. Redemption and resolution prevail in the end. Good read.
Hope it is made into a movie would love to see the landscapes of France Paris and Germany. Such a touching story to survive a unbelievable time in history.
All the Light we Cannot See was a wonderful read and I have recommended it to a number of people.  The characters were engaging and the history interesting
I thought I was not interested in another WWII book, but this author can really write!  I was taken away and couldn't stop reading.  Didn't want it to end.
This novel gives a new prospective to World War II.  The descriptions were so real I felt I was there experiencing the everyday trauma of the agony of war.
A beautiful and simultaneously heartwarming yet heartbreaking story. Doerr's muscular imagery and metaphor fills nearly description in this brilliant book.
I enjoyed this deeply sad story about life's hardships during war. I loved the closeness of the characters. The author has a special gift of story telling.
Such  a beautiful and unique story. I loved the way the author built the story and kept me interested in each little chapter.  I enjoyed it cover to cover.
This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  Beautifully written with amazing character development and story line.  I could not put it down.
I DON'T GET THESE GLOWING REVIEWS!  I bought this on audible and after a multiple attempts in what seemed like a slow painful slog I returned it. On balance, I enjoy most genres of book.  Although it's true that I am not a history buff.  I just found this plodding and not interesting.  I suppose that this is because as a student, I studied WWII far more than I care to so I found this book factually generically accurate and very slow paced.  I did not develop a lasting interest in any of the characters or the story.  I was intrigued by the title however I did not get to find out All The Light We Cannot See.
Fantastic human micro approach to World War 2. Individuals impacted and relationships upheld and destroyed. Meaningful!!!Very well done and worth reading.
This story is the story of war and of its victims.  So it is the story of all wars.  Told through a boy and a girl, told through history, told with grace.
in metaphor, character, cultural connections and interwoven stories. If you like the Book Thief and The City of Thieves this is like completing a "trilogy".
"All the light we cannot see" was a pleasure to read. I've  highly recommended it to friends and family. Look forward to reading another by Anthony Doerr.
A perfectly written tale of human interaction during a time of upheaval like no other.  FInd time to start it.  You will certainly make time to finish it.
Amazing story. Facing the challenges of an occupied France during WW11 would be hard enough, but to face it as a young, blind girl made the story amazing.
Well written novel, very touching.  We should never forget the atrocities Hitler and the Nazis committed and how the German youth was totally brainwashed.
A difficult read but definitely worth the effort.  I've read a lot of World War II novels but this one presented a new perspective of this historical era.
Very moving WW II novel about a genius German youth dragged into the Reich and a blind French girl suffering thru German occupation.  Wonderfully written.
I really enjoyed this book.  As the two main characters spiral toward each other, you wonder how and when they will meet.  I was said when the book ended.
Gives you a true feeling of living during wartime and how quickly a country of people can further causes they don't understand because they are clueless.
Another deep look at a very sad time in our history. Beautifully written, full of surprises, tragic circumstances, the beauty and sadness of being human.
Sensitive and poetic with two main characters who meet only briefly but are exquisitely rendered. Lovely and extremely moving. Deserving of the Pulitzer.
One of the best, most thought provoking and insightful novels I have read in years. More than mere entertainment, but a page-turner in a different sense.
This is one of the best novels I have ever read. Doerrs writing style is intriguing and masterful. Definitely will seek out all the books he has written.
This is a very moving book told from two very individual perspectives regarding the impact of World War II on their lives and those around it.  Fabulous.
It was hopeful to me.  It was so real and eye opening.  To my Mother, who had been through the end of the war, it brought up many sad, but real memories.
Loved the writing. Gripping for sure. Ending petered out.<br/>Felt sympathetic toward characters I shouldn't have - wished for more resolution for them.
This is the best book I have read in a long time. The descriptions are written so well.  Often I would go back and re-read a paragraph to enjoy it again.
This is an excellent novel with wonderful character development, a compelling story and incredible imagery. It is very well-written and hard to put down.
A well written book that goes nowhere.  Most of my friends who have read it were angry at the author.  So much potential waisted and a big waist of time.
Excellent writing, lost in story and character, never felt pulled out to a writer saying look at me, look at me. Truly literary and wonderfully readable!
What a beautifully written story!  I could barely put it down; when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about reading it.  Worthy of all its accolades...
Enjoyed it very much.<br/>Descriptions were vivid and could feel the emotions of the characters.<br/>Wish the author would have allowed Werner to live.
Beautifully written book from the perspective of a young French girl in Paris and s young German boy caught up on devastating events during Workd War II.
I could write a paper on how great this book is but instead I will just keep recommending it to anyone who love great writing and wonderful storytelling.
The plot was wonderful, the literary style was simply outstanding!  You will want to devour this book as soon as you read the first page<br/><br/>Enjoy
One of the most well written novels that I have read in some time.  Wonderful time movement and outstanding development of characters.  Just plain grand!
Thought provoking story, beautifully written. I savored the last half of the book, reading more and more slowly, as I really didn't want the book to end.
Excellent book.  Our book club really enjoyed it.  It was a great discussion book.  We learned about<br/>blindness, war, and the bad and good in people.
An eye-opening story of how war affects those who were merely born in the wrong place and time. All lives are affected in some way, and scars do not heal
A WONDERFULLY DESCRIPTIVE LOOK  AT THE LIFE OF A YOUNG BOY IN GERMANY DURING THE WAR AND A YOUNG BLIND GIRL IN FRANCE DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME>
Superb book<br/>  It revealed the emotions  of both sides.  From the First to the end<br/>The ending was right even though I wanted it to be  different
Grabs your attention from the start especially if you love WWII French Resistance. You immediately get involved with the characters and interesting plot.
Amazing book, loved how the author wove the story of 2 individuals together so that you couldn't put the book down on your journey to<br/>the conclusion
I really liked this book.  There was a beauty represented by a love that may have been blind to others, but very visible to a blind girl.  Worth reading.
Beautifully written, emotionally charged-I reread many passages, I could visualize everything the author described-I have given six copies to my friends·
A tender story interwoven with the callousness and brutality of war. Strong, likeable characters, lots of imagery, and interesting historical references.
This is not the kind of book I typically read. I need to be more open to what I read. Wonderful look at the terrible consequences suffered on both sides.
Poignant  This novel gathered speed as it went. Having recently visited Paris and Normandy, the depictions of occupied France were especially meaningful.
It takes awhile to get into this book but persevere. Your perseverance will be rewarded!  The story centers on 2 major characters and several minor ones.
Deep into the night, reading, waking in the morning reading. That kind of grip!<br/>Read kit till it's done gripping me. You will like this book- a lot.
This was a page turner.  The back an forth of two very interesting characters and how their lives crossed paths.  This is a definite "Must Read".
Thoroughly enjoyed!! The writing is so vivid, I could picture myself in each location - smell the ocean, taste the peaches ... Surprised by the ending!!!
I enjoyed the book very much, the in depth story of life in France during WWII.  Having a blind girl as the main character made it even more interesting.
Don't let the length out you off.  Moody and melodious, I found the short chapters moving between characters and time periods mesmerizing yet fast reads.
Delicately written, with vivid language and characters that move into your heart and stay there. A deep view of life during an impossible troubling time.
Beautifully written historical fiction; historians and fans of authors who can turn a phrase will be wishing for more when the book concludes. Loved it !
I love to read - just not this. I read 80 or so pages and couldn't bear to waste 500+ more pages of my time.
I believe I have found a new favorite author. The story rolls along smoothly, some paragraphs are so lyrical I save them so I can read them again later.
Read this book for book club and really didn't want to read about war but WWII was only the back drop. Interesting, well developed characters and story.
LOVED THIS BOOK! I've put all of Anthony Doerr's books on my wishlist.  Highly recommend it to anyone who loves a great story that evokes every emotion.
I can definitely see what it has been on the best seller list!  It is a great read and you fall in love with and are inspired by some of the characters.
Just finished this for book club. Fascinating characters and a good look at the lives of a young German soldier and a young French civilian during WWII.
Very interesting perspective about the Holocaust. Beautifully written... I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for another perspective of this history.
I haven't read a book this well-written in a very, very long time. Breathtaking imagery and memorable characters make this book one to read and re-read.
Very good, enjoyed the action and interaction of all the players and the Germany setting<br/>Reading another novel by Anthony Doerr this one is strange
Really liked this novel. The end disappointed somewhat as the conclusions of the main characters lives were narrated. Maybe I just like happier endings.
Engrossing theme & storylines, beautifully told. Many fascinating characters, larger than life concepts, weaving plotlines make for a fantastic reading.
Very well written. Found that I couldn't put down. Characters are so intriguing and interesting. For those who enjoy WWII novels, this is a good choice.
Enjoyed Doerr's writing style.  Made me feel as though I were there at times.  Especially interesting getting so many different perspectives of the war.
Masterful storytelling, beautiful writing, touching, thought-provoking. We may not see light but we can see into hearts through writing as fine as this.
I read the first chapter and literally gasped at Anthony Doerr's breathtaking sentences. If you know that language can be transcendent, read this novel.
VERY INTERESTING BOOK AND STORY.  ALITTLE CONFUSING BECAUSE IT JUMPED AROUND FROM PERSON TO PERSON BUT IT DID COME TOGETHER.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.
excellent book, very thoughtful, gives you a real insight into just how  many people suffered during the 2nd world war, Germans<br/>certainly included.
I just finished the book and I am still wondering,what happened to the diamond?? Did I miss something? The ending dragged on and there was no resolution
I could not put this book down...didn't want to leave a single one of the characters Anthony created when sleep overtook the need to stay close to them.
This is a story beautifully told of "real" people in a "real" time, in "real" places , that needed to be told to all of the real world in our real time.
Beautifully written, Doerr is truly a wordsmith. He brings a new light to the well documented WWII years in both side of the conflict. A wonderful read.
I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The story envelops the reader completely.  The characters capture the reader's imagination.
I loved this book. It's very different from other Holocaust era novels. The writing is beautiful, lyrical. I really appreciated the short chapters, too.
I enjoyed reading this. I was confused by some of the timeline jumps. Overall a great specific look at the ways the war affected 2 separate individuals.
What a gift of a story. There are few books I finish and know I will want to revisit, but this is definitely on that short list. Thank you to Mr. Doerr.
What a great book. I was kind of bummed when I finished it because I was enjoying the read so much. It will be a tough act to follow with  my next book!
I felt as if I were floating as I read "All the Light...".  It has the most beautiful prose and loveliest story I have read<br/>In years.  Magnificent!
They cross the Channel at midnight. There are twelve and they are named for songs: Stardust and Stormy Weather and In the Mood and Pistol- Packin’ Mama.
A completely satisfying novel. Beautifully written and soulful. I find myself thinking about the characters long after having finished reading the book.
A wonderfully woven tail that orchestrates the power of the mind, the power of compassion and the power of survival.  Its a bit long but it is worth it.
beautifully written.What a great read.<br/>The characters were so well developed that it made the story real to life.<br/>Did not want to put it down.
Beautiful, lyrical, and life-affirming! I was immersed in Doerr's world from the opening pages. By far one of the best books I have read in a long time!
One of the best I have read recently,  it is surprising how much some children can live thru.<br/>And it shows there is good people in both side in war
What a marvelously written book, a story at once both terrifying and hopeful, of two young people who save each other in the dark days of World War II.
Wonderful, you fall in love with the young girl, and young man,  whose lives crossed but who meet only momentarily, Great to learn history in this way.
Great character development, horrific descriptions of world war 2 atrocities, all told through the eyes of two separate teenagers. Touching and moving.
It was hard to put this book down. The story of the two characters is intricately interwoven and you can't stop reading until their paths are revealed.
Loved the book. I think the author did a good job in his research.  It did take me a while to finish the book because of the formate it was written in.
Whereas there are countless novels out there about the tragedies, sacrifices, and invisible scars wrought by the Second World War, this one stands out.
Could not put this beautiful book down. A very original poignant story with well-developed memorable characters you feel you come to know and root for.
I thought it was quite interesting and well crafted.  However, it was not my favorite book of the year so I gave it 4 stars.  Still would recommend it.
A big book, well worth the trouble of holding and reading it. Short chapters keep up suspense and interest- liked it even better on the second reading,
I felt it was an intriguing story, but at times a little confusing. I enjoyed reading about Marie & Werner, I wished they had spent more time together.
fantastic reading !
Best book I have read in years. A braided compelling  narrative set in France and Germany during WW2. Mystery, conflict, heart--this novel has it all.
One of my favorite books ever! Each chapter is only a couple of pages so it leaves you eager to keep reading. Great characters, good story telling....
Very captivating... Still find myself thinking about the characters. It opened a whole new perspective on that time in history. Thoroughly enjoyed it!
A beautifully written page turner that captures the complexities of World War II through " new eyes". This writing is effortless and incredibly rich .
Tender story that portrays the experiences of two youngsters on opposing sides during world war two  It is fast moving and keeps the readers interest.
If I hadn't been reading this for a book discussion I would have quit before the middle. One person in the group did. But I'm SO GLAD I stuck with it.
Compelling pace and inspiring characters spanning the decades. This tale was expertly told. Beautiful, exciting, and full of hope. Highly recommended!
I like the non linear flow of this book. I usually don't like to read about Germany and France during WWII, but this story was captivating. Good read.
While a clever story with well developed characters and story line,  I was a bit disappointed by the paucity of striking metaphors or brilliant prose.
Excellent, compelling novel. Memorable, descriptive passages. Plot is enhanced by the short chapters, which alternate between the two main characters.
Engaging and beautiful story that was creatively arranged. A heart warming look into the lives of  youth who were impacted by the ugly reality of war.
This book is amazing.  It is a beautiful story about the lives of two young people during World War II.  It is one of the best books I have ever read.
I couldn't put this book down.  It got you from the first page.  The writing and story was one of the best I have read.  Heartbreaking, but inspiring.
It was good but...the answer you read to the end to discover was not clear.  I ended up thinking I knew what happened but I am still not 100% certain.
This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Very well written and one of those stories that carries you away to a different te and place.
loved the historical perspective of both sides of people affected by WWII.  Well developed characters.  Not a predictable ending, kind of bittersweet.
Beautifully written, a true reading experience. It does however deal with the reality and horror of WWII. I was a little disappointed with the ending.
Exceptionally well written. Brought to life European natives' perspective of the war. Loved the flash back and forward method of writing. Great read!!
A wonderful read......beautifully written<br/>Was sorry to finish it as I wanted to follow each person until their death<br/>We need more like this.
Wife actually read the book. Couldn't put it down.<br/>Heartfelt story, young people growing up, helping each other during WW2<br/>Highly recommends
This book was recommended to me, and I can't praise it highly enough. Fine writing, totally engaging characters and the best book I've read in awhile.
I couldn't put this beautifully and lyrically written down. I wanted to savor each and every word! This is a lovely story of healing and redemption...
This book starts off slow but trust me when k say that if you get 40-50% in, you won't be able to put it down. Incredible read. I was sad it was over.
This was an excellent story. Fast paced and the characters were very well developed. I've read other books by this author and really like her writing.
A stunning book....Best that I have read for a long time. I particularly liked the imagery in the writing and the weaving together of multiple stories
I thought I'd enjoy this more because of the reviews.  I fell asleep reading it 4 times and it took me 5 weeks to finish a book I didn't really enjoy.
An amazing story about an intelligent blind girl  living through the outbreak of  the Second World War surviving Hitler. Kept my interest all the way.
I really enjoyed reading this book, as well as the author's other books. This is a wonderful historical novel.  Should be required reading at schools.
Exquisitely written novel.  I loved the story, the characters, the prose.  The book drags you into the story, the time, the place, and the characters.
Loved this book...such a powerful story. Although it is historical fiction the author is brilliant and really takes you to the scene of France in WWII
Compelling characters, a plot that draws you right in and evocative writing. Loved it. The author is gifted in her ability to convey imagery in words.
Marvelous prose, wonderful characters. This is the best book I've read in at least ten years. I could not put it down after reading the first chapter.
Loved the character development and the plot held many mysteries and elegantly crafted suspense.  Tragic and rich and gorgeous and palpable.  Enjoy...
Beautifully written, engrossing story.  The characters were unique and the evocation of time an place transportive.  I definitely recommend this book.
It was ok. I skimmed the last third just so I wouldn't feel guilty about not finishing it. Wish I would have waited until it was cheaper but...oh well
Beautifully written and humanizing story of the most inhumane period in  recent history. So much the blind girl sees that is not visible with sight...
The story endlessly dragged your emotions and fears through war torn France and Germany. Subtle. Fearful. Unique. Courageous  I could not put it down.
The story is good, the characters are strong, the author drags it out too long with unnecessary ramblings and confusing flashbacks and flash forwards.
Excellent. Made you feel that you were "seeing" through the vision/hands of the young blind girl. The kind of book you think about afterwards.
Well written story of two youth caught in WWII.  Despite all the tension and ugliness of the war, a father's love and the innocence of children shone.
Not the "book of books" as it promises, but very good.  It takes you there to that time period and we need NEVER to forget what they suffered!
Thoughtful construction of the narrative builds tension and wonder. The characters are fully developed making me care for their story and its outcome.
Was my Book Club's selection, but I've left it on my teenage son's bedside table as I think he would enjoy it AND get a better understanding of WWII.
A well written, engaging story. The second half of the book is better than the first half but both are very good.  I recommend this book to everyone.
Excellent book--interesting perspectives of two young people on opposite sides of the war--would highly recommend this book-was difficult to put down
Wonderful word pictures.  Short chapters were novel.  I wanted to stop, but kept finding myself saying, "Just one more chapter, then to bed."
One of the best books I've ever read. Important subject then and now, layers of meaning, thoughtfully researched and woven. Realistic: just superior.
For those who lived through the war it brought back memories.  For those who didn't it was a good description to be learned. And the story was great.
At times I was a bit confused where the chapter was taking place. Kinda wished we knew what happened to her dad. Other than that it was a good novel.
Captivating book, kept my attention, great writer with a feel for humanity. Highly recommended. A unique look into war history from a special person,
Excellent read which gives the reader a great feel for the times and an understanding of the few choices the German people were given in their lives.
poignant treatment of historically significant events told through the lives of people who seem to represent so many participants and victims of WW2.
I'm still reading the book.  The book was selected for my book club and since the books took 19 days to arrive I wasn't able to complete it.  Thanks.
This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time! It's beautifully written, well conceived and made me think again about the cruelty of war.
I really enjoyed this book. It's a fresh take on the war and what it leaves us with. It offers a glimpse into human nature that feels raw and honest.
When my book club picked this book, I was a little disappointed.  Another WW2 book.  However it is a beautifully written story with great characters.
This is a wonderful novel with characters I care about, a world that is fascinating, and writing that is lucid and beautiful. I couldn't put it down.
The depth of the characters brought them to life.  I could not put the book down.  You can imagine yourself there during the war.  What would you do?
Really enjoyed the history side of the Wars. Lovely characters with a good in site into being blind, especially as a child growing up during the war.
Sweet and poignant - a beautiful read that gives you an intimate perspective on the sacrifice that war creates and the seduction of Nazi nationalism.
Beautifully written. Frightfully stunning. Excellent recount and depiction of war, love, humanity, right, wrong and just is. Highly recommend! Enjoy!
good story- a little wordy-have read many WW11 novels and although not my favorite, it was good. For current WW11 fiction try reading the Nightingale
Great view of the war from a totally different perspective.<br/><br/>Not sure how realistic this story line is.<br/><br/>Makes for a decent read.
I enjoyed this book but found it was lacking in some areas. The book was written well and many people who enjoy historical books will enjoy this one!
I thought it was great even though some people said it was sad, that's life!  Determination seems to be the big word in this book!  Against all odds!
This was a selection for my book club. For me it started slowly. After about the first 100 pages I couldn't put it down. Loved the characterizations.
a beautifully-written, poignant, haunting read. I feel privileged to have read it and admire the way Doerr has managed to evoke empathy and humanity.
I loved the characters in this book. The writing was superb. I found myself rereading passages because I enjoy the author's style and use of imagery.
He makes the devastation of war so much more real from each of his characters than any history book.  This is the light he shines and opens our eyes.
Once you start reading, it's hard to put down. So descriptively written I could smell, taste, feel, and hear what each of the characters experienced.
Wonderful dialog and mental pictures.  A wonderful story.  Good insight into the second world war.  It was not pretty.  I highly recommend this book.
Seriously one of the best books I have ever read. The story was well written and a wonderful read into the middle of the night book.<br/>LOVED IT!!!
Especially meaningful if one lived during those wartime years...even as a child. So sensitive. Unforgettable, well drawn characters...such sad times.
Beautifully written.  Unique story line and characters, just beginning to read it, but worth a review to recommend.  I will follow up when completed.
Are we to assume the stone is still behind the locked iron gate into the watery catacombs of St Malo?<br/><br/>Does Marie Laure ever go and get it?
Beautifully written story about WW1 Europe. I particularly appreciated experiencing every aspect of life through the senses of the blind Marie Laure.
Captivating prose, beautifully written. It's always hard to imagine the brutal conditions that were endured during World War 2 in Germany and France.
Are we supposed to have sympathy for the Germans?  Again, time switches back and forth. Parts were interesting, but on the whole, I was disappointed.
A wonderful book, that showed in part that there are regular and real people on both sides of a war.  Entertaining and educating from the very start.
A very insightful perspective of WW II. Moves slow at times, but the stories are rich and descriptive. It is nice when the author ties up loose ends.
Wow. It's been a long time since I've read a book that can hold it's own from start to the finish with eloquence and substance. A definite must read.
The writing was beautiful and very descriptive.<br/>The story had many tragic events, the characters lived very hard lives, like real life for many.
Imaginative, suspenseful, sweeping in scope. An addictive read. I felt like I was in a time machine seeing pockets of humanity in seas of inhumanity.
Very factual about the times, places and people during WWII with a good story line.  Interesting characters but not always the outcomes you hope for.
It was a wonderful read and I enjoyed the writing as well. This book was recommended at my book club and I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did.
The author is so descriptive in his dialogue and scenes. The starkness and tragedy of war is sad but humanized with the live stories of the children.
It's a bleak and dark novel. There were times I wanted to put it down, but the shear beauty of the prose kept me going. The ending tore my heart out.
This is a gripping story of how characters interact during War and one could sense there would be some merging but hard to know how it would be done.
A wonderful book. Characters written with a rare sweetness. I cannot think of another book quite like it. I think it will stay with me for some time.
I enjoyed experiencing the story from each person's perspective and couldn't wait for their stories to intersect at some point. This is a great book.
Very intriguing, interesting book. Couldn't put it down. Have recommended it to several friends and they alll agree, one of the best books this year.
One of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. I still don't understand how someone can portray the trauma of war in such a poetic way.
This was not my usual read. But WW II stories lways intrigue me. The story was interesting and absorbing. Great chearacters and an interesting plot.
I enjoyed the book quite a bit.  I have visited San Malo several times and enjoyed reading about it as a location.  Also very interested in history.
A beautifully written novel detailing both personal and military battles of a young German boy and the people who help him heal his conflicted soul.
A reader will learn a lot about WW II history with a very personal touch. I like the well developed characters but wish the stone was more apparent!
Excellent read, vivid descriptions in every scene. The book came to life with all the terror of world war 2, very human drama. Couldn't put it down!
Such an unexpected delight.  It took me far longer to read than normal, as I had to keep stopping to savour so many exquisite lines.  A masterpiece.
One of the best books I've ever read and I read every day.  I recommend it to everyone I know and they have all had the same feeling about the book.
One of my favorite books of all time. Interesting, clever, smooth, enveloping. Highly recommended for book lovers, young and old. A treasure indeed.
One of the best books I have read in quite a while. Loved the writting. Loved the characters! Tells a great surprising story! Praise for the author.
It was difficult in the beginning wondering if you are in the past or present. Then it takes hold of you. An emotional war story and so well written
Compelling, beautifully written, a great novel of love, war, time, and light. Completely rendered,  Sweeping in scope, and exceptionally visualized.
This book washes over the reader,leaving not so much a story, but the experience of having been there,transformed by the lives who lived through it.
The author`s writing  in this book was like music. Amazing writing and beautiful descriptions along  with a gripping story made it hard to put down.
Great tempo, beautiful language and imagery. Sad and tragic. Amazed by the perspective. We are so soft in these modern times. We are very fortunate.
Beautifully written story from the tumultuous WWII era. A reminder of the power of courage, resilience and love -- even when darkness surrounds you.
This book was beautifully written.  I felt very connected to all the characters. The only thing I disliked was in my opinion the ending felt rushed.
The book developed a wonderful group of characters and their interactions during an incredible time in history. I was engaged from beginning to end.
The book arrived in a timely manner and in better shape than listed.  It was an interesting read, once you got into the flashback method of writing.
I was impressed with how the French underground were represented and how the people were treated.  Aspect of using the diamond was also interesting.
Thought provoking and well written.  I loved it from start to finish.  I will think of this book and its message for some time.  I highly recommend!
This is an outstanding, deeply moving novel, the best I've read in years.  It has already won the National Book Award.  I think it deserves a Nobel!
Luscious writing. Interesting character development. At times, the subject matter can be difficult to stomach but ultimately the reader is rewarded.
The character development was very finely intertwined. I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what new detail was going to be revealed. Great read!
This book is solidly descriptive and emotionally satisfying. It stands about midway between high literary and popular fiction. An overall easy read.
It's a very well-researched, deeply imagined, and flawlessly executed work of art. This is an excellent novel that people should read at least once.
In this WW II drama, Mr. DOERR makes us hope where there is only despair. His prose is as magical as radio waves and as complex as the human spirit.
It was wonderful how everything came together, it was a beautifully written story. I loved how the author describes everything in such great detail.
I had a hard time reading the first few chapters but then warmed up to the flow of the writers progress.  The end of the book makes the story real .
A beautiful novel. One of the best I have read this year, or any year.  Anthony Doerr's deserves the National Book Award for this outstanding novel.
I couldn't put this book down. A wonderful story and a history lesson in one.  The author's descriptions of what can and cannot be seen are so good.
Poetic, true, gripping.  Engrossing, fascinating.  It has been a long long time since I read a book I could not put down and did not want to finish.
Poignant story from two vantage points of WWII. Light imagery pervades the story despite Marie Laure's blindness.  Sumptuous language to feast upon.
Most incredible book I've read in a long time.  Never wanted it to end.  Doerr has a matery of the language that is refreshing and emotion provoking
A compelling story of several characters--including a blind girl--during World War Two.  Beautifully conceived and written.  I couldn't put it down.
I really enjoyed this book. I read some review or highlight recommendation about the authors `way with words` and I whole heartedly agree. Amazing!!
I really enjoyed reading this fable of how good deeds and humanism survive and conquer in an evil world.  Exceptionally well written and turned out.
I thoroughly enjoyed the historical  as well as the human interest aspects of this fine novel. Looking forward to more  writing  from Anthony Doerr.
Fascinating story giving a very different insight into what it was like to be a German during world war two. Very sad & yet somehow uplifting read.
Took a while to get into the story. Lots of history from a first-person perspective. As an educator, I enjoyed the puzzles and the mechanical mind.
Well written relentless drama. Attention to detail almost tedious at times. But in the end a beautifull tale of the the enlightenment of two souls.
I could not put this book down. I just returned from France and Germany and the story made pictures in my mind. Wow and complimented to the author.
Poignant story of survival, love, character, and unbreakable and unconditional-family ties set in the backdrop of world war 2.  Beautifully written
I loved this book! A rare example of a page-turning and hard-to-put-down read. It left me wanting more. Planning to read other books by the author.
The story line was totally engaging. The story was written beautifully. I would and have recommended this book to everyone that has listened to me.
I could not put this book down.  Truly captured the horrors of war and what it does to people.  Very poignant.  The characters were well developed.
I read it once, quickly, but I will read it again at a slower pace. The emotions require a slower reading.<br/>I wanted it to have a happy ending.
So few lessons mankind seems to have learned from the supreme tragedy of WW2. But, the stories both true and fictional must never cease to be told.
The story is beautiful. Intertwined. Moving. A very special blending of heart ache,love, hatred, simplicity, primal urges, and innate intelligence.
The story of Marie-Laure is brilliant. Will bring you back to Anne Frank. The way it ties in beautifully with Werner's story is purely captivating.
This was a wonderful novel. However, the exhausting details of imagery and explanations were a bit too much. Though the story line was fascinating.
Well written-well developed characters-timeless story of loss & overcoming adversity !  A peek at war & a glimpse of the lives it leaves shattered.
A must-read, can't-put-it-down delight. Such a satisfying, beautifully written piece of literature.  I read for 2 days solid, and still wanted more
Intricate, beautiful story about ordinary people doing extraordinary things. This novel rewards you with each page. Succinct, moving, and powerful.
I enjoyed this book, finally a well written book in the editor's pick section on Amazon.  Although I am a bit tired of reading novels based in WWII
The book took me on a trip across the miles, through history and into the hearts and minds of amazing characters. I finished the book wanting more!
Could not put the book down. I was fortunate to have spent time in Normandy, Brittany, Saint-Malo & Dinard as my wife was born in France (Brittany)
Incredible writing, incredible story, beautiful characters rich with history. You can taste the words and feel the breeze in your hair as you read.
Doerr used Textures, sounds, smells and ideas to create images that vision couldn't accurately depict.  Achingly Lovely and even a little hopeful.
This book was a surprise! Recommended by my son for a quick read, but love the personal view of WW II history and the way the stories intertwined.
One of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.  A real insight into how Hitler corrupted and used the German youth to fill his needs.
I love this book.  When I finished, I wanted to read it all over again!  The historical component was enlightening.  I didn't want to put it down.
When one reads a book of this caliber, most other writing seems amateurish.  Anthony Dorr justly deserves the Pulitzer Prize he won for this book.
Beautiful story set in France during War, with the main characters young children who grow up too fast. Desperate times, but kindness still shown.
A very dis-jointed style of writing....switching back in forth from past to present to past. Lots of flowerful words and sentences....a long book.
A truly beautiful read. Loved how the story flitted back and forth in time and finally wound it's way back together and then moved to the present.
This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I didn't want to read it as it got so much press and everyone was reading it.  I'm so glad I did.
I guess I expected the diamond to be more important or maybe it's the greed but I was disappointed in how the author just dropped that story line.
A brilliant and poignant narrative. The author has a stunning command of language and has beautifully woven the story lines. A captivating read...
Great read. I really enjoyed it. I love World War 2 novels and this one was unique and original. What an interesting story to be transported into.
Good story but difficult to follow because of all the going back and forth of the characters.  The story dragged on and the conclusion was abrupt.
Amazing amount of research went into this book.  Gives what seems like a very realistic view of what war can be like for "non-combatants."
We listened to this book on a long drive and kept our attention. I think I would like to go back and read the words because it is written so well,
The characters were well developed,the story was intruiging and engrossing and the very thought-provoking. It gripped me to the final punctuation!
The most amazing thing about this book was the incredible writing by the author.  His descriptive use of language gave so much depth to the story.
This is a skillfully written evolving story of two families during WW2.  Great images that stick with you to make the human experience come alive.
This is textural tour de force, rich beyond imagination and detail. A must read for anyone who loves words and what they are capable of conveying.
I could not stop reading this first person account of the young French girl and German boy as they grew up before and during WWII. Fantastic read.
Would have been good, but too much jumping back and forth.  Forced myself to read it at times to get to end.  Just not my type of fiction I guess.
Wonderful approach to a devastating time in recent history.  Happy it was recommended to me.  If a reader is undecided, take the leap and read it.
Lovely story with yet another perspective on WWII. It was well written and engaging. The characters relatable and likeable. I couldn't put it down
Excellent writing.  Great character development.  Very entertaining book.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt the ending dragged a little bit
The prose, the characters, the story, the heartache and the joy...I didn't want it to end. I haven't enjoyed a book this much since The Goldfinch.
Now I know how it must have been to be in England or in Germany during WW2.......beautifully captured the hopes and fears of young people and old.
Found it to be an amazing story.  Was very impressed how he could use so few words to convey so many thoughts and situations. Highly recommend it!
I could not put it down. Beautifully told. I usually do not read "war novels" but absolutely loved this book. Will be reading more by this author.
It has to be ow of the most moving books I have ever read! The impact of the gentle kindness of the human spirit fills one with so much emotion...
Unforgettable . . . This story brings the atrocities of war to life and makes you realize there are no real bad guys . . . only human beings . . .
one of the most beautifully written books I've ever had the honor to read. Its visual imagery stayed with me for days after I finished reading it.
Gripping, thoughtful,  well written. The different perspectives made the story very personal on many levels.  Highly recommend! An excellent read.
An unexpected  treasure.  Breathing life into me.  I feel diminished after reading a book like this one.  It's huge and leaves a mark on my heart.
This book takes a few twists that I did not expect.  It goes from a distortion of reality to true reality and the conclusion is elegantly written!
Loved the way this story was told and the writing style, great character development, intriguing plot, definitely recommend this book, great read!
Wonderful storyteller.  Extremely well written.  Puts the reader right there!  A difficult book to put down and yet one hates to reach the ending.
I loved the moral dilemma that this book poses. The characters are nuanced -- you will from liking one to dislike to acceptance and understanding.
Extremely well written. A nice development of characters as the scenes change places and times, smoothly and seemlessly.<br/>Very enjoyable read.
The plot drove the story onward but the underlying message to me is that war must be avoided but for survivors  the pain remains with us for good.
great WW2 story told through the perspective of many different characters, I did have trouble keeping all of the german military people straight.
thought the length of chapters  some what brief  , guess  its thought that we all have short attention spans these days ,I  did  enjoy this  book
It was a so so story.  The German war has been done so many times, and this was not the best/  A very depressing story, definitely not uplifting.
I don't like war stories but I must say this one put a wonderful human side to it. It was very personal and humanizing and very touching as well.
One of the best books I have read this year. Thought-provoking, very realistic and unpredictable. Highly - actually: very highly - recommendable!
Very well written. A master at combining varied characters who ultimately come together. Also an insight into a very difficult period in history.
The story was interesting but I feel; it was dragged out---if it had been shotrtened  with  each  character it would have been better in my eyes.
Anthony Doerr's writing is truly beautiful. I loved the story and how it flowed between the two main characters. I just love a well written book.
Wonderful story and strong characters. It is a real page turner and I hated to get to the end!  Action and mystery combined and do e history too.
Loved  the story but it was a little wordy....at the end, when I would have loved more details it felt like the author raced through  the ending.
A poetic journey into the disruptive power of war seen through the experience of wonderfully human complex characters each a delightful companion
This  was a very good book -it really makes you stop and think and see everything from all sides while the actions of some did not make it right.
I felt immersed in the time and place and really connected with the characters. Interesting to get a feel for things from the German perspective.
This was a wonderful account of a life well lived. The language and soul of the book were outstanding. I recommend this book to anyone who reads.
This's is one of the best "war stories".  The first half  was just the usual but the second half was wonderful.<br/>Beautifully written.
It took me over two weeks to read this book because I savored each chapter, each sentence,each word. This is a classic that will live on forever.
Wasn't sure I wanted to read another book about all the suffering in WWII, but I really loved this book.  It was such an interesting perspective.
This is more than I expected.  I love the short chapters that go back and forth between the major characters and how Werner and Marie first meet.
I wasn't expecting the impact this book would have on me.  Sad, but inspiring story about the evil tentacles of Nazi Germany..highly recommended.
Good historical fiction about the German occupation of a French town near the end of WWII mostly told through the "eyes" of a blind girl.
A beautiful book. Written very well .Gives you a flavor of this time and the impact of WW Ii on the French people I would definitely recommend it
Unique, thought provoking, told through many different perspectives on the most famous war of the world. A twisted ending for the curious reader.
One of the finest books I've read!  Excellent character and plot development bedded in the history of WWII.  Loved Anthony Doerr's writing style.
I appreciated the wonderful character development and the vivid images of life during the war but found the time displacement really distracting.
This was such a marvelous book, I hated to stop to go to work each day...  It is the first work I have read by this author... Ready to read more.
I loved this story. It's great to read something with good characters and some history from a few very different perspectives. An enjoyable read!
Beautiful story, beautifully written.  Set during WW2, two children and how the world tears their worlds apart and reveals their inner strengths.
I like Doerr's writing style and beautiful images. Chapters are short and compact and interesting characters. Makes<br/>for good summer reading.
Topic similar to The Nightingale  but no comparison.  This had too much description  which slowed up  the plat and unnecessarily dragged it out.
I know everyone loves this book.  I might have felt the same way except that it is written in present tense.  I do not enjoy prose in that form.
Yes, everyone says this book is amazing and that's because it is. It's the best book of the year hands down. Listen to your friends and read it.
An extremely well developed plot with great incite into the two main characters that we knew would meet but could not predict what would happen.
Beautifully written.  Exceptional point of view from the German side--human side.  Highly recommended!  I could not stop reading it!  Brilliant!
Really interesting for some historical fiction, compelling storyline, tear jerker.  But definitely a bit cliche in some parts.  Would recommend.
This book is a great representation of bravery, love and perseverance. Though this book is kind of lengthy, it is definitely worth of your time.
It is one of those rare stories that makes you fall in love with the characters, travel with them during their troubles, and embrace the author.
I fell in love with the characters, and watched them grow. The setting gave me a vivid view the devastation of war had on the character's lives.
WW II story with brilliant expressiveness-  vivid details from the perspective of someone who is blind, but with compensating heightened senses.
Not a long read, very easy shot chapter, back and forth to each character. I haven't decided what new book to read but I will keep you informed.
This book is a WWII book, but not the same as others. A very interesting story, great character development.<br/>And wonderful use of language.
A fascinating, very well written story!  Can't put it down.  Anthony Doerr is a wonderful writer, his sense of details is incredible!  Loved it!
Realistic depiction of what happens in war, as well as the basic goodness people can hold onto.  A very sweet picture of two sweet young people.
This book was thoroughly enjoyable. The character development and way in which Doerr paints the scene with crafted word selection are masterful.
Brilliantly written and engaging.  Phenomenal character development. You truly feel present in the story, imaging the scenery, sounds, and pain.
Excellent read.  Could not put it down.  Had a friend that listened to the CD on a trip and said it was mesmerizing and extremely well produced.
An incredibly powerful tale ripped from the horrible setting of war, detailing the beauty of the human spirit, in a wonderfully woven narrative.
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time, maybe in all my forty years of reading. I cannot recommend this book enough to you!
A super good read.  Suspenseful plot and great for book club discussions.  The characters, especially the French girl, are thoroughly developed.
Wonderful, informative, satisfying.  I would recommend it to any reader. If the reader is old enough to remember WW two, it will be even better!
What an amazing story for this historical time frame. I loved how plausible the story was and how much I loved and hated some of the characters.
Touching story of love and loss and how we are all connected. Hard to read at times as the graphic details of the war were so realistic and raw.
Enjoyed this book! It took a long time for the two main characters to meet but when they finally did, it became an amazing story!  Well written!
A great book with rich character development and strong internal integrity.  The author does not leave you hanging even with subplot characters.
The book is very German and existential in thought.  Without the presence of God, characters are left to make decisions in an effort to survive.
This is one of the best books I've ever read. Clever juxtaposition of 2 well-written characters, beautifully described locations and situations.
Wonderful book<br/>Language(use of imagery, choice of words and phrases) is amazing<br/>Reflects a thoughtful, sensitive spirit for the author
I could not stop reading. This was a great story with engaging characters. I felt that I knew them all personally. I highly recommend this book.
This was a very good book; however, it started out a little slow.  I wasn't really able to get into it until the middle.<br/><br/>Great story!
Loved the different perspectives, definitely kept me interested. Highly recommend if you like "The Book Thief" or historical fiction in general.
great insight to the horror or war, especially when battling a disability you cannot control.  A bit lengthly in parts but overall, a great read
Wonderful story of the human spirit and how it can rise to show great strength in the most difficult situations. Enjoyed the historical insight.
It was one of the best written books that I have read in a long time.  I will read it again because I want to make sure I did not miss anything.
What a gorgeously crafted story. Each character is developed and each story is full of ranch rich details that I feel as if I know these people.
An exquisitely written book which asks us to consider human potential and how war, greed, and love interplay to ultimately determine who we are.
Beautifully written. Lives destroyed including the Germans who fought in the war. A new look at how war kills the sprit of our world.<br/>Merle
Just kept me wanting to read the next page....recommend strongly to all ages...great story with interesting people that you rooted would survive
I'm still sorting out this story.  When I am thinking about a book weeks after I read it, the author has struck a chord.  The title says it all.
A n  interesting story,  but on the sad side.  There are so many great WW 11, story themes.  I lived through it. I seem to prefer happy endings.
I loved this book...reminded me of the book thief in it's tone and of course it's war-based. I wanted them to live happily ever after ..somehow.
Great book.  I enjoyed the depth of the personalities of the charachters.  Very difficult book to put down, but wanted it to go on forever also.
With world wars being such a recurring theme lately... This one is certainly worth reading! Different perspective than others and very well told
The perspectives Anthony Doerr is able to capture are simply and profoundly beautiful. All the Light We Cannot See gets a well-deserved 5 stars.
Clearly drawn and engaging characters. Abbreviated chapters made the story move swiftly and with a sense of urgency.  Beautifully crafted prose.
The whole time I'm reading my mind conjures up Spielberg type images. Wonderful story with a nice blend of history and storytelling. Enjoyed it.
Beautifully written.  An interwoven story of German & French childhoods scarred & forever changed by a war they neither understood nor accepted.
Superb book in every way. The writing, the plot, characters...all were stellar. Our book club has read over 100 books and agree this is a top 5.
Huge in scope and emotional weight, but small in the details of the lives lived through the pages. Painful and beautiful to read, like a memory.
An amazing book which tells the story of the lives of two young people during WWII. Beautifully written. One of the best books I have ever read!
Thought is was a very interesting book as far as history goes, I loved the interaction with the uncle a the girl, also with Werner and the giant
This is a wonderful book It's beautifully written with memorable characters woven together in a fascinating story. Best book I've read all year.
Beautifully written story of two families one French and one German and how they suffered during WW 11, and the connection  they eventually had.
Great book set during horrific time of Nazi Germany. You get the sense of what it was like to grow up during those years in Germany and France.
Interesting, and different view on the events in France  in1944. Co narrative by a blind girl and a young German boy. I enjoyed the conclusion.
A charming, sensory filled almost mystical story. Tough subject dealt with in a touching manner. Visually provocative. Good character building.
A sensitive and enlightening presentation of human suffering and the complex network of events that are woven by Destiny.  It is a master work.
Just read this wonderful story about life and struggle and family.  I do not have the ability to write a review to do it justice. Just read it.
If only I had the gifts of Anthony Doerr to adequately describe this masterpiece.  I'm not sure I've ever read a more beautifully penned novel.
A beautifully writen and conceived story of the triumph of the human spirit and the depths to which humanity can sink in the pursuit of itself.
Beautiful storytelling intertwined with the harsh realities of World War II.  Amazing connections among the characters.  I highly recommend it.
A tear jerker tale of life during WWII. I am always a sucker for historical fiction during that time, but felt this was particularly well done.
excellent writing but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because it was too sad and brutal. Tired of reading what the Germans did and didn't do.
Interesting with lots of  information about that time of war.  Loved the the many both wonderful ane faithful people.  Got awful long at times.
Very well written, characters were identifiable and well developed. Interesting perspective on WWII story and how so many people were affected.
Delightful description of Wartime France. I felt the book lacked purpose, but it is a lovely read nonetheless. Sad testimony to a terrible era.
Beautifully written story of the good and evil of humanity.fortunately the light of goodness prevailed.  A good read deserving of a high honor.
A wonderfully written saga of the victims of WW II. Young people caught in the maelstrom of global conflict with no hope of emerging unscathed.
Beautiful sentences. A great story. Made me really reconsider what I imagined war to be like in those days. Worth every minute I spent reading.
A different perspective on the people who lived the war outside of glory and nationalisms and the scars they carry for the rest of their lives.
Compelling and wonderfully drawn.  I worried and wondered throughout the book about what would happen, and when, and why, and then it was over.
I am not typically a novel reader, but I loved every word of this.  The story flowed beautifully.  The characters were realistic and appealing.
This is novel is a masterpiece--poetic and exquisite. Well-developed characters and a clever plot, delicately woven will enchant you! Loved it!
I loved everything about this book. It is absolute perfection. The writing is just as amazing as the story. I would highly recommend this book.
An excellent read. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas. Doer is a great writer that really holds your attention. I loved the short chapters.
A touching story, fast moving and very descriptive, until the end where the story gets lost.  He tried to tie it together, but generally failed
A beautifully written book!  Although war and it's consequences is not a "fun" subject, this was a book I couldn't wait to get back to.
Doers has a gift of painting with words<br/><br/>I plan to read all his works.<br/><br/>Pretty sure it will be a defining work of our time.
Loved this book, I couldn't put it down.  Beautiful writing with interesting and sympathetic characters against the background of World War ll.
Incredible,beautiful, and heart wrenching .<br/><br/>Thank you for your sensitive portrayal of a very dark time . When will mankind learn ...
One of the best WWII books I have ever read. It gives an interesting viewpoint from children facing the hardships of the war on opposing sides.
The kind of "Can't put down" book. Kept my interest from beginning to end. Would recommend to any one looking for a well written story.
One of the best books I have read in a really long time. Love how the two stories weave together in just the right way, at just the right time.
Beautiful writing with a story I didn't want to ever end. I loved this book for the journey it took me on with characters I became so close to.
I love the characters in this book. I felt like when I put the book down, I was leaving them hanging. An interesting plot line. Worth the read.
Surviving a war as a child is unimaginable.  These children endured incredible circumstances and how their paths crossed was an amazing  story.
I thought the book was beautifully written. I had a hard time putting it down. I liked the way it went back and forth between people and years.
This story is woven. It is a tapestry of color, of hopes, of fears, of our common humanity. The language is beautiful, and the story compelling
Doerr does not disappoint--as with all his books and short stories<br/>he holds the reader tight for the sage filled with every human emotion.
This book, with its unique story line, was so beautifully written I didn't want it to end. The characters were so real I felt that I knew them.
Hurry up, Mr. Doerr, write fast, write lots more - you're a great plotter, an exemplary researcher, and a magnificent wordsmith.  Please hurry!
An excellent book.
Lovely, different.
A wonderful story.
will read again...
I wanted to like this book but it was just too unnecessarily convoluted and none of the characters seemed fully realized; rather, they were saccharine caricatures.  The end seemed forced/rushed as if the author lost interest but figured he should wrap up the loose ends -- Jutta just seems like a loose end.  I get the convention of changing out scenes with each chapter but there wasn't a plausible reason for doing so in this book.<br/><br/>I know many loved the novel and it is not my place to challenge them.  Reading and appreciation are personal.
What a wonderful story! Please read this book; you will not be able to put it down. I read it quickly and will reread it slowly the next time.
I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time.  It came recommended by several friends over time and I finally relented to buy it.  Score!
A deeply wise, intelligent and insightful book, dream-like at times in its images but with a narrative that is always rooted in stark reality.
I can understand why the book was an award winner. My book club has this book on it's list for 2016 and I look forward to everyone's comments.
Insightful characters, engaging story. Some suspense filled moments. I enjoyed the unique flashback/flashforward style once I caught on to it.
Absolutely absorbing...the writer pulls you deep into the lives of the main characters..you can feel their fear, pain, greed, determination...
An interesting book.  Somewhat difficult to read with the switching back and forth between characters stories but brought together in the end.
I've read voraciously on WWII over the years, but this story is a totally different from any others and a fresh story which I greatly enjoyed.
Most difficult were the switches in time! Back and forth from prewar to post, made it hard to follow. But gripping and well written otherwise.
Fell in love with all the characters, except the fat, old German "art collecting" officer. Wish things turned out better than reality allowed.
This book rekindled my love of reading. I had forgotten how to feel so much, see things that are all around us.<br/>Thank you, Anthony Doerr.
A very thoughtful and harrowing tale of humanity.  "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."  John 1:5
I loved this book. Marie Laure, her father, and Werner's development through the book was spell binding<br/>recommend as one of my best reads
This text is a fantastic reminder of our past and lessons to be learned while providing enough glimmer of hope for our society to retain faith
An interesting and captivating read that I highly recommend.  It exposes you to world events on a personal level through memorable characters.
It took a few chapters to get into the story and understand the back and forth in time, but I was hooked. Great story with suspense and heart.
This was a sad story about two children from different countries during war time but was unique the way they met.  Couldn't put the book down.
An amazing book that I couldn't put down. I am going to reread it so I can discover some of the nuances I missed the first time. Amazing book!
This book was a wonderful read.  Some of it read like poetry!  Beautiful!  I could see it in my minds eye.  It would make a really good movie.
Great book. Hard to put down. Great character development and story telling. Highly recommended this to someone who seeks a well written book.
Finally a jewel. A beautiful, lyrical, irresistible story. I've not read anything this delightful,compelling, and heart rending in many years!
It is one of the best stories that I have ever read. Really inventive and with parallel lines that you knew were going to cross. A great book.
I enjoyed this.  I was worried about the Nazi perspective.  The author does a great job of making everybody human, and most everybody likable.
Loved this book! So beautifully written. It almost reads like poetry! I could not put it down! Each character was so fully clear to the reader
A touching presentation of the interdependence of disparate French and German souls caught up in the chaos and destruction of the Nazi regime.
Beautifully written.  Characters are well developed  and one gains a very real sense of living during these times and through so much turmoil.
It's hard to write about Nazi Germany without being formulaic. The formula of this book is the fairy tale. Kudos to Ann Frank and Jules Verne.
A beautiful, moving, haunting story. I was engrossed in this novel from beginning to end. What an incredible piece of work from Anthony Doerr!
I found it a little difficult to follow.  Not until nearly the end did I grasp what the two were doing and how they were getting away with it.
Well written and sad throughout. Anticlimactic ending leaves me just as sad as the characters. Artistic in scope yet realistic. Worth reading!
I couldn't put the book down. Would recommend this book. What a great read and perspective on history. Will look  for others from this author.
...and I was sad to see it end.  Luminous characters, language and a glimpse into a tragic chapter in our recent history.  Highly recommended.
Very moving book during the war.  The characters were very brave.  It kept you turning the pages to see what would happen next<br/>  Loved it
Wow!  Great book.  Good reading, wonderful characters, interesting plot with a powerful ending. Really great portrayal of a moment in history.
An extraordinary novel. One that I will certainly be re-reading to plumb its elegantly interwoven themes, character development and symbolism.
Doerr's writing is superb and his story riveting. I loved the character development and the intertwined plots. Sad to arrive at the last page.
An outstanding book, and one you will want to read more than once. It deserves all the accolades one can give. You won't regret this purchase.
Amazing blend of characters and interwoven story lines. Very worthwhile journey through our near distant past, but still lightyears behind us.
Amazing piece of work.  Superb writing.  I've read many a book about the Holocaust and none touched me quite like this one.  It's a must read!
I thought I'd never read another WWII novel, but this was exceptional.  I got pulled in and really enjoyed it, improbable as the storyline is.
I could not stop reading ...the ending was a little disappointing but I would highly recommend as the story keeps you on the edge of your seat
I enjoyed reading this story.  It does skip around a lot between time periods and characters, but once I grasped the flow, it was a good read.
It was very interesting . The people want to help one another. It depict the war in France and how life and art were distroyed<br/>or stolen.
I loved it.. a little long but interesting view of WW11.  Wish it had a happier ending but then there were few happy endings during that time.
Although I enjoyed the story, the writing was sometimes a bit "choppy" and hard to follow and connect between the two main characters.
A most interesting boo.  I have no idea how w it would end.  Liked the way the blind girl was taught to navigate the town and survive the war.
I am an avid reader and this book is in  my top ten of favorite books. Beautifully written. Thought provoking characters. Unforgettable story.
Lovely prose, lovely invention.  Still I found it hard to stay with and wandered off to find something else.  Will eventually get back to it -
The great inventive storytelling is beyond comparison. What a triumph! Heartbreaking, gripping, moving, and finally , all you need in the end.
I loved the development of the main characters in the book and how each chapter went back and forth between the two until they eventually met.
Beautifully written, poignant story...I couldn't put it down! The end was a little disappointing but true to life. Highly recommend this book.
An interesting novel set in France during world war 2 that depicts fictionally incidents that occurred during France's occupation bu Germany.
I found this book a bit slow to get into but once I got near the end I didn't want it to finish. The story and the language are so beautiful.
Great book.  Wish the author would have gone into depth with Marie's father and not left that hanging<br/>But I totally recommend this book.
Great insight into a very difficult period of history. The characters telling the story is insightful and an added sensitivity to the events.
Touching story about a French girl and a German Hitler Jugend boy whose paths intertwine. A must read and definitely lives up for all praise.
Such a devastating time to live through for these characters but they tackled their adversities with determination and grace.  A lovely read.
I was engaged by the first chapter and couldn't put it down. The writing is absolutely gorgeous, each character perfectly developed and real.
This book was a great read.  A little tricky to follow at first as it jumps around in time with two different characters.  Enjoyed very much.
A wonderful book that's beautifully written with a very interesting and complex story. Probably the best book I've read all year, I loved it.
A well written book containing accurate WW11 history with highly interesting characters both German and French woven into a suspenseful plot.
Beautifully written. Couldn't put the book down. Poetic rendering of a gripping story with timeless questions of  beauty and horrors of life.
One of the best reading experiences I have had in a very very long time.  Wonderful characters.  The historical details penned to perfection.
Historically significant. Endearing characters - so brave when facing extreme danger  - psychological as well as physical. Satisfying ending.
Such an interesting read.  Great choice for book club.  Can't wait to discuss it and find out thoughts on what happened after the book ended.
Loved this book, hooked me from the very beginning - but I am a sucker for historical fiction, and have taken care of vision impaired people.
This was one of the best books I've read.  So beautifully written, and a unique perspective on the war makes this book stand out from others.
very good.  I enjoyed it.  Maybe a bit rambling - a bit long for the content but overall really well written and great character development.
Beautifully written book, proving that life can be horrible and wonderful at the same time. I look forward to reading other books by this author.
I loved the characters and the setting. I also loved the balance between both sides and the understanding it brought to the humanity of both.
Loved this book...loved the writing style, the story, the characters and the ending...it was worth every moment I read it!  Highly recommend.
Beautifully written account of a young blind French girl and a young German boy whose individual stories come together in France during WWII.
Could not put the book down.  The blend of fiction and history is masterfully seamless. The best book I've read in years. And what an ending!
This book was boring but I persevered.  It is also depressing.  I can't understand all the 5 star reviews.  I would rather have my time back.
My husband was in WWII and he has told me much about what he saw and felt. This book explains what<br/>The people in Europe went through. Bb
A travel through a difficult time in history and at a perfect pace with interesting characters.  I would recommend to all ages over thirteen.
This was a beautifully written book. It captured my imagination from the beginning. I found it very sad but all books written about wars are.
Beautiful writing and a compelling story.  The way the two different story lines connect is amazing.  I loved this book.  Highly recommended.
A great read with characters that seemed so real.  The author was great at weaving together many stories. Loved that it was not predictable. For those that claimed it was boring a long, I believe it is just a disagreement on writing style. I love well written prose that make me think.
Left me wanting more.  Words painted  the scenes so beautifully I could see every detail, every nuance  I will be reading this more than once
I enjoyed  this book very much.  It's hard to fathom what leople lived through during that timein history.  This is a very well written book.
Mr. Doerr has a way of painting pictures with his words. I truly felt like I was in Germany and France while reading his book. Fabulous tale.
Wonderful plot. Well thought out characters who came to life through the author's masterful use of prose. I would highly recommend this book.
Slowish start to what turned out to be the best read of my year! A wonderfully rich story, expertly told. Stayed up half the night to finish.
What a very exciting author, hard to put down, leaves one wondering at humans ability to withstand anything. And what would our strengths be.
One of the most spectacular books I've ever read and one  which anyone alive from the Second World War would understand at the deepest level.
This was one of the best books I have ever read....it ranks up there with Flight Behavior and Invention of Wings....great historical fiction!
Great portrayal of World War II from varying perspectives. Did seem like the ending was rather rushed compared to the remainder of the novel.
This is the way to tell a story, keeping you interested until the very end. During the tale, it helps to know a little about the era of WWII.
A heart-wrenching story of 2 children and the effect of World War II on their lives.  We forget too often how the young were affected by war.
Although a very heart wrenching situation, the characters were strong and amazing...very mature for such young adults dealing with illnesses.
Great book.  I couldn't put it down.  the descriptions were really wonderful.  I felt like I was reliving the story along with the characters
well told, well balanced, well designed storytelling with the highest quality imagery and insight into the characters... well done Mr. Doerr.
A must read.  Beauty in the tragedy of WWII.  Thoroughly enjoyed the geography of it and the enhance descriptions from the blind Marie-Laure.
I enjoyed every word.  I loved the way the many interlocking stories enfolded. All the characters were very real.  Nicely done.  Recommended,
Compelling story line, characters the reader cannot help but care about, lyrical writing of a time of horror and ain - this was a great read!
This is an absolutely beautiful book.  Wonderfully written.  Highly suspenseful.  Fell in love with the characters. Very sad  to have it end.
Loved this emotional book! Both happy and very sad. You are drawn to each character and feel their pain. Would definitely recommend the book!
Very well written. I found it difficult to put the book down . It was as though I was there myself, seeing through the eyes of the character.
This is the kind of book that I could not put down, that I thought about after finishing, that I did not want to end.<br/>It is really 2 stories, one about a French girl and the other about a German boy during WWII. The novel flashes back and forth between the two main characters yet it is not confusing or hard to follow. The writing itself is intelligent and the character and scene descriptions make it come to life. The author shows the war through the eyes of each character as it builds to the brief but meaningful meeting between the two young people. I cared for each of the characters and was touched by their struggles to stay alive, to understand themselves, to help others. For me, it was one of the best novels I have read. They have to make a movie out of this book!
The book took some time to complete but I enjoyed every page.  The full character development was a joy to read!  I loved his writing style.
I liked it, didn't love it.  It was long and wordy and had more description than I like, but overall thought the story/plot was interesting.
The author describes everything in such great detail. I was able to feel everything the main character felt. Highly recommend it to everyone
A very surprising and fantastic story of survival in the midst of mankind's worst invention -war.  Lyrical and convoluted just like a shell.
Best book I've read in a long time.  It is so well written and gets its hooks into you from the very beginning and never lets go.  Loved it!
I'll be reading this book over again.  Theres just so much there to digest that I actually think I'll like it even more the 2nd time around.
Lovely story centered around an actual event.  Strong characters.  I'm not normally one to say you won't want to put it down, but you won't.
The author creates sophisticated imagery and nearly teaches a sighted person how to survive against every possible odd and love and be loved
This is a must read! The language is gorgeous, the story heartbreaking and each sentence is a marvel. This may be the first novel I re-read!
Excellent read.  Told a wonderful story and use of words, phrases and sentences that not only described but made you think. Highly recommend
Was very engrossing till the end. Felt the last chapters skipped so many years that the author just wanted to finish the book. Good overall.
The arc of its story conjoined with pitch-perfect language, this empathetic tale sails above the ironic rubble of most contemporary fiction.
This is the best book I have read in quite a while. When I finished I reread it just to make sure that I did not miss any part of the story.
Great compelling book, brilliantly vivid writing takes you back in time to see the impact of WW2 on the lives of very different individuals.
This is a WWII novl about greed and propaganda and the lives of soldiers and civilians . The heroine is blind but sees more than others.....
Having read "The Nightengale" which was excellent,I wish I had never started "All The :Light We Cannot See"  Such a let down
Enjoyed the different stories and how they intertwined. It was interesting how the characters saw the same event from different perspectives
So beautifully written.  The characters so developed, you feel you know them.  War through ordinary people's lives and the courage to go on.
The cadence of the written words was deeply moving making each character come alive and walk the pages. Each book reward is richly deserved.
A thoroughly enjoyable book. Some parts seemed contrived, but nonetheless I really enjoyed the story and I thought it was very well written.
Hasn't arrived yet, but sounds like a good storyline.  Definitely sounds like it will be interesting to read.  Eagerly awaiting its arrival.
Great story.  Historical period of great personal interest which may be required to figure out parts of it.  Well written for the most part.
I was transfixed with the interweaving a beautiful and tragic stories. Every word and detail were at once masterful and simple. A must read.
Richly detailed characters and settings, the story kept me engaged and looking forward.  I felt as if I were in their world, a part of them.
Brilliantly written. Interesting, in depth characters. About WWII, but so much more. A book that ended too quickly, a story I will remember.
A little to serious and sad for my liking.  At times I had to put it down and do something else because war stories are hard for me to read.
everyone seems to love this book, didnt do it for me, i really didnt like it.....oh well.  got confusing at times and just didnt grip me....
I'm only going to say that I really enjoyed the book, although it wasn't what I expected it would be.  I definitely would recommend the book
Very good read - highly recommend. Nice character development. Changed between several story and time lines, which I enjoy. Kept me engaged.
A feast.  Anthony Doerr engages all our senses as he draws us into a world gone mad at the close of WWII.  But mostly he engages our hearts.
A different slant on wwII books. Good writing, esp. In depicting the limitations of the sightless Marie laure.  Nice short chapters as well.
It's been an awakening and has provided me with many world views. However, it's a beautiful and endearing Novel. Not for the faint at heart.
A great story.  The situation of two 12 yr. olds at the begin of WWII in Germany.  How well the author puts you right with them is exciding.
Nice weaving of the two separate stories from world war two. I would most definitely look for novels by this author again and again. Lovely.
"Artsy" jumping around within the time frame did not enhance the storyline.  Somewhat wordy.  Well plotted.  Glad I read it even so.
I have read many, many books about the World War Two era, but this one is very different.  Love, compassion and honor really do conquer all.
The journey into two separate lives during Germany's occupation of France keeps you wondering!! One story presented as a coin with two sides
Love this book. Author's style is wonderful and such prose and detail are rare these days. One of the best books I've read in quite a while!
It's the kind of book you can't put down, yet you don't want it to end.  It was beautifully written.  I'll be looking for more of his books.
I enjoyed the book. Sometimes a little on the depressing side  but well written the to and fro-ing across the time times is a bit irritating
Intricately woven into the brutality of war, this story shines a light on humanity.  Great storytelling and wonderfully depicted characters.
Beautifully crafted and intelligent book.  Excellent development of characters.  One of my favorite all time reads!  Did not want it to end.
It was very interesting how he brought the two main characters together in the end. You knew it was going to happen, but not how. Well done!
A wonderfully human story set in WWII.  Beautifully written and layered with meanings. A great portrayal of the triumph of the human spirit!
one of the best books I have read this year - I have been talking endlessly about it to my friends - I can't say enough good things about it- it was a page turner to the end
One of those books that will haunt me for many years, I recommend  it to fans of historical fiction. Please add this title to your TBR list.
This was one of the best books that I have read this year! Characters came alive and the historical aspects, although sad, were fascinating!
A truly magnificent book..this story will stay with me.  The characters were well developed.  I cared about the fate of the main characters.
Excellent Historical fiction. Parts describing Hitlers youth schools very informing.  Leaves you pondering the justice in who survives wars.
It jumps from present to past quite a bite, but once I got used to it, I enjoyed seeing WWII from a different perspective (French & German).
Difficult at first but couldn't put it down when near the end. Complicated story that might have been helped by less jumping around in time.
Surprisingly good. Not just another WWII story. Very well written with a sophisticated style. I enjoyed it even though I read it ravenously.
Held my interest, kept me captive and engendered a greater comprehension of how small movements of life throw their waves at our tomorrow's.
A riveting story of the bravery & resourcefulness of a young blind girl during the German occupation of France during WW II.  A page turner!
Very well written.  The story sheds a "light" on different points of views, and reminds us that good people sometimes do bad things.
Enjoyed the writing style and the parallel stories of the young people. Heartwarming story of two young people caught in the tragedy of war.
Captivating novel with characters richly developed in the backdrop of a cruel and unjust setting. Doerr draws you in with every page turned.
Powerful human drama set during WW2.  Really about the people, who are wonderfully drawn, rather than the war, which is refreshing approach.
This novel grabbed me and held me until I finished the book.  I could hardly bear to put it down.  Anthony Doer is a superlative writer, capable of seeing through the eyes of his characters and allowing the reader to come to their own conclusions about each of his very human players.<br/>We know so much regarding the monstrous actions of Nazi Germany, but sometimes we forget that living in that country during those horrendous years were many good people, caught up in the horror that blanketed Europe.<br/>This book raises questions that are difficult to contemplate, much less answer.  Were the "innocents" responsible for the actions of their government?  What, exactly, is a soldier's duty?<br/>I would highly recommend this book to both adults and young adults.
I love a book where I feel like I get to know the characters personally. This is one of those books. Heart felt and heart breaking stories.
I had trouble getting in to it until about 1/3 of the way in. Then I enjoyed it all the way through. Very beautiful writing style. Lyrical.
Wonderful book. So beautifully written. I enjoyed the story and the back & forth story line of the characters. I see why it won the Pultzer
Radical editing needed. He was energetic, even encyclopedic, in his descriptions. I would have preferred it if he were a bit more listless.
Seldom has a novel captured my attention from beginning to end,but this one did. The content, style, and story made me sorry to have it end
A hauntingly wonderful book, one that could be read over again as the great classics.  Beautifully written with fully developed characters.
Sensitive, with action, symbolism, love.  Explores the horrors of war and the human spirit.  I couldn't put this down.  Highly recommended.
I agree with the person who said it was a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down but the ending left you guessing and was a disappointment.
Gripping. Pulls you into it and the lives of the characters. Understandably a Pulitzer Prize winner. But don't read it if you're depressed.
Wonderfully written and heart breaking story of the hardships of war, the struggle to survive and strong bonds of friendships and memories.
One of the most beautifully written books I've read. Although long, the story moved very quickly and I finished it in a little over a week.
Well written but dishonest. A blind girl in occupied France too much a set up. And the miniature cities. Why? I couldn't believe any of it.
I couldn't put it down. The characters were so complete that I understood each of them as you would a lifelong friend. Beautifully written.
Absolutely amazing. I can't wait to recommend this book to everyone I know. Beautifully written and the characters are beautifully crafted.
This is a sensitive and beautifully written book, giving another perspective on World War II.  It is a reminder of how damaging ANY war is.
I could not stop reading this book!  Doer makes the sights and sounds of the war and of everyday life leap off the page.  A wonderful read.
Just enjoy. Such a unique plot, just when you think you've read ever angle of WWII.  Written with such care and beauty. A pleasure to read.
Beautiful historical story of a tragic time.  Characters were real and their stories very moving. Recommend this book to lovers of history.
An incredible story, which brings to life some very real and tender characters and how lives on both sides of the fence are ravaged by war.
Loved this well researched story of two people and war torn France and Germany during WW 2.  It is so well written and holds your interest.
Good story line but at times it is hard to follow. It jumps back in forth between characters and, also, goes backwardsand forwards in time.
Nice read great story.  Loved how at the end the author describes how the main characters end.  Will look for more titles from this author.
A perfectly woven tale with beautifully constructed characters. Such expertly written prose I wonder about the characters daily. Must read.
Loved the way the author describes childhood during the war from two opposing aspects. Great read, intelligent and beautifully descriptive.
Amazing story of determination and survival. There are so many reviews I won't clutter the field but suffice to say it was a brilliant read
I enjoyed this book very much. The author writes beautifully and the characters were skillfully drawn. I would highly recommend this novel.
Excellent story. Developed characters quite well.  Too much boring verbiage which I found disinteresting that didn't enhance the story line
Really enjoyed reading this book. Perfectly written. I was captured by the first word. Fell in love with the characters. Highly recommended
Simply a beautifully writtEn book that must be read. Destined to become one of the greats. Pick it up and you won't be able to put it down.
This is a wonderful  story. It even made me cry more than once. This was my first read by this author and look forward to reading many more
The best book I have read in ages.  I loved the writing, the characters, the story.  Could not put it down and was so sad when it was over!
I loved this book. It grabbed me from the beginning right through to the end. I could not put it down. I can not say that about many books.
Beautifully written: WWII novel based in France. Sensitive and masterfully woven. gently pulls the reader into a difficult time in history.
Creative story line.  One author's view of how young people coped with WWII.  A thought provoking title that would be worthy of discussion.
One of the best books I've ever read. Teaching me so much about WWII from perspectives I had never really thought about. Beautiful writing.
Beautifully written. I felt as if I could feel the emotions of the characters, and the story just whisks you along with them until the end.
Really enjoyed this novel. I consider it to be a light and easy reading level, but it kept me interested, wanting to see how the plot ends.
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  The way the writer tells the story is like poetry.  Very moving and difficult to put down.
I so enjoyed the book. To think of what she went through being blind. The ending was wonderful. Out book club will discuss this novel soon.
Beautifully written. Like "Angela's Ashes". Such a tragic subject, but written through the eyes of children., making it compelling.
Imagery is beautiful.  Moments of light spun bright in words.  Story seemed hastily wrapped towards end. Otherwise good read. Recommended .
One of the best books I've read all year. I was somewhat sad as I approached the end of the novel b/c I didn't want it to end. A must read.
This is a lyrical and lovely book that engages from the first paragraph.  It was haunting and stayed with me for days after I finished it.
Not finished yet, but this is one of the most well-written and gripping books I have read in years.  DON"T miss reading this Pulizter!
Enjoyed it. Page turner. A few unexpected twists too. Not the typical world war 2 novel. Unique perspective on a horrible time in history.
Without a doubt, the best book I've read in a long time.  Others have come close, but no wonder this was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize.
ohhhhh SO POWERFUL.....dark in ways but just a reminder what the Nazi invasion of Europe really was about through the eyes of a blind girl
I really connected with the characters in this book.  I loved the heart of Marie Laure and Werner.  These children really warmed my heart!
Great prose: "So really, children, mathematically, all of light is visible." And, "...curses are only stories cooked up to deter thieves."
beautifully written, such pathos, characters developed fully and sensitively - worth reading for everyone - especially for history buffs -
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Our book club of ten men all agreed in was up there with Unbroken and Water for Elephants
Absolutely breathtaking. The story is magnificent. Wonderful for those who love the Second World War period - both men and women. Loved it.
Incredible.<br/>A most intriguing group of characters whom you feel deeply connected to and a most intriguing way their lives intertwine.
Excellent account of WWII, especially the French Resistance. One of those books that I will never forget. Excellent character development.
One of those books that didn't have a lot happening, but one that I could not put down.  Very well written and very cleverly put together.
This is a superb novel. It is a touching and memorable story of lives woven together by war and madness then broken by their consequences.
Feelings of being present with the characters as they traveled through the years of light. Beautifully written. A must read for this year!
I really enjoyed this book. I really liked the fact that we saw the war from a very different angle. I thought it was beautifully written.
Great read! I loved how it let you know what happened to most of the characters. It would have been nice to know what happened to her dad!
One the best, if not THE best book I have read all year! He doesn't tell the reader anything. He shows - vividly and with absolute beauty!
Beautifully written giving insight into characters, historical background, and local details in Germany and France before and during WWII.
This book mesmerized me, every description was a delight, it brought home to me the absolute horrors of the war. I did not want it to end.
Sublime and so well written.  I really liked the characters and it was nice to read about the war from opposing perspectives for a change.
Best novel I've read in a long time. The writing is beautiful, fascinating characters, and an amazing story that commemorates our history.
This the best book I've read in a long time!  It haunts me. The characters are so powerfully developed and the story so intricately woven.
A well written, well paced WW II story without voyeuristic descriptions of atrocities.  And it has an ending!  I will recommend this book.
I loved every chapter, every sentence, every word of the book. Excellent writing and a story that will stay with you for a very long time.
I never got in the flow of the story. I thought it was too wordy and too descriptive of unnecessary subject matter to demand my attention.
One of my the best  books I've<br/>had the pleasure of reading.  Wonderful character development and story.  Recommend highly to everyone
A beautiful story about how WW2 affected everyday people and how chance changed lives forever. I recommend this lovely, though sad, story.
What a heartbreakingly beautiful story. I couldnt put it down. Sometimes thetime shifting was a little confusing but worth figuring it out
Wonderfully developed characters. You see  the impact of the war on everyone involved, not just during it but for the rest of their lives.
This book proved to be a lovely surprise in that it was such a wonderful read, really transported me to the places and the times described
Complex and compelling characters that develop chapter by chapter. Complex and compelling plot as well. Really hated to see this book end.
Quick paced very interesting perspective on war. A little frantic at times but a good un-Hollywood ending. A wonderful traveling companion
Couldn't put it down.  Loved the character development and the tying together of two young people trying to make sense of life during war.
absolutely fantastic . . . I even created a "Keepers"  section for this one<br/>  should be required reading for junior high kids
Wonderfully written. I could feel the war, the suffering, and the tenderness of the characters. Should be required reading in high school.
I have never realized how war completely disrupts life. An eloquent,beautifully written book. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.
well articulated stories of the disrupted lives of ordinary but extraordinary people caught in the evil of the war<br/>I enjoyed the book
Well worth reading.  Thought provoking.  Different perspective of WWII.  The characters seem real and become a part of your very own life.
Wonderful!!.  Descriptions were fantastic and yet not over the top. You just couldn't stop reading. Looking forward to more by this author
This is a WWII story from a totally different perspective, a blind teenage girl in France.  The story was spellbinding.  Highly recommend.
A fascinating book, blending history and science, and leading us through world war two using a blind girl and a young talented german boy.
What lovely writing---a pleasure to read. The weaving of the story is fulfilling and satisfying.  The end is wistful and ...life goes on.
Nice nugget sized chapters with tons of historical detail woven into a gripping plot with several twists.  It's gonna make a great movie!
This book is told from alternating perspectives that could not be further  apart, yet serves as a reminder of what makes us all the same.
Lovely story. Follows two children growing up in France and Germany just before WWII. Wrestles with big, universal questions. Recommended
A beautiful story,but too long and too much technical information. I feel the story could have been . told in a much more concise manner.
Seemed rush near the end . . . please let me write a better ending . . . seem like his editor could have suggest significant improvements
This just might be my first 5 star book.  Beautifully told in images that stir and haunt in the deepest recesses of the human experience.
Beautifully written, extremely well paced. Elegant and thoughtful treatment of events in a time of unimaginable chaos. A wonderful story.
Really liked the language. Read almost like poetry.  Got very involved with the characters.  Will rx to anyone  Where did the diamond go?
Interesting but long.  This is fiction with a historical basis. Well written. Time line jumps around-you have to pay attention to follow.
This was a very interesting story.  I lived in the U.S. during those years and remember the crimes being committed in France and Germany.

A thoughtful, well-written novel about innocent victims on both sides set in World War II, in France and Germany.  I highly recommend it.
A sort of unexpected plot and a really revealing insight to how a blind person especially a young girl gets along in those circumstances.
Exquisite book.  Some of the best writing I"ve seen in a long time. Sensitive story with clever plot line.  One of my favorite books.
Not sure what I missed but I really did not enjoy this book.  Was looking forward to it but as I started it I just couldn't get captured.
This is a wonderful story beautifully told. You will not want to put it down. I shared the story with my family nightly until I finished.

Absolutely one of the most wonderful reads in a very long time!!  I have instructed all my reading friends to be sure to read this book!!
For me,  the story was slow to get going.  I did get into it kept wondering just where it was going. Overall I would recommend this book.
A sad tale of the effects of Nazism on the young and old. We learn of cruelty and kindness, great talent and fortitude, bravery and fear.
One of the best books I've read all year.  I can see why it was a National Book of the Year Finalist.  Great use of language.  Rich book.
Interesting take on this area of WWII Very likeable main characters. Skips back and forth from year to year which sometimes was confusing

This is a gotta read book. It has great characters, mystery, sadness, love and nature tangling up after WWI in Australia. Surprising end.
Not a satisfying read. Almost all the characters are not active; things just happen to them. Also, important characters are just dropped.
A wonderful story. Well worth it. Couldn't stop reading, would recommend it to any one, each caricature and personality well thought out.
All the characters come alive and deserve to be heard.  I will miss them all as they became friends even though none were perfect humans.
Short chapters, fantastic description and character development. Also a very easy read that I didn't want to put down. I'd read it again.

When the story is being told by the blind girl this book is like fine poetry...you really wonder if the author was or is bllind himsel!f
What a beautiful story. I really loved this book! Great tapestry woven between the two main characters, great writing. Highly recommend.
Short chapters keep you interested as you go from one character to the next. If you don't like one chapter, the next chapter starts soon
Just a detailed, heart warming story written by a man who is "a scientist and poet. "  An absolutely fabulous fabulous treasure.
Almost poetic. Structure of story adds to quality of work. Very well-written. Would recommend to anyone. Don't often find so good a work
Beautiful.  A fascinating book on so many levels with a perfect ending at just the right time.  A book I shall read over and over again.
High quality, all the acclaim is justly deserved, and like many books, this one is enjoyed best if you go into it with no preconceptions

This is a meticulous historical fiction that I couldn't put down. Impossible not to appreciate. I was captivated from beginning to end.
Nice to see the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for "All the Light We Cannot See" by Anthony Doerr. I just finished it and loved the story.
I will most likely be thinking of these characters for awhile. Simultaneously gut-wrenching and heart warming. Definitely worth a read.
I couldn't put the book down from start to finish! I highly recommend this book. It was so descriptive but not to point of distraction.
Excellent descriptions of people and places that holds your attention for page after page. You can easily picture what is taking place.
What a beautifully written book! I took my time reading it; I just didn't want it to end. Some of his descriptions took my breath away.
As a friend said, you'll either be giddy that such great writing exists, or you'll feel awful knowing you'll never be able to match it.

Their are no real victors in war. So many lives. Such terrible suffering. Beautifully written. You will care about the main characters.
Sometimes difficult to read because of the content but beautifully written, a very poignant story from another viewpoint about the war.
I liked the way the author told the three stories simultaneously. He showed how the war affected each person in so many different ways.
Parallel coming-of-age stories set against the crushing end of WWII. Beautiful characters and a plot that drives the reader to the end.
An interesting read, but it is definitely over-hyped. It could have been shorter and not suffered. I found myself skimming quite a bit.
I can't put this book down! I have highly endorsed it to several friends. A very memorable book. Books like this one seldom come along.
If you love exquisitely beautiful words, carefully crafted images, and stores of how WWII affected Europeans, this book is a must read.

Totally delightful story,the characters,the time, the perspective. That has a gutsy, real feel to it.  I will read more by this author.
Evokes the horror and despair of war, the depth and power of love and the triumph of goodness and courage over evil.  A wonderful read.

An  amazing story with rich characters beautifully written. It's historical with a little mysticism thrown in. So glad I read this one.
A remarkable story laid out in an unhurried way. Love the long-timescale structure and the essential goodness of many of the characters
I'm not a literary critical.  I consider "All the Light ..." to be historical novel, very interesting and a page turner for me.
Loved the book.  It was a great story of the lives of 2 people during WW II that was so realistic it was diffuclt to put the book down.
Beautifully written , highly insightful , moving moving moving a very huge  thank you to anthony doer for such delicacy and compaession
I really felt transported to novel's landscape. I liked the wick chaper happenings  Loved the author style of writing and storytelling.
Learned so much history and loved the characters . It was a different perspective on a WWII story told in France during the occupation.
It was all I expected and more.  I couldn't put it down.  I stayed up until 2am yo finish it.  Recommended to friend she loved it also.
It was a great story. No matter how much I read about WW2, I always get different perspectives. So much to learn about that awful time.
I don't know how writers weave these tales, jumping between characters and dates.  This was beautifully written in an intriguing style.
Reminded me a lot of The Book Thief. Charming. Tragic. Thoughtful. Metaphorical. Lots of interesting concepts to think about. Read it.
Loved the play with time, the going back and forth in time. Especially when the flashbacks caught up with real time. Great characters.
So well written. This is the kind of book that requires discussion when you've finished. The characters are real... flawed and heroic.
This novel reads like a love poem or a painfully sad song. I chose it over sleep for several evenings. Beautiful. Better than a dream.
One of the most beautiful stories.  It is filled with imagery that tries to balance out the ugliness of war and the goodness of people
A very captivating book, I couldn't put it down. The author went out of his way to get you to smell, feel, and taste what it was like.
Great book - so well paced - and good reading from another angle on the situation.<br/>Will have to read Anthony Doerr's other books.
This is a  beautifully written story. Sometimes difficult to follow the changing time frames and characters but well worth the effort.
I have been reading about slavery, war, and human misery now for the last few weeks.  This book about tops them all.  So true to life.
I concur with all the other reviewers that this is a must read. The descriptions are beautifully written and the story is interesting.
Such detail, such sensitivity.  Brilliant read.  The audible version is priceless, bringing the story alive.  The best narration ever.
What extraordinary writing and graceful plot development.  Such a creative point of view. Highly recommend this beautiful work of art!
It's difficult not to fall in love with the wonderfully complex  characters so lovingly created here by the author. It will haunt you.
Written in a unique style of very short chapters bouncing between characters. Somehow, moves forward and gels around these characters.
Wonderful plot weaving sad events with heartwarming stories about people who were drawn into the war regardless of sides.  Great read.
I felt that I came to know all of the characters personally.  They are memorable and I find myself thinking about the book frequently.
Unbelievably spectacular. I am not particularly interested in WW2 books. This book went way beyond that. My favorite book of the year.
Descriptions were poetic! Some phrases begged to be reread, they were so beautiful! Wonderful story. It ended leaving me wanting more.
I couldn't put this book down. It is a captivating tale of love, war, loss and redemption. Can't wait to discuss at my next book club.
Tender and sweet...yet heart wrenching in its reality. Characters stay with you for days...you think of them as a part of your family.
Great writing. It gave perspectives from both sides of WW2. I saw the diamond in the story as the search for the Pearl of Great Price.
Enjoyed it very much.  However it is a little too long and it does go back and forth in time which can be a little confusing at times.
A compelling story about a blind French girl and a young nazi radio tech soldier.  No more details.  Don't want to give anything away.
Beautifully described , wordy at times ,but wondrous in how the author captures the time and essence of the life and landscape of WWII
A gripping and moving work if empathy and imagination,  A natural possibility for Masterpiece Theater or ither television adaptations!
I've asked myself many times how the world could be so blind to what was happening in Germany.  This book helped answer that question.
a sad story of what happens in a war.  Interesting to view it from those under occupation.  Spoiler alert...it's a bittersweet ending.
Totally overwhelmed. It may be the most  beautifully written book I have ever read. I dreaded finishing it. Like losing a best friend.
I ENJOYED THE BOOK, ESCPECIALLY THAT IT WAS DURING WW2. SOME OF THE BOOK WAS A LITTLE HARD TO FOLLOW, BUT ON A WHOLE IT WAS VERY GOOD.
Beautifully written and the author has good character development. It takes a little while to get into the book but then it takes off.
Great book. Strong characters and a moving story of the kindness of man. So many dead. So many wrong decisions. And yet, we learn not.
This book was so well written. The characters so believable. Everyone in our book club enjoyed this story, and had a great discussion.
A compelling read that pulls you into a time study of humanity,made all the clearer by the blind Marie-Laure. I didn't want it to end.
It seemed long and somewhat disjointed. The violence is due to the war and all that goes with war. Same thing with the sexual content.
One of the best books I have ever read! I thought it was so well written and certainly kept me engaged all the way through to the end.
So very beautifully written! A rare experience to find plot taking second place to poetic prose. Hated to come to the end of this one.
Excellent! Doerr has a unique voice. He tells a great story embedded in the wonderment of physics and the depths of the natural world.
This was one of the books that the book club I belong to read and reviewed.  I have told every reader I know that this is a must read.
There were times I wanted to close my eyes, when the sadness and pain overwhelmed me but the beauty and the light kept me coming back.
Excellent story with memorable characters that come to life against the backdrop of World War II. Hoping a movie will follow the book.
A sweet, somewhat sentimental, but always interesting and well-written book.  I can't imagine anyone wouldn't really enjoy reading it.
Enjoyed all the symbolism and depth of the characters.  Touches of light and music throughout brought joy to very disturbing settings.
Beautifully written, engaging and haunting. Difficult to put down. Wonderful ending that brings closure but not what you would expect.
Beautifully written. Soulful. Memories of war, and death, of family. Marie is a complex soul. Circumstance a mystery. Loved this book.
Spellbinding and sad.....a page turner!! I enjoyed it thoroughly! I recommend it for everyone and am so glad it was recommended to me.
Great Book . I enjoy books about WWII  and this one was very good.  The writing was beautiful.  A lot of info about the war in France.
An outstanding book and worthy of any and all prizes it receives.  I highly recommend this book and it's unusual perspective of WWII.
After a slow start I swam in it and the ending is strong which is often not the case with many writers which is annoying as all hell.
A wonderful story. So sad and yet so true and lovely. I enjoyed it very much, although I did wish for things to turn out differently.
The people you never ever thought about beautifully articulated. A realization that World War II was about more than one devastation.
beautifully written poignant story of the holocaust I highly recommend this book for after reading it a month ago I still think of it
Could not put it down! Great story, amazing characters, excellent writing. Ending was a little disappointing, but still a great book!
This was the most astounding work I have read in the past decade. Dazzling, heartbreaking, affirming. I simply could not put it down.
Loved this book and the story. Read it in three days. Will recommend to friends. Pure poetry, moving swiftly and keeping you engaged.
I needed a happily ever after! Love stories should always end happily.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend to everyone to read though. 😍
World War seen from inside with believable characters.  Setting is plausible and at times the plot is almost biographically accurate.
Historical but his writing made you feel.like you were there. Loved the way he told so many different stories and how they connected.
Like the time period of World War 2. Great story line following the characters and their will to survive. I would strongly recommend!
An amazing tale following a blind girl's life during WWII. Well written with a great story line. Loved this book, could not put down.
A good story, told in an odd fashion.  I feel it had the potential of being "great" but the author just didn't take it to that level.
I did not enjoy the ending of the story.  It had the years go by too fast; and never answered the question about the key.  Thank you,
Loved the book. I felt like I lived through that time with the protagonists .  I will definitely look for other books by this author.
I loved the way the author weaved the two stories together. Would definitely definitely recommend! Beautifully written with good plot
Very absorbing, well written.  A good read, especially for anyone interested in that time (WWII).  Gives a different view of the war.
Nothing short of amazing. I loved the character development and the plot structure. An original, enjoyable book from start to finish!
An absorbing read with characters who claim a piece of you.<br/>Only some scenes seem too visual, as if awaiting the filmed version.
A totally different perspective as "seen" by some one blind. Very well done but sometimes the story lags with so much detail.
All The Light We Cannot See is a beautifully written story about the misery of war in general and the Second World War in particular.
Awesome...  enjoyed the details... and the insight into the many many stories that may exist yet untold by those who lived thru WW 2.
Please read this book.  It will open a world that one hopes will never visit us again.<br/>But somehow that world has already begun.
Wonderful book! The many stories converge inevitably, and the events are told out of sequence, but it all works together beautifully!
Wonderful story. Heartbreaking, but a strong recommended for all teens - twentys. Want to know the broader effects of WWII read this.
I found the story from both points of view, the blind girl and the German boy very compelling.  The book became a page turner for me.
The storied told are impeccably woven together. This book transforms the way I responded to my day while reading it.  Truly engaging.
One of the best books I have ever read, and I have read a lot! I hated to finish it. Wonderful story, beautifully written. Exquisite.
It was a good book, very detailed, but after reading it I really couldn't put it down and say WOW.  It was a fast read though.  WWII.
Great story written from the German and French perspective .  Mystery and intrigue make the story interesting as well as enlightening
Remarkable story<br/>Well written<br/>Unusual enough to remember for a very long time<br/>I recommend this book<br/>A superb read
This is a moving tale with lyrical writing.  Although some happenings were inevitable they wrenched at your heart when they occurred.
Gives the perspective of both sides of a war. Both sides wonder if they are right. It's the viewpoint of the innocent victims of war.
I am sad the stories come to an end. It's been a wonderful journey, I've  enjoyed being taken along in the lives of these characters.
a peak into individual's battle, journey in time of war. a touching story of the life of 2 people's struggle and bravery through loss
Wonderful book.  Lovely characters and a brilliant and grizzly portrayal of WW2 Europe. I couldn't put it down.  Beautifully written.

This was so good. I hated to see it coming to the end. I will seek out other books by this author.<br/>Loved the historical context.
While reading this book I often thought "I don't like this book," but I couldn't put it down!  Interesting, a very good read!
This story was riveting.  The descriptions and the subject matter- Braille, short wave radios, and WWII were intertwined beautifully.
I highly recommend this book. I didn't think I would enjoy it since it was chosen for my book club but it was surprisingly enjoyable.
Beautifully written. Tragic and poignant story provides a glimpse of how this tragic time in our history misled and destroyed people's lives. The magic of this story is in the power of the radio and in the pure resilience of children.
Beautifully written, superb character development, engrossing commentary and detail on the emotional toils of historic World War One.
A bit slow in the beginning, but was beautifully orchestrated for time and place and a sensitive depiction of the two main characters
A very touching story, using WWII as a backdrop. Very interesting to see how Doerr fit all the pieces together. Good for a book club.
A very good read, very well written. A different perspective on the human effects of war with WWII as the backdrop. Highly recommend.

Absolutely wonderful, beautiful writing. A mental painting of youth, resilience and wonderment.  Not a book to ever be taken lightly.
I enjoy this book. Well written in the new style of short chapters going back and forth between each character. Not what I am used to
So much more than a book about WW II.  I love that Saint-Malo is an actual  city and that the story has so much actual history in it.
Taking multiple strings and eloquently lacing them together into one book. Refreshing! Nice to read a WW2 with both sides being told!
Loved the personal side of things that went on from the unusual characters  point of view-- beautiful people caught in such a horror.
Still working on this book. It's dense, but the alternating stories are compelling and the prose is beautiful. So far I recommend it!
Anthony Doerr is an amazing writer - it has been a long time since I have found a book that I could not put down - I loved this book.
A lyrical, magnificently written novel. I couldn't put it down. His ability to take the point of view of a blind girl was incredible.
This is a great book. The writing is superb. The affects of war impact generations. This is one book I will remember for a long time.
Very interesting manner of switching between characters and what was happening in the world.  I really didn't see the ending coming!
Beautifully written. This book looks at the German occupation of France from a different perspective. Through the eyes of teenagers.
It kept me moving along with each persons story, to find out what would happen. I found the endings to their story very interesting.
Amazing i felt trsnsformed  consumed  crlestial ecstatic full thankyou i will recomend this book to everyonewho i care aboutand love
Loved it, and I didn't think I would like a story written along two parallel lines that don't seem to intersect until further along.
I couldn't put it down. An intricate tale written in pieces as a puzzle I couldn't anticipate but had to open one chapter at a time.
Excellent book.  Interesting and heartbreaking story line, and exquisite writing.  Hard to put down.  Hated to finish it.  Loved it.
Intricately woven and beautifully written with complicated and fascinating characters whose lives connect through the drama of WWII.
Beautiful, poetic, evocative--the characters, plot, and language come together to form one of the best novels I have read this year.
This was a very entertaining book. It was fast passed. The short chapters and moving from character to character made it intriguing.
Very interesting take on the era of German invasion of France and the People suffering conditions..and how they fought back..or not.
This was a very interesting book. I really like the way it switched back and forth between characters . I would highly recommend it.
Definite top 5 books ever read and I read a lot.  Such a sweet story.  I felt for every character in this book.  Love love loved it.
Although somewhat confusing, it's interesting how it jumps around in time as much as any book I've read. All in all a very good read
I really enjoyed this book. It was a page turner. The characters lives wove together to create a sweet, sad, and engaging narrative.
Well written with interesting parallel story lines. Bring WWII alive in a difficult way. Great details of Paris. Highly recommended.
descriptions put me there - the story line isn't new, but the emotions, the bravery, the love, the insights are well worth the read.
One of the best books I have read in a long time.  I kept thinking about it long after the end of the story.  I highly recommend it.

Beautifully written. You feel like you are living in the time, experiencing what the characters describe.  Will recommend this book!
Beautifully written. Keeps you on edge to the very end. One of the best book I have ever read. Thanks to the author for creating it.
Beautifully told, true art. It breaks the heart and looses the spirit. It illuminates the world as only art can. It is deeply human.
How the author managed time. Lessons of life we often forgetter that need remembering. That feelings have better insight then sight.
You see a different side to the war but the book is about more than just war--loss, beauty, bravery. You won't want to stop reading.
A wonderful accounting of the barbarity of war and the tenderness of life. Describes how we are not so much in control of our lives.
I really enjoyed this book. This is the first I have read by this author and I will look for more.  I thought it was very well done.
New insight on the war and the ordinary people caught up it in.  Having one of the protaganists as blind was an interesting feature.
Wonderful story told in very unique writing style, and once I started reading I could hardly put the book down.  Highly recommended.
I so enjoyed this book.  Recommended by a colleague. At first I thought oh no not another WW2 story. But this one was so different.
Ineresting that a main character could tell a story after dying-flunked a writing class using that premise.  All in all a good read
This is a novel that reportedly took 10 years to write, and you can appreciate the work with every page, every chapter, every word.
Totally amazing,extraordinary personal visit to those individual who suffered thru the most devastating time in our nation history.
A story that is woven about World War Two written through the eyes of a blind French girl and a German orphan. Beautifully written.
A beautifully written story about the ordinary people's lives, and the resilience of the human spirit despite the awfulness of war.
Wonderfully written. Interesting perspective in you get some insights into growing up and being recruited into the German military.
If ever there was a book that combined artistic language with an incredible story, this is it. I cannot recommend this book enough.
Beautifully written from beginning to end...Loved so much I sent this book to my nephew for part of his college graduation present!
If you have never read a Pulizer prize winner you should read this. Great for everybody including parents with disability children.
Beautifully written story about two young people growing up at the end of World War II. The epilog is both touching and believable.
Fascinating!  It makes me grieve for every child ever touched by war. Which may be all of us.  War sucks. The book is well written.
An elegantly written story that was impossible to put down. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who  enjoys literary fiction.
Loved the story and the writing. Like flowing down a river. Unexpected turns and twists, with a smooth and thought provoking finish
Well written and intriguing storyline set in WW2. A different story concept with very interesting character portrayal. Enjoyable read.
It's been a very long time I haven't read such a beautiful book. Extremely well written, without any bloat of words. A masterpiece.
The plot was interesting, and the protagonists were multi-dimensional and sympathetic and their circumstances were quite difficult.
What an amazing book!  I felt transported to the time and place, connected to the characters.  Incredible writing.  Worth the read!
love reading books about World War II.  This book was heartfelt and told of the lives of people caught up in the horror of the war.
It's a lovely book, full of rich imagery, beautiful writing, and a story to both warm and break the heart.  Truly a wonderful read.
Great book.  Highly recommend. Detailed plot and intricate characters. Good use of history blended with a strong fiction story line
Exciting and excellent.  Read it for my Book Club group and was something I would have not read if not for the groups suggested it.
I loved the structure of the story: the moving back and forth through, time the parallel stories and the questions left unanswered.
I didn't expect to wait until the book was pretty much done for the main characters to meet up.  Was a challenge to just finish it.
A thoroughly enjoyable read. It was not a typical WWII Holocaust novel. It was original in both story and the fresh, crisp writing.
One of the best, if not the best book I have read recently.  In the beginning it was difficult to figure out but later on -- WOW!!!
Beautifully written.  I saw the colors, felt the fear, heard the bombs and planes, felt the carvings and tasted the canned peaches.
This was an excellent read. Interesting characters that were developed well. An all new perspective on WWII. I highly recommend it.
This book was on everyone must read list. It was slow at first but did get better. The characters were well developed and likable .
A little slow in parts .  Held my interest good story. Lot of history .and very historical facts.  Very informative my kind of book
Beautifully written, engaging, historic, and human story of the impact of the Holocaust across Europe. Will long remember this one.
Compelling story that holds your interest--hard to put down as the story unfolds.  I have recommended this book to several friends.
The multiple characters trading the narrative back and forth with each other and through time worked so well. Such a fantastic read.
The character development was wonderfully done and the story was so unique in terms of following the lives of the two protagonists.
I couldn't wait to finish this book but didn't want it to end. Loved the characters and the twists and how elegantly things merged.
Loved this book. The author writes with a richness in language and metaphor that creates a beautiful poetic and sensual experience.
What a beautifully articulated story. The characters are raw, genuine, compassionate, and interwoven in a way that is not expected.
I enjoyed this book about World War 2 very much.  It is very well written and the characters are ones you can easily identify with.
A very good read. Educational. First time I've read this author and will see what else of his is on Amazon to download to my Kindle
I really enjoyed this book.  The author pulls you in so it seems you are right in the middle of the action as the story progresses.
Starts out promising, but becomes pretentious and full of unimportant minutia.  Ended up being a disappointment.  Book club agreed.
A fascinating story about a terrible period of history, and the complicated interplay of German and French lives!<br/>A must read!
I loved every page of this book. It is so beautifully written. I fell in love with the characters and didn't want the story to end.
Best book I've read in a while. The characters come to life and you feel like you are with them thru the journey. Loved the ending!
Wonderfully written, deep character development that drew me in and left me wanting more at the end.  Thought provoking, impactful.
Great characters. Felt uplifted by how<br/>the main characters stayed true to their<br/>values and morality during heinous times.
All Light We Cannot See<br/>This book captures the sights and sounds of WW II and captures the innate goodness of its' characters.
Excellent book.  Great writing.  Loved the characters and the story.  My book group had longest discussion...so much to talk about.
The best written book I have read in ages!  The descriptions made it feel like I was there, hearing, seeing and feeling everything!
An incredible and thought provoking look at two young lives in parallel but contrasting worlds. I loved everything about this book.
One of the best books I've read. Historically interesting story of two young people in wartime Europe seeming unlikely association.
An interesting and sometimes confusing read. An intimate portrayal of WWII from multiple perspectives. Takes time to read & digest.
A beautifully constructed novel. Many things to think about with regard to everyday life and what we do not see  I loved reading it
books that have a historical element to them are wonderful.  They are easy to read because of the story line, but also informative.
Loved this book. Wonderful characters. I enjoyed the historical aspect. But the story had me from the very start. Highly recommend.
I was not going to read this book because my BOOKCLUB didn't love it but I'm glad I did. Once i got started I couldn't put it down.
A great story about the secon world war, with short chapters that will keep you reading. It is the best book I have read this year.
An interesting plot that will keep you reading, set in an authentic historical event (St. Malo during WWII). , Best of both worlds.
Anthony Doer is a terrific storyteller and is certain to win all the big prizes for literature!  Can not recommend the book enough.
A riveting read.  I felt like I got to know the characters; they were so well defined and real to me.  I wish it ended differently.
Such a well written book.  The characters are engaging and you fall in love with each of them.  I would definitely read this again.
Touching and insightful, this book draws you in and holds you until the end. Well worth reading. It's a book you won't soon forget.
Perhaps one of the best books I have ever read... so poetic, so beautifully written and realized.  I could not put this book down!
Did not enjoy the arrangement of rotating chapters.  In congruent to me.  Character development good but disappointing conclusion.
Amazing characters and an intricate war story. A little long at times but beautifully written. Loved this new story from this era.
A gripping, imagistic tale that is as enlightening as it is difficult to put down. The writing is powerful, as are the characters.
Interesting perspective on WW II.  Rarely is something written about the war that lets you see into the lives of ordinary Germans.
The book moved a little slowly at first, but more because it was weaving such an intricate story. The ending was fitting. Perfect.
A truly wonderful novel that will both entertain and enlighten you.  It's a story that will remain in your mind and in your heart.
Beautifully written, compelling interwoven stories of two very different people who meet for a couple of hours at the end of WWII.
Couldn't put it down. The writing is poetic, thought-provoking and spine-tingling. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
The writing is flowing and thoughtful. The story is both historical and contemporary. It was a great experience to read this book.
One of my favorite books of the year. Fresh, fascinating, heart felt, connected, unusual approach to the time period. A must read!
Good character build up.  Seemed long at times, but very good finish. Couldn't put the book down for the last quarter of the book.
Could not put this book down. Thought about the characters even  when I wasn't reading.<br/>Absolutely recommend it for everyone!
None of the canned comments really apply. This is a masterfully written, poignant, historic, beautiful, powerful story. Brilliant.
This book was very well written. Ingenious how there were many parallel stories. Loved it. I really enjoyed all of the characters.
This has to be one of the best books I've read in a long time. I not only learned from it, but I enjoyed it simply as a good book.
I enjoyed the story very much. The author picked his way through the issues from both sides of the war and displayed much empathy.
Such a beautiful look into the small world we live in and how lives cross and change during the trials of war. I loved reading it.
Read it for a book club.  I thought 'oh another WWII book' and was captured by this very well written book.  Couldn't put it down.
I was Mesmerized. I wanted to keep reading, not stop. I became part of the book and the book part of me.<br/>Beautifully written.
Well written. Descriptions made it easy to feel close to the characters. Kept me wanting to read another chapter and then another.
A marvelous book, with compassionate views of humanity and the complexities inherent in the face of war, evil, greed, and goodness
The author's amazing way with words brings the characters distinctly clear. I wanted to reread many passages of pure poetic bliss.
It is a beautifully written book -- like poetry!  If you are a student of WWII, you will love this book.  A Pulitzer Prize winner.
This book proclaims an intimate and insightful memory of WW II. It delves into who we are, all of us, with honesty and compassion.
Disturbing, yet very moving book.  Emotionally difficult to read, however hard to put down,  I recommend it to anyone but a child.
Good, a little confusing hopping from one time of the war to another.  I loved the two different lives of Werner and Marie Laurie.
A beautiful story of love, mystery, heartbreak and war. This story was touching, sad and hopeful. A must read I really enjoyed it.
Loved the book. Beautifully written and keeps you interested throughout. I liked the ending very much. Highly recommend this book!
The fabric of two exceptional lives in two different countries presents facets of WW II unknown to me before.  Highly recommended.
It was very good, at first you need to continue for a couple of chapters to get involved with the story, then u can't put it down.
The story grabbed me and held me; beautiful writing.  Realistic threads that weave in and out of the story.  I felt i was 'there'.
Well written, fascinating, unique story.  Everything tied together nicely, although a bit of suspension of disbelief is necessary.
Marvelous view of WWII thru the eyes of the blind girl in the French Resistance and the German child genius that became a soldier.
Stunning, absolutely stunning.  There are no words to describe how beautiful it is.  Simply read it.  You will be so glad you did.
What a wonderful book - such gripping depictions of what children experience in times of war!  My novel discussion group loved it.
Excellent book. I couldn't put it down.  But it left me in a melancholy mood. Situations in WWII won't always have a happy ending.
I couldn't put it down. Beautiful lyrical story of love, persistence and redemption. A must read. A great film in the right hands.
Beautifully written and masterly crafted novel. Well developed core characters whose stories are expertly interwoven. A must read!
Extraordinary writing!  Beautifully-drawn characters! Fine World War 2 background plots!<br/>My choice for this year's Pulitizer.
Beautifully written story about two adolescents from opposing sides during WWII both caught within the relentless tide of history.
This is a beautifully written and constructed novel that tells a great story of World War II. The best book I have read this year.
I usually avoid novels about WWII - just too sad! But this book was gorgeous (and sad) and it's the best book I've read this year.
Insights into the psychological damage of war and the human response to pervasive evil. Doerr has produced an unforgettable story.
Nice pace and interesting reading.  Followed up with 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas and understand why she liked that book so much.
Beautifully written. Details details. So much investigation into Europe during the war. Well planned out novel with no loose ends.
I loved the writing. A little long but worth it.but what happened to the dimaned? I don't read meany books but  this was worth it.
The book became longer at the end --- and I certainly did not expect the ending.  Many people may enjoy it just for this feature.
Poetic and magnetic.  So beautifully written I wished it would not end.  The story is pure magic and the imagery is unforgettable
Interesting perspective into the lives of the innocent  affected by WWII and the emotional toll forever ingrained in their heart.
Excellent book. Stories weaved nicely together across space and time. At times moved to tears. Highly recommended. Jonas, Berlin.
One of the best books I have ever read. The prose was flawless and encouraged reading and reading because it stimulated interest.
What an amazing book! Well written. Exciting to read. Lots to think about. I highly recommend it. Great for bookclub discussions.
This was an insightful story. The characters live on in my thoughts, leaving me wishing I could have changed the course of a war.
Lovely story. I was transported to another time and place.  Although it was a war story, it was so much more. Highly recommended!
The author has a wonderful command of words so that you feel like you actually there in the setting or feeling the same emotions.
One of the best books I've read in awhile. Couldn't put it down was so worried about Werner and Marie-Laure and their loved ones.
The end is worth the wait. It all comes together. But not completely, as in life nothing is perfect or explainable in human terms
I enjoyed this book a great deal.  I liked how it flipped stories between the characters and between the present and their pasts.
I guess the only books that end with the boy getting the girl are mushy romance novels.  I was hoping this would be an exception.
This book depicts the horrors and futility of war.  It shows man's inhumanity to man and how people on both sides are hurt by it.
I have just re-read this magnificent novel and found it even more beautiful than the first time. I guess the suspense inherent in each short chapter makes the reader want to 'find out' and in so doing one misses how beautiful and deep some of the personae are while others are meanness incarnate.<br/>Re-reading also allows one to admire the writing which I find extraordinary when it describes feelings or actions (Marie Laure never sees but 'listens' to the scenery unfolding in front of her.<br/>A well deserved Pulitzer and should win a Nobel if the latter were given for literature and not for political reasons.
A truly splendid  read about the devastation of tyranny (such as war) and the timeless beauty and strength of some human spirits.
slow start, didn't grab me immediately... but by the time i finished the sample, I knew I wanted to read it... then I LOVED it...
A very interesting, diversified look at action in Europe during WW2. Touchingly shown from two entirely different point of views.
I can't say I would have purchased this book for pleasure.  Its on our list for book club.  I don't care for his style of writing
Wonderful writing, beautiful characters...just a lovely book. Recommend it on audible app as well. The voice they used was great.
Several complex characters. Interesting and kept me intrigued. Would recommend for anyone who is interested in this type of novel
An elegant book. The words carefully crafted and the organization of time and chapters in such a way that keeps you wanting more.
Excellent read and one of the most well written books I've come across in a long time! I plan to read more of the author's books.
Beautiful prose and rich characters.  Our book club couldn't wait to read this book. Everyone enjoyed it and some are re-reading.
I loved the language used and writing style, the back and forth through time. Many descriptions are unusually worded but spot on.
I loved this book! It's got little-known history incorporated into a wonderful story, and it kept me hooked from start to finish.
Brings WWII into focus with a thoughtful balance as seen through the eyes of a blind French girl and an equally blind German boy.
I enjoyed the way it went from the girl's life in France to the boy's life in Germany. I thought the way it concluded was unique.
Beautifully written and full of life. The story of how one soul can save another. Deep WWII history without becoming mired in it.
It was so interesting to watch all the various perspective of the characters as the war progressed.  What devastation war causes!
A thought-provoking and compelling journey. I was captivated by the characters and was left wishing I could meet them personally.
Many of our "seniors" book club members had a hard time following the plot as it went back and forth in time quite a lot.
This book is soulful, deeply touching, and memorable. Truly a beautiful adventure through an ugly time in our collective history.
Very well written. The characters are so well developed. This novel is just a fantastic piece of story telling. Highly recommend.
If you read one book this year, read this.So many threads in this tale set in WW2 all woven together. Not at all what you expect.
Really makes you think about what war and global conflict does to real people on a personal level.  Very well done Anthony Doerr!
An engaging and intricate Second Worl War tale of a young German boy and a blind French girl and how their lives are intertwined.
Wonderful read. Fast moving. The author got you feeling a plethora of emotions. Loved his characters the goodies and the baddies.
Love the writing - interesting story that keep you reading and learning how hard war is for all- often trapped under a bad leader
Heart wrenching! Anthony Doerr does an excellent job portraying the war through his characters lives and eyes!<br/> A must read!
What a wonderful story., and so beautifully written. I cried many times while reading this book. I did not want the story to end.
Great book, loved the back and forth with the two characters!  Would recommend to all.  Never thought I would so love a war book.
Very thought provoking.  Don't think of these things regarding WWII.  Well written.  Would read more books by this author.<br/>y
I can't find a word for the writing.  Perhaps luminescent?  It's surely one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read.
Fantastic novel and story. Fabulous writing style and character development. I'd recommend this great read to anyone and any age.
This is an amazing book!  The reader gets insights into WWII from a totally new perspective.  Anthony Doerr is an amazing author.
OK, but completely predictable, and somewhat soppy in nature.  It was nicely written, good characters and a very predicable plot.
This is a gripping story that brings you into the book, into the world of the characters of the book and makes you wanting more.
The story beautifully captures the tragedy and sadness of war. When will we ever learn?<br/><br/>Poor Paris. Again it suffers.
Excellent book.  Extremely well-written.  I was really hoping the two main characters would get together at the end, but didn't.
This book brings to life the "small" happenings that occur when war was all around you and humanity shines through, is inspiring
I love the unexpected connections between characters that mimic real life relationships; we would say, 'What a small world!"
I adored this book. Couldn't wait to finish it yet never wanted it to end. Makes me very grateful for my own life and blessings.
A terrific novel!  All of the characters had their own way of being blind. It was amazing how the characters' lives intertwined.
Well written and I felt the emotions, hope, relationships, and suspense throughout the entire book. I highly recommend this book
An excellent War time historical novel with in depth character development and story with wonderful detail and color. Must read!
The book flows so well through imagery and feelings of being in those terrible times of WW2. The author has a gift for language.
This book was captivating, I really enjoyed the character development and the shifts of perspective from character to character.
I thought it was a great book.  People who want a fairytale ending may not like it due to its realism, but I found it excellent.
One of those books I wished there was more of (there was plenty I know) when it was over. Beautifully and thoughtfully composed.
Some books change your life, at least for a while, or change your view of the world.  This beautifully observed novel does both.
Loved reading this book! Doerr describes things with clarity and beauty. The characters are vivid. I highly recommend this book.
Wonderful how he gets inside the psyche and perhaps even the soul of these very different people. And the context is compelling.
This is the story of a blind girl and how she survives during WWII.  The writing is very descriptive,but it seems a little slow.
One of the better books out their today. A reflection on survival during the greatest war, . It transports you into time periods
One of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. I know this story will stay with me for a long time, if not forever.
I enjoyed this book. A mixture of pain and betrayal equal to loyalty and friendship. The undying love of a father for his child.
the writing is exquisite and the stories are wound together brilliantly.  I very much liked this book. I read it all night long.
Very engrossing, put you in a different time and country.  Lots of history and some French and German words, but easy to follow.
An intriguing story, full of historical detail. It opens worlds that most cannot imagine.<br/>I hope for more from this author!
Not a favorite, but interesting and well researched. Liked the characters and struggles of a blind girl in WWII was interesting.
This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Both my book clubs reviewed it too and all agreed it was worth the read.
No question that this novel was riveting and enjoyable, but the style of back and forth stories was occasionally annoying to me.
I was intrigued by the alternating person approach to narration.  I found the historical aspects fascinating and profoundly sad.
Interesting story with historical back up. Very intense at times and I would have to put it aside and return to it after awhile.
A very enjoyable read.  I could not put it down.  Very educational too.  A great review of World War II involving many families.
Well written interesting story highlighted with beautiful prose juxtapose against a heart breaking backdrop.  An enjoyable read.
This story is a beautifully crafted tale that changes the reader, a page at a time. The merging of the characters' experiences and histories are both beautiful and tragic. There is no doubt that this remarkable story will remain a lifetime favorite.
The story takes such pains unfolding is small pieces. Along, with wonderful descriptions of things in such detail. I great read.
A very well written book.  Here's my favorite line....“Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever.”
Couldn't put it down. Beautiful story left me wanting more details in the lives of all the characters. Might have to read again.
The senses are fine tuned so that you see without seeing into the worlds of opposing forces and feel as humanity asserts itself.
Absolutely wonderful book!  SO glad it was recommended to me by a friend.  The story and characters were so engaging and lovely.
I couldn't stop reading this book. I love the short chapters "I'll read just one more."<br/> One of the best this year.
Through crisp writing the story of WWII and the effects on individuals all trying to do the right thing.  A gentle and sad story
The "used" book is like brand new.  I received it in just a couple of days after placing my order.  I am reading it now.
Loved the way it went back and forth between the 2 main characters, giving you a feel for the reasons both had for their actions
Superb!  Wonderful character development in a sweet story.  Definitely a must read.  I hated to see the story end.  Recommended.
Enjoyed this book so very much! So well written. Interesting and gave you a different perspective on people living at that time.
the authors way of telling this beautiful, tragic, sweet, suspenseful story is wonderful, should be on every ones must read list
This was an interesting historical story.  I would recommend it for any person who enjoys history.  It was an easy book to read.
This was a wonderful story of two young people caught up in the horror of war. I highly recommend it. It is beautifully written.
Such a fantastic read. It might be set in WWII but it doesn't get bogged down in the misery of it all! A truley wonderful story.
I found the pArallel themes to be especially effective.  The story  was full of little-known  (to me) stories of the Great  war.
An amazing story .I think so much more about what the Germans went though during this time period now after this wonderful read.
I constantly went back and forth to my dictionary, learning words I did not recognize.  The experience was well worth the prize.
Well written and paced story.  Will remember the characters.  I  was always coming back to the book whenever I had time to read.
What a powerful story.  The characters are interesting and well -written. It was fascinating to see how their lives intersected.
I can definitely see why this book soared up as a best seller - it is an amazing story, written so well. A must read, seriously!
Very interesting picture of life in France in WWII as well as a snapshot of the view from the German side.  Engaging characters.
I felt it was well written and kept my interest.  Of course I wanted a romantic happy ever after but I appreciated how it ended.
Well written, interesting if not totally full characters. Some surprises, and a view of life during WW II I had not read before.
Beautifully written and conceptualized.  A very touching story that makes the realities of WW2 accessible without being maudlin.
Beautifully written book.  Touched my heart. I felt as if I were living the story. The development of the characters is intense.
Though-provoking
A very enjoyable read.  Nice pace, thought-provoking and historically interesting.  Characters were convincing.  Sad it's over.
Could not put this book down.  Disturbing as most world war narratives are, but it had such a sensitive side to it.  Brilliant.
Portrayal of the peer pressures in children during the 2nd world war<br/>Recommended to readers of history and war enthusiasts
I loved this book.  Yet another interesting perspective of World War II.  I am planning a trip to visit St. Malo because of it.
Highly recommend, this is just a beautiful novel. The human spirit shines, the development of the Nazis is a warning to us all.
Beautiful, intriguing, creative... the character development was masterful, and the writing compelling. Great story, well told!
The reader is drawn into the intimacies, horrors, bravery and kind actions in war most readers have not personally experienced.
This is an awesome book.  The writer draws you in from the first page.  I would definitely recommend for your reading pleasure.
unexpected yet expected set in this time.  You will get emotionally attached to all the characters, not just the two main ones.
Well... I wanted to love this book but unfortunately i did not. It was very slow reading, hard to get into. I was disappointed.
Eloquent and sensuous writing. One can experience all that Marie-Laure feels through this elegantly-imagined book.  A treasure.
I guess I didn't understand the point of the book. It was a decent/easy read but a lot went unanswered. Wouldn't read it again.
Beautiful story.  I loved the way the author portrayed the blind girl.  I am losing my sight and enjoyed hearing how she coped.
This is one of the most beautifully written stories, with intriguing character development, that I've read in a very long time.
Captivating story. I read this non stop until I got close to the end. Then I read as slowly as possible trying to make it last.
One of the most amazing books I have ever read, and I have been reading for over sixty years.  Stunning characters and history.
Could not put this book down. Instantly was drawn in by the characters and love how the story unfolds all the way till the end.
Wonderful novel. Beautiful story. I recommend it to anyone.<br/>This book was so well written. It caught me and didn't let go.
This books charms you slowly. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I liked it but after the first 50 pages I did not want to stop!
The book was interesting and left me with some questions.  I wonder if someone in my book club will have some possible answers.
One of the best books I have ever read--characters, storyline, redemptive theme, poetic language blended with scientific rigor.
Excellence in written form.  The intertwining of characters is far more brilliant than The Sea of Flames.  Well worth the read!
Engaging, brilliant book. Full of history, intrigue, and the impact of war on all sides. Truly a masterpiece World War 2 novel?
I can recommend this book to those who are interested in WWII. The narrative is told from the points of view of 2 young people.
Beautifully written book.  Some of the descriptions of atrocities were difficult to read.  Why is there such evil in the world?
Great start with good character detail development. By the end, I felt the author rushed to finish the book. Still a good read.
Loved this book! Phenomenal piece of historical fiction that will keep you up late at night because you just can't put it down!
Very thought provoking! A very loving  and show of friendship that exists between the to young friends makes all seem possible.
a nice read, good character development is the best part of the book. The end not so intriguing but fits the bill nevertheless.
Beautifully written and love the structure of the book. A compelling insight into individuals on both sides and their humanity.
Nice story, characters well developed, good prose.  Too much jumping back and forth in time for my taste.  Overall a good read.
Toggling between both parties throughout the book was slightly annoying. Book took some getting into then it moved along nicely
A wonderfully told story they gave you perspective on both sides of a conflict. I found the ending disappointing and enigmatic.
To much rambling. Plot jumps all over the place. Too many details left open. half way thru the book the page numbers disappear.
I am grateful to the dear friend that recommended this book to me. I have been ill and it has helped me as I work on resting :)
Captivating and inspiring. Such a sad time in our history. The author really knows how to bring the emotions out for the reader
Tears are falling from my eyes and I am sad and happy at the same time. What a wonderful story. Everyone should read this book.
I haven't read a book this perfect in a long time. I won't say much other than you can't not love it. I wish it lasted forever.
One of the most beautifully written books I've read in many years. Rich characters, intriguing story, told in eloquent imagery.
Thank you.  What a beautifully written book.  Characters were so well developed. I didn't want it to end and will recommend it.
Fantastic story with real flavor of France and a very particular time during WW2.  The characters are realistic and very human.
The story is very jagged and doesn't flow well. Felt like I was plodding through it. It took great effort to finish reading it.
Just a wonderful story and beautifully told. One of those books that will keep you up at night much longer than you would like.
Beautifully written, vivid language.  At times a difficult story, and kind of a flat ending (to me), but a very enjoyable read.
From the first to last page, a wonderful read.  The characters and enviornment are so well written that you feel you are there.
What a great book. Learned a lot about the war and what life must have been for those who lived through it. Recommend it highly
This was an amazing book, set before and through WWII, through the eyes of a young German soldier and a blind girl from France.
This is one of the best stories I have read.  Gives a clear picture of how the children of Germany and France survived the war.
All I can say is just read it. This book is eloquently written, captivates and keeps you turning the pages. Extraordinary book.
The first "can't put it down" book I've read in awhile. An interesting perspective from very well developed characters.
This is the 1st Anthony Doerr novel I've read; I really enjoyed it. The history, character development,prose, and the suspense.
Beautifully written and an unusual story. I love Saint Malo and the author conveys the power and beauty of this part of France.
An amazing story!<br/>That there are no winners in wars is beautifully depicted, along with the basic goodness of most people.
Beautifully written characters and a plot that grabs you from the beginning and won't let you go.  I hated for the book to end.
Beautifully written, an interesting slant on the horrors of World War II, and the conditions in Europe that lead up to the war.
Excellent  writing.  The story was difficult to read just because it is so well written.  You feel like these were real people.
One of the most beautiful novels I've read in years - an incredible look at the the personal cost of war on both sides of WW2.
I enjoyed the stories and the characters but got lost in he story as I read it over a couple of weeks versus a couple of days.
Story-telling at its best, with carefully rendered characters who struggle to survive the German occupation of France in WWII.
Not as good as I was hoping. Choppy, disconnected and when you finally reach the part you are hoping for, you're disappointed.
It was as good as I'd heard.  I enjoyed it very much and I know that it is one I'll be thinking about for a long time to come.
Incredible. This is a compelling, beautiful, artfully crafted story. One of my favorite books in years. I highly recommend it.
Once you read this book you will know why it won a Pulitzer Prize.  The characters  stay with you long after the story is done
It is a great read, the author's style weaves the character in a fascinating way , connecting them intricately with the story.
It's a warm story about growing up, with personal challenges, during WW II. It's slow and fast at the same time. Good reading!
Very good and interesting.  This book introduced me to Anthony Doerr.  I will now be interested in reading others of his works
This novel manages to blend horror and beauty, war and forgiveness into an unforgettable story of humans amidst good and evil.
Really enjoyable! Doerr writes with great feeling about caring, if fictional, people. Immersive with a great plot and imagery.
Such a long and suspenseful buildup for a brief acquaintance of the main characters.  Maybe that makes it more like real life?
I really enjoyed reading this book from begging to end. Very touching and well written. Highly recommended<br/>Hope you enjoy
A story of two perspectives during WWII.  One a French girl, the other a German boy who becomes a soldier at a very young age.
I loved it, a great book written from the eye witness accounts (so to speak) of those who lived through the war on both sides!
A captivating story that winds back and forth through time.  Told with love and grace. Magically written with rich characters.
Great story.  Well written and informative. You will know what it must have felt like to be a teenager in Europe during WW II.
This book lived up to its excellent reviews. Creative viewpoint, beautifully written, a fresh story of WWII:  a real surprise.
Really enjoyed this page turner. Will be looking to read more by this author. Poignant, bittersweet, deeply moving. Thank you!
This book was a gift.  I loved it.  It was so well written and the story was wonderful.  One of the best books I've ever read.
Such captivating characters and story lines. Felt as though I was there-not just reading. Hated for it to end. Excellent read!
One of the best books I have read ever. Should become a classic. The 2 characters and plots weave together with true artistry.
A beautifully written book - evocative descriptions, nuanced well-developed characters, and a story that holds your attention.
I can see why this won so many awards!  Vivid words suggest that the reader is blind and lives through the pages of this book!
This was a book I had trouble leaving. It was so well written and kept pulling me into the story. I really enjoyed reading it.
Thanks to Dorothy Browne and Jan Reid for suggesting it. I enjoyed the crystalline intricacy and elegance of the storytelling.
I found the story fascinating and the characters were well portrayed.  Enjoyed the writing style and could hardly put it down.
I enjoyed the scene setting and the construction, It was a compelling read, but was disappointed with structure of the ending.
I suspect this will be one of those books I remember for a long time: the compassion and cruelty, waste and cleverness of war.
Took a while to get into but then was reeled in.  The end was a little disappointing but can't imagine another.  Well written.
Great read! So many thought provoking characters. A really interesting perspective of life in Germany and France during WW ll.
Beautifully written and compelling story. I became so involved with the characters and literally did not want the book to end.
I loved the character development and the subtle way the author unmasks the unspoken horrors of war. Really beautiful writing.
Very touching. Wonderful read!!!'  Makes me really think about how the people of that time struggled and how strong they were.
Fantastic read. Words and descriptions were incredible.. It was so hard to put the book down and most of all come to the end..
Fascinating story of 2 individuals one in France and one in Germany durig WWII, whose lives briefy intertwine.  Great writing.
I read this for my book club discussion and am very glad I did. The story kept me intrigued from beginning to end. Do read it.
It is in my top 5 all time best book list. At times I made myself put the book down so I would be able to make it last longer.
Beautifully written.  I found the story gripping from beginning to end (and stayed up way past midnight to finish reading it!)
Great story but wanted more from the ending. Love the back and forth storytelling approach. Entertsining and fast read. Enjoy!
I really liked this book,until the end.How was she able to do the research if she was blind .Why was she not kinder toNight's.
My 5 star evaluation has been validated as this book was chosen by readers on Goodreads as the best historical fiction of 2014
Good read.  Beautiful, lyrical language.  While there are some cultural and historical inaccuracies, it was enjoyable to read.
Doerr dies an exquisite job drawing the reader into the world of war as told through a young people in very trying situations.
Great book and great writer. However, it is a little long with much unnecessary detail. Loved how he developed the characters.
Very enjoyable read.<br/>I felt I understood the war from both a young French child and a young German child's point of view.
So refreshing to read a book with fully fleshed out characters.  And characters you care about.  Could not put this book down.
This book brings a new perspective to World War Two.  It is beautifully written and the story lines weave together seamlessly.
One of the best books I have read in a long time! Anthony Doerr is a brilliant writer. Do yourself a favor and read this book.
What a wonderful read!  I could not wait to go to the next chapter.  Highly recommend this book, which is beautifully written.
. Highly recommend this excellent book. The story line holds your interest through out. The author is a wonderful storyteller.
This is one of those lovely books that's not too heavy to read, but still ends up being a riveting story. A great travel read.
Interesting story. Beautiful writing.I loved the characters and setting. If you enjoy historic fiction,  don't miss this book.
a very well done novel. the last 20% of the book is some of the best literature i have read. would recommend this book highly.
This is a book, whose characters will live with me a long time. A historical novel, the kind I love, and places I love. The descriptions of places, things, and people are so vivid. I know these people! The story line loops from present to past, and then forward with suspense carrying the reader along. One of those you try to savor, like a wonderful desert, and save a chapter or two to make it last, but then you drop everything to get back to it.<br/><br/>The landscapes, the buildings, the characters are all unforgettable. The horror of war, the hope, and courage all make this story a thing of  beauty. There is even a gentle giant.  Thank you, Anthony Doerr for your special gift.
No wonder this won the Pulitzer Prize.  One of the best books I have read in 60 some years of reading.  And, a one of a kind.
Had a hard time staying with it - but several of the ladies in my book club (ages 65 /70) really enjoyed it,  for me -- no --
So beautifully written. Sights,smells, sounds come to life as the reader feels time past. Characters come alive on each page.
A great story about ww2  from the German prospective. Just a special prospective into the lives of young people in the story.
Something a bit different and even when you have read the whole thing, there are still mysteries that aren't really resolved.
I really felt like I knew the characters intimately.  It gave a good idea of what it was like to be on both sides of the war.
It is a touching story. However, the author takes the long road to make this story come together. I found it somewhat boring.
The language was beautiful - almost a prose.  The story was touching and, unfortunately, probably too real.  Loved this book.
Wonderffully, poetically written.  I read it very slowly so I could absorb every feeling of the characters.  Loved this book!
A must read book!  Kept my attention and made me eager to proceed.  The ending makes room for some good book club discussion.
Outstanding WORLD WAR II historical fiction with rich characters.  Couldn't put it down.  Want to read more by Anthony Doerr.
A GREAT writer.  Beautiful prose and expert story-telling. I will be reading earlier books by him.  his writing is exquisite.
Wonderful book with interweaving stories. Well written, compelling and stimulating in terms of the issues and moral dilemmas.
Loved that WWII was treated from a different perspective. I liked the characters and the plot. Would definitely recommend it.
I was really enjoying the book until the last hour.  It felt like another author wrote the ending and it was all unnecessary.
Good read. Page turner. The characters are well defined and brought light to aspects of WWII that I hadn't considered before.
One of the best books that I have read in quite awhile...Highly recommend! I am sure that a movie version will be out soon...
Wonderfully well written book that keeps you involved. You won't want to stop reading it and dread for the last page to come.
I hated the book to end! Marvelous words, imagery, details, history...  Truly the best novel I have had the pleasure to read.
I love historical novels and this one is great! Characters are well developed. Chapters are short and keep the reader moving.
A very compelling story spun around the lives of ordinary people in France and Germany during WW2.  Also a lovely love story.
I enjoyed the depth of the characters, the descriptions of the war torn countries and the brief but meaningful relationships.
It is extremely captivating. I feel like I am in the book! However with all the descriptions it takes a while to get through.
A perfect book in every way: plot, characters, language. Beautifully written. I intend to read it again to savor its imagery.
I cancelled everything and slipped into this story, I will miss them all and wish them well. This author had his way with me.
An incredible novel. Well written and so informative. Fascinating insight into World War Two and some of the people affected.
I loved this book. Different and had more to it than just a story about a blind girl. Liked the style of the writing as well.
Albeit a bit convoluted, beautiful descriptions of St. Malo and, separately, the horrors of being in the German army in WWII.
Beautiful language, clear imagery, ever changing, the characters capture you and do not let go, good luck trying to let it go
Fabulous use of interesting descriptors.<br/>A bit weak in the wrap-up.<br/>Looking forward to trying another of his works.
This story tells in exquisite detail how a blind young French girl and a brilliant young German soldier are brought together.
A powerful story follwoing two threads, two lives, which the reader expects to intersect at some point.  Very well developed.
An amazing book that covers a topic that has been exhausted!  This book however is extremely well written and worth the read.
Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.  Stirs up thoughts about what life was like during WWll for those in Europe
I can't explain the beauty and pathos contained in this work. It Is a wonderful piece.  Read it. It's long but well worth it.
I Really enjoyed this novel very much!  Will recommend to friends. Very well written, I enjoyed the characters and the story.
Seems well researched and transports you into another time and place seamlessly. Generated great discussion in our book club.
Very well written novel about a blind French girl and an<br/>orphaned German boy who finally meet up during the end of WWII.
I absolutely loved this book.  It is beautifully written, flows well and is full of characters you want to know in real life.
Riveting and thought provoking.  Loved the short chapters because I rushed to the next with anticipation of a new revelation.
Another fictional story of ww2.Iived through that time and now I'm interested in stories of that time.i found it fascinating.
Totally engrossing story of the horrors of World War II from the perspective of two children on opposite sides. A great book.
Ok book but I don't like an author going back and forth. Between people.  Somewhat disappointing ending.  Not a relaxing read
Beautifully written and quite engaging. Haven't looked up so many new vocabulary words since I read Moby Dick. Terrific read.
Beautifully written, a visual treat. Couldn't help but be sad as the book comes to an end. A master of story telling. Superb!
A beautiful powerful well written story. I enjoyed every character. I wante a to know more and more about them with each page
I will never forget this very special book! It's in my "all time" top ten! Gorgeous writing and compelling narrative.
Enjoyed the history of WWII that is entwined in this novel about youth and survival during times that we can ok only imagine.
Haunting, exquisite, delicately told. Marie-laure was a great and worthwhile heroine. I was sad to reach the end of the book.
A contemporary work of art, written with pathos, wisdom, knowledge, feeling and angst.  It is first and last a story of love.
Great story, excellent topic and very well told, fast moving and reverting, I could not put it down, definitely worth reading
Easy to read but hard subject matter. WW2 was always a well talked about subject in my home growing up the daughter of a vet.
Interesting book about World War II. Character development well done. Learned a lot about Germany and France. I recommend it.
A fresh view of those who lived in Europe during World War 2, the story kept me entertained from the beginning until the end.
This book was well-written. The author weaved two entirely different situations into a story that was moving and interesting.
Important book for all to read about the scary time during WW2 and how many of us turned away eater than standing up to evil.
Excellent book,,,hard to put down.  Character development was very good and story was<br/>riveting.  I couldn't put it down!
I could hardly put it down!  I'll be recommending it to friends & family who have been searching for something great to read!
This is an incredibly good read. The imagery and use of language are sublime. It is the best book I have read in a long time.
I almost stopped reading during first chapter or so because it was so unclear as to what was happening.  Glad I kept reading.
An incredible and most poignant journey that was a pure delight to take a truly beautifully written book and a beautiful book
Loved this book, especially the way the author tells the story from all the characters perspective, and weaves through time.
I was immersed in the characters from the beginning.  A different view of this time in history.  Well written and emotional.
Great read. I love historical fiction especially World War II. Excellent play on words and so descriptive. Wonderful writer!
Even the Germans suffered at the hands of the Nazis. A well written story of many stories intertwined with sadness and hope.
Such a beautifully written book. I liked the way the author alternated voices and chronological time. Was sad for it to end.
A story of true purity and bravery juxtaposition to the Nazi idea of purity and bravery. Weave in fate and you have classic.
Beautifully written story about surviving and overcoming tragedy and the most difficult of circumstances.  Highly recommend!
Loved this book, I would definitely recommend It to anyone who wants a deep read. Was captivating and transporting. merchant
Good read about a blind girl who surprised everyone with her capabilities, nurtured by her fathers devotion during war time.
I found the story slow, with the following two separate life stories. Some of the story seemed somewhat impossible/unlikely.
I loved the two main characters. The stories of the main characters and how they were drawn together in the end was special.
Great story. Great writing. Just a pleasure to read and follow the characters' journey thru the violent part of our history.
Total page turner... with each chapter following alternating characters and moving back and forth through time effortlessly.
Not just another novel based in WWII. Good story. Good writing. Amazing how much author could communicate in short chapters.
The characters were well-developed and the technique used to intertwine these players was creatively employed.  A good read!
The author's writing is wonderful and the character development is very detailed and comprehensive.  A very compelling read.
Even though the topic is war, the lush writing of this story, and its empathetic characters make it a delicious page turner.
I enjoyed this book about World War 2 very much. It is very well written .Couldn't put it down. Have already recommended it.
I loved it.<br/>A bit confusing at times with years going back and forth.<br/>There were wonderful characters and stories.
This was a book club favorite! Great writing, great characters! You will not be disappointed! Now get out and get this book!
Many layered work about WWII, but not completely a Holocaust book. Very engaging and lots of food for thought and dicussion.
A short wait for delivery but arrived in perfect condition. Excellent novel, well written, would highly recommend this book.
This book did not meet my expectations and was not a page turner. Though well written I found the subject matter depressing.
A glorious, beautiful, fascinating book, written with a depth of knowledge and compassion rarely seen in literature anymore.
fabulous book....now one of my favorites....very well written beautiful characters.  thank you Mr. Doerr....I love this book
Best novel I've read in a long time--it really took me away, far into the world into the characters and milieu of the story.
Beyond the horror of war lies a deeply spiritual story of hope and survival,of goodness over evil and the power of memories.
Good story, looked to me like the author had a problem getting out of it.  It is a good WW I I story from a different slant.
A mesmerizing story of good and evil interposed upon innocent people who become great by their survival and integrity. Bravo
Could not put it down after I got past the first chapter.😊Enjoyed the story very much. Leaves you grateful for lives today.
Haunting and insightful....homage to humanity, birds, science, and music. One of those books I'm so sad to be finished with.
This is an amazingly well written book. Each character brings life to the story. Recommend to anyone who enjoys WWII fiction
Two young people, each suffering from disability, one physical, one emotional, seek to find a way through the horror of war.
Interesting characters, twists and turns throughout this very coherent story! One of the best books I have read this summer.
Touching story. Well written. Read it in a day. Hard to put down. Highly recommend. Many levels of meaning.  Really enjoyed!
Listened to the audio book. It was stunning and left me with many new memories that are and aren't mine. Fantastic writing.
loved it !  Couldn't wait to finish it and then wanted more.  Very real characters , interesting look at both sides of war.
Excellent read. Poignant view of people caught in the grip of war, especially the youth caught up in the rise of the nazis.
Interesting characters in Germany and France During WWII. Twelve more words required to post my book review. That all I got
Time jumping was a bit confusing.  Otherwise, it was an enjoyable and many layered read, good for our book club discussion.
What a breathtaking story of the courage of individuals and the horrors of war. Truly exquisite and impossible to put down.
Really nice story that grows on you as you read the book.  Towards the end your only regret is that it cannot go on and on.
As a child of a World War II veteran, this story gives light to a dark time in history. Compelling characters. A must read.
The book was written so beautifully.  Wonderful characters  Doerr is one of our best living novelists, I believe.  Read it.
Wonderful, well -written book. It was definitely one of the best books I've read in the past few years. Highly recommended.
Intriguing insight into the lives of two families, one from France and one from Germany during the horrors of World War II.
A special book.  Once started couldn't put it down.  Probably one of the best books  I've read.  Awesome reading for anyone
Beautifully written about a side of World War II that is not well known to the younger generations.  A very touching story.
Beautifully written; I thought I was over reading about the complexities of World War II but I am so glad I read this book.
Well written and an unusual war story. Shows the way war affects the young people caught up in a war they don't understand.
Five stars because I can't give it ten. Poetic. A wonderful work of art. Love and war. It doesn't get any better than this.
I enjoyed this book but felt the ending was a bit contrived - trying to end things suddenly doesn't satisfy ma as a reader.
The book was poetic and graphic. As someone who has read a lot of historical fiction and nonfiction this is one of the best
beautifully written of course and moves in a way that keeps you on the edge of it's intensity but doesn't get overwhelming.
Just phenomenal. So well written I was transported right into the book. So sad to be finished with it. Kudos to the author.
Loved this book.  The words paint the stories in grand fashion.  Would recommend to everyone.  Never wanted to put it down.
Extremely  &beautifully; written in thoughtful language with 3 contrapunctual sets of characters that eventually intertwine.
The incredible detail of war and people inevitably caught in the wide web of war overwhelmed me. Beautifully written novel.
Beautifully crafted piece of writing. Highly intelligent and well developed characters.<br/>Best book I have read in years
No wonder it won the Pulitzer Prize! It is simply the VERY BEST!! Hopefully we will see it on the big screen in the future.
I had a bit of difficulty getting into the book, but when I did, I couldn't put it down.  Historical even though fictional.
Not sure I'd recommend it, because of the long ending, but it definitely captured the details of WWII, which fascinates me.
Took awhile to get its hooks in me, but beautifully written and well worth the read. Highly recommended historical fiction.
The language is so beautiful, I just wanted to savor each sentence.  I recommend this book for everyone - it was that good!
It had a slow beginning for me, but then I could not put it down. I could almost feel Marie's fear as she hid in the attic.
I did not care for the skipping about on time periods but can see how the writer was incorporating this into the story line
The author captivated my heart with the story of a brave blind girl & young German boy caught up in nazi invasion of france
One of the best books I have ever read. Captures and releases time. Character development and writing style are phenomenal.
One of the most powerful books I've read in a very long time. Beautifully written - I felt like I knew the characters well.
I can't recomment this book enough!! Fascinating story of two teens during WW11 in France and Germany. Beautifully written.
Vividly written story that gives so much about the brave people that fought the battles of selfish politicians! I loved it!
I loved the format of the storytelling of this book. The imagery was incredible throughout. Truly enjoyable; a great story.
A wonderful flow through time and characters aging.if you are 85 or even 90 you can remember and relate to each time frame.
This is a beautifully written novel of coping with what life gives us, and of a relationship bound by the nightmare of war.
Touching account of what civilians went through in ww11<br/>Keep your interest all the way to the end<br/>Good characters
If you enjoyed "Sarah's Key", you will love this book. Beautifully written and a great narrative. Highly recommend!
Each person was described so well. The war almost too vivedly. The author new her subject. The sadness that all wars bring.
Beautiful writing. Excellent character development. Poignant story illustrating how all of life's characters are connected.
How can you describe war? This book finds a way. And it leaves you to feeling you should spend more time with your friends.
When you got into the characters it was ok, a bit too much in detail for me towards the end. But overall an enjoyable book.
A very interesting look at World War II from the perspective of a blind girl and an orphan boy who was in the hitler youth.
I loved this book, and didn't want to put it down. It was if I was living the life of each character as I turned the pages.
I love the way Anthony describes situations and surroundings and people. And I like the pace of the book. He is a cut above
Beautiful story. Highly recommend this book! The author's prose is perfect and the story is worth every page spent reading.
Beautifully written, the descriptions of objects that the blind girl spoke of were amazing. The ending left me flat though.
very real characters and an excellent story.  the back and forth worked well.  confused at the ending.  what about the key?
I really enjoyed the descriptive writing style and the way the author led the reader through the various characters' lives.
Love how the author is able to translate the world from the perspective of blindness - how her other senses are heightened.
Lovely book.  Gets quite suspenseful in the third quarter.  Intense character development and amazing descriptive language.
Beautifully written.  Unexpected twists and turns.  Impressive that such a young author has such a fine command of the era.
The characters are interesting and human.  The story is touching and thought provoking. This is an enjoyable read for sure!
What an amazing and very powerful book. It's very intense and very beautifully written. I unequivocally give it five stars!
This novel was beautifully written, very poignant ,and a wonderful story, but it ended a little too abruptly for my liking.
Nicely written and provided the minds eye with a visual of WWII realities.  Love how the stories tie together.  Great read!
Another book about WWII, but with a twist.  Where is the missing gem?  Where is my father?  Good twists on a familiar plot.
Well, this was an amazing read.  I could not put it down.  The ending was better than I expected.  Thanks for the referral.
WWW 2 era and historically correct account of the burning of Saint Malo interwovenwith two young people on opposing sides .
Interesting history ,good character building. This book held my interest but because of the details it was not a fast read.
Excellent writing ,real literature and beautiful descriptions. One of the best books I have read recently.Highly recomended
Great story of family and choices for 2 very diverse children during a very tumultuous time in world history. Well written.
I liked this, a mix of The Book Thief with notes of Goldfinch. Intriguing war story  and a how a couple met near war's end.
A great book.  I could not put it down.  The young characters were so strong.  I hope Doerr continues writing n this genre.
Pretty good story.  Liked the characters.  And then the swearing and crudity begins.
Complex. beautiful, thoughtful novel. I was sobbing near the end - such an interesting, fresh perspective on World War II.
This has to be one of the best books I have read this past year.  Great writing, great subject, and extremely interesting.
This is one of the best books I have ever read and I have read many. The story was compelling and the prose was beautiful.
I had to keep reading even when uncomfortable. Felt as if I was there with each character and cared about them. Well done.
engaging story, well written, characters you can care about.  would recommend to anyone looking for a quality book to read
Why did I wait so long to read this wonderful book? The descriptions make you feel like you're right there in WWII France.
Actually 4 and 1/2 stars. Interesting characters and the story is told from varying viewpoints. In all, an enjoyable read.
Following the two young children as they travel through the same time in history from opposite viewpoints was captivating.
So well written. I could not out it down. The characters were wonderfully rendered and your heart ached for both children.
Hard to read some of this history, but impossible not to.  Amazing characters.  How do humans survive times such as these?
Superbly written story about challenging lives during WW<br/><br/>Superbly written story of challenged lives during WW2.
This was one of the best books I ever read and I am an avid reader.  Very hopeful book, surprising too. And of course sad.
A beautifully written book giving insight into every day characters and how they were effected by a tragic and brutal war.
Once I got into the rhythm of the book I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down! Looking forward the reading it again.
Fantastic!  One of the best new books I have read in years.  Wonderful characters, great story line, and terrific writing.
What a wonderful sad story about the goodness in people.  I highly recommend it and wished it could have gone on and on...
What a breathtaking book!  In the midst of the horrors of war is this story of grace, courage and love.  Not to be missed.
I couldn't put this story down unless I had to! Great book! The author keeps the reader engaged and always wanting more...
loved the story but also enjoyed the historical background on what was going on in France and Germany during the war years
Not too impress. I couldn't really connect with the book, but I did find it fascinating the model city that das had build.
I enjoyed this book very much. It was a different view of such a historical time in our past. I would recommend this book.
I was very disappointed in this book. The story lines dragged on and on, and the time shifts were unnecessarily confusing.
One of the very best<br/>I could not put it down<br/>So many memories of my growing up years during the war in France...
Loved the book. This is normally not my genre. I am a paranormal romance type of girl. But I could not put this book down.
Took a chance on reading this book as I am not a reader of war stories. The story really kept me interested .Well written.
Its surprising how you can read  the book about  WW II and still be left without some bed taste in your mouth. Pure magic!
Very intriguing until the last minute. A great story of family, loyalty, and love. I will definitely read this book again.
So many great stories to one book. Every character is embedded in your mind. Travels through time with each until the end.
Well written and enjoyed seeing both characters on opposite sides but both with humanity.  Enjoy a good read for everyone.
Beautifully written with a depth of understanding of how the universe shapes us and how choices we make shape our destiny.
It was a slow start little hard to grasp all the characters .  But half way through I couldn't put it down .  Great story.
It was a great story that held my interest. I enjoyed getting to know the characters and the effects of WW2 on their lives
One of the best books I've read. There was a stupendous sentence on almost every page. And the plot never was predictable!
The book was just  OK. The story was OK but this was not the best I've ever read. I don't know what all the hype was about
I battled to put it down - a moving account of how the war affected ordinary children. Written with depth and sensitivity.
Poetic, at times dreamy writing and a moving story at so many levels. Great for history buffs, but so much more than that.
As a rule I don't read very much fiction but I am happy I chose to read this book. It is a real page turner a great story!
The war through the eyes of its youngest victims and most innocent observers.  I loved it and will keep thinking about it.
This was one of the best books I've read in years.<br/>The story grabbed my attention from the beginning and never let up
...tale unlike any war novel I have read. Its impact will affect you for a very long time. Read it, you will not be sorry.
A bit awkward as it moves back and forth in time, but engrossing childhood characters help you feel the danger of the war.
Beautifully written story about the intersecting lives of a French blind girl and a German boy set in WWII.  A must read!!
Unusual characters.  A story of radio waves.  Different slant on effects of WW 2 on children living in Germany and France.
I haven't read a more beautiful, haunting book in many years.  Absolutely amazingly well written.  Mr Doerr is a magician.
One of the best books I have read all year.  The characters are drawn perfectly and the language is remarkable.  READ IT !
Excellent book. Loved it!  Events of the war in Europe as told from perspective of very young people who lived through it.
What a wonderful story intrenched in a/an historical setting. Beautiful writing, moving characters, just a wonderful book.
Simply...deep calling to deep. A wonderfully spiritual read, from then until now. In fact I may re-read it during holidays
This book is a lovely fictional account from World War 2. I would whole heartedly recommend loosing yourself in this book.
This story of intersecting lives during WW2 is artfully written. It is sad, as any book written about that time period is.
Did not think I wanted to read a book about a blind girl during World War 2, but it turned out to be more than I expected.
A beautiful poignant telling of a slice of life during WW2 when paths cross in unexpected ways towards survival and grace.
This is one of the best books that I've ever read about WWII.  Incredibly written.  Very long, but every page was awesome.
Loved this book! Also had to go back and read about WWII and the occupation of France, so it was a history lesson as well.
Loved this book.  I was very engaged with the characters and plot.  I didn't want it to end!  Beautifully written as well.
Really gave you insight into how horrific WWII was for both sides.  Also, showed how propaganda affected the German youth.
Heartbreaking and poetic. Sweeping and minute. Lovely. War is the third character but never the first person. I want more.
Beautifully written , interesting perspective of World War II . Will make a great discussion for our book group this week.
Great story and view of the pressures on individuals during the Nazi occupation.  I have recommended it to all my friends.
Such intense suspense, such possibilities, that I would have to put it down for a bit and walk away . . . but not too far!
Too flowery lost story in hauty words.  Very weak ending.  Could  see why the elite  would like it.  Read something else.
I couldn't put this book down but as I came close to the end of the book - I read slower because I didn't want it to end!
Not really a romance novel, otherwise I probably would not have finished the book. Fictional history is always a favorite
An amazing read.  Words cannot describe how beautifully written this book is!  Doeer is a master of language and imagery!
Riveting story of two lives intertwining during Hitlers rule. Short chapters flowing back and forth ....hard to put down.
This is the first novel I've read that upon reading the last word, I wanted to start over and see what I might've missed.
Fantastic. I didn't want to end. Doerr's style pulls you in from the first page. I can't wait to read more of hills work.
Someone recommended this book, so I read it. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down until I was done. Great storyline.
Werner, Frederick, Volkmann (the good German soldiers) & the intolerable were the waves that rode upon Marie Laure's sea.
Something about the way this book is written evokes such emotion. I felt fear and anxiety for (or with) these characters.
This beautiful book will be recommended, given as presents and talked about for a long time. It is beautiful. Read it now
Well written, well paced - captures the Life of two children growing up during the war from opposing cultural viewpoints.
An amazing story that kept me up all knight reading<br/>I'd like to give it 4.5 stars but don't know how<br/>Great read
This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. It is amazingly beautiful and breathtaking. Treasure every page.
This book makes you care about the characters and how much they went threw in World War 2. I recommend this for everyone.
A wonderful historical fiction read in the same vein of Eric Larsson's writing. Beautiful and terrifying all in the same.
This book was ok. Painful to get through but I finished it. I think it could have been half as long and equally stirring.
Riveting, eye opening, sorrowful and hopeful.  This is an excellent book for mid-high school students, as well as adults.
This author has a unique voice, describing the world within his story in a way that makes you savor his words and images!
I wasn't sure about this book when I started reading it...I couldn't put it down after about 30 pages...a new favorite...
The back and forth parallel stories make it difficult to get into but stay with it! You will fall in love with this book.
One of the most amazing books I have ever read. I will be thinking about it for years. A description does not do justice.
One of those books that you cannot put down.  So well written.  Would recommend it to anyone. Loved it from start to end.
I loved this book.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.  Wonderful statement of the waste that war is. Awesome read.
This book was beautifully written and shows a deep understanding of how war and tragedy affect lives in on going ripples.
Was a great read and very informative. Hopefully it can help to avoid repeating history. Too much violence in the world !
I felt empathy for all the characters and felt a deeper understanding of that period of time and the situation in Europe.
I just really liked this book. it was such an interesting story and told of the love and compassion of all the characters
Very well written - almost poetic.  An unusual story but quite captivating.  Was sorry when I was finished with the book.
Adds to the history of world war 2..Told in a very unique way. Well presented with some mystery weaved in until the last.
Imaginative plot line, which provides a nearly tactile description of the challenges encountered by someone who is blind.
A wonderful well written book.  In this day and age, it is hard for us to understand what people went through during WW 2
This book is, of course, about the ravages of war, but the "worlds" we discover are so full of grace. I loved it!
Beautifully written, and lead characters fully realized.  But sometimes confusing as to who the ancillary characters were
Well written - good read.  Enjoyed the book very much yet it didn't feel like a compelling read that I couldn't put down.
I'll remember this book for a long time. It was written so exquisitely and the story was riveting. I recommend it highly.
This book starts a bit slowly, but the stories it interlaces are each beautifully drawn. I would definitely recommend it.
We so soon forget about the atrocities. This book reveals two more facets of how it affected so many. A "gem" of a novel!
Excellent book about world war 2 from a different perspective and many turns. in story that was tied together in the end.
I really enjoyed the historical detail and the emotional and full portrayal  of these amazing characters.  Unforgettable.
Great Book. Not the kind of book I would normaly read, but I found the story very interesting and I enjoyed it very much.
Such amazing descriptions of the lives of the characters and the affects of war on innocent lives. Recommend it to anyone
A real page-turner. Don't start reading before bed or you'll miss a night's sleep. Beautiful writing, heartrending story.
I will be visiting the cities in France this summer so the area was exciting for me. Great story and loved the characters
Should have ended at the 85% mark, not really thrilled about what happens after than.  But great book through that point.
This author paints beautiful word-pictures as backdrop for an emotional story of coming of age during the horrors of war.
Beautifully written. Best read in a long time. War takes such a toll on humanity. World leaders should have to read this.
amazing beautifully written couldn't put it down the descriptions of light leave you craving each page will read it again
War is always the same old story, grandiosity in motion. This rendition of the story is written with insight and empathy.
The writing was lyrical. The characters were fascinating. The story was woven together brilliantly and it made you think!
This was such a good book.  It gave me a good idea of what life was like for the French people who lived through the war.
The back & forth of the story became tedious. Also the 2 main characters only had a brief encounter so late in the book.
This book was well written and kept my interest clear to the end.  I am looking forward to another book from this author.
Liked the characters viewpoints and feelings they experienced during the story. I recommend it for all to read and enjoy.
I loved and despaired of the world of this novel. Wish there'd been more of the encounter between Marie Laure and Werner.
Beautifully written story.  I liked the short chapters and the suspense building towards the end.<br/><br/>A must read.
Well written, fascinating characters showing a different side to WW2 but just as sad and compelling. Highly recommend it.
Loved this book.  If you are into historical fiction, it's a good one for you. Well written, great character development.
Good read. It goes from character to character in different chapters. Even changes years. This can be confusing at times.
Beautifully written, spellbinding novel......one of my favorite WWII stories.  Deserves rereading to truly appreciate it.
Book club choice, excellent and had great historic story line.  Fun to read and discuss over coffee!  Everybody loved it!
Beautiful novel. Amazingly written, and masterful merging of the two main characters' plots. Could not put this one down.
Amazing story, couldn't put it down! So beautifully written and well developed characters...so sad to read the last page!
This is one of the rare books that you live inside while you read it. Completely beautiful. To read it is to be enriched.
i liked because it gave me insight into what you would go through if you were sightless.  It was good book, well written.
I just could not get into this book, but I did read the whole thing anyway.  The writing just wasn't enough to capture me.  Originally I was going to choose this book for my book club presentation, and I am so glad that I did not choose it. I prodded along; but for some reason, I  was totally disinterested.<br/><br/>Someone had compared this to "The Book Thief".  There is no comparison as "The Book Thief" was a wonderful book.
Wonderful book.
Fantastic read!
Beautifully written insightful book about WWII from the perspective of two innocent children, one German and one French.
I loved this book. The character development is great, the writing is very descriptive, and it's very thought-provoking.
A unique style which keeps you totally engrossed. I was sad when I got to the end that there were no more pages to turn.
Great read. Pleasure to the senses although one may be missing. An education in life and loss in the face of occupation.
Not a happy ending but a great read and definitely one of my favorites. The intensity of the young and all their dreams.
Absolutely loved this book and could not put it down. Masterful crafting of a riveting story. When's the movie come out?
Excellent story , well written, each character has there own flaws and good points, gripping WWII story based in France.
It was good story. The writing is lyrical. I loved the vocabulary. Read it on a Kindle so you can quickly look up words.
Loved the book, written beautifully. There are many books out now about WW11 but not many written from the German angle.
I'd heard a lot of good things about this book, so I read with high expectations and those were surpassed substantially.
Richly textured, multi-layered writing.  Superb character development.  Deeply moving story, with a poignant denouement.
book in a very long time!  I have encouraged everyone I talk to READ this!!!!! My daughter is travelling Europe with it!
Have not finished..but intentions to do so. So far the words that describe..weave, dark, compassion, historical review..
A can't put it down book. The short chapters permits the reader to keep track of the main characters. Not a lot of death
Interesting story which moves quickly. Throws light on the suffering of both sides in WWII.  Clear descriptive language.
Beautiful story, eloquently written. Anthony Doerr is a true wordsmith.  My only regret is that the book ended too soon.
Absolutely loved this book. When I finished, I missed the characters so much I started reading from the beginning again.
Lovely descriptions of our world through a blind persons's "eye". Good plot narration and believable characters;
I enjoyed this book a lot. I liked the subject matter.And I liked the author's sensitive treatment of the characters....
What a wonderful journey we are taken on through these pages. I finished only to want to read it over again immediately.
A gripping plot - couldn't put it down.  Confusing when the story would jump ahead a couple of years and then jump back.
Well written and fascinating tale of WWII told from the point of view of a young German soldier and a blind French girl.
Long, sometimes excruciatingly detailed in its descriptions of things.  A good book, not sure it's worthy of a Pulitzer.
Wonderful book. This is a must read to commemorate WWII. Those that died and those that survived. This is a masterpiece.
Wonderful book with marvelous characters and a page-turning plot. I could not put it down.  Can't wait to see the movie,
Wonderful story.<br/>I haven't finished reading it but keeps one fascinated.<br/>So well written.<br/>Get a copy now!
I have read many books about the various aspects of WWII.  This book offered an entirely different and compelling story.
Good story, good pace with many interesting characters that are brought alive by the real historical events of the time.
Wonderful unique story.  Seldom have I ever read a book that so puts me in the<br/>place of the character so perfectly.
Enjoyed this book immensely.  It has a great story line that keeps you engaged from the very beginning to the last word.
What fantastic story to tell.  He has you on the first page your a goner till the end of the book ! Absolutely loved it.
Beautiful and compelling book. Loved every minute of it. So nice to read a book with so much meaning and thoughtfulness.
Love that this book shows different perspectives of such a trying time. I could not put this book down until I finished.
Superb reada .  Couldn't put it down.  The characters - both French and German - were beautifully created and memorable.
What a wonderfully written story!  This wartime novel was both tragic and uplifting.  I found it almost poetic. Read it!
One of my top 5 favorite books ever. Beautifully written heartbreaking....but in a good way.  You should read this book.
An amazing book about World War 11 that takes you into the personal life of men, women and children and the Nazi regime.
It was mean to be an allegory, I think, but I never quite got it.  Doerr should have ended it without trying to explain.
When you want to begin reading the book over again, you have a diamond in hand.  Truly, wonderful story so well written.
Well written, riveting historical fiction.  I could not put the book down.  Good book for young and old, history of WWII
An interesting view of World War II from the perspective of 2 young characters, one from Germany, the other from France.
This book started out well but then the ending was not gratifying.  It was as if the writer lost his place in the story.
Original, inspired approach to the novel form. Minor, human characters within the broad scope of World War II, committed
I doubt that I will ever forget this book.  It is beautifully written and is about a time that is hard to believe today.
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Deeply moving, beautifully written and a compelling, captivating story.
This is a book to savor. Beautiful writing and interesting story. I found myself rereading portions to not miss a thing.
Twisting turning plot weaving stories between the French and Germans, young and old, those who see and those who cannot.
Exquisitely written, beautiful story line. Characters to care about. I didn't want it to end. Waiting for a few sequels!
This novel perfectly exemplifies the love, hate, fear, and hope we have or should have in this world. Best read of 2014.
Good book! I thought it had an interesting storyline. I'm not totally into historical fiction, but I enjoyed reading it.
Exceptionally well-constructed novel. Great interwoven stories, great historical detail, and just a lovely read overall.
Excellent, well written, absorbing, educational, thought provoking. It deserves all the accolades it has been receiving.
This story is very gripping and poignant. The beauty of the characters against the backdrop of the war is unforgettable.
Some books you can "see". This is one so full of story and images that it fills your mind and heart. I loved it.
I did not like this book.  It was very difficult to keep track of the characters with the time jumps and the flashbacks.
One of the best books I've read this year. The characters are amazing. The writing is excellent. The story is wonderful. I'm going to pitch it to our book club at the next meeting.
This book just drew me in. You become part of the story and the characters. There is much to contemplate from this tale.
A fabulous novel beautifully written.  Interesting characters, lovely language and a gripping tale.  Highly recommended!
Beautifully written story about two children during World War II, a German boy who is an orphan and a blind French girl.
What a lovely book!  A new take on a terrible war.  Written from the view of a young blind girl.  Besutifully written!!!
One of my favorite books of all time.  Fascinating characters and historical perspective on WWII for Germans and French.
Very well written book. Recommend it highly. Great character development. Excellent story line keeps you very interested
Story is so well written and characters perfectly developed.. would recommend it to anyone. Will probably read it again.
A very moving book. So descriptive and great character studies. Would recommend this book to readers of all ages. Enjoy.
this truly is a great book and once you start it you cannot stop reading it to see the outcome of this brave young girl.
A genius German orphan, a mysterious powerful gem, a French blind girl, WWII Framce.  Made me want to read Jules Verne.
Very creative in approach to telling the story.  A little too long getting to the climax of the story - but I loved it!
This is an engrossing narrative written in simply beautiful prose. Read it for the inspired imagery.  It swept me away.
Well developed characters. Excellent juxtaposition of characters with shared but different exposure to same main event.
I didn't give the book a five because I found it hard to follow.  It jumped around quite a bit.  However, I enjoyed it.
The world is still killing in order to gain power and  sadly in the<br/>Process abuse  innocent others they encounter.
I loved this book, but didn't love the ending. The characters were so beautifully crafted. I would highly recommend it!
I just began to read the book. It is like a new book, arrived quickly and has more than met my expectations. Thank you.
Wonderful story, great characters. Period piece that depicts WWII as people lived or died as I've never read it before.
I really enjoyed this book. Beautifully written, I felt like I was right there with the characters. I highly recommend.
Any one who likes to read about history.  Why do you want more words.  I do not need more words to express my thoughts!
3 stories intertwined in the background of WW 2. You feel the war from a young person's perspective. Thought provoking.
Some of the writing is truly beautiful.  Many interesting characters, but I'd have liked to know learn more about them.
This is a great historical novel from a new perspective. Although quite long, I really enjoyed reading this great book!
I really loved this book.  It was nostalgic, thoughtful, hopeful and beautifully written.  I would recommend to anyone.

Very well written, researched book. Appreciated the constrasts presented. There is a great deal of light in this story.
The author weaves this historical fiction tale brilliantly. I would recommend it to a friend in a heartbeat. Well done!
A truly different and most remarkable story. Fabulously detail oriented writing. Scholarly and suspenseful. Great read!
One of my favorite books of all time.  Loved all the references to light and the unbelievably incredible writing style.
Interesting, great story but slow in the beginning and too fast toward the end. Well written but seemingly not finished
Great book.  Engrossing story, great writing.  Maybe more of a dark winter night book than a beach book.  Recommend it.
Very well written, great character development. I really enjoyed this book I plan on sharing it with family and friends
I am sad it is over and feel empty because I can't meet them. Wonderful story and memorable characters. A special book!
Two separate stories which took a long time to get together.  Hoping for a happier ending.  Good historical literature.
This was a thoroughly enjoyable story about 2 young people on different sides during WW II. I enjoy historical fiction.
Exceptional read from a gifted writer. A Sensitive insight to human nature as it is manipulated by our life experiences
Couldn't put it down from start to finish.  Well written.  Beautiful story.  Language was amazing.  A must read for all
Enjoyed all of this book. Excellent story teller. Just enough real history to make it great to where you feel the pain.
This book leaves us with the impression that all the people affected by war are scarred, victims and perpetrator alike.
Not your routine WWII novel, focus is on the youth of each side, and how fast they had to grow up. Beautifully written.
One of the best books ever -- I am still thinking about it -- it lingers on forever in your heart. REally WELL WRITTEN!
Enjoyed this book immensely. It has a great story line that keeps you engaged from the very beginning to the last word.
Reminded me somewhat of "Book Thief".  A personal look into lives at that time.  Hard to get it out of my head.
Love the way it is written and the intertwining of characters.  The insight into German citizens under the Nazi regime.
What a beautifully written story; What descriptive powers !!!!.....  A read you will remember.......<br/><br/>Ed Loeb
Beautifully written, enthralling book that carries you away and will not leave you for a long time. Bravo Anthony Doerr
Very good,  painful but easy to believe; good characters, terrible decisions, great sadness.  Would recommend to others
A must read. This story brings something different and beautiful to the many WW II novels already written. A must read.
Beautifully written. Spoiler alert: things don't always turn out the way you wish. That's unusual for a Book like this.
This is an excellent book. Very well written.  Have chosen this book for April Book Club.  Should be lively discussion.
This book was well written- great story, and he really developed his charactures. Wish they would make it into a Movie!
Good read. Characters are well defined. It is easy to follow the people in the story as they move through the chapters.
Enjoyed all the twists and turns, never being able to guess what was coming next.  I especially appreciated the ending.
It has been a long time since a book kept my interest so fully.<br/>Excellentlynwritten, great story.<br/>I loved it!
Took a little while to get use to how the chapters were put together.  Highly enjoyed the story line.  Be sure to read.
Wonderful book. Very well written. Couldn't put it down<br/>Loved the way it was presented. Each chapter its own great
I loved travelling with them across Europe and through all of their dreams and adventures- I wonder if there are others
I will recommend it to all! A compelling read.<br/><br/>My heart is with all the characters and those they represent.
I bought this for my granddaughter and she was excited to get it.  She has not read it yet so no book report on it yet.
I liked that I had visited many of the sites in these books, and it really brought home how much devastation there was.
love this book. It is well written, suspenseful, cant put it down, and informative. One of the best I have read in 2014
Short chapters make his book fly. Excellent writing and a terrific story all around. The characters truly came to life.
This was a wonderful story. It had warmth, love, fear and excitement all taking place during an insane time in history.
The story is more like a documentary of a period of history. The characters were well drawn but then, for me, abandoned
Well defined characters with lots of internal dialog.  WW II for a backdrop in France gives some heaviness to the plot.
Good story , strong characterization and excellent description ...in fact would sometimes rate it higher than 4 stars .
One of the best historical novels I have read in years. Lyrical prose, making characters and places truly come to life.
Exceptionally well written.  Characters you can care about.  Historically interesting time, place.  Recommend it highly
Engrossing tale about 2 young teenagers from very different backgrounds and how they eventually meet up with each other
I liked it very much.  It was a real page turner from beginning  to end.  Great character development and descriptions.
One feels every step of the lives of these characters as the war evolves. The truly horrendous toll it took on so many.
One of the best books I have read in a long time, how evil can grow in a society and the bravery of those who fight it.
I loved this book!  Anthony Doerr is a great author and a great storyteller!!  It put me in a very pensive mood!  David
One of the best books I have read in a LONG LONG time.  Still "miss it" and will read it again in a few months.
It's really a great read.  The details are within every sentence.  You see the cities, you feel the suffering of WWII.
This is a beautiful book with fantastic word play. I did not enjoy the words that was wrongly translated on my kindle!
Great book! I've referred it to my mom and her friend and they couldn't put it down either. Definetily worth the read.
I don't want to get to the end of this book because I'm pretty sure it doesn't end well so I'm reading it very slowly.
Enjoyed it so much!  Quick read and thourly engaged me.  A great beach or vacation read.  You too will enjoy the book.
Thoughtful consideration is given the plight of the deceived manipulated Germans as well as the atrocities of Hitler..
It was hard to put down as all the emotions of so many live through such a difficult time. Highly recommend this book.
The author got my interest early and kept it throughout the book. Love historical fiction and will recommend this one!
wonderful , thoughtful writer who develops characters we would like to believe in! I'll be looking at his other books.
Not the end I was expecting but a very engaging story nonetheless. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!
One of the best WWII novels I've ever read. Many layered with so many facets dovetailing.  Highly recommend this book.
Flawless. Compelling. Rich in historical detail without being pedantic. Can see why people are lining up to read it.
Best book I have read in years! Loved it! Loved the story and style of writing. Would recommend this book to everyone!
Well written and wordy. This was a very interesting book with a different view of world war 2 than I have read before.
This is another tale of people making it through WWII.  The wrapping up of details at the end was a satisfying closure
Most of the violence is implied.  It is WWII; we know what is going on.  There is a rape scene, but it is not graphic.
Really, really well-written, utilizing a marvelous vocabulary.  Moving and well done, showing both sides of conflicts.
Intriguing.  Kept my interest.  Was dissapointed that there was no mention of the 6 million Jews murdered in this war.
Great book I recommend it.  Well written fascinating story although mans inhumanity to man is always disturbing to me.
Captures the true impact of war on ordinary and extraordinary people. The story is sad and uplifting at the same time.
Great story and writing. I learned a lot about WWII while gaining insights into the lives of people who were impacted.
Engaging - touching story - enjoyed it very much - highly recommend - unique pacing of the story that keeps it flowing
Captivating, intertwined story of people made interesting by the perspective writer's talent.  Job well done Mr Doerr.
I was a bit disappointed at the end of the book. I'm not sure if that is because the Author might be planing a sequel?
Excellent read! The author created a unique perspective to a story which takes place during WWll. Wonderfully written!
Powerful novel that crosses the spectrum of time and invisible light.  We have so much to learn and pass on to others.
The story of the blind girl makes this WWII story very personal. A bit slow at first, but a beautiful, engaging story.
This book flows along &  keeps you interested & entertained  from start to finish. Loved it!  History brought to life.
DESPITE GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM PEOPLE TO YEARS THE BOOK WAS GRIPPING FROM START TO FINISH. SERIOUS AND FASCINATING.
I loved this book and lived right along with the characters. Certainly was not a happy read but what war situation is.
A well-written and thought-provoking book, the story of two young people, strangers, whose paths cross during wartime.
Great story; however, it takes forever to get it out.  Very long book, unnecessarily so.  Glad to have read it though.
A very compelling story of people in France and Germany during WWII, philosophically profound and beautifully written.
Loved the book! Laughed and cried and although it is not a suspense the book kept me wondering what would happen next.
Beautifully written, intricate compelling story and multidimensional characters you truly come to know and care about.
The character development was excellent and the plot line above average. It was a story line which was quite gripping.
A wonderful story about life, war, and appreciating the nuggets of our lives. We can be so cruel and yet also, so good
Wonderfully told story and so well written and not at all predictable like so many books. Doerr is just a great writer
Love the beauty and power found in thus book! Life-changing. I suggest all read this and be enlightened and empowered.
A unique perspective of WWII. Magnificently written. The blind open our eyes to life before, during and after the war.
Beautifully written.  The Internet has wonderful pictures of Saint-Malo that let you know where Marie lives and walks.
A charming, well written glimpse into people's lives and the mess war creates. I like the way Doerr sets up the story.
When I finished the book I felt like I would be missing a very good friend. It was a sad book but one worth living in.
Great story, a little confusing trying to keep all the characters straight at first, but it resolved itself in the end
Fascinating look at how children/young adults tried to survive WWII.  It also champions the ripple effect of kindness.
Easily one of the best books, if not the best, books i have ever read.  This book will touch your heart and your soul.
His descriptive style is amazing. One of the best books I have ever read. He keeps you saying " just one more chapter"
Much to consider here - to think about! The writing is exquisite!  Something to treasure.  To be read again and again.
Just a fantastic read!  It's the kind of book you just can't put down.  Historical in nature with a touch of suspense.
I wish I would have read this to my daughter and used it as a discussion topic. It's on my list to do that. Excellent.
One of the best books I've ever read.  Through the lives of these 2 young people, the horrors of war are clearly seen.
A great book with vivid imagery and startling impact!  I enjoyed the adventure and was moved by the sadness of it all.
Very touching story, an intimate look at how the French felt while under German occupation.  I was sorry to finish it.
A powerful story of compassion, love and caring written in the context of horror, destruction and the genocide of WWII
So well written.  Hard to describe the courage of souls who found themselves in places you can't imagine but survived.
It was well written, poetic for war time novel.<br/>Follows three innocent characters as they grow up during the war.
One of the best novels I have read in a long time.  all  who had read it in our book club agreed.  Hated to finish it.
Terrible ending!! Disappointing!!  The story was suspenseful and interesting to follow but the terrible ending ruin it
While this took me a little bit to get into....at some point it just swept me away. A rich and powerful story of WWII.
every chapter is a painting. the ending could have been cut about 2/3 chapters. a bit too long...but a wonderful read.
His writing is beautiful, the story was a little hard to read for me, but very interesting and I couldn't put it down.
I found myself caught up in this story with the first page.  Such a wonderful story.  Gripping and haunting. Loved it!
Interesting story of two young lives growing up in Germany. Very insightful to the choices each made in their journey.
takes great effort to build a novel that weaves it self successfully to an exciting conclusion. But this book does it.
Good moving story!  At times, there was too much going on and too many names, to follow.  It was an interesting story.
Didn't want it to end. Beautifully written novel that painted a clear image of the scenes and characters. A must read.
I so enjoyed this book. A sad and beautiful story infused with humanity-makes you want to live! I highly recommend it.
The best novel I've read in two years. These characters, this beautifully written story will stay with me a long time.
The book was good, but not great.  I didn't like the skipping around in time.  I thought that made it hard to follow.
Very disappointing!  Had such good reviews. It was a great storyline / the writer could of done so much more with it.
This books pulls you in and shows all the facets of humanity with such a simple but riveting story. So we'll written!
Amazing book I could not put it down. It's historical but that is really just the backdrop to the two main characters
Excellent writer! The book is consistently engaging in an elegantly presented format with memorably cinematic scenes.
I loved all the characters, there was happiness and sadness a very great book.  I have recommended it to many people.
Very good read!  Characters are interesting and well developed.  Plot keeps the reader wai ting  for the  next twist.
I don't think it lives up to its hype. Much more on the dark aspects of war and little on the personalities involved.
Wonderful! An inspiring story and insight into the effects of war, esp for those of us who did not live through WWII.
So many layers of terrific writing.........on so many different topics besides the main storyline........great read..
You need to read this all within a short time because if you put it down, you may get lost trying to pick it up again
A story worth understanding. Heart wrenching and lovely - the characters stay with me long after I put the book down.
Good, but long......thought it could have been shortened.  Also, was disappointed in the ending....hence the 4 stars.
However, I kept waiting and expecting something more and it never came. I would still recommend. It was a quick read.
what's all the hoopla about this book. it felt like it was going somewhere but took forever to get there. predictable
I bought this book as a gift for a family member because I thought it was one of the best books I've read in a while.
Well written story about a young French girl under Nazi occupation, and a young German boy conscripted into the army.
So many "lights"  go off when reading this book..this is a book you will read twice. Every character becomes a story.
Great read! I didn't want to put the book down. Definitely would recommend it to anyone looking for a rainy day read!
Predictable, yet I enjoyed the characters.  Especially, enjoyed the old uncle.  Like the view points of the children.
It was a great book filled with interesting twists and turns. All through the book the title kept resonating with me!
Very good Book Club read. We all had different thought a out the book. I thought it took awhile to get into the book.
Excellent reading. A well-crafted story I enjoyed.<br/>The interweaving of the different characters was suspenseful.
Incredible tale. Incredible writing. Takes you to another world and then brings you back. Highly recommended. . . . .
I found it depressing but a really intriguing and interesting way to describe WWII from the eyes of two young people.
perfect book for book club!  We discussed the book almost the entire night, everyone (14 ladies, age 40-50) loved it.
The author manages to describe the scenes with remarkable detail. Interesting story told with brilliant descriptions.
This novel is beautifully written, and the characters are so intriguing that you will not want to put this book down.
I really enjoyed the story and found the history interesting. I thought the ending could have been better. Good read.
This is a wonderful, keeps-you-glued-to-it story.  I'm still left puzzled by the ending. . .  There's got to be more.
What a beautiful novel.  The characters and events are as beautifully spiraled together as the shell of a sea snail!  🐚
Very interesting story for me, having lived thru The War.  At times it moved a little slow, but I did enjoy the read.
One of the best books that I have read! Wonderful imagery, historical detail and characters. It was hard to put down.
Best book I've read in the last 12 months.  Beautifully crafted, well developed characters and very interesting plot.

Each word, every image has a sense of purpose, like the elements of delicate, intricate machine.  This book is a joy.

An incredibly intimate book about love, and loss, and the brutality of war. Masterfully written. This is a must read!
A must read.  Full of history, emotion, love of all timbres, humanness at it's worst, but oh so much of at it's best!
This was a great book. Very well written. The characters were interesting and the story moved along well. I loved it!
A little too much sex- yeah they're doing it again, yawn--but the people & plot are engaging, wanted to keep reading.
good but long and drawn out. well written and intense. impractical and dramatic. I recommend this to anyone with time
Beautifully and smartly written. Character development exceptional. Touching story that held my attention throughout.
Liked it; recommended it to friends.  Interesting to follow the lives of the young people and see them come together.
Wonderful , glad I read this. Simply beautiful writing. Just a little too long and dragged a bit about 2/3's through.
A must read, wonderful story.  So moving.  It will touch your soul and stay with you long after you are done reading.
A moving story, but a bit lengthy. I would have enjoyed the novel even more if it had been edited a bit more tightly.
A really spectacular book, beautifully written, always interesting, wonderful details, engaging characters….Loved it.
This book was beautiful and historical. Like an Atonement for young adults. It was amazing and I would read it again.
I  did not like the ending but the rest of but the rest of the book was excellent.  Made me want to travel to France,
Very good account of the war and interesting storyline bringing together two people from opposite sides of the fence.
I loved this story--it is rich in history; it can be stark, but it is filled with the warmth of loving relationships.
Incredibly beautiful.  Characters and scenes are still in my head.  Very moving and from the heart.  Loved this book!
_All the Light We Cannot See_ is a story of grace in a time of hatred, of mercy in a time of slaughter, of souls longing for, searching, and finding others as though pulled by some force, broadcasting selves with the hope that transceivers are waiting to receive them, to welcome them home and to comfort the receiver. Doerr's mastery of language is illuminating, educational, fascinating and captivating. I felt joy, sadness, anxiety, and resolve. I recommend this book to all lovers of language, lovers of love, lovers of history and science, and lovers of the human experience. I will read this book again. And again. And again.
Wonderful story... found it very interesting. Really enjoy reading novels that include war and survival experiences.
This book was the best book I've read in a long long time. It may be the best book I've ever read. Highly recommend.
Loved it. Immersed myself in the characters. My only small issue was the back-and-forth between characters and time.
Does a good job of bringing fiction and real world together.  I was disappointed with the end but still a good book.
Great book about a very difficult time in the history of the world.  My book club spent a lot of time discussing it,
Lovely prose, well drawn characters, and proof that there is very little pure evil in a person. Sorry to see it end.
Great story. Well written. Page turner. Interested in that era. Recommend it to people that like that kind of thing.
It was a beautifully written book about everyday people trying to survive during World War II in France and Germany.

Very unique characters and a good read about the impact of WWII without having to read through lots of war violence.
I loved how it followed the Parisian girl and the german boy at the same time.  It was a beautiful and tragic story.
Beautifully written. The author takes you places that you will never see and never forget.  Best read of the summer.

I couldn't put it down. The author makes you truly feel for these characters. I would recommend this book to anyone.
Wonderful descriptive details and people that I truly cared about. Once I got started, I couldn't put the book down.
Could not put it down for three day . Short stories from.before and after the war from lots of people's perspectives
Would love to see this made into a TV ministries series!  Don't think a movie would be long enough to do it justice.
Very well written.  Should be read by all generations who might want to know WW II era history and what it was like.

A great interweaving of the perspectives and stories of two families and two sides of an ugly time.  Very intricate.

t<br/><br/>This was a  Could  not put down book, a rare story taking place during the war.  I highly recommend it.
Leaves you with a sense of awe. Reading this novel is an engrossing experience that you will find in few other books
Beautifully written. The events of WWII are rarely written from the viewpoint of children as they are in this novel.
I listened to an audio version from the library and had to get it in print to keep.  Fantastic story told perfectly.
This novel, with an unusual and interesting subject is also exceptionally well written with fine control of language
This was a great book.  We read it in our book group and there are so many issues that make for a lively discussion.
Loved the setting in Bretton and the history during the second war. Would love to travel there and see it for myself

Absolutely perfect, a wonderful story, well conceived characters excellent plot, wished it hadn't ended when it did!
Excellent book about Nazi's in France.  The story skips between 2 characters and times and sometimes hard to follow.

I really enjoyed this book. It is bitter sweat and tells the story of being in war invade France during world war 2.

I wasn't sure I would like it. I generally don't like books set in WWII; it's so overdone. But this book was lovely.
Vivid characters. A wonderful sense of time and place. I very much like the author's spare and poetic writing style.
This is a beautifully written novel.  I could hardly put it down and woke up and read it in the middle of the night.

Deserving of the Pulitzer Price. Best book of the year. Probably will become a terrific movie. Beautifully written.
Beautiful use of language and a very exciting end but reminded me of the Titanic film. Best feature is the imagery.
Slow start but necessary to set up the story.  Really fell in love with Werner.  Ended up enjoying it tremendously!
I read this book in twelve hours. I wish I had not read this book so that I could read it again for the first time.
It was an enjoyable read though it became predictable towards then end.  Also I did not enjoy the ending that much.
Very slow beginning but it picked up somewhere around a third of the way through; this book is beautifully written.
Great historical novel regarding the Second World War in France and Germany. Very descriptive. Highly recommend!!!!
Very difficult to follow each chapter. Jumped too much from person to person and year to year. Would not recommend.

Beautifully written.. gives an unusual look at WWII. Would recommend it to anyone interested in  historical novels.
liked it but do not love . In fact  I would not even have bought it if I knew the tract of the story.Disappointing.
This book is certainly in the category of literary fiction, but more engaging than many.  Very well done, Mr. Doer.
This was a fascinating story about WWII, very well told. I thoroughly enjoyed. I do wIsh there were others like it.
So interesting I couldn't put it down. Great development of story and characters and then time in which they lived.
War stories are oftentimes too difficult to read.  This one brings beauty to an otherwise ugly time in our history.
Very well written and very interesting without being too graphic about the atrocities of WWII.  Good story telling.
Good book WWII it was good it was a different kind of book about the war you should read this book very interesting

Riverting, touching, excellent story, skilled writing. Re-read several passages because they were so well written.
Loved this book!! Excellent read with very complex characters. Would recommend to everybody who loves WWII novels.
Fascinating story and creative order in which the story was told. I could hardly wait to get time to keep reading.
At a loss of words for this beautifully interwoven story; I feel like I've learned more about life, deeply moving.
The time taken for character development in the beginning created characters and a plot that became a page-turner!
A good, but sad book.  Much I site into WWII  and what hard and difficult times people went through.  A fast read.
One of the best books I have ever read, recently awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  Great Historical fiction
Interesting book. Less about WWII than expected and much more about the two characters. Interesting writing style.

Beautifully written, Incredible characters, and some unforgettable WWII history . My very favorite book this year.
A very engaging story. I am eager to read more books written by Anthony Doerr. He brings vivid imagery to history.
The best book I've read in months. The story never stopped going with big and small ideas to think about. Read It.
An excellent journey into France of WWII. Chronological jumps were sometimes hard to follow, but worth the effort.
On my list of the very best books ever read.  Great story!  Beautifully written.  Will buy as gift for my friends.
Engaging book...where characters were brought to life in a way that made u feel as you  we're living their journey

I absolutely loved this book.  It was well written and told a very good story!  I was hooked from the very start!
Read this for Book Club. Excellent book that held my interest the entire way through! Highly recommend this book.
A different concept in presentation.  Very interesting.  Not a page-turner but keeps you wanting to stay with it.
Very nicely written book giving a picture of a slice of history of both WW2 and Early France in the 20th century.
Beautifully written novel about the tragedy of war and two different souls who endured the war on opposite sides.
Anthony Doerr captures World War II from three unique perspectives that ultimately intertwine in unexpected ways.
Proceed if you're inclined. Just don't expect too much.  I found I was glad to be done once I reached that point.
I greatly enjoyed this book. Very well written with an insight into the war years from a very different prospect.
Enchanting story set in superb places; even though full of the horrors of war.  Human beings can be so steadfast.
One of my favorite books I've ever read! The author's use of imagery is incredible! I highly recommend this book!
Book was great, slow at first but picked up nicely. Only reason for 4 stars is that one of the discs did not play
A beautiful story during an extraordinary era. There is a reason why they were the Great Generation. A must read!
Many underlying themes to elude to the light we cannot see.  Has a Dicksonian ending with everyone tied together.
I loved the book, like reading poetry or listening to music. The author deserves all the awards bestowed upon him
This elegant and poetic novel illuminates the fabric of life that veils eternity in all the light we cannot see .
This book is both uplifting and depressing. Much is left to the imagination.. Well written. I will read it again.
This was a beautifully written tale of 2 children from very different points of view during WWII.  Don't miss it.
There was some pretty writing and the stories were woven together nicely but I didn't see it as Pullitzer worthy.
Was a very interesting perspective on WWII.  The characters were depicted in great depth and with great sympathy.
I liked how the author developed the story. Viewing both sides of the war.  Would have liked a happier ending :-)
A very well written and suspenseful work. Great character development that drew one into caring for these people.
Memorable characters, beautiful landscapes, a little hard to follow with the back and forth times. A Great Read!!
Such a good book. The writing had me hooked and when I wasn't reading it I was thinking about it. Just beautiful.
Totally captivated by the characters, the historical perspective, and the broader themes addressed by the author!

This book carries you away even though the destination  is often uncomfortable. Beautifully developed characters.
Beautifully written and engaging story!  The characters were well developed.  I would highly recommend this book!
Starts off great, the middle is good, but the ending is poor. Difficult time finishing it, as the end was boring.
Story of two young people caught up in WWII. Their stories are unlike anything I have ever read. Many loose ends.
Very well written novel.  It is a novel which is hard to put down and keeps your interest.<br/>A very good read.
Although the end was not what I wanted or envisioned, the story was riveting and kept me up far to late at night.
I really loved this book..  It is a good historical novel as well as a good characterization of all in the story.
World War II, a blind French girl, and an orphaned German boy.  Two wonderful stories beautifully woven together.
All the Light We Cannot See kept my attention throughout. One of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading.
A tapestry of lives, thoughts, hopes and dreams caught up in a time that made it impossible to attain. Excellent.
Excellent book
Very sad book.
It's a different take on WWII.  Gripping story of two people that leaves you wondering how they will intertwine.

Couldn't put this book down. Beautifully written. One of the best books I've read in quite some time. Well done.

I adored this book. It's been along time since I've read something that I didn't want to end. Beautifully written.

Very engaging book. You can't wait to pick it up and find out what happens to characters. Plenty to think about.
Loved the development of the characters , the story line , really loved everything about this book . Well done !
I'm clearly in the minority, but I just couldn't get absorbed in this story.  The pace seemed quite slow for me.
I felt that the story could have been a real story, and while I enjoyed it it was rather depressing to read.  MJ
I liked it because I have been to St. Malo.  It was a little slow but very informative about France during WWII.
Beautifully written. I thought this was a compelling story, perhaps longer than necessary, but a wonderful book.
This book is amazing...I could not put it down. So beautifully written and such an engaging story. Must read!!!!

A moving story, very descriptive and well written.  A little long-winded, but it finally got there.  It was OK
This book was a waste of time.  I kept waiting for something good to happen, for closure.  I was disappointed.
In the top ten best books I've ever read! A work of art, really! This thing is making me write six more words.

Beautifully written.  Somewhat disconcerting trying to follow the "time line", jumps around all over.
An amazing story of the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of two children on both sides of the conflict
A powerful story told brilliantly, a story about war, but still somewhat removed from it. Simply outstanding.

Book was very well written,at times it seemed a little lengthy.I enjoyed it but it took me awhile to finish.
This book is so beautifully written, I felt I wanted to be able to ingest it physically. Thank you, Anthony.
I wanted the story to continue. There was the concept of time and generations and that time can heal wounds.
I have read all of Anthony Doerr's books - like them all very much, and am sorry there are no more to order!
I would have given it 5 stars but the ending, to me, lacked the substance and drama of all that preceded it.
This is a compelling novel that is very hard to put down. The story kept me fascinated from beginning to end
All the light we can not see was a well written book. The characters were one you found yourself caring for.
This book was a delight to read. The writing is lyrical. The story is gripping. Really, just give it a read.

Beautifully written story about World War Two and the lives of two children in different experiences . . . .
This is a truly wonderful novel.  The use of language is sublime and the character development is excellent.
An outstanding novel!  The author's choice to tell the story through parallel lives was extremely well done!
Too many parallel plots going with a lot of description not needed.  Found it tedious rather than enjoyable.
Couldn't put this book down. Amazing story of survival and life lessons, family strength and inner strength.
Beautifully written!!!!  Enjoyed the development of the characters.  The ended dragged, but would recommend.

A beautifully written book. Have followed up with The Nightingale, which takes place in the same time frame.
A true study of young lives in their own accelerated development as a result of catastrophe. Very well done.

Great story of WWII through the eyes of the young. Doerr does a fantastic job with the details in this book.
Excellent story somewhat hindered by the use of two many foreign words we are not accustomed to pronouncing.
A really good read.  Enjoyed it from beginning to end.  A little confused at the beginning then I caught up.
Most everyone in my book club agreed that this was a beautifully written book with a very interesting story.
Powerful story about the triumph of the human spirit in the face of life threatening conditions during WWII.

All the Light...is a fascinating novel, realistic yet peotically written and a good history lesson as well.
Amazing story! Great writer. Takes some time to get into the story but worth all the character development.
An interesting treatise on war and life and how we are victims of fate or, are we? What choices do we make?
Such a truly wonderful book.  Beautifully written and amazing insights into such a dreadful period in time.
This is a book that should be required reading in high school!  Well written and leads to many discussions.

Excellent read, beautifully written.  A great depiction of life during the war years in France and Germany.
Very interesting & certainly held my attention . At times, hard to put down!! A little too wordy at times .
A good story just a little drawn out. But others in my book club enjoyed it more than me so what do I know?
Loved the characters and the writing was good.  I wasn't pleased with the outcome but it does reflect life.
I really like the idea of two very separate main characters and the setting, which is the Second World War.
A beautiful story, excellently told . . . both tragic and uplifting much like the times in which it is set.
Wonderful characters, interesting historically, and great story.<br/>Hard to put down. I loved this novel!
Interesting story but sometimes hard to follow. I would recommend this book. Heart wrenching in some areas.
Fabulous imagery. A cerebral exercise in how the mind both works to adapt and compensate.  Beautiful story.
Great insight into the torments and emotions of WW II .  Author presents a view of victims from both sides.
The book did always tell the story I wanted, but it told a true tale of people caught up in a horrible war.
Excellent characters focused on a different angle of the war than most WWII books - I enjoyed it very much.
wonderfully written; heart-wrenching and soulful; poignant; a reminder of the costs and travails of all war
One of the most magnificent books I've ever read. I absolutely loved it. Doerr is a truly brilliant writer.
It was and ok book I thought, I found it hard to keep up with the story at times because it jumped so much.
I loved the beauty and hated the violence, but in the end I was glad I finished it. His writing is lyrical.
All the Light We Cannot See was a favorite new read for me. Loved the historical references and characters.
My book club read it.<br/>It was a good book but I think it was a little too long.<br/>Did not finish it.
This novel holds the reader from Strat to finish. You can see clearly through blind eyes the horror of war.
A great story of the courage people can muster in a bad situation.  It is well planned and pulled together.
Often very painful but a good insight to ordinary people's experiences caused by war.  Well worth the read.
A different perspective on the war. The writing was so descriptive I felt like I was there. Worth your time
Well it has beautiful use of the English language. Sad and hopeful. Word word word word word word word word
By far my favorite book of 2014.  Loved this book so much.  Original, well-written, emotionally satisfying.
A richly told story of children, family, friends and war. I felt I was a part of the story. Very good read.
The story is engrossing but the prose is what I enjoyed most about this book. It is literature at its best.
An amazing story that entranced my imagination, one of the few books that I would be willing to read again.
Loved this book...  Took a little bit, due to style, to hit stride, but once you do, oh boy, you're hooked.
Well  written  easy  read  but  keeps  your  interest  A  very  sweet  story  that  will  keep you  reading
This book is a marvelous read - imaginative, evocative and ultimately heartbreaking. I highly recommend it.
There is a reason this book has been so long on top of the best seller list. Read it and see.<br/>Or know.
This is a well written novel. The author has an amazing talent of describing details, in a very unique way!
This book was hard to put down. The two main characters were both so interesting and alike in so many ways.
This is a great book, I loved the characters and how in the end, the author wrapped up each of their lives.

This is a beautifully written novel involving two characters whose lives touch on so many levels. Loved it!
This is a great book. I usually don't like war era stories but this was an exception.I recommend it highly.
One of the best novels I've read in years. Anthony Doerr is a phenomenal talent. And this book is his best.
I thought it was a very good book during a time when a country was truly introduced to dispectible horror.
What a well written, amazing story. This book is a great read and keeps you interested past the last page.
Great story and quite interesting, sometimes the flashbacks took sometime to realize what year you were in
I really enjoyed reading this book because it allowed me to put myself in an era I was not familiar with..
This was a great story with excellent visualization.  The character's stories were nicely weaved together.
I felt it a difficult book to get into the first few chapters.  Then it suddenly became a compelling read!
Absolutely loved this book. I felt the underlying theme was that there is a light of goodness in everyone.
Very nice story and well written. But I was disappointed by the ending. Some things were never cleared up.
I don't care for books that jump around in time. They are hard to follow. The story itself was quite good.
A very moving and memorable read.  Powerful, beautiful writing, unique characters, an unforgettable novel.
Fantastic book showing you two sides as well as the complexity within each side during the second word war
This novel is pure poetry from the beginning to the end. One of the most memorable books I have ever read.
An excellent read! A time of war without the bloody battle on the pages, and a story of lives that matter.
Great story. Well written but a little over wordy. Time frame jumping each chapter a little disconcerting.
I am not a fan of this style of writing. IT LEFT ME CONFUSEd and looking for a meaning. It was disjointed.
Loved the story.  Interesting how the stories of the two main characters weaved together to come together.
Don't miss this book!  Beautiful writing, beautiful characters.  Vivid descriptions during a complex time.
very unusual story for a WWII story-beautifully written, characters multidimensional, place well described
Beautiful writing. A joy to read. Engaging story. I couldn't put it down. A love story and tragedy of war.
A really excellent book.  I know why the author has been the recipient of so many awards -  well deserved.
A great read, a bit tedious in some parts about the war, but I would highly recommend others reading this.
Another excellent war book but one that concentrates on characters and their experiences and relationships
The author did a very realistic telling of conditions in Germany and France leading up to and during WWII.
But not worth a Pulitzer prize.  There is something missing in this book but I cannot put my finger on it.
My favorite book of the decade so far. Like the sea flames, beautiful to look at and impossible to let go.
Compelling story, unforgettable characters, exquisite prose; a literary hat trick you'll savor every page!
Not a bad book but very slow but picking up in middle , dumb ending, this type of book is not for me. 3/10
Have read a lot of WWII stories lately so am kinda done with the topic.  Exquisite writing keeps me going.
Parallel stories of a young German boy in nazi army and young blind French girl, of how WWII affects them.
Tis book is beautifully written,the way the author uses words is magical.I really loved reading this book.
Loved this book. t first it seemed a little confusing.  The more I read, the more it was hard to put down.
Hard to put down. Made you feel like you were a part of the lives of the characters. Very endearing story.
it was an excellent book . it kept me interested and i learned new facts about the war . very well written
Good read I think Doerr could of shorten the story.  I would of like more on after the war of their lives.
"Flat" although the subject sounded interesting. Left me feeling nothing for either main character
Loved this book. Very well written, lovely story. I feel like I learned a lot about the human cost of war.
Excellent, to be cliche, this book was a real page turner. I am inspired to read all works by this author.
This is a fantastic read. It is amazing that so many people have stories about the war they remain untold.
I would recommend this as a great book to read nice stories about what life was like before and during ww2
Very touching & thought provoking novel. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has or loves children.
Wonderful story and very beautifully written. The words pull on your imagination as much as the narrative.
Well written and did not want to put down! Will read again as I'm sure there were subtleties I overlooked!
There are a lot of books with similar concepts but the descriptive abilities of the author set this apart.
It was OK. Many friends told me how fabulous this book was so I think I just set my expectations too high.
Loved this book so much I am having my daughter read it over the break. Can't wait to hear what she thinks
I just had to savor each and every word to have it last as long as possible. Like chocolate. Aaaaaaahhhhhh
as beautifully written as anything i've read.  reminicent of  'the book thief'  or  'the goldfinch', even.
Beautifully written and artfully connected stories.  Read it on a sunny day!  A brutally frank WWII story.
An excellent novel that portrays the passion and dterminstion of youth during the challenges of war timed.
A little slow at the beginning but fell in love with the characters and spent many nights up late reading!
Wonderful, heart-wrenching story of two young people struggling to survive during WWII. Thought provoking!
I did not want to put this book down. I have read many war time stories but this book by far was the best.
Well written with several themes which were skillfully tied together - enjoyed this "page turner."
captivating dual story about a blind French girl and a. German orphan boy and how ww2 affected their lives
With the exception of the last chapter, which had no value add, All the Light We Cannot See is great book.
Beautifully written without any unnecessary gut wrenching detail, which gave a regal quality to the story.
Engaging, a real page turner.  Doerr developed the characters extremely well and represented the era well.
Great book!  Shows the innocence of youth during the war and how that was taken away by the wraths of war.
I liked this book very much. The story line was very original and the author's research was very thorough.
A great read!!!  Thrilling, poignant, gives a clear understanding of the rise of the Hitler Young Program.
An insightful look at the horrors of WWII through a number of different perspectives. Engaging characters.
A transcendent novel of WW11 that unsparingly depicts the horrors that impact the innocents on both sides.
Loved it!  Listened to it on disc while traveling - the characters really come to life through the reader.
I have written the review above.  The book is a gift from a very talented and insightful man.  How lucky!
Very interesting book.  Well written, short chapters, a page turner.  Hadn't expected to like it so much.
So beautifully descriptive of the lives & times during WWII - you feel you have lived every moment of it.
5 stars on every level --- plot, character development, prose, dialog, suspense. It was hard to put down.
When  you win the National Book Award, you have written a great book.  This is a great book.  I loved it.
There are many layers to this story. It jumps between characters and time, but everything comes together.
Interesting book that did show a different way of perceiving life thru the eyes of the visually impaired.
I really enjoyed reading this book. I was hoping the end would turn out differently but it was not to be.
A beautiful story! Yes, it jumps around but it feels like watching a movie. I highly recommend this book.
A must read! I loved it and it is now making it a around my entire family. Great writing and great story!
Story is woven together very well. Moves between time periods, but not difficult to follow.  Suspenseful.
Beautifully written; interesting story sequence; I only ended up wishing for more of a payoff at the end.
Well written in an unusual style of short chapters which keeps you involved with the plot and characters.
Excellent book and I highly recommend it. Though it was not as engaging as I expected. Very well written.
Another ww2 as a back drop for this very interesting story. If your not tired of such it's worth reading.
This story weaves a spell so real that it takes one's breath.  I found myself unable to leave this world.
I liked the book for entertainment but I'm not sure it will stick with me. I enjoyed it for a summer read
Very touching stories that show you the humanity of both sides of those who fought and lived through WW2.
I ended up caring truly and deeply for both of the main characters in this novel.  Could not put it down!
I loved this book.  I recommend this book to those who can witness the beauty hand in hand with the pain.
Fantastic from start to finish. !0+ on characters, story line and beautifully written. I loved this book.
Reading it slowly. Reading it again. A story that weaves its way into my heart with every word and image.
Perfect prose. Provocative story about the personal price of war. There are always victims on both sides.
An incredibly beautiful and at the same time horrific novel. A great read.  I couldn't put the book down.
loved this book, and felt very engaged in it......like the short chapters, made it more interesting to me
Good read. Not great but good. Good content. Not a fan of the back and forth chronology style of writing.
Anthony Doerr is a craftsman and able to write about this bit of history in a unique way. Very enjoyable.
very well written  -  though fictional, it exposes the horrors people on all sides experience during war.
Beautifully written. We as humans strive to do what we feel is right, misguided or not, in love, in life.
Wonderful book.  A must read for everyone.  Very interesting to see WW II from eyes of France and Germany
Unusual WWII story told from 2 unusual points of view. Couldn't put it down. Have already recommended it.
Loved the characters , the historic background and the great story that unfolded. Recommended reading!!!!
I enjoyed this book immensely! It was slow to start but then offered an sweet and dark story!  Thank you.
Very good story. Very real. It was a compelling read, that took me four days and kept me up until two am.
This book stunned me with the aching story and beautiful words. I miss it already and I just finished it.
This was the perfect book...I was in a rush for the end, but then when I knew I was close..I had to slow.
A good read, but the chronology was disruptive and still can't figure out why the back and forth in time.
I enjoyed this book very much. Really two stories in one and how they come together. Beautifully written.
Wonderful story...heartbreaking but I felt as if I was living in France during that very troubling time .
Beautifully written, one that should not be missed. It will not disappoint. I regretted when it was over.
The death of one of the protagonists was just WRONG; but over all a very well written and enjoyable book.
Wonderful winding story, one I will not soon forget. I had late nights with a story I could not put down.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book!! The writing is just like poetry sometimes!! I would highly recommend it!
Great read.  Blindness does not have to be in the dark.............feel the light is what it's all about.
I almost did not read this because I don't care for war novels.  But this is so much more!  A great read.
Great historical novel! I suggested it for book group and we all loved it! It made the war very personal.
I did like the book.  Even though it was a novel, I believe all of the events could easily have occurred.
Best Fiction Book of 2014 in my opinion.  Highly recommended!  It was also the favorite of my book club -
A story of courage, love, loss and shear endurance.  Left me a little sad, but worth the time to read it.
The story really comes to life. I  didn't want it to end, I simply wanted the characters to remain happy.
I did not want this book to end. The character development was impressive and language so rich and vivid.
It kept my interest. A very personal story about the horror of war. The terrible and good side of people.
Excellent story about the human trials on both sides of the war and all the havoc and destruction as well
This book was so great I was sad it was over.  The way this is written is captivating.<br/>LOVE!!! LOVE!
Beautiful story, beautifully conceived and written with an ending that ties all ends up with sensitivity.
Beautifully written story. Just enough history to hold my interest. Loved the characters.<br/>Great read
Interesting read, characters well developed & great plot! We read it in our book club & enjoyed the book.
Excellent story with compelling characters. I liked the ending. Provided good closure for all characters!
An excellent read. Unusual. Really well-written. I rarely give a book five stars, but this one qualifies.
Awesome book!
Given the rave reviews for this book, I picked it up with high expectations.  Unfortunately, I found it to be a slow, somewhat burdensome read.  Given all of the hight praise for Doerr's novel, I reluctantly plodded through all 530 pages of the book.  Unlike the other reviewers, I found the book to drag along much too slowly.  Overall, I think the novel would have been much better with about 200 page edited out of the tome.
Beautifully, artfully written.You feel as if you are there.  A real page turner - chapter after chapter!
This book was incredible! Very lovely deceptions I felt like I was there watching the events take place.
This is one of the best historical fiction books I have read n a very long time.  I highly recommend it!
It is a good story but long and it is hard to follow when it jumps between characters, time, and places.
This was a great book. Glad it was not your typical world war two novel. Was a page Turner till the end.
If you like Historical Fiction, you'll love this book. I loved the characters and didn't want it to end.
Beautifully written book--great character development. Good story and a fast read despite the 534 pages.
Outstanding and haunting. An affirmation of the strength of the human spirit and love in its many forms.
Still reading and enjoying it.  Story is slow to develop but hopefully will pick up.  Excellent writing.
Very compelling story; I did find that the juxtaposing of characters and times a bit confusing, however.
This is a beautifully written story that pulls you in slowly and doesn't let you go until the last page.
The book was wonderfully written but did not leave me with a feeling of having been uplifted in any way.
A good story, I suppose, but there is so much literature on how WWII affected people that is non-fiction
Very book but some times a little long.  Could feel the human feelings of lives challenges in this book.
Beautifully written, wonderful believable characters, keeps your interest right up through the last page
Absolutely riveting, and deserved the Pulitzer.  Worth reading a second time.  Pair with The Book Thief.
Brilliant writing! The only book I have wanted to pick up and read again. A book that will stay with me!
Beautifully drawn characters.  Complete page-turner.  Hopeful, heartbreaking and epic.  Loved this book!
A unique war story.  Brings insight into the little people during the war. Well done, unexpected ending.
Very interesting as to how the war affected different kinds of people. Men friends also liked this book.
It is a good story, well written. The beginning was a little slow, but very work spending my time on it!
Enjoyed reading it, learned more about WWII and the occupation of France and wartime footing in Germany.
Really enjoyed it. A little dark and gory but I just kept wanting to move forward. The writing is poetry
I read this while traveling in France. You can still feel the war in the small villages. A special book!
What a great read and so much to learn about WWII!  The plot twists had me furiously  turning the pages!
An excellent WWII Story told from a totally different perspective. Very enjoyable and thought provoking.
I loved it!  I read it was a book for young readers and I am hardly that, but I enjoyed it every minute!
This is a great book-good story & also tells what the people in Paris endured during the Nazi occupation
Very intriguing book which didn't turn out like I had hoped but was tied together very nicely in the end
There was just something about this book. It really took all of it to see that. Glad I took the journey.
I enjoyed the book. The back and forth in time and place kept me thinking. Great characters. A good read
I think this story got over my head at some point.  Never really connected with it or the characters :-(
This is the best book I've read in a long time.  This is a great story and which is beautifully written.
I really enjoyed this book, this is the first time I have read any thing by this author.  It touched me.
What a wonderful read.  Historical fiction that is well written.....it doesn't get any better than that.
Not very climatic. It is more a story/description of two separate lives in WWII but beautifully written.
I loved the book.  Anthony Doerr depicted the blind girl superbly.  It was like you were there with her.
Fast-paced moving account of two young lives, one German, the other French - their strength and heroism.
I haven't finished it, but what a beatiful book this is. I shall write with pleasure when I am finished.
It's interesting to read about the ingenuity of the human soul to prepare loved ones for their survival.
Beautifully written and enjoyed finding out how stories entertwined. I am eager to read his other works.
The language is beautiful. The alternating stories of the French girl and the German boy are compelling.
Loved the way the author told the story - kept me interested and wanting to know what would happen next.
A little bit too long, but interesting enough that I wanted to find out what happened to the characters.
Anthony has a way with words and swept me right into this story. I couldn't put it down.<br/>Fantastic.
Incredibly well written book. As much pleasure in each line as in the story, and the story is wonderful!
This was a beautifully written book, well-paced with a unique perspective on the events of World War II.
I give it 5 stars. Great character development, and fast read. I recommend it for any age, woman or man.
Best book I've. Read in awhile!  Tear jerker at the end, but I'm still trying to get my wife to read it.
Beautifully written.  Wonderful story, well developed characters.  Best book I've read so far this year.
Great read. Characters are well developed. Plot jumps around but compact enough to stay with throughout.
I loved this book.  It was a story I soon became totally invested in and the.ending does not dissapoint
Loved all of it. So touching. So sad. Yet suspenseful and moving. A fox jumps through the garden gate v
Enjoyed story and writing style.  I prefer nonfiction so would rather read a book with less speculation
The best book I've ever read about WWII.  It goes beyond the horror to explain the complexities of war.
I didn't like the way it kept jumping back and forth from chapter to chapter until it was near the end.
I couldn't put it down....so good I bought it in hard copy and Kindle after having it from the liberry.
Beautifully written, almost lyrical.  The story weaves back and forth like a fine tapestry. Great read.
what a well-told suspensciful story. It is a "I couldn't put-it-down tale."<br/>Tom Fitzgerald
Beautifully written descriptive language, brings you right into the daily lives of the main characters.
Good descriptive writing.  Great story line.  I did not want to put the book down until the last page!!
This was a wonderful book. I loved its historical roots and beautiful plot.<br/>I highly recommend it.
This is an amazing story told with such finesse and rich details that I had difficulty putting it down!
one of the best books I have read-Historically accurate-aqnd writing was excellent-couldn't put it down
About half way through I had enough and just moved to the last chapter to finish the book.  Didn't like
WONDERFUL BOOK ! LOVED IT .  THE WRITING WAS SPECTACULAR AND THE NARRATION GREAT.<br/>HIGHLY RECOMMENT
Loved this book. Was a little vague in areas but still held my attention to the end. I would recommend.
A beautifully written book, well worth reading, but like others I found the end a little disappointing.
Love at first page, a must read.  So vivid the novel makes me look towards other world war two stories.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It been a long time since I have read a book that I hated to put down.
This should be an American Classic.  A must read for high school students to teach good writing skills.
Excellent book.. Strong characters, beautiful writing..historical information that was so informative..
This is an intriguing book with a lot of issues to think about.  There is no one answer to the dilemma.
Beautifully wrtten, hideous story that needs to be told and never forgotten, too many time jump tricks.
An incredible literary masterpiece, I have never read a book that painted such a richly detailed image.
Best book I've ever read. The author's writing was so descriptive he placed you there. Hated to finish.
The book is beautifully written, very descriptive. Great character development of the two young people.
Powerful writing and heartfelt story... characters remain with you long after you have finished reading
The powerful story is told in such a poetic manner. this is one I won't delete from my Kindle and iPad.
Suitable for anyone who like s learning, or a good story. Mystery all the way to the end<br/>. Love it
I am still reading this book, but I am enjoying it very much.  I has been recommended for my book club.
I enjoyed is book - just give it a bit of time tiger into it. Liked the switching between perspectives.
This is the first book I have read by this author.  I Loved it!  Enjoyed the characters and the period.
This was a rare book that once I started to read it I bacterium let putting it down. Very well written.
Very good interesting book ....not just another WW11 story.  Totally enjoyable and keeps your interest.
Top 5 books I've ever read........as an avid reader, that is a profound statement!  Simply outstanding.
I loved it!  The characters and actions were enough to keep me reading until late at night.  Wonderful!
A wonderful book, but went on to read another of the author's books (About Grace) and was disappointed.
Smartly written.  Historical accuracy a plus.  Takes you to the heart of those that lived through WWII.
A book that allows you to see the story as you read it.  You actually live the lives of the characters.
Very well written, characters well developed. At first hard to get into but then could not put it down!
Was a emotional time in my life.  I needed these characters to be ok.  I found it a very emotional book
A good read, but a little slow in places. If you like historical novels set in WWII this is a good one.
The first half dragged and then I had to finish. A good historical fiction book. A good book club book.
Teriffic story. The characters became so important to me, couldn't wait to sit down with them each day.
Interesting but I felt the ending was weak. The descriptions of different sites were beautifully drawn.
What a beautiful and sensitively written book. It managed to cover a difficult subject with such grace.
An outstanding book!  Wonderful story, amazing characters and character development, very well written.
Very well written and engaging. Nice easy read at first, but then a race to the end. Lovely ending too.
Very well written, captured my attention from the beginning and then I couldn't put it down.  Loved it!
I have read books before that jumped between characters and went forward and backward in time like this one did.  But I found this one the most difficult to follow.  I was relieved when I finally made it halfway through and picked up a little momentum.  I was determined to finish!  Yet when I did finish and the Acknowledgement came up, I found myself wondering if I'd missed a few chapters, so twice I went back a ways, to be sure I hadn't skipped something.  I felt like the writer got tired of trying to tie up loose ends and just stopped writing.
The story was so realistic, I felt as if I were there. I loved the way the characters lives connected.
I found the story a little disjointed.  It went on and on and then quickly tried to tie up the ending!
Beautiful Prose, Wonderful Characters, Fantastic Plot.  Could Not Put It Down.  Did Not Want It To End
I read it very fast just to get to the end -- now I will go back and savor how it is all put together.
Wonderful book to read. I liked seeing this time in history seen through the eyes of the young people.
Beautifully written, with well developed characters.  It is easy to see why it won the Pulitzer Prize.
Excellent presentation.  Though a bit hurried closing.  Memorable characters.  Will make a great film.
Not sure about it first then it pulls you in, totally. Very well written. I was taken with every page!
The short chapters make this book a great read for the occasional and brief sojourn into another world
Poetic. Thrilling. Poignant. Tragic. Suspenseful. Wonderful. A thoroughly satisfying journey of a book
Beautifully developed characters and a wonderful  telling of the war from very different perspectives.
Haven't loved a book as much as I love this one in a long time. Can't recommend enough. A masterpiece.
Very good read, but there was too much switching between story lines and time lines. It got confusing.
A very compelling story. Well written with beautiful prose. Doer makes the places and time come alive.
Incredible and wonderful book.  Read it in 2 sittings and wanted it to go on and on. Loved reading it.
It's beautiful writing. There were some scenes that needed to be edited, but I am glad that I read it.
Very well written but somewhat confusing with the skipping of events particularly between 1940 & 1945.
I did not like the ending too much not very moving.  The stone never wound up with anyone in the story
With each step that Marie-Laure takes, I could see a world that I have never known. Beautiful writing.
An interesting WW!! story told from two very different perspectives.  A unique, character driven tale.
I enjoyed the story and writing, but the book did tend to lag the first 3/4 for me.  Good read though!
This book is a must read. It is a  nonstop page turner worth every second. I recommend it to everyone.
A beautifully written novel about such a terrifyingly heartbreaking time in history. Highly recommend.
Great story. Didn't really want to read another WWII novel but this was told in an unconventional way.
Best book I have read in a long time and I read a lot of books.  Characters grab you and Don't let go!
It is kind of a shame these well written stories only last a few days because you can't put them down.
articulate depiction of two separate lives; exquisitely written and captivating.  sorry to see it end.
Engaging and beautifully written. I was recommending it to friends before I was even half way through.
Couldn't be better.  Look forward to reading more books by this author. The book is a work of art. One
This is such an incredibly beautiful work of literature that saying more diminishes it.  Just read it.
As with all of his work, I could not put it down. The characters were real and the writing was superb.
I am still reading it . It's a good read . There are children as the main people  in it which I love .
One of the best historical fiction books I've read. Loved it and recommended to all my fellow readers.
Personally I didn't care at for this story...especially how it was written. It was confusing at times.
Awesome book.  Hard to put down.  Unbelievable are the horrors the human soul deals with but survives!
Absolutely the best book I've read in a while! Mr. Doer is a great storyteller.I couldn't put it down.
A real insight into aspects of war, power and greed and its consequences. Also a story of redemption.
It is refreshing to read a book that is both beautifully written and has an incredible story to tell.
A poignant story- sad and tragic, but hope weaved throughout and a nice "wrap up" at the end.
Have heard from friends who have read it and they say it is great!  I haven't read it yet personally!
A peek into the life of those affected by WWII who were not Jewish. Fell in love with the characters.
Beautifully written, unique, well developed characters, masterful use of narrators and jumps in time.
I'm not a huge reader but my brother highly recommended this book to me. I loved it. Hard to put down
Inspiring and thought provoking story.  Well-drawn characters.  Beautiful and evocative descriptions.
A lovely story, well written with endearing characters.  Intriguing setting.  Another WW II story....
The writing is vivid and flows, and the characters come alive in one's mind. I could not put it down.
A long read, but so detailed and touching. It's such a sad story, but I would read it all over again.
Good and interesting read. It's a complex story, so a bit hard to follow at times, but I'd recommend.
Beautifully written novel about WWII characters who struggle, are impacted by the war,  and overcome.
One of the best written books I've ever read.  Clearly deserves its Pulitzer Prize.  Loved this book.
Beautifully written, stunning imagery, and the characters are so compelling, I could not put it down.
Read for a book club. It's a slow start, in my opinion, but worth it to get to the middle and ending.
Heheheur nenes nenes needs  Keen need Jensen nene nene needs nonfiction had dh dh end dh dh en dh end
One of my favorite books of 2015! Beautiful writing and wonderful characters. I don't want it to end.
Another book about the second war. Horrible people, good people, suffering, survival. It's all there.
So visual ... especially from the world of Marie Laure ... makes you believe in the heart of mankind!
Well written, good character development plus a new angle on WWII.  My favorite book in last 2 years.
It was a pleasure to read.  I enjoyed every minute of my time invested in this book.  Excellent work.
Well written, fascinating story of two young people one French the other German during world war two.
This book is a thrilling read and stops at just the right places to keep you on the edge of your seat
The writing is lyrical in this book. Characters are well developed. Its a bit too long but I loved it
I love the combination of history and the characters. The blind girl'sl perspective was enlightening.
A beautifully written account of the lives of two young people on different sides during World War 2.
Great book with short chapters that make it easy to pick up for a few minutes when you have a chance.
Very well written.  I have not finished it and can't wait to see how they mesh the to lives together.
Excellent tale of love and lost amid the horrors of World War II.  I highly recommend this new Novel.
excellent writing...intriguing story...fascinating characters...a different perspective on the war...
This book took me forever to read. It was difficult to get get into and seemed quite scattered to me.
This is an increasingly engrossing book, written poetically, with layers of meaning. Very satisfying.
This is one of those books that the characters stay with you long after you have completed the novel.
An excellent read by an accomplished author. Could be cut by 10% as the story tends to drag in spots.
A warm engaging story of people caught in the web of war and intrigue told as gently as a love story.
All the light we cannot see is a wonderful read. I could see this being made into a marvellous movie.
So vivid, I was rooting for Werner!  This book is so touching on so many levels.  I was sad it ended.
well written story. Informative, I got lost in the story, it was so real.  I recommend it to any one.
Makes the liberation of France an intensely personal story thru the interwoven tales of 5 characters.
Interesting character development against a somber background of the effects of war on ordinary folk.
A beautiful, inspiring story..beautifully written. Once started, you will not be able to put it down.
Great book! Only complaint is that the cover was not properly centered and was folded in wrong place.
One of the most beautifully written books I have read.<br/>Informative and wonderfully entertaining.
Fast read,well written but not a favorite of mine. I found the book a little hard to follow at times.
I loved this story from beginning to end.  A must read for all, we should never forget what happened.
Loved it!  A little slow getting into it, but that's me.  Could not put it down after a few chapters.
Loved the fact that this book came from the point of view of children from each side of the conflict.
Lyrical writing, compelling characters and an unconventional look at war from the young participants.
Chosen for my book club; I couldn't put it down!  I look forward now to reading other books by Doerr.
Beautifully written and wonderfully plotted.  Sentences, images, characters that took my breath away.
Beautifully written.  Wonderful characters. Great insight into a terrible period of European history.
Great Story written beautifully. One of those books you stay up late because you cannot stop reading.
Good read, little disapointed in the ending. Was hoping Werner and Marie Laure would end up together.
I was reluctant to read yet another WWII novel but I loved the characters and the story sucked me in.
This book was overly verbose. The story was interesting until is wasn't, it merely ran out. Multiple sentences were required to explain every mundane person, place, event, or location; the chronological disconnect added to the confusion.
What a masterpiece! Such a fantastic book with an illumined perspective on World War 2.  I loved it!
Well written story about WWII. I liked how it wove stories together from different sides of the war.
The story of a blind girl along with her uncle as they work to defeat the Nazi during world war two.
One of the best books I've ever read.  My only criticism is the occasional non-linear story telling.
One oif the few books you cannot put down the characters are very rich and suspense in their outcome
Written in such a way that one can imagine actually being there!  A great story, imaginatively told.
Wonderfully creative unique view of WWII as understood by a blind French girl and orphan German boy.
Jumps around between times, places and characters, but is a well crafted and engaging story/ stories
This is a fantastic book. The story is highly compelling and the construction is superb. A rare gem.
A must read....more incite into how horrible Hitler was.There were many courageous people back then.
This book was recommended to me by a teacher this summer. It is one of the best works in my library.
Great read. Although fiction, plenty of accurate historical facts that makes it even more enjoyable.
heartwarming and heartbreaking at times. It goes to show what we can do if we really want to survive
Well written. I was surprised how much I liked this book.<br/>Can't wait to read Doerr's next book.
Seriously - wonderful, couldn't put it down.  Did not want to end. Characters stil alive in my mind.
Once you get past the first few chapters this book is so hard to put down!  It is Very well written.
I enjoyed this book a great deal.  It seemed to drag just a bit in the middle but overall great read
Very good read. The story was a little choppy at first but then began to flow. I enjoyed reading it.
You can see why it won the Pulitzer and has been on the NY times best seller list for so many weeks.
Absolutely the best book I have read in years. Quite a creative story, and the writing is brilliant.
I didn't want it to end!  It was so well written and such a powerful story.  Definitely a must read!
Enjoyed the book.  A look at WW II and the way it affects the lives of people in occupied countries.
This is one of those books you want to be able to read again for the first time. It ended perfectly.
Remarkable. A great read. This is such a period piece and yet so much more. It was hard to put down.
Beautifully written and intricately constructed.  An engrossing novel that will surely be a classic.
I'm sure we are going to read this excellent novel in my book club this year. The writing is superb.
A bit slow for me in the beginning, then when it all came together it was surprising and delightful.
Brilliantly written.  Truly, an inspired account of some of the personal beauty and tragedy of WWII.
Well written and generally engaging. Eventually, the plot became to predictable and I lost interest.
Kind of slow, but good read. Not the ending I expected, but maybe that is not a bad thing after all.
Another insight into WWII a book that remains in my head weeks after I finished. Worth a second read
The best book I've read in five years.  A literary masterpiece in character development and travels.
Beautifully written and interesting. This is a book worth buying so you can read it again and again.
AMAZING BOOK!  SKILLFULLY WRITTEN!! I LOOK FORWARD TO THE REREAD AND SHARING THIS READ WITH FRIENDS!
A great read. It kept me turning the page to see what would happen next. Absorbing and well written.
What war does to the innocent.  The writing is extraordinary.  The plot sublime.  Best read of 2014.
Beautifully written, intriguing story that holds your interest. One of few books I would read again.
Recommended by several friends.  Haven't read it yet, but looking forward to it...over the holidays.
Lyrical, moving, character-driven, thought-provoking, a real page turner,  and a tearjerker as well.
Really enjoyed this book. Great characters and historical fiction. Jumps around, but easy to follow.
Really enjoyed this different WW2 story... Not the typical war story...saw different points of view.
I so enjoyed this book, wonderful characters and time frame. I had a difficult time putting it down.
Wonderful novel...Fresh perspective on WWII.  I loved the detail and the descriptions of the author.
I find that novels often start out great and then fizzle. Not this one .Best I've read in many years
A powerful and moving story that adds yet another dimension to our understanding of the Third Reich.
I felt so close to those people in the story. I did not really wanted it to end.Wonderfully written!
A very compelling story.  It jumped a bit much  from year to year but it wasn't too hard to connect.
holds you all the way through.  well constructed and all characters attach themselves to the reader.
This is one of those books that you just don't want to end. Very well written and worth every penny.
This story was so compelling and told in such a beautiful style I want to read it again. Right now.
this was a very intense book.  read it for book club and the discussion was great.  so many levels.
Amazing wonderful riveting and difficult to put down.<br/>I walked miles / kms listening on audio.
Exceptional novel, poetic writing style, well developed characters and storyline. Highly recommend!
The book was a challenge to read.  The characters were well developed and the story quite explicit.
The story was beautifully written, however, it moved at such a slow pace I was unable to finish it.
Interesting perspective on the German occupation of France and impact on youth from both countries.
Really enjoyed this book.  It was a little slow to get started, but loved how it all came together.
The story is good, but it's so scattered from one character to another.  At time's it is confusing.
I enjoyed this book. It gave thought to what had happened back then, and the courage of the people.
read this book for a book club I joined. Just know it was written during around the time of Hitler.
One of the best books I've ever read.mi did mine in audio, but everything about the book was great.
Engaging.  Gives a view of the Nazi occupation of Paris through the experience of two young people.
I  found  the  book  to  be  very  thought  provoking.  It  made  a  profound  impression  on  me.,
Loved this book. The writing is pure poetry, and the story gained momentum that held me to the end.
Amazingly brilliant.  Touching in ways you don't expect.  Beautifully written.  Highly recommended.
This was a very good and interesting book.  I really enjoyed "The Nightingale" more though.
Really enjoyed this book. Never quite sure where all this was going but enjoyed the end especially.
The story was quite interesting, and it was hard to stop reading before finishing the entire story.
I will always remember this novel.  It was a little too wordy.  My book club gave it a 9-10 rating.
A wonderful tale with interesting characters and with surprises and real hear wrenching situations.
did not finish it. Got lost with the characters in the story as the chapters went back and forward.
excellent book, only comment is sometimes the back and forth of the story left timelines confusing.
Enjoyable but too wordy.  What happened at the end should have happened earlier and then developed.
This book is riveting and I enjoyed the writing style immensely. My favorite book in the last year.
Well written book about World War 2 as seen from many viewpoints through well-developed characters.
Wonderful characters set in late 30s/ WWII era in France and Germany with a few interesting twists.
This book will remind you how powerful a story can be. It haunts me. What talent Anthony Doerr has.
I enjoyed the characters and the story, but this was a long book to read and then have a non-ending.
My favorite book from 2014. Poignant and thought provoking. Very much enjoyed this excellent novel!
Best book I've read in years.  Beautiful language, pace, images.  Just a tad too rushed at the end.
If you are drawn to the WWII era, this book will take you in and take you on an incredible journey.
What a super story !! Could not put it down This was all a trip of unexpected pleasure and surprise
It reminded me of my Childhood.Could not put the book down.It was written so fluid ,wonderful read.
An excellent, well written, beautiful book!  Not surprised to find it was one of the best for 2014!
Truly one of the best books I have read in a long time. Ended before I was ready to finish it!!~!!!
Beautifully written. Subject matter difficult to read. But material told in a very different style.
An interesting book showcasing an area of WWII that is not so common to read about. Very enjoyable.
An excellent book; don't pass up this one.  One of my favorite this year. The writing is wonderful.
A wonderfully written novel. Each character was brought to life by the author. Well worth the read.
Just written with such amazing imagery. Books like this don't come along often. Savored every page.
One of the best books I have read in years.the writing style is poetic and the message is profound.
Celebrates the beauty of human relationships, even across cultures, in the midst of a horrible war.
absolutely one of the best books I've read recently, well written and really grabs you emotionally.
Great story and the prose is beautiful.  Like Mark Helprin without the fantasy.  Really enjoyed it.
a beautifully written novel about two very different lives intersecting for a brief moment in time.
I had high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, I was let down. I thought the story jumped around too much. I often wondered what year and month it was during a chapter. I expected more of a connection between Marie and Werner. Their brief, but important encounter, left me wanting more. I felt there were a lot of characters whose stories could have been more. Instead, there are a lot of different characters with potential. I feel perhaps I missed something given all of the stellar reviews. However, it should be noted that I have read a number of unforgettable, outstanding WWII novels.
I am writing this review for the people with the courage to say a book is not good even though it is a "best seller." Mostly I felt angry about the editors allowing the author to essentially vomit on the reader at the end with the death of Werner not by disease, not by the guard yelling halt, but by stepping on a landmine--just after finally meeting the girl. Then the whole part about her putting the diamond in the water when even at 16 and blind it would appear a valuable commodity to trade a diamond for food/shelter for someone that has now become a refugee but her first act is to dump it what!!??. The whole part about the kennel with the snails with the lock was preposterous as was Frau Elena giving him back 50 of the 75 marks he received for repairing the radio. Hello!!-- wartime she's taking care of the orphanage--or even illogical for him to have offered her the money in the first place. Then the girl's father never comes back into the story after all that buildup about him. And the Russian rape segment --please deliver me. Then the giant being one of the one who survives and the boy brain damaged and his sister Jutta. I even hate spending my quality time writing this review it make me so disgusted.
Couldn't get into it. Went on and on without telling you a story.
A little slow in some places, but otherwise a very good story. I would read another of his novels.
The time shifts made the story confusing and I would need to read it again to fully understand it.
I loved everything about this book. It was so well written and the characters were well developed.
Long, but easy amazing book, great for a book club has discussion questions at the end of the book
Great book!  Everyone in my family read it and everybody loved it - all generations, genders, etc.
It was great until the end. There was so much potential in the story and then it just dropped off.
Excellent word pictures.  Expressed beauty in a time in our history that was horrific for so many.
Absolutely loved this book. I thoroughly enjoy WWII books and this one knocked it out of the park.
I love WWII stories.  This one is a unique look at how young lives intersected in a terrible time.
I actually liked it better than "to kill a mockingbird" which I read just before this book
The best fiction of summer 2015.  great story; beautiful writing.  Hated to see it come to an end.
Intriguing approach to WWII from the perspective of two young people involved in it.  Fascinating.
very surprising - the book was not what i expected, but i really liked it - extremely well-written
The writing in this book was riveting. I couldn't wait to finish it, yet hated to have it be over.
A very interesting story. With good descriptions of the era. Great insight/  working of the story.
Wonderful. Very sad but shows the power of the will to survive and what the human body can endure.
I can't put it down! I haven't underlined so much in a book in a really long time. Fantastic read!
One of the best books about World War I that I have ever read. I literally did not want it to end.
Enjoyed this book. Takes time to get into it, but then it is read well worth the effort. Enjoy it.
A great story that is almost impossible to put down!  My daughter and I both read it and loved it.
An amazing read.  The courage of the people during this horrible war was so apparent in this book.
I really enjoyed the first half but got very tired of his lists and endless adjectives by the end.
Beautifully written~a different perspective on growing up in The Holocaust. Great detail & insight
A very good reading book. It was interesting from a blind girls perspective and very good reading.
I would suggest this book for my book club. It is a great read and also there is  much to discuss.
Beautiful story. Haunting. Dark and truthful of the hell that went on during Europe in the 1940's.
It will probably be on my "best ever" books.  I plan to present it to my book club in May.
An excellent read about WWII from a vastly different viewpoint.  One of my favorites of this year.
Beautifully written.  Kept my interest - I had to put it down so that I wouldn't read it too fast!
This was quite a long read, and worth it I recommend this book, you will find it hard to put down.
This was an amazing adventure to write about, the writer creates emotions that you can truly feel.
A little heavy on details --- got bogged down in places but I'm glad I read it (for my book club).
Can you buy just half the book? Some reviews say the first half was great, the second not so much.
Great book -- the characters are very rich and love how they are interconnected.  Highly recommend
A captivating story that weaves fact with fiction. I haven't found anyone yet who hasn't loved it.
Beautifully written. Wonderful book with great plot and characters that are easy to live and hate.
Beautifully written. A very sad, poetic but profound book.  I would have liked a different ending.
An extraordinary book with truly elegant writing style and a very compelling story - I loved it...
It had a run of words to often. Maybe I have read a lot of war stories. I can't say I disliked it.
Great reading<br/>Hard to put down . If you like WW II books this is a is wonderful book to read.
A book well worth your time invested. A story I will never forget. I couldn't put this book down !
I never liked history in school, but this book has changed my mind.  Spell-binding, love, love it!
Once you start reading it, you won't want to stop.  I  gave it only 4 stars because of the ending.
All of us in our book group enjoyed this book. I personally found it very moving and well-written.
My first time to read this author. It was our book club selection. Wonderful characters and story.
excellent book!  strongly recommend it. Terrific writing with an absorbing plot. Hard to put down.
I'm equally afraid I that I will and won't be able to let go of this feeling. Beautiful and sad...
I enjoyed this book very much - quite an interesting entanglement of characters - a bit sad though
Depressing.  The writing is uneven - some is excellent, some is amateurish.  Couldn't put it down.
Less about the occupation of France than thoughtful and intriguing character and plot development.
Interesting story, well written, covers events that could have taken place during WW II in Europe.
although this is yet another ww2 novel it was delightful different perspective beautifully written
Fabulous book. Written so poetically. Takes you from time period to time period. Highly recommend.
Loved this book! Well written and very interesting view of WWII from those involved on both sides.
It was a very good read.hard to put down and the author didn't,t try to tie up the ending too fast
The writing is beautiful, and the story is gripping.  A most unusual book, and well worth reading.
I loved this book! Great characters! I felt like I was in Euope during the war. Wonderful insight.
This book had extremely high reviews and I am a WWII history nerd. This book brought a few humane dimensions to the moral destruction associated with the war, but fell short of my expectations. I waited and waited and waited for this book to pick up...it never did. In all fairness I skimmed the last 50 pages because I was just ready to be done.
Amazing book
Have not finished the book yet, but reading it slowly gives one time to think about the contents.
A real treat to read and follow.  Beautifully written, believable and heart-rending, all at once.
You don't have enough stars to rate this book.  It read poetically.  I would highly recommend it.
One great read! An epic story and interesting characters that will stay with you for a long time.
A story sentimental, hard, and real. Believable narrative about two paths, distant but connected.
Beautiful, magical, strange, poetic. I can't add much to what's been said, but really enjoyed it.
Poetic prose that allows the reader to deeply become emerged in the story.  Worthy of its awards.
The book is hard to follow. New locations and events are, hard to discern until late in paragraph
Read smoothly.  Lots of suspense and you really care for these characters.  A nice books to read.
I am 80% through with the book, but I absolutely love it so far!  I recommend it whole-heartedly!
An amazing, poetically written novel of an extremely dangerous and difficult time in our history.
A great summer read....I noted that the Obamas chose this book for their summer vacation reading.
Exceptionally well written novel. The outcome was not predictable.Kept me on the edge of my seat.
I wish it did not end so I could still see the characters and stay with them for a little longer.
Very well written and interesting story.  Couldn't put it down, which is unusual for a war story!
Quite simply, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  And I have read hundreds of books.
Interesting story from WWII, from the prospective of 2 children, one French and the other German.
Wonderful book, easy to tell why it won a Pulitzer Prize.<br/><br/>Capt. Denis Faherty USN(RET)
This is one of the best books I have read this year. No wonder it is a long standing best seller!
I could not put this book down.  It was a good thing I was on a 7 hour flight.  Riveting writing.
Another tragic WWII story, poignant but showing the courage and bravery of this young blind girl.
Good book, long at times, but a good read.  I recommend it especially those who like WWII novels.
A refreshing and tender story of WWII from the point of view of children. I was totally captured.
Have not quite finished the book but it is well written and I am looking forward to finishing it.
Sad story of survival.  The human spirit is told through strong characters of both good and evil.
Beautifully written. Poignant and compassionate. Sad, yet uplifting and a book I would recommend.
Sensitive story...you will feel for the characters...more casualties from this devastating War...
I liked the story but it was slow at times.  The ending was not what I thought it would be either
Wonderful book, beautiful writing, engaging characters and engrossing story. Hated for it to end.
Beautifully written book , wonderful story, was sorry when it was finished. Thoroughly recommend.
Simple, but beautiful narrative of an intricate weaving of multiple stories. A really great read.
Well written developed characters, interesting story that drive faster and faster toward the end.
Loved the short chapters and thought the writing was beautiful.  Exquisitely painted characters--
What a wonderful novel full of intertwined complex characters who bring the story of war to life.
Well written and gives an interesting perspective to both sides. Cdertainly made for a good read.
Touching in depth look at characters . Kept the reader involved from page one  to the very last .
This novel brings World War Two to life in a most personal sense.  The central characters are people caught up in the destruction and horrors of war--ordinary, engaging, eminently human--we quickly fall in love with them, and are thus drawn headlong, into the War and their lives lived in and around the storm.  I can't wait to see the movie!
This story did what few can do. It put me into the place and time, engrossed me to the point that I did’t want it to end, engaged me emotionally so that I felt the sadness, joy, terror, and dilemmas of the characters’ lives. If I’m lucky, I will read a book like this about twice a year. It has become a classic in my view, one to be reread every few years or so. I look forward to Mr. Doerr’s next book, but I can’t see where it could possibly be as wonderful a read as this one was! I am happy to recommend this one!
I came upon this book by accident.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story of the young blind French girl and the young German boy.  If you've been to the Brittany coast of France, you will love reading about St. Malo, where most of the story takes place.  If you like books about World War II, I guarantee that you won't be able to put this down.
A good book but hard to follow as they kept changing from one character to another each chapter.
One of the best books I have ever read. The plot is spellbinding and it is beautifully written .
I didn't think I would like this book, as I normally read mysteries, but I very much enjoyed it.
I really enjoyed the story going back and forth between the two stories.  I really recommend it.
A moving, thoughtful story with breathtaking descriptions of the events and places in the story.
Fantastic read from start to finish. Well written and interesting from a historical perspective.
Very well written. Interesting. Suspenseful. Good depiction of war and what it does to the soul.
A compassionate exploration of the complexities of humanity. A wonderful tale, wonderfully told!
The ending was rushed and I was left disappointed that I invested the time in reading the novel.
I love the characters in this book. Loved the alternating chapters. In short, I loved this book.
I love it when the book ties up all the loose ends, you know how all the main characters end up.
Outstanding book. Beautiful prose. Such an interesting approach to each character's development.
A little hard to get into initially, but I returned to it and ended up enjoying it tremendously.
I thoroughly enjoyed the stories of the two protagonists and how they ultimately were interwoven
A story you never want to end. Want to read more books by this author. He is gifted as a writer.
Very graphic story of the lives of two young people as they grow up through the tragedy of WWII.
If I could give it 6 stars I would--one of the most beautifully written novels I have ever read.

Very interesting and unique  perspective on World War II through the eyes of youth. Suspenseful.

One of those that you don't want to end.  I so loved the characters. The book moved me to tears.
Could not but the book down.  Such a great story and not what you expected of World War II book.
A little difficult keeping up with the plot jumping around, but at the end I was well satisfied.
this book is a good read but it made me sad.  i don't think i can read another war book anymore.
Amazing,well written book .catchs you and does not let go,the ending is so unexpected I gasped..

Compelling-couldn't put it down! Wonderfully descriptive of two children growing up during WWII.
What a great read! Wonderful character development. I really enjoyed the stories slowly merging.
It's ambitious to write a novel with a fresh take on WWII, and I think Doerr was up to the task.
Enjoyed it immensely.  Very thoughtful novel, nicely paced.  The characters really come to life.
I cried when I finished this book...I didn't want it tobe over!  Very well written and engaging.
Goes onto my "one of the best books I have ever read" list. Doerr is a masterful writer.
Interesting subject, treated well, just hard to reat very much at one time.  Somewhat depressing
interesting characters and plot.  Makes an easier read because of the shorter chapter divisions.
Just when you thought you wouldn't read another holocaust story this marvellous tale comes along
Good story.  Became slow in the middle, but made up for it with the ending.  Would recommend it.
So metaphorical you can't make sense of the story.  No emotion.
Beautifully expressed, poignant novel about the toll of war, written in the most human of terms
This story is incredible since everything is described by sound. The author did an amazing job.
A page turner that pleasantly challenges the reader to reread for meaning and literary devices.
Well written.  Felt like I was getting a WWII history lesson in addition to a suspenseful read.
Wonderful read, quality of writing is wonderful. A new insight into individual pain during WWII
Beautifully written and wonderful character development but too much concern and sorrow for me.
An excellent book from an historical perspective with a great story intermingled or vice versa.
Beautifully written and so poignantly told, this is a story to be savored. I really enjoyed it.
Written by an American with American references - very little French feel to the French scenes.
One of the best novels I have read in years rare mix of crisp, lyrical prose and a great story.
Well written, and engaging. I found it difficult to put down.  Wonderful character development.
Hard to put down!  Thought provoking and a compelling read about love, friendship, and loyalty.
Great book!!  Very short chapters sometimes made it a bit choppy, but overall a very good read.
Enjoyed reading the story and realizing the hardship ordinary people  suffered during the WW11.
I would highly recommend it.  It took me about 100 pages to get into it, but then I was hooked.
An amazing book. How we forget the tremendous sacrifice and cost that war requires of everyone.
Well done. Story dealing with relationships of all kind, in the worst circumstances. Good read.
Really liked it.  I didn't think I would at first, as I don't read war novels.  Very good book.
This book has a little bit of a slow start for me, but then, I had a hard time putting it down.
A profound a statement of life and hope in the midst of the incredible tragedy of World War II.
I buy books on CD because my friend is blind.  She says the book is very good and entertaining.
I very much enjoyed this read. It was original and fresh. A twist to war that was so very true.
Not a happy story, if that's what you're in to, but a very poignant, beautifully written story.
One of the best books I ever read and have recommended to many people. Also have loaned it out.
Great human story about WWII, interwoven very well.  Good suspense; enjoyed the book very much.
Good book. I wanted to cry when finishing it. Life was so tragic for everyone during that time.
Great story of growing up, not only blind, but during WWII and all of the hardships they faced.
The book was very good but confusing at times when they would go from one story line to another
It was good but I wish it had been more about the main characters than the war. Maybe next time
Loved this book !  The author's descriptive passages make the characters and scenes come alive.
Beautifully written coming of age story. The ending was not as rich for me as rest of the book.
Well written, sad, funny, interesting and a great look intothe hardships of others during WWII.

I thought the book was so interesting and touching.<br/>I highly recommend reading this novel.
Loved this book......hated to have it end somI dragged out reading the last quarter of the book
This book reminds us that there is a part of us that can be held aside from the external world.
A wonderful book that kept me caring about all the characters.  Wonderful immersion in history.
A lovely read. Sorry when it ended--I liked the main characters and didn't want to say goodbye.
Not my usual genre.. nut i loved this story it is  beautifully written ..could not put it down
Slow start.  Excellent story, and well written for the most part, but the ending is very poor.
I love this genre and it gave me a look at a part of France that I  had not read about before.
One of best books I've ever read.  You can see how the French people were hurt during the war.
You really cared about the characters and what was going to happen to them.  Hard to put down!
Excellent novel!! Very original and full of details that show the author's knowledge of II WW.
This book was just ok.  It was a slightly interesting read.  However, I would not recommend t.
This book is so well written - a great story during an awful time in history. A very good read
An engaging read.  I did research to find out more about the village in France.  Well written.
Unique perspective on WW 2 that elevated the human dilemma of all involved. Excellent writing.
I really liked it, except for the ending.  I hope  there is a sequel to tie up the loose ends.
Loved this book, the writing, the intermingled stories and the historical backdrop, inspiring!
I have not read a book so moving or thoughtful as this in a long time. It is superbly written.
Beautifully written and sad, but with a compelling spiritual force.  It reads like a symphony.
I like reading about this time in history.  It is well written and I enjoyed reading the book.
Would have given it five stars if ending had been different. Guess I'm too much of a romantic?
I've already recommended it to my book club.  I will also look for other books by this author.
Well done.  Just when I said I'd never read another book about WWII.  Happy I changed my mind.
Truly worthwhile reading.  Beautifully written with a compelling plot, I couldn't put it down.
a very poetic novel. . . metaphors of connection by sound (radio) and touch dominate the story
I love this book, could not put it down, pick it up and read it, you won't be sorry. Have fun.
Superbly written.  A beautiful story, more poetic than prosaic.  One of the year's best books.
Compelling story of two lost souls in WWII.  Unique writing style that really firs the strory.

This is one of the best books I have ever read. Could not put it down. Bravo Mr. Doerr. Bravo.
I liked tha story, but I found the switching between different time periods somewhat annoying.
An unbelievably good book. When I finished, I immediately had to start over and read it again!
I haven't finished it yet. Probably don't want it to end. Great writing and a wonderful story.
The development of the characters was very good. You felt like you were following that person.
Such a beautifully written novel.  The characters were so real,  Didn't want the story to end!
Very interesting about 2 different perspectives of W.W.ll  well written & nice short chapters.
A quality novel.  A great read that  in the midst of war gives a glimmer of hope for humanity.

This was such a great book, I couldn't put it down!  But then again, I didn't want it to end.
A very good book which kept me engaged entire time..however the end disappointed me somehow..

One of the best books I've read in a long time.  Had me in its grip right from the beginning.
What can I say, it is one of the best books I've read this year.  It will make a great movie.
Solid work that took me to a place and time through the events of lives impacting both sides.
I was disappointed when I finished the story. Well-written, descriptive, engaging characters.
I enjoyed this book.  Marie-Laure endured a lot her entire life.  She was a strong character.
Beautifully written and a thrilling page turner. Well thought out storyline. Loved this book.
Enjoyable read. Also very informative.Good capture of life in Germany and France during WWII.
I am not a fan of back and forth chapters about the characters.  Plus, too technical fior me.
Perfect insight into an unfamiliar space and how a memory and realisation, can save your life
Vivid descriptions; especially the ones felt, heard and experienced by the blind protagonist.
Beautiful writer and it brought great memories of my trip to Saint Malo. Loved the storyline.
A beautifully written book. The characters are portrayed so fully and with great sensitivity.
A unique story of a familiar subject:  WWII.  Breezed through it.  A tragedy with redemption.
An excellent book with a unique story line that I found to be intriguing. Highly recommended!
Good read..love me the story with using short chapters to switch to a he different characters
This book lived up to all of my expectations and the reviews.  Beautifully bittersweet story.
I was ready to start this book again as soon as I finished.  Everything about it was perfect!
Compelling story, historical context, vivid characters, gorgeous language...and some science.
Engrossing, vivid tale with historical merit. Unusual chronology can nonetheless be followed.
very well written, the characters really come alive,  some sad , some happy but a great story
Very moving story set in WW2. Another graphic take of the suffering and pointlessness of war.
Intriguing story, well crafted.  I really cared about the main characters and their survival.
Not a bad book to read from the perspective of a blind girl and her survival through the war.
Loved it.  Had my husband read it and now it's with my son. Felt like you're there with them.
This was a good read. I read it for my work bookclub and would not have chosen it  on my own.

I've read this twice now. Excellent writing--beautiful imagery and a very interesting story.
fabulous writing.  Enthralling, was sad when the book was over and there was no more to read
Excellent story! Ending seemed rushed and not as well thought through. Still worth the read!
great writing yet the story was not my favorite type. looking forward to Doerr's next novel.
Wonderful book World War II story as told by German boy/soldier and French girl. Great story
This was a beautifully written book. It is one of the best books I have read in a long time.
I liked this book so much that I sent my father a copy for his birthday. He enjoyed it also.
It was gripping but with a sense of dread at what was coming. Extremely well written though!
This book more than met my expectations. It is a great read and I would highly recommend it.
It was "Dark" in that it was a Nazi war setting but also very "suspenseful."
It won the 2015 Pulitzer. It deserved it. Wonderful story, beautifully written - I loved it.
Kind or puzzling at.first, but throws a new light on Nazi Germany as well as occupied Paris.
an engaging read even though it takes place in one of the darkest times of the 20th century.
Glued to every page. Didn't want it to end. Not a light read - you need to absorb every word
New look on an old subject. Enjoyed it much better as I talked with others that had read it.
Nice writing style, engaging characters, but the end of the story was flat and unfulfilling.
Not enjoying this book.  I need it for a book club I belong to or I wouldn't even finish it.
Well written.  Kept my interest.  Good information on the resistance during WW2.  Good reed.
Good story but didn't like constant back and forth each chapter of locations and characters.
Excellent insights and very creative. Would give it a five if it weren't drawn out at times.
Well written and a very different perspective of the human dramas that occurred during WWII.
It draws you in, it is a story of history and humanity and peaches will never taste the same
Good story and well written for the most part.  However it seemed too wordy and overly long.
From the very first moment you start reading you can not put down mr Doer's intriguing novel
Powerful story.  Should be required reading for everyone.  Beautifully written.  Compelling.
One of the best World War II stories I've read.  It compares to The Book Thief and Unbroken.
Written beautifully.  Could not put it down.  Gives the reader a unique perspective of WWII.
Gorgeous, captivating read. A lovely book I will read again and I don't have many of those..
I enjoyed reading the book,can not imagine what is was like living in Europe during the war.
Well written. Interesting perspective of war viewed through the experiences of a blind girl.
This is an endearing story of trust, faith and hope.  It's the best read I've had this year.
This book is beautifully written, compelling, pictorial and engaging story. Excellent, read.
A different perspective on the nature of how we relate to each other as enemies and friends.
Loved the book until the ending- sad that it didn't have a better one as it was a great read
Wonderful story about young blind girl in France during Nazi takeover. Enjoyed it immensely.
Best book I have read in a while-- I would definitely recommend to anyone interested in WWII

Hard to get into at the start but keep at it and it will start making sense and pull you in.

I really liked this book , stated a little slow to me but then I didn't want to put it down
Engaging writing, well developed characters showing the tragedy of war for all of humanity.
Simply one the best I have read recently. Two great  stories wonderfully stitched together.
The best fiction I've read this year.  Other reviewers have said it all, so I won't repeat.
Great book where I was immediately drawn in. Loved the characters and couldn't put it down.
Interesting viewpoint although I struggled to get into the story. Not as good as I'd hoped.
A wonderful story woven around world war two.The bravery of a blind girl and her struggles.
To keep it short but sweet, this is an enthralling, touching, and beautifully written book.
A glorious read by a gifted author. Just visited St-Malo and had to go see 4, rue Vauborel.
Really loved the read.<br/>Couldn't put it down and could hardly wait to pick it up again.
Good story looking at ww 2 through the eyes of a young German orphan and blind French girl.
Great book.  Interesting to read about how the war affected these two young peoples' lives.
Perfect condition. Loved the book. It was a book club choice. It got a 4.3 rating out of 5.
If you like your prose a bit poetic, and enjoy a bewitching story, you will love this book.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a different view of WWII from some European's eyes.
A beautifully written book.  The language throughout had a certain delicacy that, to me, underscored the tentative and fragile aspects of the characters' lives.  The parallel stories were fascinating and became interwoven in a unique and satisfying way.  I've already recommended this book to all my reader friends.
Loved the authors description of the environment the characters were seeing. Lovely story.
Overall the book was okay. I think it wasn't as good as all the reviews made it out to be.
Reader will glean insight into human frailties and the effects of war on everyone's lives.
The author's writing was really enjoyable and engaging.  I was disappointed by the ending.
Excellent book if you pay attention. If not, it is easy to get lost in the time and voice.
Enjoyed it very much. Felt the beginning, middle were brilliant and the ending the weakest
The first couple of chapters, I was unsure. Then it picked up and I couldn't stop reading.
This is the best book of the season, in my opinion.  I believe most readers would love it!
Excellent story very well written. It left me stunned when it ends. I highly recommend it.
I loved this  book  great  story  Historic  ,suspenseful  . I really  enjoyed  this  book.
Well written tender story intertwined with the atrocities surrounding the main characters.
Fantastic book! I would go as far as to say that this is the best book I've read all year.
excellent story - great character portrayals - and a different more personal look at WWII.
Well written and realistic portrayal of the Second World War from the human point of view.
An interesting review of the end of WW2 in Europe.  Held my attention all the way through.
this is a beautiful, inspiring and heartwarming story.  We can be strong if we have to be!
Could not set the book down.  Great read more understanding about the war with Germany....
One extra ordinarily written and meaningful book<br/>Best I have read in a very long time
Wonderfully written historical novel documenting how the war affected lives on both sides.
Loved this book.  Puts you right inside the horrific war.  Well written and a page turner.
Enjoyed the personal feeling of the characters showing how devastating war is to everyone.
This story keeps your interest throughout. A common thread units two characters over time.
Very well thought out and fascinating….just a little too long…could have ended it earlier.
A good read. A little slow in places. Did love the ending and all the ends tying together.
I really have no words other than I think it's the best book I've read in quite some time!
tjis is a really good book! I was sorry to put it down and anxious to get back to it! Judy
I just wasn't interested enough to finish this book. I know that people raved about it. My own daughter was shocked when I said that I just found it rather boring. She thought it was great. Maybe I've read too many books on the WWII era. I like the story of the young boy but the girl lacked depth. I wanted to know something more about her feelings other than her waiting for her beloved father to return to her. I got 3/4 of the way through. Maybe I'll finish it some day.
Outstanding
Great read!
pretty good
Great book!
joyful read
Great story
I loved this book.  The writing technique and language usage was great!  Great story too.
In view of the  numerous books written about the second world war, this had a novel angle
Very slow moving, character development could have been deeper. Disappointed with ending,
Very well written with interesting characters. Also love stories based on actual history.
Great historic fiction novel.Little confusing at times with transitioning back and forth.
All are excellent books.  You don't want them to end.  Sad that Odd Thomas series is over.
This was some of the most beautiful writing I have read in a long time. A wonderful story
Very interesting perspective of 2 young people from different worlds impacted by the war.
Excellent book. The trying together of the stories was superbly done. I highly recommend!

loved the book...a good discussion for book clubs...even my husband read it and loved it!
This was a very interesting perspective on WWII, and a mix of humor, sadness and destiny.
I really did not line the writing style  Also never really felt connected with the story.
Things don't occur in any recognizable order.  I thought my Kindle version was corrupted.
This was a great book.  Loved it.  The characters were well written, they all drew me in.
I could not put this book down! The writing was so descriptive.  I felt that I was there.
Switches back and forth in both time and characters, making it a bit difficult to follow.
A novel about the lives of people affected by World War II.  Not your standard war novel.
The prose is breathtaking. The experience awakening. Take time in each step and be aware.
Great book.  Could not put it down.  I will definitely buy more of Anthony Doerr's books.
A different perspective from most war books. Beautifully written. Spell-binding. Intense.
Outstanding writing and fascinating plot.  One of the best book I've read in a long time!
Loved this book.  Exquisite use of language and beautifully masterful symbolism of light.
Well written and definitely a must read.  I can see this coming out as a movie next year!
Amazing, wonderful, beautiful. Such an interesting story to read and so well written too!

Outstanding. Great character development, beautifully written and drenched with humanity.
It is well written and gives a real insight into what living in a war zone could be like.

The book is slow to start ...I have read a lot of war  books so this wasn't my favorite.

A journey that makes you feel like you are in the middle of it.  Extraordinary writing.
Beautifully told tale. Paints a great picture of the time and place and inner feelings.
Very thoughtful and well-written.  Even though it's a novel, it seemed very believable.
great book on a grim subject. Characters were so well thought out and imagery fantastic
I thought this was a very good book. It held my interest and had some good information.
This is a book you can go back and read over and get new insight each time. Great book
I liked it but I did not love it.  I found it to be unpredictable which I liked a lot.
One of the best books I've read all year ... and I usually don't prefer period pieces.
While the chapter structure - which moves backwards and forwards through time - can be
Very different style of writing which worked most of the time but not all of the time.
Really loved this book. I couldn't wait for bedtime so I could get back to reading it!
Excellent book. Well written. Very poignant. Very telling about both sides in the war.

The story evolved from different times and places. Skillfully woven. A powerful story.
I thought this was a great book and it stuck with me long after I finished reading it.

I enjoyed this hitorical fiction. Interesting how the lives intertwine over the years.
Gorgeous, thoughtful, brilliant book that reflects the author's talents and diligence.
Good book, allows you to look into the characters lives with interesting perspectives.
Intriguing, but too much about Werner working with the Nazi`s on radios in the fields.
I took a while to get into this book but find myself haunted by it now as I finish it.
Found this a compelling story and full of historical content. Very beautiful language.
beautifully written engaging story that is a page turner. I would recommend this book.
I liked the book but would have liked it better if it was simply told chronologically.
What a fabulous writer! What a way with words! Doerr is a literary artist! Great read.
This is a book that was hard to put down.  Well writen and goes straight to the heart.
beautiful writing<br/>convoluted story line<br/>amazing main character<br/>too long
Excellent read!  WWII as seen from two diverse characters.  The language is beautiful.
the female character seemed too young for the role she was playing and a bit too stiff
Fantastic book!  I couldn't wait to finish to see how the stories collided in the end.
This novel is perfectly constructed.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it to the very end.
Excellent read - kept me riveted - a bit disappointed in the ending but...............
This book is so well written I could not put it down.One of the best I read this year.
I felt like the only reason I continued to read this book was because it was for my book club. I enjoy reading details but this book took it to the extremes.  After a short time I found myself skimming most of the chapters because not every little thing needed a whole chapter dedicated to such details.  After forcing myself to read most of this book, I found myself finally interested in the last 20% percent to just be disappointed in the ending.
I found it a thoughtful historical novel with good insight into the reality of WW II.
One of the great books that I have read so far in my lifetime...and I have read many.
Great read. Liked the short chapters, could pick it up and put it down without worry.
The characters are so compelling. They linger with me and I find myself missing them.
Superb book.  The author's description of scenes and individuals was especially good.
Interesting story. A reminder of the impact of WW !! on so many lives, on both sides.
I enjoyed this book, it was a easy read and kept my interest through the entire book.
Not just a written novel but an exquisite piece of literature an absolute page turner
Lovely writing.  However, the ending was very disappointing as it simply fizzled out.
Great book! I really enjoyed it! Well written and the audio book is really well read.
Sad review of the populace during WWII.  How did so many survive and go on afterward?
Took me about half the book before I started to like it, enjoyed the last half a lot.
Great book, but the ending was a little flat when compared with the rest of the book.
One of the best, if not the best book I have ever read. I recommend this book highly.
It was a little plodding in the middle.  Tying up loose ends made the conclusion odd.
Best book I have read in years! A well written wonderful story of historical fiction!
Couldn't stop thinking about story between reading sessions.  Would highly recommend!
A tragic story based on fact. I thought it was a wonderful fiction mixed wit history.
One of the most beautifully written, most enthralling books I've read in a long time!
Great read!! So interesting how the author paralleled the two main characters' lives.
Tender and heartfelt.  WW2 story of innocents involved in and traumatized by the war.
A very compelling story with well-developed characters.  Extremely thought provoking.
This book is beautifully written. The characters are unforgettable. Outstanding novel
This was a well written, excellent book.  I highly recommend it.  A real page turner.
This is a long book but that is necessary for the excellent character development.  I
I loved this book. Now, I am looking forward to reading more from this gifted author.
A wonderfully written book with memorable characters but the end is somewhat obscure.
Beautiful prose, sensitive, characters painted beautifully and the story is smashing.
Awesome illustration and writing. I read this book over and over again. Just perfect!
It was an ok read. Chapters are short and quick. Story line was good but predictable.
Great story. It really covers the people caught in the middle of a war on both sides.
An excellent novel set during WW2 but not ABOUT WW2.<br/>Great characters and story.
It kept me interested right to the end.  Some of the flashbacks were a bit confusing.
One of the best books I have read in the past year.  The writing is beautifully done.
I am no book critique, but I found this a very enjoyable read and eloquently written.
Thought provoking, sincere and touching story of hope, love and survival in bad times

Beautiful writing.  Lovely weaving of stories.  A real gem that I didn't want to end.
You are hooked on page one.  A beautifully written story that you will long remember.
This book was difficult to get into; and I'm still "working" on finishing it.
Great book, similar to The Book Thief but stands on it's own.  I highly recommend it.
never heard of this author but the book was really good.  I could hardly put it down.
This had to be my least favorite WWII themed novel to date; and I read many.  The whole book just seemed choppy. Facts, facts and more facts and I'm not referring to actual historic facts either.  The two main characters were okay, the girl being the most interesting of the two but their connection is minimal which was unexpected to me.  An unsatisfying read from beginning to disappointing end.  Sorry.  I know it won awards but not sure why.
In my years of reading books, I've realized I'm pretty finicky. Characters have to entice me and plots must grab me.  I only made it half way through this book. I wanted to like it. The story was fine if you don't mind long-and-drawn-out. Since I was willing to end my reading at half way through, I obviously wasn't attached to the characters. I realize I am in the minority and I truly wanted to like this book. It's just not for me. Bummer.
good read, good story, brought awareness to the German side of the war, well written
Recommended this book to all my friends.  I enjoyed from the first page to the last!
Very well written book that has you empathizing with people on all sides of the war.
Excellent book.  The story and  its characters all come together in creative I ways.
A wonderful description of a blind child learning to cope with war while growing up.
Beautiful use of words.  Very personal story of victims of war.  Exciting, at times.
Two intertwined lives that are destined to connect.  Beautiful storytelling imagery.
This is what "FICTION" at its finest brings to everyone who reads this book.
Beautiful book and very well written. An unforgettable story of resilience and love.
Really great and well-written book, interweaving interesting characters during WWII.
This was a thoroughly enjoyable, suspenseful, action packed, with excellent writing.
Suspense mounts constantly while brilliant prose seduces you into a state of wonder.
Enjoyed Anthony Doerr's descriptive writing style. Plan to read more of his writing.
Terrific in every way. A must read, the imagery is wonderful and the story touching.
I read the book and listened to the audio on whispersync. It was a great experience.
Loved it. A new twist in another story of the war. Can't wait to read his next book.

Enlightening and intriguing story about two children growing up during World War II.
A sensitive view of the people, both French and German, impacted by the Nazi regime.

Best book I've read this year! Imagery was just beautiful. Interesting perspective.
Excellent book that reels you into the war torn cities and lives of the characters.
I loved the authors writing style.  It was lyrical.  The violence was due to WW II.
Graphic violence because it is a World War story and violence is part of the story.

One of the best books I've read in a  very long time and Doerr writes like a dream!
This book was very well- written and draws you in. It is a bit of a downer, though.

We  read it just prior to a visit to St. Malo which turned out to be a great idea.

An excellent read. A beautifully written book. I think this will become a classic.
One of the best books I've read in a long time. Doerr deserved the Pulitzer Prize.
Sometimes there was too much detail which caused the story line to move roo slowly
Amazing book, I understand why Anthony Doerr won the Pulitzer Prize with this book
Connecting blindness to war is a relevant viewpoint.  In all cases, war is tragic.
Love the development of the characters and the descriptions of places and objects!

Beautiful story and beautifully written. I have recommended it to several people.
Wonderful book  was really sorry it was over. Plan on reading more by this author
At first I was a bit surprised at how very short the chapters were, but as I got into the book I forgot all about that. He packs so much into each chapter in few words, but those words tell everything. I learned about the siege of St. Malo in France during WWII and about the training of Hitler Youth, both scary things, but the main characters balance them with their humanity and will to live. I highly recommend this book.
Many characters, different time periods, made for a very different look at WWII.
Great read. Gripping character study. Fascinating story. Worthy of its Pulitzer.
I enjoyed it mainly because it was a child's view of what happened under Hitler.
Excellent, educational, well written, would recommend from teenage on to oldage.
I prefer true stories or fiction based on fact.  This was a perfect book for me.
This very beautifully written novel reveals, at least to me, a new aspect of WWII.
One of the best books I have ever read.  Very well written and hard to put down.
Great read - good plot and you want to know how all the characters finally meet.
Excellent story but I got a little lost at times with all of the back and forth.
Took a few chapters to understand the writing style, but really enjoyed the book
Intrigue, history, danger, emotion, and the innate goodness of the human spirit.
Every sentence is sensual. One of the most amazing, moving books I've ever read.
This is a must read book. Outstanding, beautiful writing and a compelling story.
So entwined with love.......intrigue.....patriots......could not put it in down.
Excellent interwoven plot, beautifully written.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
Couldn't put it down.  Took a day off work just to finish reading it.  LOved it.
Great story - really keeps your interest.  Well written with complex characters.
One woman living thoughtfully while coping with blindness during WWII in Europe.
Beautiful book. Great book for couples or womens' ok clubs. Beautifully written.
Well written. Captures the reader's attention immediately. Liked the characters.
Sentence structure often distrscting. Good premise but didn't hold my attention.
Sad reminder of a terrible time in history with beautiful stories weaved within.
A well written , insightful book allowing the reader new perspective on the war.
Pedestrian prose lacking dramaturgical arc.  I definitely did not see the light.
One of the most well written books that I have ever read. I recommend it highly!
A great book, I couldn't put it down.  Beautiful characters in a touching story.
An excellent literary work..  I like the author's style and use of the language.
Lyrical descriptions.  I actually felt blind when narration was by blind person.
Positively one of the most beautiful and heart-wrenching books I have ever read.
A little too sad for me.  I lived through WWII.  Brought back too many memories.
Great story. A different view of France and Germany during the war. Very moving.
Beautifully written story. The power of love has the power to change everything!
Best book I read this year, and I read a lot. The audible version is also great.
Swell written and moving story that lets you feel two sides of a time in history
Lovely historical fiction that involves you from page one! Couldn't put it down.
Beautifully written!! An 'insight' to all the facets of humanity during wartime.

absorbing and interesting.  An ending that is not predictable and is satisfying.
So well written.  Doesn't move in a predictable path and has a realistic ending.
This story was so amazing....I am STILL THINKING about it.  Must read my dears..
Beautifully written..  sad.I look forward to reading other books by Anthony Doer
THIS WAS MY FAVORITE BOOK OF THE SUMMER.....PICK IT UP TODAY,YOU WON'T BE SORRY!
I loved this book. It was not an easy subject, but the characters were riveting.
This is perhaps one of the best written books I have read, couldn't put it down.
Great listening.  The author writes colorful prose and the story is interesting.
From all the positive things I'd read about this novel I expected much more.  For the first 200 pages I felt like I was reading a YA novel, following two young people who were not very nuanced or complicated.  They never did develop, but the plot picked up and I was impressed by the author's vast knowledge of many areas of science.  Ultimately, the story wasn't very credible, but it was pleasant and a fast read.
Excellent look at what it might have been like to live during the time of WWII.
What can I say? It was an awesome story, and I am so glad I decided to read it!
Well worth the time to read.  Part mystical and "in your face" reality.
A beautiful written story of a of very tragic time of our lives..Just lovely...

Wonderfully written, constructed story that is realistic in plot , gratefully.
Beautifully crafted and written.  A thoughtful insight into the horror of war.
I really liked this book, I had a hard time putting it down, it was that good.
This is one of those rare books that are so well written that we do not want them to end.<br/>A sensitive portrayal of two engaging young people during the Second World War. So well<br/>researched and done that it is difficult to believe it is not true.  On the one hand a clear<br/>portrait of the Hitler Youth movement.  And on the other a sweet honest understanding<br/>of what it means to be blind.
This novel successfully employs the "jumping timeline" technique to build suspense.  Readers who don't have even a basic knowledge of the history of WW II might get confused by the jumping back and forth across the years,  but most will be able to follow the story.  A stark reminder that there was tragedy on all sides of this conflict.  Highly recommended for the WW II historical novel buffs.
Loved this book! Totally engaging picture of the characters and their worlds.
a spectacular book which stays with you long after the you read the last page
I could bot put this book down. It deserves every award it received and more.

Excellent. Wonderful writer, great story. Best book I've read in a long time.
A great read. Not a book I would normally choose but I am glad I did read it.
After reading such wonderful reviews, I was disappointed in this book.  I found it choppy, disjointed, and extremely depressing.  There seemed to be very little light in this book.  Chapters alternated between characters and time periods.  The characters lacked depth--they seemed more stereotypical than genuine.  That being said, the possible historical events in the background were interesting.
I've been reading books about World War II and this one sounded good and got a 5 star review. It was not my kind of book. It goes from past to present and I didn't feel like it flowed. The details were enjoyable at first and then they became tedious. I was disappointed with the end of the book. I kept waiting for the stories to come together and when they did I still didn't feel the connection.
Made the miles fly by on my trip. Best one I had listened to in a long time.
Good historical novel, I bit hard to follow, with some great human interest.
The best book I've read in a very long time. Doerr is a wonderful wordsmith.

Amazing storytelling.  This book is about a talisman, a diamond, a tiny model house, town, St. Malo, radio transmissions, shells, WW II, the liberation, waiting for the liberation, sighted and sightless children, starvation and the strength of the human spirit.

Excellent telling of an intriguing story with the most beautiful prose.
Wish I could write like Doerr.  A wonderful story, beautifully crafted.

You have to get through the 1st few chapters but then it is SO worth it
Fantastic story -- 500+ pages went by quickly -- thoroughly enjoyed it.

Beautiful prose, and a compelling story line.  I didn't want it to end.
I loved this book about a French blind girl and a brilliant german boy.
Different perspective of the war than what I have read in other novels.
It is so easy to get caught up in the lives of the individual characters that one forgets there will come a point when the stories will intertwine to create an unforgettably rich and complex tapestry.  The conclusion of the book left me in awe of the power of individuals to effect the lives of others, in small ways and large ways, for good and sometimes for evil.
I loved it, book and audio. Well deserving of the 2015 Pulitzer Prize!
Have been recommending this to all my book loving friends- I loved it.

Beautifully written!  Can't wait to read other books by Anthony Doerr.
Very well written.  Characters are well drawn and likable.  Good book!
Beautifully written. A bit of suspense and A very different WW2 story.
The story takes place in Germany and France during WWII. I had recently read The Welsh Girl by Peter Ho Davies and War Brides by Helen McBride so I was hesitant to pick yet another book about the war. I am so glad I did. The characters are so engaging and the imagery so vivid, I could not put the book down. Anything by Anthony Doerr is a must read for me now.
This is a review of the audio CD version of this poignant book: it deserves to be read by a mature voice, a skilled reader: someone far more mellifluous, subtle in inflection, and rich in timbre, than Zach Appelman, who sounds like a teenager trying to read Shakespeare. Great literature needs to be heard, and that means it needs to be read by great voices.
Wonderful prose. As soon as I finished it I started reading it again!
Love the writing style. Imaginative and insightful. Great characters!
Beautifully written, intriguing story of two young people in wartime.
It was memorable but a difficult read with the frequent time changes.
Very descriptive. Just enough twists and turns to keep you wondering.
Actually feel as if you the characters.  Outstanding use of language.

Enjoyed it a lot. Good vacation reading. Historical background WWII.
One of the best historical fiction books I have read in my lifetime.
captivating storyline, look forward to reading more by Anthony Doerr
I did not find it engaging. Therefore it took me a longtime to read.
The story felt flat to me. I wasn't vested in the characters at all.
A blind girl in Germany during world war 2 was my favorite character
Very good book and was a strong 5 until the end.  Ok end but to sad.
Kept echoing through the mind long after you had read the last page.
One of the best books I've read in a long time. Highly recommend it.

Fascinating story and beautiful prose.  May be my new favorite book.
The idea for the story was good but it just wasn't that interesting.

Best book I've read in some time (and I wasn't expecting that much).

Way too long.  Needed a better editor.  But it was an unusual story.

Very good book, and I am a literary snob when it comes to fiction:).
The best book that I have read in many years. I highly recommend it.

Well written and a touching and gripping story. A bit long at times.
Intelligent, thought-provoking. Lyrically written. Highly recommend.
Beautiful vivid language creates perfect pictures... Heartfelt story
Far and away one of the best books I have read recently, .I loved it
amazing book. i loved it so much i bought more copies for relatives!
I thought the book was beautifully written with descriptions that often took your,breath away.  I also thought that it often rambled on in many directions and became repetitious .  There were too many characters having too many lives and situations.  Warner's life,of technology and radios, were too,technical and also too repetitious.  I thought the book was longer than it should have been.  However, I enjoyed the parts of the story that were about Marie and her quests in a seeing world.<br/>  The storyline that dealt with the diamond I found unnecessary and sort of like a fairy take.  Maybe that is what it was intended to be.
Thoroughly enjoyed this story!
Very good.  I couldn't put the kindle down.
I recommend this wonderfully written novel for anyone who truly enjoys connecting with the main characters in a book. The author spins a story that captures your interest from the first chapter and takes you through a journey of WW2 that has never really been written about before. I definitely would put this book on my list of all time favourites.  I do for see it being optioned for a major motion picture sometime in the future.
Beautiful writing. Anthony Doerr is a poet. His words made me just stop tocatch my breath. The two main characters, Werner, the young German boy who with his younger sister grows up in the orphanage run by the French nun is a natural genius with electronics. The other character whose story parallels Werners, is Marie-Laure who is a French girl who has lost her sight. Her father, a single parent and museum employee, creates ingenious ways for her to navigate her world. Both Werner and Marie-Laure independently question and fear the growing menace of the Third Reich, Werner from within the system and Marie-Laure as a member of le' Resistance. Ultimately it is Werner's genius with radios that brings them together and serves as the bridge to their relationship. If you read the Book Thief you will love this book too.
Perfect. A visual delight. Brimming with Words that click and drip satisfyingly into the soul. Cannot help feeling despair that it is over.
This is the perfect book to read after the Goldfinch.  There is nothing pretentious about the prose, no lectures, no pedantic essays.<br/>A story well told, well paced and with an abundance of noble characters.  The author develops his characters so that they are believable and make the tale plausible.  I could not stop reading this book. It was a delight after the ponderous Goldfinch.
I am enthralled with this book at about the halfway point.  I have had to ration myself to keep from reading it too quickly and save it for airplane reading.<br/><br/>Best fiction that I have read in a long time.<br/><br/>It is like a hundred short stories cobbled together in to a multi-streamed novel.
Wonderfully written, reading it a second time.
It' been awhile since I found a book that I truly loved and wanted to recommend to all I know, one in which you feel complete empathy with the characters.<br/>This is a beautifully written engrossing story of ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances and how they traverse through the hardships and the heartbreak to survive - or not - the nightmare of WWII.<br/>I have always been fascinated, appalled, saddened and amazed with the individual stories of those who had their perfectly ordinary, sometimes ideallic, lives suddenly swept away, finding themselves in an unfamiliar, unimanagably hostile world.<br/>I found it difficult to put this book down - read it in record time despite not wanting the story to end.<br/><br/>I'll
I will have to read all of his other books! He writes: so beautifully! a fantastic story from World War II
the author wove a beautiful story using the English language as the threads to weave a memorial story of two young people and they views of the their worlds being changed forever during the war. the characters had depth and sensitivity beyond their years. the vivid descriptions were wonderful. Sometimes the author jumped around a bit, and you really had to focus to stay with time frames.<br/>All together a good story that will go on to become a very best seller. If you like history, Europe, poetry in motion, and want to feel what the people felt as their lives were torn apart during WW II, please read, and remember we must never, ever repeat this history again.....
This is a really well done historical novel. The writer was really creative in his presentation and kept you on pins and needles in some spots as he flipped the story back and then to the present. The characters were real and believable. I would recommend it.
I choose this book because I enjoy books about the 2nd world war.  Great reading and another "can't put the book down." I reccommend it to all that is into this subject.
Wonderful story that made me really feel with the characters. I recommend this book highly. I was sorry when I finished it.
I so loved this story ... I could feel myself within these characters as they were so vividly portrayed .. My heart residences within them.. I am so sad it is over and no longer within the pages of their life.
This is the most beautiful book I've read in a long time.  Well written with something for everyone  I would recommend it  to everyone. A gem.  I athink it will be a classic.
Very well told story of two young people, one a blind French girl and the other a smart German boy, whose lives connect briefly during World War  II.
I was unacquainted with the work of Anthony Doerr until this week, when I ordered a  Kindle of All  the Light We Cannot See: A Novel. I read the book cover to cover with very few and then only very short interruptions. I intend to read it a second time quite soon.Doerr has an impressive and beautiful skill in his use of language. I have traveled to locations in the book: St.Malo, Paris, and Berlin; his descriptions of these places as they were some 70 years ago vividly brings  them to life.  Doerr's depiction of characters in All  the Light We Cannot See: A Novel--a blind French girl, a bright German boy, and several others, not all of them as appealing as the young people, make this book one that is hard to put down.<br/>The reader cares about them well after the reading is completed. This is writing and reading from the heart; it is not so much a historical novel as it is  story taking place now in the reader's mind.
This book was recommended to me because I like history. This story took place during WWII. I could not put this book down for a minute. Several of my friends read it and all of them loved it.
great story and great writing. Amazingly accurate. It could have been a little shorter.Very sad story for both sides during the war.
Innocent children caught up in the horror of this War living their lives the best they could, running from the military destroying everything in its path, or as a part of the military, whatever country.  Achingly beautiful and intelligent.
Days after I have finished reading this book, the characters are still within me and I am still thinking about their lives they have lived. What an extraordinary book. Worth a second reading or more.
This book told of the suffering during WW 1. There is intrigue, a good story and romance.  I think it would make an excellent movie.
One of the beautifully written books I have ever read. Captivating.
Keeps your attention.  Good mix of history with a suspenseful plot.
Beautiful writing and compelling stories come together wonderfully!
This is certainly one of the best books that I have read this year.
One of the best written books I've ever read.  A must for everyone.

Best book I've read in I don't even remember!  Beautifully written.
Interesting story of individuals whose lives intersect due to WWII.
Very well written, kept your interest and the storyline was unique.
Not just the best book of 2014, maybe one of the best books ever.  It is one of the top five books I have ever read, that is for sure.  Amazing prose, incredible character development...this book had me thinking about a dozen issues at once.  Cannot praise it highly enough.  The premise was so imaginative, and the story extremely compelling.
WW II has so many tales to give and stories yet to be written but I liked this story for it's lead up to the end of the war and the unlikely communication between opposing young people.  Both sides are caught in something way beyond their understanding but must and do keep going, trying to find the "Light" even if it's hard to see.
Full disclosure: I received an advance copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an unbiased review.<br/><br/>I don't know why I waited so long to read Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See. I've loved his other books—in fact, his 2010 story collection, Memory Wall, was among the best books I read that year, so I know he's a tremendously talented writer.<br/><br/>Maybe I hesitated because the book has already begun showing up on a number of year-end "best" lists, and lately I've had a bit of a disconnect between those the critics label as best of the year and those of which I'm most enamored. Well, I needn't have worried, because Doerr's latest is as good, and beautifully written, as I hoped it might be.<br/><br/>In the early 1940s, the world is on the brink of war. Marie-Laure is a 12-year-old girl living in Paris with her father, a locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. Although Marie-Laure went blind at the age of six, she has a tremendous thirst for knowledge and a passion about the world around her, particularly the natural world. Ever-protective of his daughter, Marie-Laure's father built a model of their Paris neighborhood so she can navigate the streets and always find her way home.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a German mining town, young Werner Pfennig is growing up with his sister, Jutta, in an orphanage. When the two discover a radio, it opens up a world of dreams and information. Werner also discovers his ability to repair and build radios, as well as his ability to grasp complicated mathematical and scientific concepts. This intelligence catches the interest of a Nazi officer, who sees that Werner is enrolled in an elite Hitler Youth school, where the fervor for perfection and rooting out inferiority begins to turn him into a person he doesn't recognize.<br/><br/>As war closes in, Marie-Laure and her father flee Paris and head to the seaside town of Saint-Malo, where her eccentric great-uncle Etienne lives. Etienne has never been the same since the first World War, and he is unprepared for just how profoundly his life—and the lives of those around him—will be affected by Marie-Laure's presence, as well as the town's resistance to the Nazi occupation. And Werner finds himself on the front lines, as he is part of a team tracking down those using radios to subvert the Nazis.<br/><br/>Werner and Marie-Laure's lives will intersect in a profound way, both when they are at one of their weakest moments. And this encounter will have an indelible impact on the lives of many for years to come.<br/><br/>"To men like that, time was a surfeit, a barrel they watched slowly drain. When really, he thinks, it's a glowing puddle you carry in your hands; you should spend all your energy protecting it. Fighting for it. Working so hard not to spill one single drop."<br/><br/>This is an exquisite, wonderfully told story. The characters are tremendously vivid and came to life for me, and I found myself fully immersed in what was happening to them. Although the book unfolds slowly, I was never bored, and although I had some suspicions about how certain events would be resolved, I felt some suspense at what would happen. Doerr is truly so talented, and although the book's switching back forth between two points in time sometimes made me take a moment to re-orient myself to where I was in the plot, I enjoyed this book so, so much.<br/><br/>If you don't need a book to move at breakneck speed, but you want a story to savor, pick up All the Light We Cannot See. This is one of those books I could see as a fantastic movie as well, but the book is so worth reading.
I think so much of this hauntingly beautiful novel is summed up in the simple phrase that comes at the precise moment that the entire novel builds up to: "Es-tu là?"  Doerr's prose is beautiful and ephemeral, and all the more poignant given the dehumanizing brutality that occurs throughout the tale.  It's a little hard to talk about this book without giving some specifics, so I will give the standard "SPOILER ALERT" caveat.<br/><br/>There is so much that works about this story: it is beautifully told, the characters are fascinating and complex, and despite (or perhaps because of) the split-perspective narrative that shifts from time to time it is a very suspenseful work.  It is set during World War II, and in many ways it is an "anti-war" novel in the sense that it would be impossible to read this story and not feel the senseless waste of life and the loss of so many innocents and dreamers.  But in many ways the tale is an even more fundamental one: it is about embracing the beauty of the natural world, the tenuous but essential attempt to connect to other travelers in this journey through life, and the difficult attempt to do the right thing, even if it is not the popular thing.  I loved Marie-Laure, but in many ways it was Werner I connected with the most ... I kept asking myself what I would do in his (impossible) situation, and I could not help but feel (fear?) I would betray people as he does, for the reasons and rationalizations that he does, but perhaps find some measure of salvation and atonement at the end, in the defining moments of his life.<br/><br/>There are so many things I liked about this book that it seems a little unfair to mention the few, minor flaws.  For me, there were only a couple.  Personally, Von Rumple was too stereotypical as the "evil Nazi" (I couldn't help but think of the Nazis who get their faces melted off in Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is a fun movie but not exactly a rich character study) ... he felt like a bit of a walking metaphor for greed, violence, human desires, etc. who was only around to add tension to the plot (and serve as a counterpoint to the "good German" Werner).  He is, literally, a walking cancerous tumor.  If Von Rumple had been more nuanced, he might've been an interesting character, but in the end I think all readers will have the same "Thank goodness, it's about time!" reaction when he meets his end.  Also, I wished for just a little bit more in the last chapters set in more modern times ... they were all extremely emotional and poignant, but it just seems like the characters would've had more they would've wanted to ask or say to each other.  Finally, poor Werner seems like he deserved a slightly more noble exit from the tale.  But, these are all minor nit-picks ... but I had to get them out of my system!<br/><br/>As a final comment, I would recommend that all people who read this book also read Doerr's interview with Powell's Books (easy to find online).  I think it provides interesting insights into the motivations and back story behind this book, and also helps to explain the many strengths (and minor weaknesses) of this book.<br/><br/>At the time I write this review, it's only a few months after the book has been released and there are already 1500 reviews, 1200 5-star.  I think that tells you all you need to know.  An incredible book, and while this was my first experience with Doerr, it certainly will not be my last.
“New York Times bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II.”<br/><br/>The above description of Anthony Doerr’s All the Light We Cannot See caught my attention. I purchased the book. All is not as advertised.<br/><br/>True the book is about a blind French girl and a German boy/soldier. But their paths do not collide. They briefly touch in a tipping point and then deflect in separate ways and they meet different ends.<br/><br/>The book tells of the two who grow up in totally different environments—the girl a daughter of a lock maker for a Paris museum. The boy, an orphan in Alsace-Lorraine cared for (along with his younger sister) by a kind-hearted Catholic nun. Their stories are told separately. For long periods of time nothing much really happens. Warned by his sister that the Nazi movement is evil, he works for (has no choice) to work as a Hitler youth and later as a soldier for the corrupt Nazi state.<br/><br/>The girl just tries to survive after fleeing France with her father to stay in Brittany with her eccentric uncle. Her father returns to Paris and disappears to a “work” camp. Somehow he sends sappy letters to assure her that everything is all right. Unbelievable.<br/><br/>Doerr is a decorated writer who sometimes gets lazy. Often the action is told from the point of view of the two main characters. Once when the blind girl is shown a cellar hiding place by her uncle, she describes the round ring in the square trap door. But how can she know their shape when she can’t see them. Her uncle doesn’t tell her.<br/><br/>Doerr also has an annoying habit of doing a lot of faux philosophizing in his writing. Deadly to the reader. Yawn. This book could do with prudent editing. A hundred pages could be sliced easily with nothing lost and more plot movement gained. When the two protagonists finally meet, their time together is so brief, it hardly seems worth the effort.<br/><br/>Although the premise of the book is intriguing, it wasn’t worth the effort.
I am an avid reader, but this book is absolutely the best I have ever read!  I have never seen an author that could create the drama that this book holds.  Relunctanly, I gave the book to my German friend that was a child after WWII.  Although she was reminded of many painful memories, she nevertheless thought it was historically correct.
This is a remarkable novel. The prose is beautiful, and the two characters whose lives intersect near the end of the book are unforgettable. All the Light We Cannot See (to me, the title has multiple meanings) is one of those rare books that you regret coming to the end because the journey to get there is so enjoyable. Highly recommended!
loved it
Intriguing read. Not the run of the mill plot. Liked it very much.
A tragic story beautifully written.  I didn't want to put it down!
Well written & enjoyable, but sometimes it jumped around too much.
This is one of the most powerful books I have read in a long time.
Beautifully written! I'm searching out other books by this author.
a good but slow read due to propensity of author to over describe.
This book reads like a beautifully and intricately woven tapestry.
Absolutely the most beautiful and unique imagery. What a writer!!!
Best book I ve read in long time superb writing deserved pullitzer
Beautiful writing. One of the best books I've read in a long time.

I am not sure why this book is atop the NY TImes best seller list.

An almost unbelievable story, especially the "good" ending
Great book! Very descriptive. Now I want to plan a trip to France.
Very interesting tale about how lives were interwoven during WWII.
Such a beautiful and heart wrenching book! I couldn't put it down.
A book that leaves you sighing. Fantastic story and great writing.

I enjoy the book.  Two stories in one.  Not the ending I expected.
Excellent read. Well written with very good character development.
A good  look into the lives of the European civilians during WWII.
Great book--a little slow at the end but the story line was super.
loved the book,admired the charecters,writing was crisp and fresh.
Interesting story because of the points of view of the characters.
The most majestically crafted novel I've ever read.  Four weeks later and I'm still processing not only the storylines, symbolism, and realism of it all, but the *way* Doerr wrote it as well:  weaving between long lyrical prose and jagged, stilted writing that makes the trauma and tension of the moment palpable.
Brilliantly written, couldn't put the book down, full of suspense.
The prose is beautiful and the story telling is intense and human.
My wife read this book. Beautifully written.  Hated when finished!
Most beatiful, and disturbing, book I've read in a very long time.
A wonderful story that is beautifully written i enjoyed every page
Outstanding - lovely twists and turns. Enjoy the style of writing.
A very detailed account of life in Germny and France durring WWII,
Fine writing. Believable characters. Resolution of moral dilemmas.
A fantastic story.  It was difficult to put down once you started.
I loved this book! it took me in and I sailed away with the story.
A little slow, but also very realistic... not a romanticized tale.
One of the best I have read in many years--was sorry to see it end
Great book.  Humanized both sides of the war in a very unique way.
Riveting, excellent read based on real life in historical setting.
I couldn't put this book down.  It is a beautifully written story.
Incredible.  Definitely on my list of 'one of the memorable books'
Very interesting book written from a new perspective.  I loved it!
Exceptional writing. Sad but inspiring story and beautiful detail.
Great book, kept going from chapter to chapter.  Hard to put down.
Interesting writing style that intertwined two central characters.
Amazing book!!!  Can't wait to read more books by the same author!

Very well written, and excellent job of developing the characters.
A wonderful perspective of a historically intense time. Well done.
Very gifted writer. Loved the story even with all the heartbreaks.
very realistic well written book.  It kept my interest throughout.
Great story on a different previously untouched aspect of the war.
Great book, a little slow in a couple places but a very good read.
Gripping story.  Beautifully written.  Absolutely loved this book.
Moving story, well told. It opened a window on the horrors of war.
Without question the most significant novel I have read this year.
Amazing and tragic tale. Beautifully written and utterly engaging.
I was engrossed in this book from the beginning. Very well written
The author weaves a marvelous story, beautifully written, lyrical.
Did not like the book.  Very slow moving.
If you think you've read it all about World War II, this magnificent novel will change your mind.  Seldom have I encountered any writing that gets so far under one's skin.  You will live each of the several utterly compelling characters.  The story will break your heart many times, but you'll be renewed by it as well.  Not to be missed.
A great historical novel. The best I've read so far this year. Marvelous story, well told. Fascinating characters. You get caught up in the lives of a young German boy and a blind French girl as they are affected by World War II. You just know their lives must cross before the book is over and you can hardly wait for that.  Very moving.
Excellent book!  WWII story told from the perspective of two sensitive children; one blind girl in occupied France, one bright German boy who ends up in the German army as part of a team searching for hidden radio transmitters in occupied territories.  One of those books you stay up late reading because you don't want to put it down!
The Goldfinch seems to be the hot book these days, but I enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See three times as much. Really enjoyed learning about the use of radios in France during the war, and the development of the radio frequency and location finders by the Germans. Just a great book. I am already pushing it on my Goodreads friends.
Anthony Doerr expertly crafts a story around a blind, French girl and an intelligent, scientifically-minded German boy during WWII. What he's done is write a book so sad and sweet and beautiful that somehow I wanted the book to go on and on.  What a gem, this book! I will tell all of my friends this is a "must read!" Don't miss out.
Imagine descriptive language allowing the reader to "see" through the eyes of a blind girl. Meet characters you would like to know and hate to leave.  Enter times and places so convincingly you feel you were there.  Experience the pleasure of a book you can joyfully recommend to friends.  That is All the Light We Cannot See.
Whopping story. Great characters.<br/>Wow it all comes together.
Suspenseful,,we'll written, interesting well developed characters
One of the best, most lyrically written stories I have ever read.
This book  was  good, but not what my friends were raving about .

A story for the ages. Should be required reading for high school.
Fascinating,elegantly conceived and written, first class fiction.
It's a Pulitzer Prize winning novel!  Need anything else be said?
Excellent perspective of wwii from the perspecfitve of teh people
WONDERFUL story & writing.  One of my favorite reads this summer.
A warm insight into the lives of civilians on both sides of WWII.
Amazing book.  I still find myself thinking about it weeks later.

fiction brain food.  thoughtful, suspenseful, and darkly hopeful.
This book was so beautifully written.  It was a pleasure to read!

Excellent story with a surprise ending.  New WWII insight for me.
My book club really enjoyed it and we had some great discussions.
Good, but fairly dark. Not exactly enjoyable, but I kept reading!
Beautiful book...very moving and full of fascinating information.
Very engrossing story of two people thrust into two sides of war.
Maybe my expectations were too high. It just didn't do it for me.
I couldn't put it down!<br/>Outstanding<br/>Hated to see it end
Exceptional writing, beautiful story! Anthony Doerr is brilliant.
Wonderful story. Beautifully written. Deserved the Pulitzer Prize
Another look at how WWII affected the lives of ordinary citizens.

Gripping story that holds your attention, interesting characters.
A very interesting story. It was difficult to put this book down.

a very original book that is interesting and holds your attention
Wonderful play of  light and dark, literally and  metaphorically.
Wonderfully haunting. Will keep you thinking about it days later!
Engaging novel with interesting characters and good story pacing.
This book just doe snto work. It is full of cliches and the stories of the two main characters do not affect each other soon enough. the intertext with Jules Verne is not obvious enough, at least for someone who has not read 20,000 leagues in 50 years. The books seems to be a marketing phenom rather than a work of literary fiction.
Beautiful story, rich use of words.  A WWII novel with a very different cast of characters and how the Third Reich's reign of terror and how the use of electronics to draw people together affected their lives before, during and after the war.  Shrouded in darkness, Anthony Doerr showcases the power of touch, taste, smell and sound.
Best book I've read in years--- a synthesis of Abraham Veghese and Willa Cather.  Brilliant! Well researched, perfectly crafted (thank you for taking the 10 years) and absolutely engaging.<br/>Couldn't put it down, yet never wanted it to end.  A book which rewards readers with characters to love and a deep hope for who we can be.
I've read so many novels about WW2...haven't we all?...that I vowed a moratorium.  I'm glad I didn't.  This is one of the best war novels I've ever read.  Doerr writes so beautifully and yet hits you in the solar plexxus when writing about the horrors of war.  He doesn't hit you over the head, merely suggests, and that's enough.
Beautifully written.  One of the best books of the year, by far.
Great story. Was recommended by a relative and I'm glad she did.
One of the few books I couldn't put down and finished in 2 days.
I'm recommending All the Light We Cannot See to everyone I know.
An interesting weaving together of history, characters and plot.
Great book had trouble putting it down.  Great characterization.
It was a wonderfully written novel.  I saw another view of WWII.
Best book I have read his year!  Beautiful, intelligent writing!

its okay, not especially rich, deep or poetic writing, just okay
I loved this book.  I can see myself reading it again and again.
Disappointing read. I was expecting a lot more. I found it dull.
Incredible imagery and an amazing story of courage and survival.
I so enjoyed every page.  This book is delightful entertainment.
Great story and writing.  Loved it but it was sad in the ending.
Beautifully written! It was a joy to read from beginning to end.
A slow start with a good ending  historical facts were very good
Beautifully written. It was pure pleasure to read Doerr's prose.
Very interesting. You can't stop reading the reality of the war.
Amazing story. One of the best books I have read in a long time.
Perhaps the best book I've ever read. Beautifully written. Deep.
My only complaint was the epilogues.  I wish I hadn't read them.
Utterly beautiful telling of this tale. What a pleasurable read!
Wonderful book, beautifully written. Would definitely recommend.
Made me feel as if I was there, in Germany, in the midst of war.
One of the best book I've ever read. Felt I was there with them.

A very well-written and touching story. I highly recommend it!!!
If you stick with it, it gets more interesting as it goes along.
Enjoyed the plot and how the lives of the characters intertwined
Couldn't put it down. Fascinating charactors,very well developed
Even though I gave it four stars, I think it's a very good read.
Enjoyed every minute of the book. Reminded me of Suite Francais.
Was a long red but loved the characters and their determination.
Excellent read. I couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end
Wonderful story; different from most of this genre. Page turner.
good book but thought the last chapters was not very interesting
I absolutely loved this book and have recommended it to everyone
Excellent 'visuals" about finding one's way around if blind.
One of the most inspiring books I have read in the recent years.
Beautifully written in prose you just don't see much of anymore.
The way the author intertwines the different stories is amazing.
Amazing rersearch, insight, the reality and consequences of war.
A well written novel about WWll during the occupation in France.
Excellent writing, thought provoking plot. Enjoyed it very much.
It was better than I expected. I had a hard time putting it down

a magnificent and well researched and unique story of survival !
Enjoyed every minute, well written and plot was fun and exciting
A page turner! It's a book that tapped the range of my emotions.
Loved it; terrific imagery and character development.  Loved it.
A very satisfying read.  The descriptive language was wonderful.
So enjoyed this book!! Just a great story!! Highly recommend it.
His writing, especially use of metaphors, is masterful, magical.
I enjoyed this book for telling it as it actually is in wartime.
This is a wonderful book. It is set in WW2 but from the view of characters I have not seen explored. The young boy is sucked into the Hitler Youth and the girl is in France and has become blind. The setting, the characters and the story are all written of in vivid prose. I am recommending it to anyone who enjoys a good book.
I am without words having just finished this book. This is a novel that will stay with me a very long time. I've read many books about the time around WWII but this is like none of the others. As I said I'm not even sure how to put into words what I'm feeling right now but I will leave a review when I can put it into words.
I could not continue with this book.  Every little detail was so descriptive.  The story is about a blind girl experiencing the ravages of WWII in France, but even a blind person couldn't be as descriptive as this account.  I found it terribly boring.  I followed up with "The Nightingale" which I thought was great!
This is the rare book that makes the reader feel as if they're peeling away the layers of an onion as they read to get to the story's heart and it is every bit as satisfying as hoped for. The switches back and forth in time are a bit disconcerting at first, but by the end it is as if the story has taken on its own rhythm.
A rare 5 stars from me.  All the accolades are true - this is an amazing, beautifully written story that I just didn't want to end.  When I finally finished it last night I was tempted to pick it up and start all over again. Unique story, fleshed out characters, incredible descriptive text.  I can't recommend this enough.
Best of the year.  You probably would also like The Nightengale
I couldn't wait to just read the next page.  I loved the ending
One of the very best novels I have ever read, and I read a lot.
Very enjoyable. However, the ending was stretched out too long.
Very descriptive regarding trials and tribulations during WWII.
A must read. Really enjoyed the historical aspect of the story.
Once you under stood who the characters are it was fun to read.
Well written, thought provoking which will effect every reader.
Incredibly well written and a great story to follow along with.
fantastic book great story A quick read and really pulls you in
A good read that stays with you some time after it is finished.
Enjoyed this book so much.  I felt I was there the entire time.

Difficult to read. Glad when it was over, but it was wonderful.
Best book I have read in recent times I did not want it to end.
Very well thought out and the writing was excellent!  Loved it!
A little slow going at first, but then the book swept me away.
Magical, with lyrical descriptions and well written characters.
This is well worth reading. But I didn't much like the wrap-up.
An outstanding saga with historic insights and rich characters.
Beautifully written book. Very enjoyable from beginning to end.
Excellent read!! Well written and compelling. Highly recommend!
Too much is used to develop the two main subjects. Slow moving.
Hard to get into but if you stay with it, it's a very good read
Loved Anthony Doerr's turn of the word and the story line was superb!
One of the best Putlizer Prize winners in a long time!<br/>WGW

Master storyteller. Gripping plot. Must read. Book of the year.
Loved the detail and how beautifully it paralleled with history
Great read!!! Disturbing. But great story. beautifully written!
Took a while to get into, but could not put it down at the end.
Best novel I've read in a while.  I was disappointed to finish.
This is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. The story captured me in the first few pages and its many threads never let go.  Some passages I had to read more than once, to savor them completely.<br/><br/>A short review, I know, but just read it. I really cannot recommend this book highly enough.
It has been years since I have read such a wonderfully written story.  Doerr's style is uniquely beautiful.  I am so looking forward to reading more Doerr.  Reading this book has been a stiring event for my old soul.  I can say nothing more than "read it to regain your belief that there are still great American writers."
This book is so beautifully written and has such a compelling story, it is hard to put it down.  It takes place at the end of WWll with fictional characters against the backdrop of a real place and about actual things that happened. It is one of those books that the characters will stay with you forever.  Amazing novel.
Very well written! Interesting theme! I thoroughly enjoyed it!
Really enjoyed this book. The writing style was very creative.
This is a must read.  Very well written and full of surprises.
Such a moving and gripping story.  I loved every minute of it.

Not as powerful as I had anticipated, but still a sweet story.
Outstanding book that provided great discussions at Book Club.
Lovely read. Satisfying, romantic, both hopeful and realistic.
Good story with historical perspective. Interesting characters
Too dark. If one is already anti-war, save yourself the agony.
Enjoyed, but a little wordy and clould be a 100 pages shorter.
A very touching story about the young people surviving the war
a very well thought out book giving alot of important details.
I am immediately rereading this book because it was wonderful!
It was very interesting with suspense but it rattled on a bit.
Very enlightening story told from many different perspectives.

A different perspective on WW2. Children learn what they live.
Brilliant, moving, parallels my father's story in World War II
predictable with twists interesting history lesson of WWII era
It was difficult to get into----later didn't wast to put down.
Absorbing and engaging!  A fascinating story. Hard to put down
Each chapter brings a new discover of the characters involved.

Exquisitely written, this story will leave you wanting more...
Interesting reading from historical perspective.  Moves along.
A well-reviewed book by a great writer at the top of his game.
Great WWII book.  Well developed characters.  Great storyline.
This is one to savor.  So well written and a pleasure to read.
A touch slow at times, but a good read about a difficult time.
Incredible story.  Important, interesting, poignant, riveting.
Great visual read. A completely different perspective of life.
Such a perfect novel, and such a new story about World War II.
This is a book you don't want to end. No sugar coated endings.
Once you get involved with the story it's hard to put it down.
Good story, a little predictable but pretty powerful in spots.
I loved it .Very well written. At times  a little to detailed.
I enjoyed it. I was not moved by the story, but it was nice...
Truly brilliant and captivating.  Exceptionally well written.  Doerr allows the reader to experience with the blind girl her emotions and discoveries about herself.  Very difficult to put down.
Post modern literature style means -- non sequential, verbose and unfulfilling. The jumping around from character to character, back and forth in time is a gimmick. It makes the story "seem" more meaty. But there is not much here. The book is quasi lyrical but the chip-chop of the narrative detracts from whatever is there. Extraneous characters, scenes, and thematic initiatives just cloud the book and I guess to some, make them feel intellectual.<br/><br/>This book took 500 pages to say what could be said in 150 pages with the same amount of lyricism. The book was recoommended to me, that's why I read it, but I felt cheated. So take my recommend, and try to read a few chapters before committing the effort required to wade through a 150 page novel spread out over 500 pages.<br/><br/>My instinct is that the people who read this book want to flatter themselves with thir sophistication, and tell others about how great this book is, hence the 5 stars some give..
The beautifully written book that appealed to all the senses!
Wonderful book, complex yet thoroughly engrossing storylines.
Amazing beautiful prose.  Hate the ending but loved the book.

Fantastic book especially if you like WWII historical novels.
I have enjoyed reading it very much but I'm not finished yet.
Unfortunately this book was not what I had hoped for.  I was extremely disappointed considering how wonderful prior published reviews were.  It took me far longer than normal to complete the book.  I so wanted to love this book but it took getting through 3/4 of the book before my interest was truly peaked.
This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time!<br/>Beautifully written!  It was so good I couldn't put it down; but I also didn't want it to end!<br/>A perfect summer read!

Very interesting story especially if you like WW 2 settings.
I loved it.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.
Beautifully written about the best and the worst of humanity
While a WWII novel, more than just a typical Holocaust book.
wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down until the last page.
An excellent literary novel.  If only we had more like this.
This is a moving story of WWII through the eyes of children.
Words just flowed and you felt like you were actually there.
Wonderful story....great writer....felt like you were there.
I couldn't put it down! Beautifully written, touching story.
Excellent story. Well written. Disappointed with the ending.
A beautifully written book. The main<br/>characters are well developed and will steal your heart.
The book is fine, but I cant say I am enthused. The characters had no arc and the author's treatment of his characters was somewhat distant and uninvolved. In the end, I just did not connect to the characters, and the overall message of destiny and life choices seemed unresolved and not well thought out.
Kinda sorry I spent 14.00 on this. It just didn't fulfill my reading needs. I think that it could be an amazing book for certain readers, but not to me. Personally, I found it poetic to a fault. It could have been lovely, but I just wasn't interested enough in the characters to care much about the plot.
The best book I have read all year. Anthony Doerr has managed to make WWII a fresh topic by weaving the story of a young blind woman with that of her locksmith father, reclusive uncle and a German soldier in love with gagetry into a powerful narrative about the triumph of curiosity over greed and power.
What a wonderful book!  All the Light We Cannot See is a haunting tale that transports the reader to a period of human horror while intimately exposing the lives of extraordinary characters. This is a book that will stay with the reader long after the last page.  You won't be able to put this book down.
well written.  i don't want to read any more books about the Hitler era.  The characters were wonderful.  It was a page turner all right!  The reason i read it was that  it was the choice for my book club last month.  The others in my group agreed with me.  I guess we hat being reminded  of that time.
Engaging historical fiction. Eloquently and intelligently written. Gave a thoughtful and subtle impression of the time period.  Did not fall into cliches and stereotypes. Doerr managed to create an intimate and complex web of characters, each of whom was human and real. I didn't want the novel to end.
I have had enough darkness, anger, hate and evil in my life and don't care to read about it.<br/>I have a blind grandchild, and this book did not give me any hope for his life, either.
Anthony writes with beautiful descriptive language.  One cannot skip over any lines.  His novel made  me think of all those living through the war and then trying to live afterwards in the remains.  It must have been just as bad for the innocent German people to handle their country's negative press.
One of my top 10 books. Well written. Don't miss this book!

T his years top read. We'll written, compelling story line.
This is a very well written book.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
The title gives the metaphor.  A blind girl sees the light.
Beautiful and well written, took too long to pull it together for me.  I found myself looking for the light at the end of the book.
Sorry to see it end.  So many facets and characters.  Another slant to WW2 France.<br/>Our book club of 8 voted it the highest score we've had in seven years since we<br/>started.  You will. expand your knowledge of the Nazi occupation and the resilience<br/>of the people caught in the conflict.
Werner is a young boy growing up in a German orphanage,<br/><br/>with his beloved younger sister Jutta and only Frau Elena to care for them. They live in a small mining town that is grim and dark leaving children little room to hope and no place for dreams. Werna and Jutta obsess themselves in the world of radios and transmissions. Jutta listening to the world she cannot reach but intuitively understands and Werner with his innate ability to dismantle, fix and build electronics. Marie-Laure is a bright beautiful young lady in France, she is blind and attuned to all the smells and sounds the world has to offer. Her father, a locksmith at the National Museum in Paris and her Great Uncle Etienne, a brilliant man who suffers from agoraphobia, feed Marie-Laure's love of science, of stories and the world outside their small protective apartment. A boy and a girl. So different, yet the same, leading two very separate lives that ultimately join together through the pain and suffering of loneliness, wanting, and the evil destruction of everything beautiful when it comes to war. This magnificent set of characters takes the reader away to another time and another place. Deep within their hearts and minds Anthony Doerr weaves together a magical story of all the little pieces that makes us human. Reminding me of The Book Thief, this easy to read, somewhat lengthy novel will be with me for a long time. Highly recommend. DO NOT MISS this great summer read!!All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel

What a wonderful story! So many different levels of sight.
Excellent story. So well told, It was like reading poetry.
A very moving work.  A book that is impossible to put down
I refrain from being critical of what ever an author writes. Even if I could, I would be at a loss to find anything here.  It's so good.  I fell in love with each character, even the stinkers!  I do hope no one is planning to make a movie from the contents of this book.  It would be a tragedy.
For me, the book was way too descriptive. So much detail and not enough storyline. While some enjoy this, I prefer a story that keeps me wanting to turn the next page. This book is not so. I kept wishing it would just get to the point without all the reflective thinking and fancy metaphors.
Amazing story. Didn't want to put it down the whole time.
I really enjoyed this book. Not typical for a WWII story.
Very nice read. A bit more fiction than history. Loved it
Long, but so well written, I finished before I wanted to.

Nice reading, sad as war time is, still a very nice story
It was an excellent book would recommend it to every one.
A wonderful book.  I will read more books by this author.
It was a good book.  I enjoyed the story line.  It would not be one of my favorite books.  What I didn't like about the book was the way the author kept bouncing back and forth.  I realize that he needed to keep the book going between the two main characters but it was a little too much.
This is a wonderful book. A sensitive German orphan boy, a beautiful blind French girl, a diamond with a mysterious curse and World War II; what more could reader ask for. The book is sad but not in an upsetting way. Rather it is a kind and insightful reflection on the human condition.
Eleanor Gaffney<br/>This exquisite novel burrows into the tiniest spaces and stares directly at our biggest questions. Yes, it is a book about war but it is more a book about seeing and hearing and connecting. Read it. It will not disappoint. You will remember these characters always.
The book was written extremely well.  I loved the way the author used each chapter to tell the story from two different characters point of view. I loved that the ending brought closure to the story.  The characters really got under my skin and when the book finished I wished for more.
seems to be a lot of embellishment of the story....  The author provides a very graphic picture of the situation.  I feel he dwells too much in the details...  ie the travel in cities... that takes you away from the story.  In other words I guess I wish it moved a little more quickly.
Very interesting and insightful book, well worth reading
Beautifully, tenderly written.  A story without victims.
A beautiful story during a difficult time in this world.
Very interesting insight into what life was during WWII.
Started slow, but evolved to a very well balanced story.
<br/>
Long book but worth it. Really care about the characters
It was an interesting view of WWII from children's eyes.
Enjoyed it. Long book and the ending wasn't what I hoped
Very suspenseful.  Hard to put down.  Excellent writing.
Never got into the flow of the book. Felt choppy & long.
Great story. I followed with the Nightingale. Also good.
Enjoyed it very much -though it dragged a bit at the end
sensitive, beautifully written.  enjoyed start to finish
A beautiful story,well written, thank you Anthony Doerr.

Absolutely stunningly beautiful. Read it more than once.
It was a good story and well written.  Good for any age.
This is one of the best books I have read in many years.
Very well written, a book that is difficult to put down.
A book that will stay with you long after the last page.
1 star is 4 too many for this book.  As other people have mentioned, I don't understand how a book that TAKES PLACE IN EUROPE DURING WWII has nothing actually happen.  I was over halfway through the book when I finally abandoned it, and the two main characters hadn't even met yet.
Such an entrancing tale of the venerability we allow ourselves to survive & how ultimately good does overcome evil!  I was addicted to reading this beautifully written tale of two young lives but found myself slowing down towards the end because I did not want to leave the story!!
I put off reading this book even though it got good reviews and when I finally decided to read it I was completely captivated by the beauty of the prose and the bravery of the main character. This would definitely rank as one of the best novels I have read . I give it 10 stars!
Very well written. Great background account of the war.
A really interesting perspective of the impacts of wwll
This was hard to get into, but it was worth the effort.

BEST BOOK of the Year! Hands down - loved this so much.
Beautiful writer, great book!  I love, love loved it!!!
Yet another perspective on WWII.  The story of the two children as they come to "see" the truth about the war is utterly compelling.  The book is also a window into the resistance, and another way to look inside and consider what one person can do to make a difference.
A magnificent tribute to the power of the human soul awash in a sea of war.<br/>Sensational. Awe inspiring.<br/>"All the light we cannot see" reminds us all of the myriad of beauty in all of our lives, our "light", that we have not opened our eyes to see yet.
I got this book as a birthday gift from my "bookie" friend, because she knows I like historical fiction related to WWII. I also travel to Normandy and Brittany and am familiar with the area. Both my husband and I read it in just a few days. Exceptional book. Loved it.
An engaging story of love of country, family and self.
great book! bookclub read, recently won pulitzer prize

I loved the book, want to recommend it to my bookclub.
Very beautiful story well written.  Enjoyed thoroughly
As Hemingway said, "If I had more time, I would have written a shorter book."  Mr. Doerr should have taken more time and written a MUCH shorter book.  What a waste of my time!  Painfully boring!
This is a beautifully crafted novel about courage, love and destiny and most of all, what it means to be human in the least humane of times.  It is all of World War II told through three people who are simply trying to find their way in the world.  Highly recommended.
Great piece of historical fiction-really well written

Amazing, beautiful language, a well thought out read.
A thoughtful, beautiful, determined book. I loved it.
I was really excited to read this book. The author is from my hometown, and I am a WWII junkie so I was expecting to love it. I didn't. It took me a month to read it (I honestly can't remember the last time it took me a month to read a book). I honestly didn't care about what would happen next. when I saw how short the chapters were I thought I'd be in trouble "I'll just read one more before I go to bed," but I had no problem putting it down because I just didn't care.
Subtle beginning...I had to trust and hang in while everything was set up for the remainder of the story's unfolding.  So glad I stayed with it....very compelling and characters magnificently crafted.  Achingly beautiful and wisdom laced prose.  Highly recommend
What all is there we do not see - well written novel
Excellent book.  I loved all the descriptive detail.
This was probably the best book I've read this year.

Wonderfully written perceptive and engrossing novel!
Fascinating characters. Certainly held my attention.
Beautifully and lyrically written.  Wonderful story.
Each chapter is a poem unto itself ... simply lovely
Wonderful, very well written, what a beautiful book.
Wow, a beautiful book.  He wove the story by alternating between a few characters and skipping ahead in time to give you snippets of the future and then back to the present - this amplified the desire to know what happened to everyone as the narrative unfolded.
A stunning, absorbing story as Doerr takes us to Paris and the coast of France during the last days of WW II with endearing characters and not all ends tied up neatly. This is a page turner; I meant to savor it over a few weeks but gobbled it up over a weekend.
A very moving story about a blind girl and life in Germany leading up to WWII . The author was actually able to make you feel the terror going on in some portions of the book. A very keen insight into a small town in France and how it was affected by the war.
In alternating narratives, a young German boy learns what war is while a young French girl - blind - learns what survival is in occupied France.  Ultimately, they come together as human beings for a time...and we learn, in poetic language, that life goes on.
Excellent book if you can handle the painful story.
Well developed plots written in captivating fashion
Excellent read. Well crafted. Couldn't put it down.
Beautifully written, mesmerizing tale.  I loved it.

Wonederful, inspirational story. Keeps you engaged.
Great book. Intriguing characters .Good story line.
It was a bit slow and although I liked the characters I felt the going back & forth was a bit much. It was about 3/4 into the book that it became more enjoyable. It was a book club read so I finished it. Had it not been I probably would not have finished.
Gorgeous, brilliant, extraordinary, compelling; there aren't enough superlatives to describe this book. Ingenious, too.  A perfect puzzle of a tale, every single detail necessary and true, revealed with restraint and intelligence. This is a fabulous book.
Really a great read.  Kept my interest throughout.
It kept my interest and I wanted it to keep going.

An absolutely brilliant book. Beautifully written.
Really enjoyed it and found it to be a page turner
excellent read !! I was engrossed the entire book.
It is an unusual perspective on WWII.  I liked it.
Loved the book, will add it to our book club list.
An amazing book should win the Pulitzer prize.  So well sequenced bringing the reader into the lives of the two main characters.  It also assisted me in the elements of World War 2. Which I had never before shown an interest in.  Loved it. Loved it.
Wonderful book!  Ou book club selected it for our July read.. We will meet to discus it this month.  Having lived in Israel for 9 years, I found these characters so believable add well as the circumstances for so many who endured that wretched war.
A truly moving tale that combines the grace and sensitivity of a poet with the narrative drive of a master storyteller.<br/><br/>If you can, set aside some sizable portions of time for this gem. Once you dive in, you won't readily come out again.
Tender story about a blind french girl and a sensitive Nazi . . . OK, you have to be able to get over the idea of a sensitive German boy in the army, but if you can, this is a beautifully written story, made me want to read the author's other work.
A good beach book---too wordy and verbose and Doerr is not as good a writer as Donna Tartt.  Interesting dual stories of the young German soldier and the French blind girl, but unless you're into ham radios or sea shells, way too much description!
One of the most finely written books about WWII that I have read.  It is told from such personal viewpoints that I couldn't help but identify with and admire the two main characters.  The ending did not satisfy me, but it was realistically told.
Worth the money for sure.  I read it on my way to France, having been to Germany, and loved dwelling in the historical references.  A page-turner.  This and The Nazi Officer's Wife (non-fiction) were my 2 favorite reads about Europe during WWII.
This is a very special book - one to be savoured.
Incredible book. Beautifully written. A must read
I found that I did not want to put the book down.
One of the best books that I have read this year.
Intriguing story - beautifully written - engaging
Amazing!  I cannot stop thinking about this book!

I so enjoyed this book, I did not want it to end.
The most beautifully written book I've ever read!

Fully deserving of the Pulitzer that it received.
It was a great read and could hardly put it down.
It was an interesting take on the events of WW!!.
a well written, insightful,  heart breaking story
one of better books i wvwer rwad. cover to cover.

Deeply developed characters to fall in love with.
All 8 members of book club liked this book a lot.
A truly beautiful book.  What a pleasure to read.
ONE OF THE FINEST NOVELS TO BE PUBLISHED IN YEARS
The last few chapters should have been elimedated
lots of words of onomatopoeia, vivid and concise
A predictably wonderful book.  A real good read.
Book was pretty good but not one of my favorites
Amazing read! I would recommend it to everyone!!
Riveting page turner with another facet of WWII.
Amazing stories intertwined in a masterful way!!

Beautiful riding and interweaving of storylines.
This is a very well written and interesting book
Great story, but didn't care for the ending.....
Good story, but I thought the ending was abrupt.
Too long. Too bogged down in unnecessary detail.
An outstanding read.  Well and cleverly written.

One of the best books I've read.  Great writing.
One if the best books I have read in a long time
Wonderful characters, the ending was surprising.
Really enjoyed this book. Good historical novel.
Tried several times to get into this book, but just never made it. I must have missed something as it came highly recommended from a friend!
The author was very clever in writing about two characters in tandem and then bringing them together in the end.  Rarely in a story does the main character die.  I felt the story was too lengthy and at some times it was too repetitious.
This amazing page turner opens a window on the fictional lives of a young blind French girl and a young orphan German boy caught in the throes of WWII. The cost of war is dramatically personalized.in these intelligent, promising lives.
Wonderful book.  Characters are so real and really struggle with what is right and wrong and the moral consequences of war.  A lot of info about the war.  Had trouble with the phrases in French and German wish they had been translated.
I absolutely love this book. Super recommended.
Descriptive narrative overdone loses story line
Beautiful story. Left me with tears in my eyes!
At time was confusing to follow the characters.
Beautifully written!  This book is a must read!
Amazing detail and emotional tension. Too long!
Beautifully written. I love the short chapters.
I read this for a local book club and loved it!
Have not read yet. Expect it will be very good.
Truly remarkable book! Best I've read in YEARS!
Great read, finished reading within a few days.
AN EXTREMELY WELL WRITTEN AND ENTERTAINING BOOK
Good...a bit long but not amazing as I expected
Very good. Michael Douglas did an excellent job
One of the best books I've read in a long time.
Wonderful writing, wonderful story! I loved it.
if you loved the book thief this is a must read
Hated ending. Killing off the boy in one sentence then tried to justified the ending in an epilogue is just not as thoughtful as the rest of the story. Loved the chapters swithing back and forth to characters kept up the intensity.
Although the book was well written, and researched, I found it to be a little too repetitious and boring. The premise was clever and the style ingenious, but it was about 75 pages over long.and it all I feel the book is over rated.
This novel is crafted with as much precision as the model houses described in the story. I couldn't stop reading, and yet felt a longing to stay connected to theses characters when I finally reached the end. This is a work of art.
Anthony Doerr never fails to deliver and once again he achieved the praise he so richly deserves. The horrors of war are very graphic. It is a great story and the research he must have done is unbelievable. very much recommended.
If you want to read a nice story about WW II this is a good book for you. It is a heartwarming tale with a disappointing ending. I read the wonderful reviews before buying the book but found it to be just interesting enough to read.....certainly not in my top 100. If you are interested in the effects of WWII on individuals as opposed to world events this story will be of great interest to you.
So incredibly well written. A beautiful story.
Wonderful story from start to finish. Love it!
A good read.  But as usual. a race to the end.
The short chapters made it eminently readable.
Amazing - I learned alot about the war/France.
Amazing read. Best book I have read this year.

Excellent read. I loved the setting and story!
This book was riveting. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Writing that will bring you to your knees, a story within the old story of people who can survive horrors and still find the goodness we all possess. War, desperation, passion, devotion, beauty intermingle. Such a haunting tale.
Before reading this book, Pat Conroy's "The Prince of Tides" was my favorite. Although the "Prince of Tides" has more of a plot, "All the Light We Cannot See" is written much more beautifully.  If you like books with a constantly moving plot, then you might find this book's slowly evolving plot  somewhat tedious. Be patient. Doerr does a great job in bringing everything together at the end. If, on the other hand, you love lyrical writing that paints pictures in your brain, then you will love this book.  Conroy needs a paragraph to paint a mental picture. Doerr needs only a single sentence. In this connection, I never understood how Ernest Hemingway's spartan writing style earned him international acclaim for generations of time. Hemingway and Doerr share using short versus more complex sentence structures. However, in my opinion, Doerr's writing makes Hemingway's look pale in comparison.  This book deserves a Pultizer Prize.  It probably will not receive one because the Pultizer committee prefers obtuse books like "A Visit From the Goon Squad:...a totally unreadable book.  Go figure.
Although reluctant to start yet another book set in WWII, this book was a page turner and I stayed up late into the night to continue reading.  Doerr is a masterful story teller and weaves beautiful scenes with lovely language.
This is the story of two children whose lives were destined to cross paths. It is a beautiful story set in WWII.  It's a story of the French resistance and horrible Nazi youth program.  It is very suspenseful and oh so good!!!!
This novel will stay with you long after the last page is read.  The story lines are woven together in a seamless, tight layout of intriguing characters and plot twists that carry you through to an ending you don't see coming.
The book (audiobook) sounded wrong from the beginning.  But I picked it up again and again unwillingly until I was finally through, because everyone tells me it's a great book!  I was hoping... Maybe something good eventually would come out?  No.  As one reviewer has pointed out, a story set in a war doesn't make it a good one automatically.<br/><br/>The focal point of the book, the priceless Sea of Flame, sounds more like a fantasy than a real-world thing.  But the book is NOT a fantasy.  Then the book must follow the basic logic of life other than inventing its own rules.  The prose may sound poetic to some ears but to me it's tedious and long drawn, as if the author is trying to fill the pages.  The book holds no surprise as the reader can guess the climax from the early on.<br/><br/>It's probably not fair for me to give it one star but I'm trying to offset the overwhelming but undeserving positive rating.  I hereby laud the two achievements of the book:<br/><br/>1. Put Saint-Malo on the list of my next travel destinations.<br/>2. Entice millions to read a book that is mediocre at best.
A hauntingly beautiful book with language like poetry. The story, the characters, their situations remain long after the novel is finished. To read this book is to have a rare and wonderful experience. I highly recommend it.
It's going to be a rough summer for me trying to find something that can top this stunning novel. This is the kind of story that you read slowly, savoring every moment, hoping to make it last as long as possible. An example from page 121.....<br/><br/>...."An omelet arrives. She positions her face over it's steam. May I have a fork please? The old woman laughs: a laugh Marie-Laure warms to immediately. In an instant a fork is fitted into her hand.<br/><br/>"The eggs taste like clouds. Like spun gold. Madame Manec says "I think she likes it," and laughs again.<br/><br/>"How about peaches, dear? murmurs Madame Manec and Marie-Laure can hear a can opening, juice slopping into a bowl. Seconds later, she's eating wedges of wet sunshine"<br/><br/>That is just one example of the beauty of this novel, along with well developed characters and short alternating chapters that keep the story moving. I liked this book almost as much as <br/> and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>P.S. This story has Hollywood movie written all over it! Are you listening Mr.Eastwood?
Well written and thoughtprovoking at the end.
I found this book very difficult to put down.
Most enjoyable book I've read in a long time!
Enjoyed the story and the writing was superb.
I am not finished but love how it is written.
Loved the characters, Marie-Laure and Werner.
Should have ended sooner, but loved the book!
A compelling and unique view of World War II.
A wonderful story, one I'll remember forever.
could not put it down, such a sensitive book.
terrific idea for a book and very suspenseful
Beautifully written. I didn't want it to end.
It was spellbinding!!  I highly recommend it.
Beautifully written but a bit anti-climactic.
This is the best novel I have read this year.
Took too long to get into, but worth the wait
I loved the word pictures that the author painted throughout the book. The characters were so personal and real, and the way they all progress to the end is exquisite. I highly recommend this book for its beauty and prose.
Someone once said: "It reads like the thesaurus puked all over it." That applies with this book. Other than that it was a good story that had an unfulfilling ending. I was left wondering what happened to the stone.
This was a great book! Extremely well written. The story was interesting and well- developed as were the characters. I love historical history and this was one of the best zi've read. I was really sorry when the book ended
I read one review before reading this book and it said that you would be casting the movie in your head as you loved this book.  So true!  I was absorbed by this book and hope that someone terrific brings it to the screen!
Really, I'm not sure how this book has remained on the NYT best seller list since May. Usually I love books that are about, or take place in, France but this is one book to which I'd give a pass. It's depressing and boring.
Doerr does a beautiful job weaving this story together. I fell in love with the characters, feeling their emotions as they experienced the war from their points of view. I will miss them now that I have finished the book.
This is the most beautiful book I have ever read.  Fascinating, evocative, historically accurate. Literary fiction at its finest. Incredible character development, fabulous plot and scene. Cannot recommend highly enough!
Thoroughly enjoyable, interesting story. Skipped around a lot but not enough to bother me. I really loved the characters, wish the boy and the girl's dad had better fates, but not everyone has a happy ending, I suppose.
Well told story.  May it never happen again.
Very good read.  I would strongly recommend.
Very enjoyable read---could not put it down.

Remarkable characterization  Magical writing
Great writer.  Read The Shell Collector too.
Wonderfully written. Did not want to finish.
A real gem of a read, didn't want it to end!
I know I am in the minority here, but I did not like this book.  At all.  It was just sooo boring and the characters soooo un-interesting.  I am glad that others liked it but I do not understand the attraction at all.
This is a book that will never leave you, long after you've finished reading it.  The characters are well defined, the story is heart warming and heart wrenching at the same time.  I would highly recommend this book.
It took me a long  time to get through this book.  People have raved about it but I found it laborious.  The super short chapters became annoying, and not much happened until the end.  Looking forward to a new book.
This was a wonderful book......I cared deeply about the characters, found the way the plot was organized fascinating, was amazed by the descriptions of place....I could almost feel the wooden buildings! A must read!
Truly one of the best books I've ever read.
Slow didn't ever really catch my attention.
Plain and simply, it's distressing realism.
One of the very best novels I've ever read.
Most amazing book I've read in a long time.
Boring: I didn't care about the characters.
Suspenseful. Hard to put down. A must read.
Great book! Very interesting writing style.

In the middle of it and loving every minute
wonderfully written, couldn't stop reading!
interesting story.. well written and told .
Great book. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I also found it more interesting because I'm German and my husband is blind.
I read lots of books and this one is one of the worst.  I did not enjoy reading it and was always trying to discover if I had missed something.  The one word sentences and concepts were annoying.  I loved the characters but the book was hard to get into and hard to read.  I just wanted it to end.  I will never read anything from this author again.  Very poor quality of writing.  He also kept  skipping around from one year to another, going back and then jumping to another year.  It was really hard to know what was happening.  I do not recommend this book.  My husband read it and he hated it also.
A beautifully written novel.  Well crafted imagery takes the reader on an almost dreamy  journey through the devastation and senselessness of war as seen through the eyes of those least equipped to handle it.
this book is a page turner; especially for people in my age (born 1940 in Germany) who couldn't be taught any recent history from those years. Not a happy book for me as a German but so very important to read
In the end, benumbed by loss, beauty remains.  Beauty in love, caring, and an untainted fascination with nature.  This is a book to end wars.  Should be required reading for anyone with the power to wage war.
This novel is written with a great deal of whimsy and and interesting detail. Initially the style and story are very compelling, but by the end I found it fairly laborious to read. Other people have raved about this book, but at about the halfway mark I thought the plot started to lose steam. The two main character's are only very loosely connected (and only by pure coincidences) and meet for perhaps 2 chapters near the end of the book. The ending feels thrown together, and lacks focus, leaping ahead through time to show what happened to a bunch of secondary characters that the reader is not particularly invested in.<br/><br/>My main criticism, however, is that Werner, one of the principal characters, is a Nazi but never really actively rejects the Nazi ideology. I get it that many Germans were fundamentally good people and were swept along with the tide of the times, but everyone nowadays more or less agrees that the Nazis were evil. So to have a character see this evil and participates in it but never grows to outright reject it ultimately prevents readers from investing in him. In my mind Werner is a weak, tarnished character--he never stands up for what is right and many people rebelling against the Nazi occupation die because of him. His so-called "redemption" in the end is done for selfish reasons and really only saves the other main character and her great uncle. This criticism can be extended to the whole book: while Doerr discusses the evils of WWII, they are generic evils of war, not the evils perpetrated by the Nazis. The only reference to the Holocaust is a mention of a Jewish lady who disappears so that her wealthy Aryan neighbors can have her apartment. This is a major failing of the book, causing it to come off as sympathetic to the Nazis.
My Review:  All The Light We Cannot See has been the talk of the literary town.  It's the darling of critics, has gotten a lot of buzz and even won the Pulitzer Prize.  It's got a lot going for it.  Unfortunately I'm not on the same wavelength as the Pulitzer prize people (and many other readers) because this highly acclaimed novel just didn't live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>I'm a huge reader of WWII fiction and have read some real gems in the past - The Paris Architect, The Storyteller, The Nightingale, Wolfsangel, The Boy In The Striped Pajamas to name just a few.  It's a favourite genre of mine so I expect a lot of emotion, action and character development.  All The Light We Cannot See introduces some unique characters (a Nazi youth and a blind French girl) and has some very lyrical writing and descriptions of France, Germany and the era.  The first half of the book was very enjoyable but then the pace slowed dramatically and continued at that pace for the remainder of the book.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  It wasn't that I didn't like the book -- I just didn't love it and feel like it will be one of those books that won't stay with me long.  I think that where the book started to lose me was around the half way point when pace petered out and the character development became stagnant.  The reader is told a lot about what's happening to these two teens but we're not privy to their inner feelings very much.<br/><br/>In the beginning I really felt for Werner as he's forced into the Nazi Youth training program.  But you'd think that after Werner witnesses a truly horrific incident involving someone he liked that it would have changed him.  Forced him to view the way the Nazi's run things differently.  Sure, he didn't like what he saw but it also didn't seem to change his path in life or even fundamentally change him as a person.  He's a young man who loves working with mechanical things and he doesn't really give any thought about how what he does leads to the death of others.  He felt very apathetic with his head stuck in a transistor radio instead of taking the time to look up and see what was going on around him and (in a some part) how his skill aids the Nazis.  He felt very juvenile throughout the book (I know that he's a teenage boy) but you'd think that the war would have matured him more than the reader witnessed.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure suffered a similar fate.  It was her character that enticed me to read the book but overall the reader is only privy to reading what happens to her, not how she really feels about things. I had a hard time relating to her when I only had these very short chapters to connect with her before the story switched back to Werner's point of view.<br/><br/>Overall, this was just an okay read for me.  There wasn't a lot of action, tension or even emotion that you'd expect from a WWII novel.  With the addition of the magical stone treasure hunt story line and two innocent children getting wrapped up in the fray, All The Light We Cannot See seemed to have a much more juvenile, young adult feel to it.  I kept at it hoping for a big climactic moment but I was left feeling that their converging stories never really came together in the end.  Or at least not as climactic as I was expecting after slogging through a rather slow last half of the book.  Frustratingly, the ending was very weak, predictable and not very believable.  The book is set during a very sensitive and horrific time but doesn't get to the nitty gritty nor the depth of emotion of that time than I was expecting.<br/><br/>My Rating: 3/5 stars<br/><br/>**This book review can also be found on my blog, The Baking Bookworm (www.thebakingbookworm.blogspot.ca) where I share hundreds of book reviews and my favourite recipes. **
I find this book interesting and read it but I am perplexed by the idea that we are supposed to feel so sorry for these German children when millions of Jewish children are being gassed by Hitler.  It is not that I don't like Werner or Jutta or don't find their lives interesting, but I started to wonder about the author's motive and why he picked sympathetic German children to focus on.  I find Marie Laure's story more interesting. There is such a "writing school" quality to this novel though that it is always in the same mode of descriptiveness and never really "felt."  It is always obvious that he was not there.  I suppose I will get attacked for my negativity and I do find the radio metaphors intriguing but I was disappointed in the book not measuring up to the wonderful title.  Maybe I am not really that comfortable with adult books that explore the minds of children in such a terrible period, war, while making everything sound overly written and poetic.  That gives a sense of distance that you could not have if you lived through it.  I never really quite feel their fear because I am too aware of the author's technique of being writerly.  There are of course negative adult German characters with the qualities we expect to see, the cruelty, sadism and acquisitiveness about French possessions. But even there the poetic quality of the writing makes me not feel things because it is all the same tone.  The author's use of conversations, which are a way to capture character, are secondary to the poetry.  I did like seeing the girls as adults coming together in the end.  I do like the setting of St. Malo and admire someone who can write an historical novel with accuracy w/o having been there but there are just some basic aspects of fiction -- that you would find in a great writer like Tolstoy -- that are missing for me.
As I write this review, All the Light We Cannot See is the #1 best selling novel in America. That position does not often go to so-called "literary" fiction such as this; more frequently the top bestseller is genre fiction, a mystery or thriller, for example. Doerr has accomplished the feat of combining all the best attributes of both "literary" and "popular" fiction and has produced a book to be savored by all different kinds of readers. Well done, Mr. Doerr.<br/><br/>Those who appreciate lyrical writing will find it in abundance. Images and scenes and sounds are so vivid that they are experienced rather than just read about. The novel is full of phrases and sentences that are so beautiful they snatch your breath away. Looking for a suspenseful thriller? Hefty doses here. How about some romance? Even a bit of that. War stories catch your interest? The time and place are France and Germany during World War II. Do you require your reading to have serious implications, say about such matters as the nature of good and evil and the resilience of human beings? Oh, yes! This novel even includes much discussion and information about scientific matters, such as the properties of light and the construction of radios and the attributes of snails.<br/><br/>But it is surely Doerr's storytelling abilities that have turned this into a bestseller. No matter what the literary preferences and pretensions, almost all readers appreciate a well-told story with believable and sympathetic characters, and this novel succeeds on that count, unquestionably, beyond a doubt.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on two young people: Marie-Laure, a blind girl from Paris who flees with her father when the city is taken by the Germans; and Werner, a precocious orphan boy from Germany whose special talent with radios lands him in an elite academy for Hitler Youth. Their stories, told in alternating (very short) chapters, follow them from childhood to coming-of-age amidst the Allied bombing of Saint-Malo, where their two lives converge.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough good things about this novel. Everyone should read it. (All the Light We Cannot See was a finalist for the National Book Award and is a strong contender for the Pulitzer.)
It is a relief when a book that is talked about, mentioned on blogs, shortlisted and longlisted is a good read.<br/><br/>So it's even better when it lives up to all that hype, a story that sticks in your head, characters whose fates you are unable to shake from your heart, whose world you have lived in for days - days because while you are so tempted to rush through it and smush as much as you can into every nook and cranny of that reading mechanism called the brain.<br/><br/>All I knew when I went into this book was that it was highly lauded, it was by Anthony Doerr, whose collection of short stories Memory Wall fascinated me, that it was set in Europe during World War II. And it had something to do with radios.<br/><br/>So at first I was all, ho-hum, this sounds like it might be a bit of a drag. But the story quickly sucked me in with young Marie-Laure, whose father is the master of the locks at the Museum of Natural History. At age six, she loses her sight and every year on her birthday, her loving and patient father builds her a wooden puzzle box with a surprise inside. He also constructs a model of their streets so that she can learn to walk around on her own. Marie-Laure has a fondness for Jules Verne which makes me instantly like her. When war breaks out, they leave Paris for St Malo, where her reclusive uncle lives.<br/><br/>"Botany smells like glue and blotter paper and pressed flowers. Paleontology smells like rock dust, bone dust. Biology smells like formalin and old fruit; it is loaded with heavy cool jars in which float things she has only had described for her: the pale coiled ropes of rattlesnakes, the severed hands of gorillas. Entomology smells like mothballs and oil: a preservative that, Dr. Geffard explains, is called naphthalene. Offices smell of carbon paper, or cigar smoke, or brandy, or perfume. Or all four."<br/><br/>And in another part of the continent, in Germany, Werner, an orphan, who lives in a mining town and despite his remarkable intelligence, has a bleak future, likely to be yet another miner.<br/><br/>"It's steel country, anthracite country, a place full of holes. Smokestacks fume and locomotives trundle back and forth on elevated conduits and leafless trees stand atop slag heaps like skeleton hands shoved up from the underworld."<br/><br/>But his talent at building and fixing radios wins him a chance to study at an elite military school, where the training is rigorous and unforgiving.<br/><br/>How will the two meet? Because you know that they are meant to! I just really wanted to find out!<br/><br/>But first, Doerr enchants us with his gorgeous evocative writing. Whether describing a town or a museum, or even the unrelenting backdrop of war.<br/><br/>"Four years of occupation, and the roar of oncoming bombers is the roar of what? Deliverance? Extirpation?<br/><br/>The clack-clack of small-arms fire. The gravelly snare drums of flak. A dozen pigeons roosting on the cathedral spire cataract down its length and wheel out over the sea."<br/><br/>Doerr takes us from character to character, going back and forth before and after the German occupation of France. In less masterful hands, this would be confusing and frustrating but Doerr guides the reader assuredly through the different years.<br/><br/>It is beautiful and moving, a story about struggle, resilience, bravery, and all the goodness and evil that comes forth in wartime.<br/><br/>All The Light We Cannot See is a story of completely deserving of all its praise, shortlisting and hype! I am both thrilled and completely relieved to be able to say that!
I tried to read this book several months ago and couldn't get into it.  Since I am a mood reader, I decided to put this one down and try another time.  This week seemed like the time to try it again.  when I reached 100 pages I whined to one og my book clubs that I needed encouragement to finish this book and some said they loved it while others sent me to their reviews which weren't that great.  At around 200 pages late last night when I couldn't sleep I picked up the book and finished it when the sun was peeking through this morning.  At one point the book really took flight and I finished it understanding why so many praised this book.<br/><br/>There were some inherent problems with the title which included chapters going back and forth in time and the use of primarily the two main characters featured in e very other chapter.  Granted the chapters were short but you no sooner were in the world of Werner and Marie Laure that you were back to the others tale.  Why then did I love the book.  I won't describe the plot as many others have but I will say the characters were really fleshed out and I feel as though I had two friends involved in WWII in a way which I haven't read about before.  This is not a book about concentration camps or a story of how some survived but just the toll that war takes on most individuals that neither planned it or fully agreed to it.  The writing is the very best of which I have read recently.  Doerr's descriptions of many items including how light plays a part in our lives and even deaths.  I found that despite that Marie Laure was blind and sheltered pretty much from the world, she was a most resilient character and others involved in the book couldn't help but fall in love with her.  And even the ending left one of the questions unanswered which I thought was how this book should end.<br/><br/>I have read many books about WWII, Studied the Holocaust and even taught it to high school students but seldom has a book resonated so much with me.  Prior to this though that few books or none could compare to Stones from the River by Ursula Hegi or Skeletons at the Feast by Christopher Bohjalian.  This morning All the Light We Cannot See takes it place among those books as the best and now I look forward to reading more by this gifted author.
Truthfully I don't know what to write in my review here for this book. I've never met a book like this ㅡthat tells a story set on long time ago during World War II; that tells every details of the war, the cities, the grief, the mess, the survivors; that tells a lot of agonies but didn't bothering; that tells very little romance yet I could sense the feeling about it is so strong. I'd hesitated several times before I decided to give this book a try. I'd read the blurb over and over again to convince myself that this book had nothing I ever wanted to read on a book. But the minute I'd met Marie-Laure, I'd fallen in love with this book. I'd become so obsessed over this book. On the first day of reading, I had to stop myself on chapter 48 because if I kept going I might skip my sleep. And today ㅡwhich is the day I finished the rest of the book in one sittingㅡ I skipped breakfast and lunch and only stopped five times to drink water because I was so eager to find the ending, yet in the same time I didn't want it to end soon.<br/>All the Light We Cannot See is a really beautiful read. When the story began, it began with a simple background of each roles but somewhere raised curious feelings for the readers. In the middle, the feelings were all mixed up that several times I had to remind myself to exhale and the next time I felt grief, pity, and even smiled on certain parts. But when the story came to an end, it felt like the curtain closed as I turned the last page of the book, leaving me with a content feeling and mind full of imagination and yet it all seemed far and settled more as memories than a feeling. The ending not only concluded the story, but my feelings as well. And I'm glad for that because sometimes it felt uncomfy when the gloomy feeling caused by reading a book haunting you to sleep. But this book did a different thing. It offered a story full of complex situations, driving emotions up and down and in the end it settled down slowly and steady to a calm end, just like a cooling session. And now that I finished the book, I don't really feel sad or happy but more like feeling content in mind.<br/>It is really genius to bring up the focus on these two main character, Marie-Laure and Werner in the middle of the war. How two people with different nations and a very short encounter yet had formed a very tight bound and...damn if it's not touching for anyone who reads this!<br/>The words that Mr. Anthony had chosen were all so simple yet formed very beautiful and meaningful sentences. The metaphors and analogies he made are brilliance. And because I am a romance-freak, I noticed these several sentences which was formed ordinarily yet damn touching and heart-melting:<br/><br/>"A shell screams over the house. He thinks: I only want to sit here with her for a thousand hours."<br/><br/>"The window glows. The slow sandy light of dawn permeates the room. Everything transient and aching; everything tentative. To be here, in this room, high in this house, out of the cellar, with her: it is like medicine."<br/><br/>"Her voice like a bright, clear window of sky. Her face a field of freckles. He thinks: I don’t want to let you go."<br/><br/>It was so simple and the farthest that a boy could think of about a girl who he just met less than a day yet it showed enough what his heart feel to her. Good God...<br/>Well, I guess it will be a while until I will start reading a book again (because my poor eyes really need to rest right now as I write this review right after I finished the book) but as I said it before, I feel content to have read this deeply moving and beautiful book :)
The title ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is a double entendre. It’s about a blind girl during WWII, but it also shows us some light that shown through the horrible events.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure has congenital cataracts, but she probably sees more than most of us. At one point in the story, she describes to another girl what she sees. She sees colors, not darkness. Her father, a locksmith at a Paris museum, makes a miniature model of their neighborhood, and she must memorize it with her fingertips. He takes her six blocks from their apartment and tells her she must lead him back to their apartment. She’s terribly frustrated at first, but she eventually does it, and then she knows there’s virtually nothing she can’t do.<br/><br/>The second main character is a German, Werner, who is kind of an electronic genius. Doerr ties him to Marie-Laure in that he and his sister Jutta listen to her grandfather’s radio broadcasts about science. Werner and Jutta are orphans, and another “light” in the story is Frau Elena who treats her wards like her own children. There’s a parallel in Marie-Laure’s story where Madamn Manec, her great uncle’s housekeeper, is a freedom fighter who can make soup out of stones. I’m not exaggerating much.<br/><br/>Werner wins a spot at a school for the best of the Hitler youth where the technical teacher gives his charges an assignment: make something out of spare parts. Werner is able to make several devices, and he becomes the teacher’s research partner. There were people in Germany who hid their Jewish friends. Not everybody was a skunk. One was Frederick, Werner’s bunk mate, at the Hitler Youth camp. When the students are required to pour cold water on a prisoner to show they will follow orders, Frederick refuses. That makes him a weakling in the director’s eyes, and he’s got a big target on his back, but we know Frederick is really another one of the “lights” in the story.<br/><br/>When the teacher is promoted, Werner is sent to Russia to ferret out partisans who are sending out radio signals. Here he is reunited with Volkheimer, the giant student who served as an enforcer for the camp director. Only Volkheimer likes and respects Werner. At first we think Volkheimer is a stone cold killer, but we gradually learn that he was swept up in events just like millions of other people who would never have thought to do in everyday life what they did in the war. At the end of the book, we see what a mensch Volkheimer really is under the rough exterior.<br/><br/>Marie-Laure’s father and his daughter escape from Paris prior to the Nazi invasion, taking them to St.-Malo, an island where his uncle lives in a house with six floors, plus an attic. He hasn’t left the building in years, thanks to a gas attack during WWI. Madamn Manac prods Etienne into using the giant radio in the attic to help the partisans.<br/><br/>Another parallel between the two stories is the American invasion at Normandy and the French partisans who are helping the Allied army find German coastal artillery. Werner is sent to Saint-Malo. There’s another plot line involving the Sea of Flames, a great diamond the director of the museum may have given Marie-Laure’s father to protect. It’s one of four, but three are fakes. Marie-Laure’s father doesn’t know if he has the real one. A German sergeant major thinks he knows where it is.<br/><br/>I usually look for character-driven novels, and Marie-Laure and Werner are two of the best I’ve encountered since I read Kent Haruf’s PLAINSONG with the two wonderful bachelor farmers. When you reach the climax, pay close attention. Doerr often suggests rather than tells what’s happening. If you don’t, you’ll only have to go back and reread it.
I really don't love fiction books, especially over-hyped bestseller fiction books (prefer history or nonfiction adventure or travel). I avoid fiction bestsellers almost to be contrarian. Sometimes the worst fiction writing is an author trying to capture a historical era or event. Then it can be cheesy drama which ends up unrealistic with stupid, stilted dialogue and nothing like the actual period or event. Actually I'm not even sure what propelled me to buy this book except that it was about WW2 but the bestseller "popular book" aspect made me a little leery.<br/><br/>BUT.... I was pleasantly surprised to find that this book IS DIFFERENT. It's totally worth the hype. Be patient with it - it might start out a little slowly for some. Let Doerr's mastery of language wash over you, enjoy it, savor it. This guy can write some amazing prose. The reader knows there will be an intersection of lives but it's worth the wait to see how it happens. However, if I had any criticism, it would be that the intersection of characters would never have/could never have truly happened - too much of a coincidence (but then again this is fiction). Yes, there is some jumping around in time - this is NOT a linear storyline - but it's flashes of memory, then to the present time of the characters - then all move forward in time. This made the book and writing even more interesting, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I will note that it helped me to have an idea of the WW2 backdrop. The Nazi ban on radios and outside information was real, the threat of punishment or imprisonment hung over the German population (the ones that weren't true to the Nazi cause, anyway). The Hitler Youth were purposely desensitized, brainwashed and trained to inflict/tolerate violence from an early age. Doerr's brutal rendering of the Werner's training (and what happened to the weak kids) rings true. Fighting on the Eastern Front was beyond horrible, apocalyptic. French towns were occupied, supplies cleaned out, citizens threatened and killed into cooperation. It was a nightmare for so many people. While certainly no expert, I found all of Doerr's descriptions to be likely pretty accurate based on everything I've read. Having a sense of how awful WW2 was in Europe made this novel even more poignant for me.<br/><br/>This historical fiction succeeds so well because it almost could have been real; I believed it. The author totally nails it with his research and resulting character development.
After a slow start, I persevered with this book and was so glad I did. This is a dazzlingly beautiful novel that weaves together the stories of several very different people who experienced the horrors of World War 2 from opposing perspectives. Marie-Laure, a blind, fiercely inquisitive young French girl living with her locksmith father in Paris and later, St. Malo - and Werner, a brilliant young German orphan with a knack for fixing and assembling radios, who is selected to attend a prestigious military academy that trains young recruits for the fuhrer's army.<br/>Doerr flip-flops back and forth in time tracing the stories of these two innocent victims of war as well as introducing a mystery about a valuable diamond! We know that somehow their two paths will collide, but we don't know when, where and how. All we know is that along the way we're treated to virtual symphony of vivid, inventive, detailed and gorgeous imagery as we follow them into the brutality and cruelty of the war. Without preaching or relying on sentimentality or melodrama, Doerr shows us the terrible waste, destruction and utter pointlessness of war. From the tragic story of Werner's gentle, bird-lover friend at the military academy who is ultimately crushed in the war machine to the horrifying scenes of Parisians fleeing their city before it's invaded. Throughout the entire story, Marie-Laure's courage and strength are constant factors and her perception of the devastation of war and its impact on those around her is made even more powerful without the sense of sight. The sounds, smells, movements tell an even deeper, more primal story.<br/>Ultimately the story shows there is more that unites us than divides us. Imagination, creativity, intelligence, love are far more more lasting and permanent.<br/>The diamond storyline is interesting, but the real gems in this story are the richly developed characters and the raw, unsentimental beauty of Doerr's prose.
This is so well written that I read it twice!  When I read "Leaflets", I was struck with how I felt as if I was gathering the leaflets myself.<br/>  Anthony Doerr is a skillful writer using each word precisely as the story becomes real, feels real.  He uses the narrative form economically  and that is why I felt as if I knew every person intimately.  Marie-Laure LeBlanc is sighted before she is six and then she gradually loses her eyesight, but her father who works in at the Museum of National d'Histoire Naturelle, and is the keeper of all the keys of the museum handing them out every morning to the different sections in the museum.  However, he is also skillful in building  a miniature city where they live so Marie-Laure will be able to memorize it  There is also another person Werner Pfennig, who is German, and along with his sister, Jutta who are orphans and live at the Children's House.  Werner has a gift of repairing radios; he can "see" how they work, and fixes every radio he gets his hands on.<br/>  Hitler is taking over country after country until the allies (Americans, too) start bombing Germany and France and finally win the war.  In the meantime all the people in the story are affected in some way.  Her father ends up in a prison, and her great -uncle is a bit crazy, but Marie-Laure survives, and is eventually saved by Werner from a sickly Sergeant Major who is frantically looking for the diamond with a red center, but Werner kills him and save Marie-Laure (a redemption for him because he never felt right about what he was doing ).and then she gets away as a refugee, and later meets up with her great-uncle.<br/>  There was so much more to this story, but it wasn't just about a blind girl.  All the Light We Cannot See  was about everyone intertwined in the story.
Stories based during World War II seem to continue appearing like a stream incumbent with wild rapids. Both for good and bad the horrors and human toll of that war continue to inspire authors. And when those like Anthony Doerr capture light in a bottle they bring the era back to us with vivid imagery and characters. I loved this story even though I am not a big fan of the books structure.<br/>  The book is a fictional version of a dual biography featuring two middle teens, a boy and a girl. The girl is French and blind and the boy is a German orphan and a master at repairing radios. We follow each via their separate journeys in streams of rapid short chapters, some no more than a page or two. All are small gems offering to move the plot forward and when combined form a perfect whole. The technique is unique and here it works.<br/>  However, I thought the two separate character narratives were enough and adding, as Doerr does, numerous flashbacks becomes a distraction getting in the way of the story. It would be interesting to see if the book would have read slightly better if it was edited to read in chronological order only moving back between the two characters. In the end this is only a minor complaint because no matter the editing structure it is still a page turner where you discover these characters and where the happenstance of war takes them. Will they meet? How and when?<br/>  I don't want to get into major plot points because much of the pleasure of the book is that it takes some unorthodox twists. Like the story of Doctor Zhivargo who just wanted to survive war and was carried away on its tide so are both young Warner and his love of radios (and his sister) and Marie-Laure's love for her father and relatives and the model of the village of Saint-Malo she uses to learn how to navigate its streets. Like in real life and especially war friends and loved ones come and go from your life....they disappear and we hunger for their return. But time brings about change and we bury our memories but they are not forgotten.<br/>  A marvelous book with a few structural flaws.
Okay, some of my favorite authors (Abraham Verghese & J.R. Moehringer), not to mention many recognized literary critics absolutely loved this book...but after reading it, I feel that this 10-year work might not be for everyone.  Yes, I was quite disappointed, not only in the wrap-it-up Hollywood ending but in the short segments (and I mean short as in one or two page "chapters") throughout the book.  Cute style to use a new title to introduce your next character; but to do it for every single section??  In other words, you'll zip through this 530 page book because it really is equal to only about 200 pages.  But what about the story?  WWII is coming, a blind German girl is cared for by her museum worker papa; the Nazi invasion begins and they flee to Saint-Malo, destruction now all around from which the father tries to hide.  Move forward and a young German boy who loves radios begins to grow and is recruited by the German camps.  The kids grow older.  Jump ahead two years and the father goes missing and the boy is now a soldier trapped beneath rubble.  Go back two years plus a month and the father is saying he's off on an important mission and his mentally unstable brother will care for the girl;  the German boy makes more points in the camp. Jump ahead (again) two years plus a week and the food is running out in both places;  things look bleak under the rubble.  Go back, no, go forward, no, go back.  Keep up!  You're on the next "chapter."  Hmmm, after all the rave reviews, I really looked forward to reading this; but honestly, I ended this book with a sigh of resignation as if I'd been gypped.  Unlike Donna Tart and Pat Conroy, author Doerr just seemed lacking in vivid descriptions and despite the 10-year effort, seemed to emerge from this exhausted as he wraps up the entire book in the final 30 pages (really equal to about 8 pages).  But, the critics DID love this book and perhaps I shouldn't have read this after reading such a wonderful book as "The Goldfinch."  In other words, plow through this book and see what you think; it's the joy of reading that makes one reader give it five stars and another (me) giving it two.
Marie-Laure LeBlanc is alone in her Uncle's home when she hears the approach of American planes on their path to bombing the city where she resides. Except for the Germans there are few residents left thanks to the flyers previously dropped by the Americans warning the French citizens to evacuate or be killed. It is apprently the intention of the Allies to level the city - one of the last strongholds of the German forces. But Marie-Laure knows nothing of this as she is blind and cannot see the flyers. Not far away is a young German man named Werner who is a radio specialist. During the bombing he is one of three men who make it to an underground cellar. By the time the bombing is over, he is able to dig out from the cellar. During the war he has been part of a small force that moves from town to town tracking down and destroying the radio broadcasts of the French Resistance. When Werner is once again above ground, he tracks down the radio wires that lead him to Marie-Laure's uncle' house.<br/><br/>Flashbacks take the reader to an earlier time when Werner and his younger sister Jutta are still in the orphans's home. The children like to go out and scavenge and Werner teaches himself to build and fix a radio receiver from spare parts. It is his greatest pleasure during those years to tune in to a scratchy broadcast of an older gentleman who speaks of all things: scientific, spiritual, and so much more. It is those broadcasts, made by the heavily foreign accented voice, that make orphan life bearable.<br/><br/>Thus when the soldier Werner has become meets Marie-Laure at the house where he has gone to destroy the radio transmitter, it suddenly realizes that this is the place where those childhood broadcasts were made and that it is this girl's uncle whose voice he remembers. What follows is one of the most touching scenes I have read this year.<br/><br/>ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE is a wonderful commentary on coming of age during World War II. Additionally it is a wonderful look at the war from two distinctly different viewpoints. The writing is crisp and carries the reader along in a pleasantly consistent fashion. At the conclusion, I found myself hoping for a second book to follow the lives further in post-war years. All in all, a terrific book you will enjoy.
Oh boy!  I absolutely loved this book.  I don’t even know what to say about it.  Gosh!  Okay let’s do this: instead of trying to write a synopsis for <I><b>All The Light We Cannot See</b></I> that would not even begin to do it justice, why don’t I just introduce you to a few of the main characters.<br/><br/><b>The Sea of Flames</b> An enormous blue diamond, 130 carats, with a flare of red at its core, the Sea of Flames has a long and tragic history.  The story goes that the goddess of the earth created the diamond as a gift for her lover, the god of the sea, and sent it to him through the river.  When an earthly prince picked up the diamond she became enraged and cursed the stone.  The keeper of the stone would live forever but misfortunes would fall on all those he loved.  A tragic tale follows the diamond through time until finally it came to the King of France on the condition that he lock it away for 200 years.  Thus it has been kept in a special vault at the Museum of Natural History in Paris for the last 196 years.<br/><br/><b>Marie-Laure (mar’-ee lore)</b> Marie-Laure is the young daughter of the keeper of keys at the Museum of Natural History and she knows all about the Sea of Flames.  She went blind at the age of six and her father built an exact scale replica of the six-block walk from their apartment to the museum so she could memorize it by touch.  When the Nazis invaded, Marie and her father were forced to flee their home and they ended up in the coastal town of Saint-Malo (san ma-lo’) at the home of her father’s uncle.  Unbeknownst to Marie, the Sea of Flames went with them in an effort to keep it safe.  Remarkably, Marie ends up working for the French underground, carrying messages hidden in loaves of bread and using the radio transmitter in her great-uncle’s attic.  The Nazi grip on Saint-Malo tightens however, and the members of Marie’s household disappear one by one, including her uncle, her father, and the housekeeper.  As the war nears its end Marie is alone in the house while the city is being bombed to pieces all around her.  Also, the radio transmissions have caught the attention of Nazi specialists and the Sea of Flames is also being traced to her location.  This all places Marie in a very precarious position.<br/><br/><b>Werner (ver’-ner)</b> Werner grew up an orphan in a small mining town in Germany with his sister.  He once found a simple radio that someone had cast out because it was broken.  He studied the device very carefully until he saw what was wrong with it and fixed it.  From then on radio was his passion.  By the time the Nazis came to power Werner had earned something of a reputation as a radio repairman.  Even though his lowly status as an orphan would have precluded him from joining the third reich, his skill with radios caught the attention of the Nazis and he was sent away to a Hitler youth camp, where conditions were hard and he was taught many horrible things.  When he was old enough, Werner was sent to the front but not as a soldier.  Rather he was sent into France to track down underground radio transmissions using signal triangulation equipment that he had helped to build.  After shutting down many transmitters, he stumbles across one that is broadcasting the voice of a girl.  It is a sweet sounding voice that seems completely out of place in the bombed out city of Saint-Malo.  Instead of reporting the signal to his superiors he just listens, undecided what to do.<br/><br/><b>von Rumpel</b> Sergeant Major von Rumpel is a German officer who is primarily a treasure hunter.  It is his job to scour France for the most valuable treasures: paintings, gems, sculptures, you name it.  He is very aware of the Sea of Flames diamond and wants to possess it very badly for obvious reasons.  What is not so obvious to the casual observer, however, is that von Rumpel is being eaten alive by cancer and more than anything he believes that the Sea of Flames is his only chance to survive.  Beginning at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, von Rumpel tracks the progress of the priceless diamond to a house in the devastated city of Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>And those are the primary players from <I><b>All The Light We Cannot See</b></I>.  It was fascinating to watch their individual stories slowly come together in the ruins of Saint-Malo.  I don’t want to give away too much so all I can say is that some of them survive the war and some do not.  But one way or another, the war had a permanent effect on them all.<br/><br/>Mostly this is the story of Werner and Marie-Laure.  You see, many years before the war, Marie’s great-uncle and his brother built the radio transmitter in the attic of their family home.  They would broadcast classical music and lectures about dinosaurs and anything else they could think of.  All the way up in Germany, a young orphan boy who had just found his first radio and fixed it, came across their regular program and was captivated by it.  Later on, near the end of the war, Marie finds herself all alone in her great-uncle’s house and there are no longer any messages to transmit for the French underground.  Finally despairing of any hope, Marie decides to transmit one of her uncle’s old records, an album containing classical music and dinosaur lectures along with a call for help, even though it may alert the Nazis to her location.  This is the transmission that Werner hears, the same one that captivated him as a child in better times, and the sweet voice of the girl.  Even though she is supposed to be his enemy he knows that he must help her.<br/><br/>Gosh, I just want to sit here and tell you the whole story as I relive it for myself.  It’s a beautiful story, definitely one of the best I’ve read this year.  I’m going to try hard to restrain myself because I don’t want to spoil it for you.  But you definitely need to read this book or listen to the audio as I did.  I don’t think you’ll regret it.<br/><br/>I have no complaints at all about Zach Appelman’s narration of <I><b>All The Light We Cannot See</b></I>.  He was easy to listen to for several hours and his French and German accents sounded just fine.  Appelman is an accomplished stage actor with a long list of credits on and off broadway.  He also has a few television guest appearances under his belt including <I>Law & Order: SVU</I>, and <I>Sleepy Hollow</I>.  He has very few audiobook credits so I’m guessing he’s new to the genre, but I have a feeling we’ll be hearing more from him in the coming years.
Crafted with utmost care, each delicate thread of plot played out and pulled in once more, always carrying the reader to an end that the reader hopes will never be reached.  I want to live within this story.

Between the plight of the unique characters and the backdrop of the Second World War, the author has woven an enthralling tale filled with suspense, horror, sympathy, and honor.  This is an excellent read.
Just a delightful story told so well you don't want it to end.  Extremely well written, with satisfying well-rounded characters and a moving plot.  Definitely will be looking to read more from this author.
May possibly be the best book I've ever read.  It gets in your head and you can't leave it.  It is intriguing, gripping, raw and emotional.  I just finished it and feel like starting it all over again.
Such a beautiful book. That's two books on WWII that I've read this year that were historical fictions, that brought to life more about the German side of the story. We forget in blaming the Germans for the things that Hitler and his cronies did, that many Germans were simply caught up in a disaster, not of their making. And certainly the children were mislead by the adults, and had no choice in the matter. There were several threads in this story, about a young orphan with remarkable skills in electronics who is forced to perform for his country, despite his inclinations towards being good. He sees both the horror of war, and the brutality...and tries to block it out with his science. He also sees some beauty, in the ocean he eventually is introduced to, and a young blind girl who he meets very shortly.<br/><br/>Another thread is about the young blind girl from France, who is forced with her father to leave their home in Paris. He is entrusted with a package from the museum he worked for, and is asked to protect. They flee to a small port in Southern France, where the girl meets an uncle who is damaged from WWI, and who becomes her protector when she loses her father.<br/><br/>The stories of the people who surround these two protagonists, is a story seen in times of war...of loss, of redemption, of forgiveness, and of courage and empathy for others. Doerr writes in such a way to draw the stories together as a quilt or collage. HIs use of words is some of the most gorgeous prose I've read in a long time, especially writing about something that is so horrendous as WWII.<br/><br/>I hope to read more from this author in the future...if you have the time, read this book.
Excellent plot and character development.
Well-written story but depressing ending.

Fabulous read - compelling story of WW2.
This is a review of the audiobook version (since I listened to it and did not read it) and of the writing.<br/><br/>Audiobook Review: The man who reads the story for the audiobook does a superb job.  When he pronounces words in French, he sounds like he knows what he's saying.  His tempo is perfect.  He doesn't use voices for all of the different characters, as some narrators do.  Doing so would have, in a way, belittled the story being told.<br/><br/>Story Review: The writing, I believe as others have said many times, is beautiful.  There is poetry in nearly every description; you can see in your mind's eye a world lovingly created by the author down to the smallest details.  There are many moments when an author who was more lazy (or who didn't love the story as much as Doerr obviously does) would have used common descriptions or less detail.  (The reader surely wouldn't have complained.)  However, Doerr's details, unique like the millions of snowflakes falling during a gentle winter storm, fall gently on the reader's skin, melting and soaking into the bloodstream.  I won't forget this story soon.  I am changed because I listened to it.  My perspective on WWII is changed because of it.  I cannot say enough about the writer's talent and words are inadequate to describe the ephemeral magic of the story.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is not, however, something to listen to when there are children around.  Especially toward the second half of the book and beyond, the subject matter becomes increasingly disturbing.  There are words used and actions described (although never graphically) that are inappropriate for children to hear.
I savored every moment of this beautifully written story and truly did not want it to end.  This is the best book I've read in the last few years and may be one of the best I've ever experienced!
I read it while on a trip to France which included St Malo and Normandy and Paris. It was a perfect read for a wonderful trip.<br/>I could walk the streets and visualize events from the book.
Very talented, award winning writer.  Tremendous clarity and great mastery of our language, our sensibilities, our fears and diligence in seeking solutions in the midst of the need to survive.
I'm not even sure how to describe this book!  I can tell you that it is set in WWII; I can tell you that it contains characters so real that you want to meet them:  the young German boy, Werner; his sister, Jutta; a blind French girl, Marie-Laure; her father, a locksmith; her great-uncle, the great-uncle's house keeper, a boy named Frederick, who loves birds ...  Each of these characters is caught up in their own horror of the war, each one a victim in his / her own way.  Doerr has woven the story back and forth through months, years and even decades.  The details are crisp and clear, perhaps even more so since a great deal of the story is "seen" through the eyes of the blind.  Nothing about the war is sugar-coated or glossed over - and I mean nothing: food, darkness, raids, bombs, bodies, destruction, fear, anger, greed, confusion, imprisonment, cruelty...it's all there!  Perhaps it is because these horrors are so great that the moments of beauty are so poignant though, and you want to cling to those moments as a drowning person would cling to a life raft:  the softness of a flower petal, the smell of the ocean, the taste of the sweetest peach ... and you keep hoping that everything will magically be OK -- even though you know you are reading something akin to a Shakespearean tragedy.  You know your history; you know what happened during WWII - and that it did not end well for so many.  Unlike fairy tales, there is no "happily ever after" -- but there is courage, perseverance, goodness and hope.  Those are the things you can walk away with as the characters linger in your mind.
The book will stay in my mind for ever!
Enthralling story. Hard to put it down.

Very well written.  It hel my interest.
Beautifully written.  I loved this book
The descriptions in this book keep it alive.  One just wants to keep reading to find out what will happen next.  This was our book club reading for the month, which was an excellent choice.
Each chapter, beautifully written, entwines the reader into this fantastic story. Characters are deeply drawn, good to the core, such a marvel in modern fiction. I am so sad that it's done!
Mr. Doerr is one of those few writers who can actually paint pictures with words. This was one of those books I didn't want to end. If you like historical fiction, this is the book for you.
This is a book  written in exquisite prose...almost poetry. I can understand the years it took to write, the intricacies of the lines and perspectives took time and thought and research.
Sometimes a bit confusing,  so not to be read in bits and pieces. But read  in long segments when you can digest the characters and their part in this World War II  to present day story.
good read ,  got up in the early morning to continue several times . A good balance the realities of war and the elegance of the human spirit , the indomitable spirit and the crass bully
This book goes back and forth between Marie and Werner's point of views. It takes a long time to realize the connection between the two, but in the meantime my advice is just enjoy the beautiful writing and not worry so much about that connection. Because Marie is blind, Doerr has a way of writing the most beautiful imagery that convey just how heightened her other senses are.<br/><br/>Here is one example of Doerr's imagery when Marie visited the ocean for the first time: "When she raises her face to the sky, she can feel the thousand tiny spines of raindrops melt onto her cheeks, her forehead."<br/><br/>There are so many intricate stories in this book. The title refers to the radio waves Werner works with, the fact that Marie-Laure is blind, and it is a metaphor for all the invisible stories of World War II. Little Marie becomes a spy working with the resistance and she is one of my favorite characters by far. She is sweet and independent and so, so brave. I never thought I would read a book where I actually felt sympathy for someone working for the Nazis, but I did. Werner was caught up trying to leave his orphanage and the main reason he went to Hitler's academy was because he wanted to further his scientific education. He pushes aside his doubts about what the Nazis are doing to achieve this goal. By the end of the book, I loved Werner almost as much as Marie. I won't give away any spoilers, but the ending was not quite what I expected. And it wasn't what I wanted. This book was one of the most beautiful books I have read this year.
The book held my interest.  The characters developed realistically and reacted to their environment.  The history of France and Germany during WWII was interesting,  Well worth reading.
Wonderful. A great and skillful story.
Amazing, beautiful, and heartbreaking.

Beautifully written. Pleasure to read.
A beautiful, lyrical historical novel.
Amazing story and beautifully written.
A busy book - lots  of short chapters about the different persona, as children, as teenagers as young  adults , about different childraisers;  Kind  Frau Elena iooking after Werner in the German orphanage.  Marie-Laure ithe blind girl, lives in  Paris and ,is being lovingly trained by heer father to become independent.  He is the locksmith at the Natural HistoryMuseum nearby,.  Yet Marie Laure does not  lose her poetic imagery of  the world she can no longer see.  Some of the best writing is about her thoughts and mental vision.  The book takes its name from her creation and enjoyment of  her own world.<br/>  Most of the book is set during World War 2 -  Dunkirk days to the invasion of Normandy. and finally peace. 2.  It raises the moral  issues of loyalty within a family and your nationhood - wartime, dictatorships, occupation, resistance to the invading nation,  the moral issues about taking advantage of working with the enemy for personal gain.  How much of your life is lived as an outward lie?  of  working for  the enemy - or for your own nation?  And always the terror of being found out.<br/>The flashes, back and forth, with just the necessary dates,are easy to follow.<br/><br/>There is a thriller element, and many other little  side stories  that make it a fascinating read.  . Radio communication developed into a very important tool for good and for evil..<br/>This is a  very different moulding of stories about ordinary people during the Second World War.,  and very briefly into the present..  Read it.  It has sld a million copies.
Love the human element to the history

Marie-Laure, a blind girl, lives in Paris with her beloved Papa, a locksmith for the Museum of Natural History. Orphaned, but cared for with his sister Jutta, young Werner, an electronics genius in the making, lives in a mining town in Germany. As Hitler’s hold on Europe escalates in WW II, Marie-Laure and her father escape Paris to live in San Malo with an eccentric relative. Werner is called to repair the family radio of a German officer, a task that has defeated all others. Spotting his talent, the officer sends him to a special school to train for Hitler’s army.<br/><br/>War happens to these two young people much as life happens to any of us. Werner is not as much stirred by Hitler’s cause, as he is the opportunity to develop his talent. Marie-Laure’s father’s disappears as he tries to save a priceless gem from the Nazis, a jewel that belongs to the Museum of Natural History. The stone has a magical history: he who possesses it will never die but all those he loves will, a double-edge sword, if ever.<br/><br/>All the light we cannot see comes to us through stories travelling through the air on radio waves, weaving a wondrous connection between Marie-Laure and Werner. Through locals in San Malo who risk all to transmit coded messages over forbidden radios, and through Marie-Laure’s sight revealed by her sense of touch, taste, smell, and intuitive knowing, and through Werner’s love for his sister and a friend he makes in school; through love undeterred by nationality.
Right at the top of my list.  Am old enough to remember this time and so can relate to this book.  Couldn't put it down!  Very accurate in his descriptions and history of WW11.
a great readable book. the story grew  as you read and it enchanted from page one.<br/>Loved the characters, the setting, the story.<br/>Wonderfully written, so descriptive.
This is an amazing book and one of two I will always remember.  Try not to read much about it because you will want to see how the story unfolds on your own. I love this book.

Great read. Top reads of the summer.
A great listen. Not what I expected.
well written suspenseful holocaust story that told the story of the misery of the times.  I wished it had had a happier ending with the blind girl being able to marry Werner
From the point of view of just the writing, perhaps the best book I've ever read.  Story's outstanding, too, but the writing is almost too good.<br/><br/>Read it, or weep.
Slow to get into, and required some concentration to keep up with the authors time and place switching, but totally engrossing and satisfying read.  Definitely a great read!
We all loved it at our book club....however none saw the important reason for going back and forth between one or two years...didn't mean anything.  Great story.  Very real.
Really enjoyed this book, although the setting and topic (Europe during WWII) meant some of the book was difficult to read.  Still, I enjoyed it and recommend it to others.
This is a classic that I felt the same about when I read The Moviegoer or Wuthering Heights or Faulkner or Tender is the Night.  It is that good  Oh what I could have been
The story is set in motion by a recording being heard<br/>By a young boy far away.  Hopefully you will  enjoy this<br/>Book it is sometimes frustrating but hopeful too.
I am confused.  I should have loved this book.  I love WW2 fiction and non-fiction and this book received glowing reviews from thousands of people.  But... I have to say that this is the worst book I've ever read in my life.  I cannot express to you, in words, how boring this book is.  This book just wasn't for me.  This is the only book that I've read in my life that I've actually had to force myself to finish.  Amazon emailed me for my review, so here it is.
I liked the story of the blind character.  The young Nazi story was more difficult to read about.  I think I'm weary of WWII sagas.  That's because I lived "it".
This has to be one of my most favorite books that I have read this year.  4 days after finishing it and I am still savoring the images, characters and story.  Well done.
Stunningly nuanced dance between complete despair and the deep tenderness of human affection. I wouldn't change a word. This is a writer I will seek out again and again.
I really enjoyed this book. Honestly, I enjoy everything that Tony Doerr writes. He is a particularly gifted individual.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to his next work.
Lovely read. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
Very good story line. Worth buying.

Wonderful book. I highly recommend.
A wonderful thought provoking book.
I didn't want this book to be over.
A very good novel - 3.5 stars.  Plot structure is terrific flipping between the bright boy growing up an orphan in a part of Germany near France and the bright blind girl growing up with a devoted father in Paris and then the dénouement of the novel set in the bombing of St Malo in 1944 dropped in from the beginning.  Trigonometry and radio and its waves are a real thing as well as a structural metaphor. Another is an allusion to bees (also as radio static) and collapsed hives leading to errant behaviour is  in there in what WWII did to France and Germany in collapsing the social structure.  Unfortunately the location and backgrounding in the scenes of the boy at a high Nazi German School was a bit too cliché in the dreadfull-ness of impact on the society of boys.  Yes, Conservative totalitarianism leads to the rise of insensitive brutes being in control but more subtly in the story telling would make the novel better.  The weird thing in this novel is that there isn’t any sexual desire in any of the people.  The only sustained non familial affection between characters is between the protective giant German youth Frank and the small boy Werner who is central to the story, but that does not amount to anything sexual – possibly potent in the long run but not conscious.  There is the day the boy and girl spend together where there is a recognition of love as possible, but again, not sexual.

Excellent story very well written.
beautifully written, very engaging story.  There were times I was confused by the way the author jumped from one time period to another.  Overall, the characters were well defined, the perspective of a French girl and a German boy during the World War II years was enlightening.
Did not like the ending. Very sad.
Best historical novel of the year.

I enjoyed every page of this book.
Amazing book, beautifully written.
Loved this novel.  Could hardly wait to see how the author was going to end it.  Brought tears to my eyes and the end, but it was the only way it could have ended.
This book is very well written, I could not put it down. The story shares memories of a time no one wants to relive. I look forward to reading more by Anthony Doer
I enjoyed reading this book over the Christmas holiday.  Loved the flow of words and storyline.  This was not sweet, easy material to read, but thought-provoking.
A beautiful piece of literature.  A new classic that should be read by future generations so as never to forget the hardships of, and the sacrifices made in WWII.
One of the best books I have ever read. I will not ever forget it. I continue to think about the characters and their stories long after I have finished reading.
Marie-Laure -- what a bore.<br/>Pfennig, Werner -- no page turner.<br/><br/>Although this book is beautifully written, shouldn't something interesting happen in a book of  531 pages?  When Humphrey Bogart must part from Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca he says "It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world." Anthony Doerr illustrates this in excruciating detail with a story in which three people race in slow motion towards a fateful meeting which really doesn't deliver much of a payoff, particularly in light of the fact that in order to engineer this meeting he has to enlist a magical, mythical object about which much is said, but little is known.  The fact that the book skips around in time doesn't matter much, because nothing much happens in any of the time segments, and since the book reveals the almost-endpoint at the very beginning, we all know where it's heading from the start. Doerr's descriptions of the the daily lives of French and German people during WWII may be poetic, but it turns out that their lives are no more interesting than our own.  Despite Doerr's efforts to manufacture marvelous fables for our amazement, we find that there are no such things as curses. There is luck, maybe, bad or good. A slight inclination of each day toward success or failure. But no curses.
Book grabbed me the minute I started reading it. Feel in love with the 2 main characters; Werner and Marie Laurie. Felt like I knew them.<br/>Would read again!
You will not read a better book this or any year. What Tony has already done for the short story he has just done for the novel. An astonishment on every level.
Well written and difficult story.

Good story, loved the characters.
Beautifully written story! One of the best books I have read in quite a while. I have been struggling since to find another book as good to read, I'm spoiled.
Poignant, suspenseful and very well-composed, I thoroughly enjoyed this book while also appreciating the deep messaging about the psychological costs of war.
Well written and a page turner.  Hard to put it down once you begin reading it.  Interesting to see WWII life from German, Austrian and French viewpoints...
A beautifully written look at war through the eys of children in two different countries. Interesting characters, descriptive scenes, and plenty of suspense
This was an intriguing story of courage and endurance in the midst of war and deprivation. The survival instinct of the young woman was an intriguing story.
Once I started this book, I had trouble putting it down. It was well written and had many twists and turns. I'm sure I'll be reading it again in the future.
Just as I was involved with one of the main character's story, it switches to the other main character.  I couldn't get absorbed with the constant changes.
Fabulous read - hard to put down
This book is amazing!  Loved it!
I didn't want this book to end!!
A great historical fiction read.
Well-written--an enjoyable read.

The<br/>Enjoyed it very much!!!
Can't put it down, fabulous book
The ending was a disappointment, The author used the prespective of children to describe the horrors of war WWll, The notion that we are connected by six degrees is very clearly manefest in the novel. I like the quick and short chapters and felt it added to the frenetic way we think and children act.
Wonderfully written. Good story.
A better book was never written.
A very interesting view of WWII.

"Wonder" fully written.
An exciting, well written book/
Unforgettable characters and a very textured narrative. So rich and thoughtfully rendered. The language was lyrical and beautiful. A terrific read.
Fantastic characters, great historical setting.  Really enjoyed the authors insight into the human spirit.  Was a good start for my summer reading.
Flip flopping between characters and locations made this very disjointed and distracted from story development. Ending was strange and fragmented.
Spoiler alert!  Don't read very far but even if you do, I suspect much of what I write will not make sense until you read this magnificant book.  Brilliant, lyrical--highlights that even in a criminal society like Nazi Germany individuals can decide no longer to allow the inversion of evil in such societies to influence their actions. Frederick, an unlikely hero, who has earlier told Werner that Werner's mistake was believe his life was his own, ended up saying no, when asked to do yet another senseless act.  Then much later almost at the end of the war, Werner stopped doing the ulitimate good in Nazi Germany, that is, obeying orders, and he acted on his own.  But even more powerful was the circle of how life affirming actions;  the broadcasts made by Marie's uncle before he died from his exposure to mustard gas in WWI, brought Werner to the very place where these broacasts originated from. to track down the resistance movement in many countries...And the wonderful blind heroine who people thought was brave in being blind; her real victory was fully saying "yes" to life...including her blindness and going from there...over and over again.  I have not even touched the giant and the magical (or cursed) jewel....
A great story with compelling characters and terrific, honest  writing.  I highly recommend this one!  It is really unforgettable and satisfying
What a beautiful portrayal of love and commitment in times of war, devastation and chaos.<br/>I visualized so much - am waiting for the movie!
Excellent product and service.
Great story, enjoyed the book.

Excellent! Enjoyed every page.
“Even in darkness it is possible to create light” Elie Wiesel<br/><br/>“Truly, it is in the darkness that one finds the light” Meister Johann Eckhart<br/><br/>If it’s possible for a book to actually exude light, then Doerr’s novel does just that.<br/><br/>Set in Europe during WWII, the book follows the lives of two children, Marie and Werner.<br/><br/>Marie, a young French girl who goes blind at 6 years old loses the light in her world both physically and metaphorically. We follow her journey from Paris to Saint-Malo as the war swirls around her.<br/><br/>Werner is a young German orphan boy with a remarkable talent for fixing radios. It is this talent that will lift him out of the orphanage and set him on a path he could never foresee. In chasing the light of his dream, Werner will instead be thrust into the darkest of places.<br/><br/>As they grow up amidst the turmoil and uncertainty of war, Marie and Werner become both hero and victim, connected to each other in a way neither of them could have predicted.<br/><br/>This is a book to read slowly and savor, for within its pages Doerr has created magic.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is a book you will remember for all the light you CAN see.
After a rocky start(I had trouble connecting with this narrative in the beginning)...I felt ashamed of myself when I finally got hooked. The prose of this author...the descriptions, the metaphors and the similes left me in awe....I suddenly realized that I was in the company of an amazing author....brilliant, beyond literate, and in rarified air. The characters are very well-developed..certainly not one dimension, instilled with human qualities that are at once realistic and understandable; their motivations and their emotions artfully displayed and described by the literary genius of the author. I am not a fan of WWII novels at all but this story personalizes the characters in such a way that as a reader I was able to step into their shoes and boots and experience their fear, ambivalences, and joy. The two protagonists, the blind French Girl and the Nazi youth orphan who is sent to an elite military school because of his innate talents, capture our souls and hearts with their desperations of feeling trapped and not in control of their own destinies. This novel will transport you to a higher plane of knowledge and perception, well beyond your expectations.A real page turner once it hooks you.
Very simply....stunning!<br/><br/>Possibly the best book of the year so far. A tear-jerkier that will leave you appreciating life. Read it.
Nazi Germany stories have been told and retold too many times.  The author's many literary devices nonwithstanding, I am tired of the story.
This book was good from start to finish.  The characters are unique and you like them all.  One of the best books I've read lately!  Try it!
All the rumors are true. What a great read this novel is! The novel offers parallel narratives of two teenagers during WWII. Werner, a German from the coal area, is gifted in math and science and it is his ticket out of the orphanage. Marie-Laure is the blind daughter of the principal locksmith at France's national museum of science in Paris. We know immediately that their stories will intertwine in August 1944 during the siege of Saint-Malo, a fortified town in Brittany perched on the edge of the sea. Doerr's third great and indispensable character is radio, the "wireless", in its many guises: strategic, for entertainment, for edification. I caught myself racing in several parts, "reading for the plot" to find out how this story would end. However, I deliberately slowed down to savor and was I glad that I did. Lovely sentences, greatly descriptive prose that takes you into the psychology of characters far outside your space and time. Laure's blindness makes touch and smell necessary senses to dwell on. Werner is almost disembodied, almost as abstract as the mathematics he uses to locate real people in real space. There's not a stereotype in this novel, lovingly told.
I loved the way the story followed two very different teens during WWII;  the descriptions and writing are fabulous.  Love, love, loved it.
I wish I could give this book 10 stars, it was THAT good! I hardly ever read books, let alone books longer than 350 pages. Doerr does a magnificent job in connecting you to each character and making you really feel like you're living in the 1940's along with them. The mood he sets keeps you intrigued until the very last page. I especially like that he never drags on one persons point of view for longer than 3 or 4 pages. This made it much easier to remember what exactly was going on in each persons life.<br/><br/>++SPOILER++ONLY SCROLL IF YOU FINISHED THE BOOK++++<br/><br/>I really wish Werner hadn't died. Out of anyone (besides Marie Laure) he should have lived a long and healthy life. His smarts could have lead him to great discoveries in the future, and his kindness would have helped many people. His death really was out of the blue, and made me unbelievably sad that he would never see his sister again. Also, I understand that this wasn't a romance book in any way but I really wished he lived and found Marie Laure some years later.<br/><br/>But overall I really did enjoy every minute reading this book. I already gave a copy to my mom to read and I hope she loves it just as much as I did.
I highly recommend this book.
Beautiful and poignant story!
Best book I've read all year.

Book club will love this one.<br/>I s o wish Werner had experienced freedom after desertion. He didn't have the stone to save him.
This book is perfect in every way. Lyrical, exciting, well written, and symphonic with a theme that constantly repeats yet changes.
One beautifully crafted story and simply the most captivating book I have read in a while. Engrossing, beautiful and enlightening!
Incredibly brilliant and moving. It has left me with a loss of words, just the ache and empty feeling from finishing a great book.
Because I've read so many, many books about Nazi Germany, I almost passed this one by. But due to all of the raving reviews I've read, I decided to give it a try. So glad that I did because I almost missed one of my favorite books. This book was pure heaven.<br/><br/>The short chapters make it a very quick read, with many of those chapters cliff hangers. I've read some complaints about how Doerr jumps around in time but I thought it was very clear as to when things were happening.<br/><br/>Usually in war-time novels, there are good guys and bad guys and you know which are which. But the lines were definitely blurred here and while you saw some of the characters doing terrible things, you also saw acts of kindness done by the same men. Doerr did a magnificent job of painting a picture of a young good-hearted German boy, his goals and dreams and how the changes in Germany during that time period effected him and the paths he took in his life.<br/><br/>This book is a literary delight and I believe it will be handed down through the generations as a true classic. I know I'll never forget this one.
Doerr has a deft touch in "All the Light We Cannot See", which allows readers to become immersed in a sad story of lives touching in a time of great turmoil that the characters live through.  While graphic and all too real at times, Doerr's touch is respectful and believable and, I think, shows us that stories of this time, of the people who lived in it need not be just black and white, but that while some were, many other stories were made up of many shades of grey.  This is the strength of the book.  I am not, however, convinced that the parallel story of the diamond works with the rest of the novel beyond being an interesting contrivance.  In short, that part of the story, does not, for this reader at least, add a great deal to the overall movement, and truth, of the novel.  Why the diamond?  Why not something more personal that reveals something mor of on of the characters?  Why not something that remains a mystery?  One wonders, then to what end Doerr included this diamond?  Had that end been less obtuse, this book would have deserved a 5 star review, but as it stands, 4 stars it is.
Wonderful book --leaves a lasting "light" in your mind and heart! Would be enjoyed by someone who knows history of WW11!
Incredible read, captivating from the first page to the very last page. Definitely would love to see this book made into a movie
My comment is for the Editor and all the other Editors and publishers who are encouraging authors to skip back and forth in time with the story and characters.  STOP telling authors to write that way!!!  It is supremely disrupting to the flow of the story and to the enjoyment of the reader!  Eventually, while reading a chopped up sequence, I get very irritated with the editor and the publisher - not with the author who wants to have a best selling book.  I do not mind skipping back and forth between two or three or four characters.  But going back and forth IN TIME fractures the flow of the narrative for the reader.<br/>Our lives do not skip back and forth in time!  And neither should any narrative written by an author.  I am going to share this disappointment with my book group.  We have encountered this before in a book and back then I expressed my displeasure with the reading experience.  This time I will make it abundantly clear that I do not care how many thousands of readers give the book a great rating, I for one will NEVER AGAIN read a book that skips back and forth in time.
This story is beautifully written. Set in WWII in France, the story is told alternately by the two main characters and goes back and forth from their childhoods to the war. Marie-Laure has been blind since age six and her father is a locksmith for the Museum of Natural History in Paris. She tells part of the story. Werner, is a German orphan who has taught himself how to build and repair radios and is accepted into one of Hitler's youth schools. Other important characters include Marie-Laure's great uncle who has stayed inside his house after suffering PTSD during WWI and his housekeeper, who joins the French Resistance and gets Marie-Laure and her great uncle Etienne involved as well. There is also a rare diamond and a German soldier who is seeking it. We follow their stories and see the brief crossing of paths between Marie-Laure and Werner. Marie likes to read Jules Verne in braille to "feel the sentences hoist her up and carry her somewhere else." The story is sad and moving and just beautiful. I received this book free to review from Netgalley and I highly recommend it.
One of the best books I have read in a long time! It is a book I will recommend to friends who like books with a evolving plot.
Hated to see the book end!!

Excellent!  Wonderful read!
Great story.  Well written.
Loved the descriptive prose
I began this book just after reading 'The Nightingale' which may have tainted my opinion of this book somewhat. Like other readers I was off put<br/>by the jumping back and forth between time periods which threw me initially because it seemed pretty far into the book when it first happened.  The author is quite descriptive with all aspects in the book, almost too much so for me.<br/>I just have to ask other readers, did anyone else notice when Werner and Marie Laure have just left the house and go to the ocean, Marie Laure puts the wooden house in the ocean and locks the gate behind them. She then puts the key in Werners hand as they part. Then as Werner ends up sick in the hospital he suddenly has the wooden house in his hand not the key.  I went back and read this several times too make sure I had read it correctly. Page 548 she puts the house in the ocean and pg 550 she gives Werner the gate key. So that kind of faux pas took a lot out of the book for me because I came up with a different ending in my head.<br/>All that being said I still found the book to be entertaining.
Beautifully written. The end was not satisfying, but neither is war satisfying.  There is no happily ever after for any side.
Who could have conceived of a love story between a blind French girl and an orphaned German boy adept at repairing radios during World War II? The girl, Marie-Laure, has first her father, then her great-uncle, Etienne, to help her find her way. Both disappear, and she is left alone. Then Werner, a member of the German Youth Movement, comes into her life. At heart, that is what this book is about.<br/><br/>There is brutality, there is cruelty, but there is also compassion, music, and story-telling. Werner's job is to find and destroy the radios that are transmitting information to the British and the Americans. With the Allied Forces landing on the beaches at Normandy and enemy planes in the air, Werner hears something on the radio that reminds him of the broadcasts he heard when he was in the orphanage.<br/><br/>It is the radio and the things Werner hears that ultimately brings him to the coastal village of Saint-Malo where Marie-Laure is hiding. The music she plays, the stories she "reads," and finally, her cry for help, draw him to her.
The title of All the Light We Cannot See is much like the novel itself: it is a simple picture with layers of meaning. The story unfolds in a series of short snapshots of the lives of various characters, primarily involving the protagonists Werner and Marie Laure, in the years leading up to the invasion of Saint-Malo, France during August of 1944. The genius of the vignettes and the title are the tight connection the author creates between the pair before they ever meet, many of the connections coming as a surprise to the reader. The writing is dense with metaphor, but not in a pretentious way. Mr. Doerr wrote the story over a ten year period and the writing reflects it, aged like a fine wine to a perfect blend of metaphor and flow. The ending may seem a bit anti-climactic when compared to the typical story arc of a novel, but it is necessary in order to send a meaningful message: that we are the sum of our experiences, and that every life leaves a mark on every other life, regardless of the brevity of the contact.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!

A serious read with heart.
A beautiful, lyrical book.
Absolutely loved the book.
I'll start by saying this book (winner of 2015 Pulitzer for fiction) is a much better choice for that award than last year's winner (The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt), But I saw similarities in plots between the two books. The Goldfinch is plotted around the theft/loss of a valuable painting; All the Light We Cannot See plots around the theft?/loss of a diamond. Both valuables are the property of a museum. I suppose there is no "law against" these similarities -- but I just found it odd that two consecutive Pulitzer winners would share this similarity of plot. And, Doerr (like Tartt last year) offers a less-than-robust plot resolution. The story seems to disappear suddenly, leaving the reader feeling dissatisfied and disappointed. I gave this book 3 stars because I liked the protagonist and her character development. Doerr's development of the book's antagonist, a German soldier, is less robust (as noted by a number of other viewers). Overall, this is a book I am glad to have read -- even while feeling less than fully satisfied.
Magnificent!!! I actually caught myself holding my breath at times.I think I may read it again. I highly recommend it.

Beautifully written book.
great spell binding novel
excellent for WW2 stories
It had interesting twists
i loved reading this book
I wasn't sure I wanted to read this book.  Through it, you are gently pushed into the world of training that young German boys were forced to do to become "soldiers" at the end of the war.  Although this section is a bit brutal, Anthony Doerr handles it well, making it possible to read, understand and grasp why this information was foundational to the plot and the relationship that develops between the Sargent and the radio operator.<br/>Even though I knew that the two main characters - the girl and the radio operator - are slowly spinning toward each other's orbits - there is nothing predictable about the how or where or when of this inevitable meeting.<br/><br/>Beyond the beautifully developed characters and the slow, easy development of the plot, Doerr's ability to describe scenes, situations and interactions is stunning.  I enjoyed the book just for his use of language, alone.  Wraped together, all these elements make for a beautiful book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading.
The unfolding of WWII as seen through the experiences of two teenagers; a blind French girl and a gifted German radio tech. This is an interesting story that captures life of ordinary people caught-up in war.  Unfortunately the story jumps around so much that it’s really hard to keep track of things.  It jumps back and forth between the two teenagers and also back and forth in time. I forced myself to finish this story, hoping that there would be a 5 star ending……but there wasn’t.  Can’t believe that this book is an award winner.
one of the best and most profound books I've read in a long time. From first page to last, thoroughly satisfiying.
Anthony Doerr wrote a story of hope and optimism in the midst of unspeakable hardship. This story was very moving.
Scores on all levels. One of the best books so far this year.
Excellent.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.
I'm speechless!  Others have described this book but I want to just say read it read - every word. A masterpiece.
Beautifully written! It's not often that a story can bring me to tears. Bravo Anthony Doerr, I am a fan for life!
Really enjoyed this book

Story would have been better if the chapters were not so chopped up bouncing the various time lines and people.
Beautifully written.  You fall in love with the characters of this book.  I didn't want it to end!  Great read.
Five stars are really not enough to show my appreciation for this book. This book is about what different people take out of the war experience. There are the individuals that look at war as a path to power, as a path for wealth, as a path to overcome one's own weaknesses. All of these are represented in this book. There is also all those others for whom war forces unwanted experiences and these are the majority of people who are forced to experience a war. This book is not only about those people who experience WW2. It is about every person who experienced wars before that and every person who has experienced war since then. The soldiers who have come back from the Middle East and those that must live through the experience of the war in their backyard experience what this book tells us about. Every person should read this book, especially politicians and generals. Maybe they can be brought to understand the negative impacts of the war experience.
I love historical fiction & this delivered! The characters were so vivid. I really enjoyed it to the very end!
This is a delicately written tale that conjures up a beautiful castle town on the French coast, and the small world inhabited by a young blind girl and a German boy; two delicate souls who are struggling to survive World War II. Just when the story, and their intersecting fates, begin to resemble a fairy tale, the author interjects some probably realism. I would have been happy with the fairy tale. But this is a small quibble, and I was carried along by the wondrous writing, and sentences of sheer luminosity that suspend this tale in a class all its own. For young adolescents, this story might have a particular resonance, as the main character is a teenaged girl who is using all of her resources in a dangerous conflict, with the added handicap of blindness. And the other character is a gentle, intelligent young man who is trying to preserve his humanity in the face of the toxic vision of masculinity that has been laid out for him.
If there is any theme unfolding in most of the books I have read, it is WW2. Fiction, mysteries, histories, biography -- I've read many of them. This book ranks along with "Sophie's Choice" for being the best.  Why? WW2 has been written about from every possible angle.  Challenged to write a WW2 book, you would have difficulty finding a field that has not been plowed.  Usually many times over.<br/><br/>This novel finds fresh ground, mostly because the two main characters are French and German children.  And the French girl is blind.  The German boy is small and geekish, talented in math.  Toward the end of the novel, after he has been drafted into the German army, he learns how to triangulate partisan broadcasts from hidden transmitters on German controlled territory.  And the tales of the French girl and the German boy are told in beautifully crafted languages. It's also gripping every step of the way.  Gardiner Davis
Absolutely wonderful book. Thought provoking, touching, and incredibly well-written.  Order, open and enjoy!
I would highly recommend this book if you want to feel what it means to survive in a world against all odds.
I thought the book was ok. Within this genre, I much preferred "Invisible Bridge" by Julie Orringer.
One of the best books of the year.  I just loved it.  Not the run of the mill novel.  I highly recommend it.
I wanted so much to see what happened, and now I am so sorry that I have finished it.  what a terrific book!
Such a good story. I could not put this book down. It is long, but totally worth the time it takes to read.

Beautiful but sad story
Compelling. Insightful.
An excellent development of two very different characters, a blind French girl and a very intellectually alive German boy as they were impacted by and brought their own impact in a small way on the 2nd World War in Europe.  Doerr moves from the scenario behind each of these main characters, with two or three sub-plots.  The communication system which the German boy 'managed' in his small way is juxtaposed by the humanitarian concerns of the blind girl finding her way around a new city St Malo, in order to keep herself and others alive, again with a communication system, run by her uncle, that kept them in touch with the wider world.<br/>This is a grim story interweaving two very different lives while keeping the reader's interest on high alert.  It could be a documentary, well researched. I await the film version.  It reminded me of Louis de Bernieres novel about two middle Eastern boys as friends.
Can't say enough great things about this book.  I read all of it in about 60 hours. Such a poignant story of young, naive German boy growing up in an orphanage before the War and how the politics of the times shaped his young life. The author weaves a beautiful parallel story of a young girl in France, and an interesting look at how they are both affected by the same events.  I found myself feeling like I was reading an actual biography, and wishing my grandfather (US veteran stationed throughout Europe during WWI, working on tanks and vehicles) was still alive so I could ask questions about his own experiences moving from place to place. (When he was alive, I was much too young to appreciate the gravity of what he had been through, and didn't know the "right" questions to ask.)  It is also a great reminder about how powerful a tool HOPE is, even in the darkest and gravest of circumstances.
Too many extraneous details and shifted focus too often
I didn't like the way the book jumped around and the clarity was missing in how the transitions worked.
The best  book I have ever read! It was like a brand new book & in excellent condition! Thanks so much!
A beautiful story during an ugly time.  So many great things about this book. I did not want it to end.
Here is a weaving of the lives of two young people whose lives were affected greatly by WWII.  The title was well places as each was affected by knowledge gained, not from light but from experience.  The plot is complex with a mysterious overtone of a cursed diamond.  The reader is gifted with insight of both Germany and France at that time.  The reader follows the plot as each of these people's lives comes closer and closer together.  The time frame of the book tends to move forward and backward and about two thirds into the book, becomes somewhat muddled.  The book brings the reader up to the present day and introduces life after the war.  When asked the basic moral premise of the book, however, it is hard to determine.  The overall purpose (other than the narrative) escaped me - maybe that is because, once over and done, it is difficult to determine the purpose of a war.
My book club loved it!

Really loved this book
I have mixed feelings about this book.  On one hand, the story sucked me in early, and the author did a wonderful job of creating characters I really liked and with whom I felt deep empathy.  The blind girl was a wonderful character in particular.  But as the story progressed, it started to become tedious and lose its way.  I finished the book, but not without struggle.  I thought the 'cursed' diamond backstory was a little odd, and seemed to unceremoniously fizzle out.  I also was unable to suspend my disbelief when the young blind girl's father created an exact replica of not one, but two entire villages, entirely by carving them out of wood.  I realize that might be petty, but it bothered me through the book.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; this is a good, very well written book.  But with the thousands and thousands of 5-star reviews and Pulitzer nod, I guess I expected more.
I read most of this book some time ago and had to quit very close to the end. I still cannot understand the critics' and publics' love for this book. All I can do is recommend that people read the one star reviews since most of them are right on.
Very simplistic. Couldn't connect with the subjects. Writing was bland and does not engage reader..
Great novel. Loved every page. Selling on my site so someone else can have the chance to enjoy it!
This book is a stunning piece of literature, from the beautiful words to the interweaving of characters and plotlines. I appreciated the fact that the book didn't portray all the Germans as one-deminsional racist war mongers. They too were at the mercy of the Nazi regime. The only thing that keeps me from giving this book five stars is the style of jumping back and forth between characters and between time periods. I always find this jarring and especially disconcerting as it was done here, often in two-page increments. It sometimes caused me to lose interest...to have to stop and think..."which character is this now?" I also felt the ending wrapped up a little too quickly, and could have used a little more depth. Would I have preferred a happier ending....? Sure!  But I'm not the one who wrote this book.  Overall:  a wonderful read.
A page turner.  Compeller might be a better word.  I think I'll invent it on the spot.  I was compelled to read this book once I started and I could not slow down until near the end.  The dual stories and flipping back and forth in time was masterfully done, though I had misgivings about the fanciful facet of the story in the cursed diamond, but I got aboard that train also and didn't ask for a refund.<br/>But once the action reached a climax in Saint-Malo and Werner was finally compelled to act on the better part of his nature,  the rest seemed like a long, long epilog and that perhaps Anthony Doerr was so taken with his characters that he could not let them go.  I feel it was too long, but this is a small complaint as the bulk of it was more riveting than most of the books I have read this year.<br/>John Vazquez, author of 'Gaten's Way'.
Amazing! If you only read one book this year, read this one. If you only read two, read it twice.

Compelling, engaging.
Interesting premise .
beautiful but long...
Could not put it down
The prose was beautiful.  The reader was set in place and time.  However, the story was tedious.
There were some interesting story lines but it seemed repetitive. I was never intrigued by book.
I too, as others have stated, was looking forward to this novel. I enjoy reading about historical periods and learning how people of different eras coped with the issues of their times.  This just did not connect for me.  The two main characters are quite separate throughout the story until the very end.  The parts where we learn how Marie and her father and then her uncle, withstood the Nazi occupation of France were of interest as they brought to life some of the historical reporting of that period.  The parts involving Werner and his sister in Germany as they cope without parents to find a place in the mobilization of their country to war were all of interest but we never seemed to find a point for these two stories to really connect.  A lot of potential for the premise of the story line but I just didn't feel it succeeded.
I thought I would at least like this book. I didn't. I glanced here at the one-star ratings and agree with them all. If you appreciate well-written literature, this isn't it. It's as if a great writer with a wonderful idea had the book taken from them and turned into a third-grade reader. Short choppy chapters. Fourth-grade vocabulary in six-word simple sentences. I thought this was a literary device to speed one into the plot at a good pace, but it continued through the book. No meat to the writing at. With such an ambitions and imaginative plot, one expects some depth to the actual writing. That is why I buy a novel. Not Cliff's notes or a movie. If you like to sit down with a cup of coffee, read some light fluff and be done by Monday, maybe this is a book for you. If you enjoy reading well-crafted English prose, it isn't.
This is truly a must read for those who not only enjoy a good story but good writing as well.  As the author follows the lives of two different young people from two different places, living in different circumstances, the reader is drawn into Europe during WWII.  How the war affects both of these characters, one a blind girl who lives in Paris with her father and the other, a young boy swept into the Nazi movement due to his brilliance with radios and communications, is revealed through a fast paced revelation of how each is personally affected by the war.  The author switches from one character to the other allowing the reader to understand how concurrent historical events affect each one.  Choices must be made by the protagonists in the story during a war that affects their loved ones and themselves.  A powerful read!
This book is depressing (obviously, it's about war) and slow to develop plot of interest, and over-written. The same concerts and mini-plots over and over and over. I finished only because I felt obliged, as my husband loved it.
What a story!  I love a book that starts in different places with different characters and shows how their lives intersect.  How many times in our lives does a moment with someone previously a stranger, someone you never see again, change your life?  Doesn't it happen to all of us?? - albeit not always quite so dramatically as these two characters in the waning months of WWII.<br/><br/>If you're a techie, you'll enjoy the back story of how radios affected life in the 1930's and during the war.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the nature of locks, puzzles and museum collections, you'll enjoy THAT part of the back story.<br/><br/>If you are a WWII buff, the battle for this town in France, 2 months after the Normandy invasion, is fascinating.<br/><br/>If you love great characters, and a great story, this is the book for you.
Absolutely wonderful story.  First-rate writing.  I was a little dubious about reading this at first---due to description of its dealing with a blind French girl and young German male in World War II.  Thought perhaps it would be a trivial, unlikely, forced story, but that is not the case.<br/><br/>One of the strengths lies in the settings.  Bleak German mining town, bleaker still elite Nazi military school, Paris right before and during German invasion, and then coastal French town.  The other would be some of the most memorable characters---German and French---along with their struggles to gain meaning in this most difficult of times.  We experience the strength of family bonds and our need for illumination----intellectual and physical.<br/><br/>This is a book which will stay with the reader over time.  Excellent
Wow, this is an outstanding accomplishment!  This author has crafted the vivid scenes, fascinating and different characters, and the tight writing style SO well that midnight comes and you can't, you just can't close the book. There is nothing in it trite or familiar or overdone. Ideas are fresh. The prose, admirably written, is in surprisingly short short chapters. You are transported between two young lives, one in France, the other in Nazi Germany. You could read a complete book about each of these characters, and you want to know more about each, yet you get teased by little bits of their lives, revealed slowly, slowly,.... until you you want to yell at the book!  "Tell me!"  I so admire this author's style that I shall be certain to look for his next novel.....no matter what he chooses to write about!
My Father fought in WWII so this story was especially poignant to me. If there is to be a "war story", let it be one about "real" people that live in the war. The characters in this story were so wonderful and true. Doerr was very successful in making you walk in their shoes and demonstrate how profoundly the war changed their lives. I felt like I could smell and breath the air around them, their fear, their joy, their tragedies. And of course, not everyone lives happily ever after and you want so much that they do because after living through a war, you should at least have that going for you, right? The advantage of audible is you don't get the pages wet from your tears.<br/><br/>I think these characters will stay with you for a long time to come. You can't say that about every story you read.
After reading this book I have decided to become a novelist. And why wouldn't I? I get to spend my days with my thoughts and imagination. I get accolades in all the major newspapers and literary publications. I'll make a nice living too.<br/><br/>And in my off-time--because I'm more than just a great writer--I've decided to play in Wimbledon in 2015. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting to win it, but I do think a trip to the Semi-Finals in realistic. [I saw Roger Federer play a few matches and the obvious conclusion was: "How easy is this game?!"]<br/><br/>Doerr makes it seem too easy; what an incredible writer. Every page I read in this beautiful story about the choices we make in the face of fate was effortless, graceful and intelligent.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
This book is not perfect, but it is beautifully written overall and an immersive experience. When I finished the last page, I smiled, looked out the window and took a moment to enjoy a beautiful morning because this book put me in such a good, appreciative mood. Although the book is long and the chronology is all jumbled up, you soon get used to it and take your time savoring the well drawn characters and the details of their lives. I am an impatient reader and usually move on if I am not intrigued by page 50. I also get tired of overly descriptive prose and writers who take too many trips to the thesaurus to insert uncommon words to make them seem literate. Here, a few passages were overly ornate, but overall the detail and carefully crafted pages were a rare confection for appreciative readers. Well done.
This book was disappointing! The writer is very talented but the storyline was lame! I will not recommend this book.
I must add to the over 4,000 5 star reviews of this book.  Read it.  You will not regret the time it takes you to read this book.  In fact, it won't take you long because it's one of those books you start to read and then end up staying up all night to finish, fall asleep with the words on your forehead, and then pick it back up in the early morning to complete.<br/>Then, you'll convince someone else to borrow it, read it. Fast. Because you'll want to read it again.<br/><br/>If you love historical fiction, or if you're interested in another perspective of how World War II could have possibly impacted people, just buy the book.  I first borrowed it from the library and the day I finished it, I bought it on Amazon to be a part of my permanent collection of "must read again and share" books.
Living with a refugee who saw it, World War 2, I hear in this book a compelling counterpoint that is right on the mark. We are taken through a child's eyes to pre-war Germany, a military machine subtly building around an Orphanage and then to a museum in Paris where a blind girl's father builds a safe harbor that is about to collapse. Slowly we follow these two stories to their inevitable fate in St. Malo shortly after the allied invasion. And then, Doer follows the characters to a point where we really know how humanity survives in the shreds of its experience.<br/>I almost put this book down in the early chapters, so now I will go back and re-read them. If you become impatient do persist and you will be rewarded with a book that I hope will become a classic, like All Quiet on the Western Front.
Truly an incredible novel. Unlike some of the critics, I do not have a problem with the fact that the story was non-chronological. I thought it added depth to the story and helped me understand their motivations. The story was rich and the characters stunning, their personalities fully developed. I was especially impressed by Marie-Laure and Daniel Leblac, whose relationship provided a great focal point for the novel and was pretty unique among the novels I've read. Doerr incorporated several sub-plots into the story but tied them all up nicely. Finally, the writing style is impeccable and the sentences luminous, conveying details that provide a breathtaking picture. Finally, I really enjoyed the relationship that formed between Marie-Laure and Warner, even though it takes a while to be realized.
A lovely story, well told, page-turner but overrated and ultimately disappointing.  Everything is cute.  The characters are cute.  The story is cute, the writing is so cute, at times it's overblown.  How can you not help but love the pretty, freckled face, blind, little French orphan who is oh so courageous and the small, smart, technically astute little German boy who ultimately saves her and then........the characters are one -dimensional, either impossibly good or rather bad.  The book is written in short confusing chapters, some less than half a page and jumps from scene to scene and year to year and one longs for some meat to get one's hooks into.  Tedious really.  The book overflows with connections reminiscent of Jack and Jill stories.  I would recommend the book for early adolescence.

Having seen this book listed on many groups of 2014's 'best of', I picked it up and eased into as the weekend began.  Little did I know  the effect that the lilting voices of Werner and Marie-Laure would have.  Interlaced passages beginning with "present day" August 1944 and flash-backs to their youth, working up through their eventual- all too brief- intersection in Saint-Malo.<br/><br/>There are some negatives, assuredly (I found the most off-putting being not the all-too-close-to-home deaths that occur during war-time but, rather) the Star-Trek Red Shirt manner that 1 occurred.  That one negative implementation detail-necessary, I'm sure, to the story as a whole, can not take away from the brilliance of the rest of it.<br/><br/>Most excellent.  Get it.  Read it.  Enjoy it.
I found this book difficult to set down to do anything. The stories were well balanced and distributed between characters and periods of time. The writing of each story in non sequential telling was a real draw as each time the story line would draw me in, I would suddenly  find myself having to switch gears only to be drawn in again and then suddenly returned to the story at a different moment in time. All masterfully written and intertwined. Beyond the mechanics of the story structure this was a powerful story about WWII as it pertained to, primarily, the lives of two young individuals and how what one does today has an effect on tomorrow whether it was our intention to do so or not. Extremely poignant,  thought-provoking, heartbreaking, and restorative. I highly recommend this book.
A beautifully written novel set in France and Germany before, during, and after World War II. An original take on the traditional "war is hell" story, centered around two young protagonists, one French the other German, connected mainly by sound (one is blind, the other an avid radio listener) and thrown together by circumstances beyond their -- or anyone's -- control. The story line bounces between locations as well as moving backward and forward in time, thus requiring close attention by the reader, but the narrative is clear and even suspenseful and the main event -- the invasion by the Allies of the French coastal town of Saint Malo in 1944 -- is powerful enough to serve as the center around which the disparate plot elements revolve in intricate and intersecting orbits.
I think this is the second time I've given a book a five star rating. Anthony Doerr's work is sheer brilliance. This is one of those pieces that reminds you of the ability of language to transcend simple words and phrases. Every once in awhile, a writer is able to tap into something "other".<br/>I lost count of how many times my heart beat madly in my chest while reading - at times in feeling the soul wrenching loss experienced by the characters, at times from the infrequent rays of hope, at times from sheer suspense. Mostly, my heart beat faster at the experience of Doerr's mastery of words.<br/>I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and this may be the best I've read, but "All the Light We Cannot See" transcends genre. If you love a well told story, it's for you.
This novel is a true masterpiece. Simply mesmerizing, and often heart-wrenching, from start to finish.  From the settings, to the characters, to the historical context, every aspect is deep, complex, and meticulously detailed and well-developed. The overall effect is that the reader is not simply observing a story, but feeling and experiencing it and the characters' motivations, fears, doubts, sorrows and triumphs within it.  The ultimate result is that, within this story and through its characters, the reader deeply experiences the every day lives of ordinary people swept up in the horrific events and tragedies of The Second World War and the struggles, both internal and external, that they went through both before, during, and after the War.  Simply a remarkable piece of work.

The story of a blind French girl caught up in World<br/><br/>War II and an orphan German boy forced into  a  war that violated his common beliefs  by his County's deranged leaders provides a view of what happened to each country's children. How they survive using what was available to each one will open the readers mind to look around their environment. It is a book that reveals the character of each of the individuals created in the book and what they had to do to survive. Many people conquered fears that ruled them and others let those fears rule them.<br/>A book that transported me to a time that changed the world forever. It is a time that teaches history will repeat its self as long as man wants to play power over others at all cost games.
The book was a long and detailed read, so I almost gave up on finishing it, which is the impatient part of my character.  I am glad that I did not because the overall message was well worth my effort.  Mr. Doerr successfully transplants the reader into the lives of Werner and Marie Laure - their challenges of etching out separate childhood existences in WWII war torn Germany and France.  I took from this story the sensitivity required to live as result from blindness and the lonliness a child must rise from when orphaned.  They meet briefly near the end of their journeys, but it is intense and memorable.  My advice to future readers:  relax, take your time and enjoy the journey you take with two unique characters - your time will be well spent.
This book was a wonderful insight into the terrible emotional toll WW 2 took on all who were drawn in. The young German soldier who was conscripted from his orphanage was really a gentle lad who was devastated by what his army was doing. We follow  him from childhood until the end of the war, and meet his sister, a few fellow soldiers, and the blind French girl he encounters. The theme, " what they could have been" echos throughout the story.<br/>the parallel story of the blind girl and her father and uncle was equally engaging. they endured great hardship in their escape from Paris and travel to the coastal town which became one of the last battlegrounds of the war.<br/>I was pulled into this story and could not put the book down.
As one who holds a PhD in literature, I have read lots of books, many that have passed the test of time; many that represent the best of various literary movements; many that have won Nobel prizes.  However, I can't remember one that captured my attention and nourished my soul as much as All the Light We Cannot See.  It is one of the the best books I have ever read!  When I finished reading it the first time, I went right back to the beginning and started reading it again--the second time just to experience the author's language without having to worry about keeping up with his story or the jumbled time sequence around which he structures the story. It is a magnificent accomplishment in every way.  My highest compliments to Anthony Doerr.
Bloated and descriptive to a fault. What a shame Doerr took ten years of his life to write this tome. He could have written four really GOOD novels in that time. I feel like I've read this story a hundred times before. Predictable, but Doerr tries to hide that within the lengthy confines of 500+ dense pages of words and more words, This book could have been (well) written in less than 200 pages. The first 400+ pages felt like an overblown prelude to the long-awaited meeting between Werner and Marie-Laure...and then what a letdown that was! And what was really the purpose of the "Sea of Flames"? An excuse for a sub-plot? Not hard to believe that this won a Pulitzer. Apparently, in the mind of the judges, quantity equals quality.
Beautifully written. Highly emotional content. Caution required.<br/><br/>I don’t read many novels any more - mostly history and non-fiction. However I bought this book because it was a best seller for so long and had so many rave reviews. The raves were right: For literary excellence it deserves every one of them - a five star book by any standard of excellence. However, I found the story so emotional that emotions and experiences -  stuff that I thought had been locked away since 1945 -  bubbled back to the surface and once again is disturbing me. So if you are one of the many who put in four years of service in some capacity somewhere during those years I think it best that you either pass on this one or read it with caution.
Anthony Doerr has writing style that far surpasses most authors. He takes you on a journey using a high caliber of vocabulary with descriptive words and passages allowing the most impressive imagery to appear before you. The story is about a blind French girl and a German boy during WWII. As a reader you are able to see and feel the daily life of the blind girl. You feel blind yourself. There is a tug of compassion for the German boy and the choices he feels he must make. The French girl may literally be blind but most humans are blind even though they can see. Blind to the atrocities that war can bring and the harm it can do to all lives. A profound read with depth, ponderous thoughts and a wondrous knowledge of the human nature.
Brilliant.  I had to force myself to read slowly so that the book could last longer.
Such resilience in how humans sustain lives...a quiet impact that keeps resurfacing!
Just an absolutely wonderful book. It focused on a aspect of WW II that have never considered, the human, or civilian side of the conflict. I loved the storyline concerning two young people trapped in a cruel and destructive war. The courage of the blind girl was unbelievable and the early resolve of the young German boy made the story very, very entertaining. I also loved the way the book was put together. I absolutely loved how it switched not only from character to character, but also switched from one time period to a different time period and in the end it all made sense. The way the author defined his characters was amazing, the characters came alive for me. Can't recommend it enough to anyone that likes a truly good book.
A thought provoking story of two young people trying to understand the evolving days of World War II within the culture of Hitler's developing Third Reich and France's fear of demolition.  Beautifully written with simplicity that makes it easy to read and yet with such depth that one is swept along in the story as if it was you living at that time.  It is difficult to put down once you begin to read and realize where you are in history.  I was looking for a book that would take me away from the wonderful John Grisham and John Sandford and their delightful murder mysteries to experience a different writing style hoping that I would find something that would take my breath away.  Anthony Doerr did exactly that.  What a treasure.
I absolutely loved this book, and I am in awe of the research and thought that must have gone into constructing such a story. If you're into historical fiction, WWII, France, Germany, science, marine biology, geology, love, sociology, culture, and/or stories of survival...do yourself a favor and add it to your reading list. Author JR Moehringer said it best: "Anthony Doerr sees the world as a scientist, but feels it as a poet. He knows about everything—radios, diamonds, mollusks, birds, flowers, locks, guns—but he also writes a line so beautiful, creates an image or scene so haunting, it makes you think forever differently about the big things—love, fear, cruelty, kindness, the countless facets of the human heart."
I found it interesting to pursue a lesser known aspect of WWII and it's impact on a small town. It was an intimate story of the lives of a small group of people.  We all know the horrors of WWII which is most often conveyed via the unimaginable plight of the Holocaust.  This story took a different direction while acknowledging the horrors.<br/><br/>I thought the character development was great.  I had a little time tracking the first several chapters until I realized the back/forth the author was describing.  The author built enough tension that I was compelled to keep reading later into the night than I wanted to!<br/><br/>The format was very short chapters of 4 or 5 pages.  I liked that as well.  It was a good read.
Far too often, I choose light-weight reading as I read to escape the everyday. Not always, however, and this week I fortunately plucked this novel from my ever-growing list of must-reads.  One of the attractions was its pleasing, engrossing length. It is very well-constructed--so well that one feels it is the only way the story could be, and I found myself surprised quite far in to recognize the parallels. The experience of war here is sufficiently harrowing to allow the experience without being so dreadful that one cannot read it.  The lives unfold as lives do, with sweet moments in the midst of dreadful circumstances, and the wise among us choosing to make the best of the good while putting aside the rest. Poignant.
I was almost reluctant to write a review of a book of which so many thoughtful reviews have already been written, but was so completely engaged by it that I must. What would the perspective of the blind protagonist, young Marie-Louise, be, I wondered. Would her view of the world be limited in some way? It is anything but. She senses the world around her fully and faces it, in the middle of WWll with no fear and great alacrity. Her story is told in parallel to that of a German orphan, Werner, and their lives touch and overlap before they ever have a chance to meet. This is a touching story of occupied France in the Second World War and also the story of an impossible young love and a yearning for a life not yet lived.
I have the biggest crush on Anthony Doerr's writing.  He is a brilliant welder of words and teller of tales. ATLWCS is a tender, lovely, gut-punch-painful, magical world you'll live in alongside the characters.  It's that good.  Read it.  It is soooooo very, very, very [enter here any superlative akin to *astoundingly awesome*].  It will change you, and you'll be the better for it.<br/>Wanting more of this wordbalm (you'll want more after you've read this treasure), I purchased two more of Doerr's books, About Grace and the Shell Collector.  Skip AG, as it nearly crushed my affection for Doerr's storytelling, but treat yo' self to the SC, as it is assemblage of masterfully crafted shorts, as spellbinding as ATLWCS.
This book was so lyrical and wonderfully written that I was sorry to see it end.  It is very sad in places...how could a book about WWII (or any war) not be depressing and sad?  There were lovable characters and others that were truly evil.  Marie Laure, French, and Werner,  German, were destined to meet, but the meeting is not what one expects by the encounter of these two.  Doerr's descriptions made one feel, see and hear the scenes portrayed in the book.  The short chapters urge one to go to the next one.  Characters, places and times alternate in the chapters, but it is not at all distracting and makes the narrative all the more interesting and alive.  My highest recommendation for All the Light We Cannot See.
Love a historical fiction that inter wines history with enduring plot! Great read!
One of my top two books read in 2014 (along with Valley of Amazement). I must admit that I shed a tear or two while reading this book. The title alone had me deep in thought long after I finished the book. All the Light We Cannot See shows the tenderness and compassion in people who are in the depths of war and evil. The struggle between goodness overcoming darkness in Germany's attempt at global domination were clearly displayed. I was surprised by this books beautiful character development.  The characters were so wonderfully complex: Marie and Werner. I particularly liked Anthony Doerr's perspective on Marie's blindness. It was a character piece that I have not read previously. I recommend this book to all.
All the Light We Cannot See: A Novel is the best novel that I have read in a long time! Set in World War II Europe, the action alternates between a young German soldier and a blind French girl, Marie-Laure, who lives with her father in Paris but is evacuated to St. Malo, as the Germans conquer France. Werner, the German boy, is strategically placed throughout the war in a company of soldiers who depend upon his radio skill. He eventually ends up in St. Malo while it is being overrun by Germans. He has become disillusioned with the Nazi dogma and obsessed with the memory of a murdered girl he saw in Paris. His encounter with Marie-Laure is the climax of this beautifully-crafted novel. I could not put it down!

I'm reading this book a little at a time, during my 20-minute bus ride to and from work.  I love every moment of it so far, even the horrible moments. World War II has long been one of my favorite book and movie subjects, because authors and screenwriters seem never to run out of fresh perspectives on the horrors or the heroism.  Never before have I read a more vivid description of the sounds and terror of an invasion.  The characters - from the highly intelligent, blind Marie-Laure, to Werner, who is recruited for special training by the Nazis because of his talent for building and fixing radios, to the actual Nazi characters themselves, are all drawn as realistically and sympathetically as possible.
Disappointing.  Skips around too much and they never really have a relationship.
WWII historical fiction is my favorite genre.  There were too many story lines and characters to keep straight and the short chapters that would jump back in forth between story lines were frustrating. Then it would be many chapters before revisiting a story line and it was difficult to keep straight.  The jumping back and forth between years was frustrating, especially when it became certain days and months. I skimmed the last two hundred pages because of the 18,000 positive reviews. I thought maybe it would come together beautifully at the end.  I didn't think it did. I am still bewildered as to why the book got such positive reviews. Maybe there was too much hype and I expected too much!
This was a page turner for me. I won't go into a lengthy summary like many reviewers do here, it's not necessary. What I will tell you is that Anthony Doerr has done an exceptional job of telling a story about the loss of innocence, the loss of life's simple moments, and the loss of all the things most people--including those that were suddenly thrown into WWII--take for granted every day. There are lessons of love, family, courage, and having faith in the the things we cannot see (both literally and figuratively). Doerr has written a story about the sometimes beautiful, sometimes horrific and sometimes ironic way in which lives collided during WWII. It's a great read. Fast and enjoyable.
I really loved the writing in this book.  The story pulled me in and was provocative, but the prose.....wow. Perhaps because the main character is blind, the author was so beautifully descriptive. I found myself underlining whole sentences, stopping to re-read a line or simply visualize the words, the scene.  He did a fabulous and realistic job of telling the story of war, allowing the characters to be afraid, anxious, angry and even jaded.<br/><br/>The story had me until the end.  I find myself wishing the author had not filled in the gaps of some characters. (Trying not to spoil, here) but he jumped ahead 40 years to tell me what had transpired. I would have rather been left wondering
This compelling novel is yet another perspective on the horrors of the occupation and the unthinkable trama expecienced by the French and Germans alike.  At some point early in the story it was clear that the two young principal characters would some day meet for the sake of the fullfillment of their shared destiny.  Saving that meeting to the near end gave much suspense and kept me rivited to my reading.  The postlog softened the tragic ending of the boy soldier as well as giving me closure of the young blind girl who was able to live productively in post war France after WWII.  Be prepared to remember one of the worst times in the history of our modern world.  But we must never forget.
I loved the opening. It puts the reader right into the center of action and that action is alarming.<br/><br/>When the book then steps back in time to trace the path back to the action, I groaned. Why do these books always start out strong and then step back for personal history? I groaned but I got over it quick enough. It didn’t drop back to be tedious.<br/><br/>The back story of both the deaf and the blind teenager is fully engaging.<br/><br/>And then there’s the cursed gem… oh yeah, there’s a cursed diamond. I love cursed relics.<br/><br/>This book has so many things to like and a whole bunch more to love, like the diamond.  Can I put that on my Wishlist? I’m not afraid.
This is a beautifully written book, and somehow the writing brought clear visual images.  I could see how the house was, could probably draw it(!) and this was true of each area, village and of course the characters, all of whom were richly created.  The story jumps a lot.  I had no problem with each chapter referring to the boy, and then the girl, but felt that I'd have enjoyed the narrative better had the author not also jumped back and forth in the years.  I wanted to be surprised, but we were given insights into the future, so I knew that things were not going too go well.  Having said this, I'd ask readers to please put this very lovely novel on their list, it's so worthwhile.
If I could give this book more than 5 stars, I certainly would.  It is such a wonderful story.  Actually it is two distinct stories.  One story is about a blind French girl, and the other story is about a German orphan.  The story takes place just before world war 2 and continues during and after the war.<br/>  The author is a fabulous writer.  He writes about one character and then alternates with the other one.  As a reader, you really feel interest and concern for both characters.  As the stories progress, the lives of both characters intersect near the conclusion of the story.<br/>  This story will become a classic.  It is that good, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to all.
A very satisfying read. The story is intricately woven and revealed piece by piece with care and constraint--much like one of Marie Laure's father's puzzles. The atmosphere and characters of a European village under WWII Nazi occupation are rendered in an authentic voice. The tragic life of Werner illustrates skillfully how some young, innocent people got caught up in their country's madness--with no easy way out. If "All the Light We Cannot See" is turned into a movie, I hope the author will be closely involved in its production. I'd be afraid to give such a jewel of a story to Hollywood. But, if done well, it's going to make for a magnificent movie. Chapeau to Mr. Anthony Doerr!
My favorite book of the year. Beautifully written and thought out. I loved it.
Wonderful book with such texture and style.  I really enjoyed this book. It I'd hard to put down so I suggest you start reading over the course of 2-2 weeks
This has been my first book by Anthony Doerr, and I have been very surprised by his talents!  Will definitely recommend it.
I have read many novels set against the backdrop of WWII.  This is one of the best.  Excellent characterizations.  The descriptions of learning while blind were very interesting, and rang true. I recommend this book to readers of fiction.
I was so expecting this to be a winner for me. I loved the look of this book, loved the title, loved the feel of it in my hands when I finally obtained it, but  I was stunned at how disappointed this turned out to be. I so wanted to enjoy it; I kept turning the pages, awed, at first,  by all this lengthy description. But that is exactly what I found so problematic. It's so heavy on every minute detail, you forget if this is an actual story, with something to say.<br/><br/>There's so much unnecessary description, I felt bogged down and finally gave up at about page 300. I gave it a good shot, and I know I am a lone dissenter here, but the hype makes me all the more skeptical.

Outstanding read!
Great story line.
Big themes, great story, beautiful writing: what more could one want? Anthony Doerr has created memorable characters in a dramatic setting--Europe (mostly France and Germany) in World War II. Marie-Laure is a blind 12-year old in 1940; Werner is a 14-year old recruited into Hitler's yourth movement. Altough their stories do not intersect until after D-Day, the reader is constantly making comparisons, as their respective lives unfold. Doerr does a magnificent job of evoking the privations of war, the choices forced upon the characters, the moral issues at stake. The writing is poetic, suspenseful, and emotional. One of the best books I've read in the past year.
Don't pass this book by,  The writer gives a very unique perspective of WW  II, mostly from the experiences of two main characters that the reader will come to love.  Their haunting experiences are followed from early childhood into early adulthood, Marie-Lauren finds herself challenged not only by her blindness, but also by the relentless effects of the war on her loved ones and her beloved country, France, Werner is a victim of the hardships he encounters first as a very poor child living in totalitarian, Germany and later as a soldier involved in covert intelligence work.  How the  author entwines the lives of these two divergent characters is masterful.
Beautifully, delicately told story of the light we carry within us, even in the darkest days.  Firmly rooted in the reality of war, this is no fairy tale, but a touching account of the realities and the sense we can make, or not make, of them.  Initially, I refrained from reading this book at bedtime, worried that the brutalities would disturb my sleep.  I soon realized, though, that there was something ineffably beautiful being created in the midst of this story of destruction and death, and finally could not put it down.<br/>Believe me, I am a pacifist and do not like war stories, no matter the perspective.  This, however, I will recommend to everyone.
This book was beautifully written. Initially I found it difficult differentiating the time periods, but I soon got into the flow. The author painted such beautiful images with his words. The characters were well-drawn and complete...poignant Marie-Laure, conflicted Werner, kind and loving Monsieur LeBlanc and endearing Uncle Etienne. They got under my skin and I didn't want to let them go.  Their stories kept me reading until late into the night. Did I foresee the ending? Yes. Did I want that outcome? No! But I knew that it had to be and I finally made peace with it because I knew it was what brought peace to that character. This was just an amazing book.
I loved this book. This is the first book that I've read by Anthony Doerr but it won't be the last. I was captivated from the first page to the last. It is written in short chapters that alternate between characters and time periods. I didn't want to make the transition between the chapters but at the same time I was eager to get back to the other character. I was torn between my desire to finish the story and not wanting it to end. I am usually very parsimonious in giving 5 stars, but I would give this book 6 if I could.<br/>Anyone who is interested in World War Two from the viewpoint of people on both sides will enjoy this book.

This tale is told with such beautiful language that it's almost like singing to read it. The brutality of war kills more than the body. It kills the soul. And yet even in horrific times the human spirit overcomes the seemingly insurmountable to shine through, to survive. This story embraces human cruelty and frailty while managing to make room for courage and love. It takes no easy shortcuts but follows each inevitability without blinking or even softening any potential outcomes. In doing so a world is created that is so real and so complete that it takes your breath away. This is one of the most moving books I've ever read.
A very touching story about a French girl and a German young man.  How hard it was to live through WWII.  Doerr certainly gave<br/>examples of how some people, under such duress, can turn do terrible things to others.  That the girl is blind is so significant since<br/>she really can see so much more than others. Werner is another story.....how many capable young men are trapped into situations<br/>which are awful.  I am glad he was so intelligent but was so sorry he had such a hard life.  Reading about that terrible war in Europe<br/>should make all of us try as hard as possible to prevent ANY war from happening.......
After reading this book, I researched to see if it's been categorized as a young adult book. Apparently, it isn't.  Certainly teens would probably enjoy it, in much the same way that The Book Thief or Sarah's Key became popular. The plot is ok although fairly predictable but the language is much too simplistic for adult readers and there is little character development. When I read a book, I want to care about what happens to the characters and frankly, I didn't care about these. I often dislike movies that are made from books but in this case, seeing the characters might help the viewer<br/>"see" them as people.
Wonderful writing, with characters who elicit tender feeling for Europeans living on both sides during WWII. Settings are beautifully rendered, especially through the blind girl's perspective. It is far too beautiful and compelling a novel to reduce to "only" four stars, but if it were possible to rate only 4 1/2 stars, I would, because of the structure. Doerr takes us back and forth in time more than seems necessary or effective. It isn't hard to follow, but it is somewhat irritating. I was distracted by trying to figure out the meaning of the constant time switches. Maybe there was a reason I couldn't discern?
This story is an engrossing read for all age groups, to include the Young Adult genre. It is my thinking that if more "history" were written in well-researched, stunningly-crafted novels like Anthony Doerr's "All the Light We Cannot See," our greater understanding and appreciation of that which can be otherwise so easily dismissed, considered part of the past, could begin to create a history that takes its place in a world where the oft-spoken saying, "History repeats itself," might no longer hold meaning--a run-on sentence to be sure, but this remarkable novel is worth my literary discretion.
Wordy, and too long!
This is a wonderful book written in prose that is almost poetic throughout.  The story is one of human determination, survival, and inspiration with many diverse characters involved in life during WWII.  It is not a "quick read", but moves along swiftly and smoothly.  I think it is one of the most well writtten books I have read in quite a long time and recommend it highly to anyone who loves to read.  The chararacters and descriptions of places in this book are unforgetable.  It transitions effortlessly through years in time. It is truly a unique jewel of a book....just as is the "jewel' in the story.
This book turned out to be a good read but halfway through the book I almost stopped reading. The constant jumping around in time made me almost want to scream. There was no reason for it. It seemed the author took a very good book and took the chapters and arranged them as he pleased. I did enjoy the book but would have enjoyed it more if the time disruptions weren't there.  Otherwise the book was well written. Some of the characters were better filled out which made me want to know some of them better. The hero's ending seemed abrupt and possibly could have been better developed. All in all a good story though.
This is a beautiful story which centres on the less important, personal aspects of WW2, involving a blind girl in France and an orphaned boy in Germany. I liked the way the story concentrated on their experiences during the war, without having to trot out the bigger history of the time. My only criticism is of the style of writing. The rhythm of short sharp sentences and two page chapters gives us the impression we are galloping relentlessly through the tale. Maybe at 520 pages we needed that to get to the finish. I felt there should have been quiet periods which would have suited the poignancy of the subject.
I chose to read this book because the author has great credits and the reviews seemed to be glowing.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This book is exceedingly slow, the characters are so sad with little hope for the future.  The one mystery of intrigue - hiding the glorious diamond - falls flat.  What a waste!
Not enough resolution in the ending for a work of historical fiction.
One of the best books I've read.  The writing is lyrically beautiful.
A beautifully written piece of fiction. The author researched the period extensively and also brought his own architectural education to the story.  This story is vibrant, thoughtful, powerful, and exciting. The writing moves eloquently and quickly from one character to another and builds suspense in the process. I was also introduced to aspects of the WW II era that I had never known before (such as details of the remote training schools for German youth) and the lives of Germans in the 1960's and 1970's.  Highly recommended reading.  This novel is also an excellent choice for a book club discussion.
This book is perfection.  I was immediately hooked from the first page.  It has very short little chapters, which some people didn't like, but I found very interesting and easy to follow.  The personal stories can be heart-wrenching, and the ending quite poignant, but uplifting at the same time.  The author's beautiful use of language makes it easy to visualize what he is explaining, and evokes strong feelings for the characters.  As I read the book, I actually found myself slowing down toward the end, because I did not want it to be over.  An amazing book.  I want to read more of this author's work.
This is a thought provoking story, filled with warmth and horror.  It shows the tenacity in people to hold on and keep believing that we can survive and overcome violence and tragedy in our lives, and to help others through it.  The love of this father for his blind daughter, and her love and trust of him predominates the story.  His method of teaching her how to find her way in the town and the house they lived in is so heartwarming and unique.  It is also a history lesson of the tragic second world war and its affect on so many people on all sides.<br/>I highly recommend this book to any reader.
Did not enjoy this. It was my book club selection. Long and tedious!
This one grabs you! Well written and a very different look at WW 11.
Simple, poignant, and full of insight.  Moving back and forth between childhood days and the war in France, the book builds to a singular moment for the two main characters. Doerr reveals some portion of the goodness and, of course, the flaws that are found in every human being.  But he also tells a story of the courage required to face this conundrum of humanity, especially in times of adversity, that distinguishes the truly good from the lost and the evil.  A wonderful and terrible story of war, purpose, and love... love of family, friends, comrades, and even those who should be your enemies.
If you're into eloquent prose and vivid imagery, this book is for you. If you appreciate an exciting and engaging storyline, then it is not. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>The only thing that separates this book from poetry is the line breaks. For me, it's too artsy. I found myself begging the author to get to the point - to cut out the superfluous multi-page descriptions of the sound that is made when someone walks across a floorboard. To me, this book was like an overly complicated piano piece that sounds awful but might at least impress the audience with it's level of difficulty.

Beautiful style
Doerr combines the best of fiction and history with a terse writing style that leaves the reader reeling.<br/><br/>He uses verbs that zing.  Metaphors that dwell deep.  Amazing piece of work.  I'm not surprised that it took the author 10 years to write and edit a book that I believe will be right up there with the very best of the 21st century novels.<br/><br/>Others have superbly summarized the plot.  This book draws a reader in, captures the heart and will always remain in the mind.  As I donate other books-- I'll be keeping this one to read again...and again...and again.
I viewed this book several times but didn't think I would like a wartime novel.  Then a friend recommended it as possibly the best book she had ever read. All the Light we Cannot See is indeed a book worth reading.  Mr Doerr has a style that is compelling; I could empathize with the characters. I could not put my Kindle down. Yes, possibly the best book I have read, I am so glad I took my friend's advice. I have read a lot of books but never offered a review, no matter how good the book.  I felt driven to review All the Light We Cannot See so others might purchase it as I did.
Gripping, realistic, characters you become involved with, well researched and well written. Anthony Doerr draws you into the interwoven individual lives.  Sometimes, it almost feels like a detective novel with you, the reader, anticipating the connections that the characters need to make and hoping they do.  The ending is not too sugar coated, fortunately, and everything does not "work out" in the end, making the novel a more realistic portrayal of what happened in Germany and France mostly during and after World War II.  One of the better books I have read recently...
Easily the most boring audiobook Ive listened to for a long time.
A well written story which toggles back and forth between the confines of two main characters' childhoods as they approach young adulthood during WWII. Although each is raised in a different country, one France the other Germany, but each has difficulties to overcome. The devastation of people's lives, families, homes, and food supplies during WWII is clearly illuminated in these chapters. The war tests the consciences of those involved leaving many scars on the survivors. I enjoyed the tension the author introduced in the very first chapters which kept me turning pages.
Anthony Doerr spent ten years writing this novel, and it shows.  Every word is exquisitely suited to its placement in the story.  His prose is so delicate, so rich and so precise that it reminds one of free verse.  His conceit of very short chapters that zigzag through time is distracting and puzzling at first, but by the end one sees that this is part of his point.  This novel, about time, family love, friendship, passion for learning and the demons war creates, is my favorite written in the last 20 years.  You must read this book--slowly, delightedly, and thoughtfully.
This was one of the rare books that I didn't want to end. In fact, when I got toward the end, I had to slow myself down since I wanted to linger w/the story and characters as much as possible. I was so moved by the story. The writing was at times a little too lyrical for my taste, but the characters and riveting narrative were captivating and powerful. I listened to the book as an audiobook, which was well very read (although sometimes I got confused by all the back-and-forth in time; that would have been easier to navigate w/a print book.) Overall, highly recommend.
This is an impressive read.  The characters are well-developed so much so as to provoke thoughtful feelings about them.  Anthony<br/>Doerr writes in beautiful prose that really allows the reader to get caught up in the journey.  The prevailing message is that we all need to do the very best we can, whatever the circumstance.  It is the severity of the WWII conflict  between the Nazis and France that tries the resilience of the human spirit.  We can still attain hope and love in the most unlikely places.  This novel is worthy of a second read; it is just that good.
I don't write reviews!  Loved the book.  Did not want it to end.
Loved it so much. What a masterpiece. A novel worth waiting for.
This novel is a Five-Plus.  I really enjoyed it.  There was never a slow moment.  The writing was beautiful.  The characters were moving.  The structure was fascinating and really worked for the story.  The subject matter was quite dark at times but there was enough beauty and sense of hope and belief in the goodness of people that it was not a depressing read for the most part.  It did have a lot to say about the vulnerability of people to being sucked into fascism and savagery.  This story really resonated with me.  I actually began re-reading it right away.
I'm quite sure that everything that happened to the characters in this book actually happened to real people in that situation during WWII. To that end it was very informative. I loved the characters, and "seeing" things from the "eyes" of someone who is blind was both helpful and interesting. But the ending is terrible, and ruined the book for me. I know that many people died, were disfigured, and lost all their loved ones, but not everyone. If that were true, none of us would be here. Surely there could have been a happy ending for somebody.
The writer succeeds in having you enter a young girls world of blindness led by her loving father into the word of sighted all the while under the terrifying reality of nazi evolution and ultimate invasion. All the while fertilizing French sanity and resistance.<br/><br/>A parallel story comes to the fore of a gifted genius young German boy who resides in an orphanage with sister who. Because of his genius is catapulted into the malignant, maniacal mechanism of the nazi emerging power.<br/><br/>Doer pulls you into both worlds... A more than gifted writer.
I kept turning the (virtual) pages in this book set in France and Germany during WWII. While there have been many stories set in this period the unique take here is the perspective of a blind French girl and a prescient engineer prodigy German boy. We see the war from the children's perspective as they come of age in this terrible time. I enjoyed the details of the radio operations as well as the vivid sensory descriptions we hear from the blind girl.<br/>I would recommend this for those who enjoy historical fiction and would like an interesting perspective.
Beautifully written about a painful time in history when people were extremely conflicted about World War II. Even the young boys forced to serve in the German Army had no idea why they were fighting or if they wanted to support such a brutal cause. The occupation of France and the toll on one family and a young blind girl are woven into a search for a legendary diamond once housed in the Paris Museum of Natural History. It is there the young girl's grandfather works and their ordeal begins. The book seems real but it is - a novel and a wonderful one to read.
Very disappointed. Mediocre plot but the book is filled with way too many words that don't add to the story. I hung in there to the end in hopes that it would get better but it never did. Hated the ending and never found clarity what really happened to the jewel. Save your money!
This book was so well written. Thoughtful with so many historical details. So informative if you are a WWII buff. The characters were so interesting and complex, It was a fairly long book. 150 chapters or so but worth reading... until the last few chapters. Wow, beyond tragic and sad. I know WWII was a rough time in history but when you are wrapping it up 20 years later you expect a little joy from the survivors. Dreary and bleak. Made me wish I hadn't spent the time reading it. One of the reasons I rarely read fiction, even historical fiction.

Loved this book. The author is a very descriptive writer which made this book a pleasure to read all the way throughout. It is a slow book so if you're looking for a thrilling sort of book this isn't really the book for you. Although it does have some really cool twists and suspenseful moments sprinkled in there. I love his writing style and the fact that he uses so much complex vocab. Would recommend the kindle version of this book because you can easily look up the definition of words and the phrases in German + French. 5 STARS
This is an extremely well written novel, with an unusual structure. The characters, with their diverse personalities, are very real to the reader. France and Germany are realistically shown before, during and after WWII. The ending of the book was not well thought out, was unrealistic  and disappointing. Because of the ending, I wish I had never read the book. It just fell flat at the end. The care given to the development of the ending was very weak. If only the writer had not given out of steam and given us such a flat ending.
While I found this book extremely slow the first 100 pages, once I got into the book, I loved it.  Taking place in Paris, and other areas of France, it gave a different perspective of the reign of the Nazi party during WWII.  Full of the villains of the Nazi party, it also showed the humanity of those swallowed by the party, only as a means to survive.  While there was fiction interwoven in the story, it was very easy to relate to each characters goal of surviving, and regaining a life after the atrocities no one was immune to.
An excellent read, following the lives of a very clever German orphan  who through circumstance becomes part of the Hitler Youth once his talents are discovered; and a blind French girl,  daughter of a museum locksmith. We know their lives will intersect but Anthony Doer by clever juxtaposition keeps us totally immersed in the plot. The second world war has them totally enmeshed but both exhibit remarkable character and ingenuity.  People can be brave in impossible circumstance.<br/>One of the best of novels that I have read.
I've never read a book like this, in fact I haven't been able to finish a book till I came across this one. It's an experience, I don't know how else to describe it. The story touches hidden places in your soul and at times leaves u breathless. Part of me wanted the story to end predictably, I yearned for it, but that would have cheapened it. This story encompasses a thousand stories and it left me with a true sense of the impact and truth of war and the immensity of the human spirit.  It will stay with me a very long time!
This is an amazing account of D-Day on the Normandy Coast in 1944, but it is also a most heartfelt novel about two memorable characters.  One is a blind young woman in the targeted town of Saint-Malo, and the other is a German orphan who rises in the German Army because he is a self-taught radio genius.<br/><br/>When they finally encounter one another, they have been struggling for so long that they can hardly go on.  As a final gesture they help one another find a measure of joy and hope in an otherwise impossible conflict.
I was looking forward in reading, All The Light We Cannot See, because of the reviews and hype. I thought it was a story you couldn't put down. I was wrong. I started to struggle from the get go but there are some novels that sometimes have a slow start then they pick up, not this one. There are too many details and it gets tedious. Also a lot of back and forth which I don't mind if it keeps my interest. I finish reading it because I was  determined to see how it ended and I was reading it for my book club. Good riddance!
What a wonderful book.  The horror and adversities of WWII in France become just the backdrop for the humanity and character of the participants.  Some reviewer gave it a low rating for the disconnected development of the plot.  But I felt the "alternating format" for the plot was an effective device to the unfolding of the characters.  I also appreciated that the author chose not to give it a "happily ever after" ending, since that surely a rare event for those in Occupied France who lived through these horrendous times.
An indepth view of the occupation of France by germany, plus the training of young boys in Germany during World war II.  The story also involves Germany's search for arts, jewels from French museums.  The characters involve intelligence boys being trained to be ruthless and how they were picked for their Aryan characteristics and a girl who grows up during this time but whom became blind at a young age.  Interesting scenes of both facinated by how air waves from radios could touch others so far away.  Excellent reading,.
A long book well written but don't get the feeling that the author knew how to end ..After devoting the whole book to Werner and Marie..Werner gets blown away by a mine and Marie although satisfied with her work is basically alone...The entire book was built on a tale of separate lives in a related existence (war). The protagonists have a very brief encounter (hours) at the end of the war, saving the girls life..  ....A lot of time on a potential relationship between a blind girl and a soldier that never materializes..
I enjoyed the writing style very much, and the transitions between the different points of view of the various characters. Although I hoped for a better ending for some of the characters; I also realize that it would be unrealistic given the situation / time period (World War ll) they lived in. This is not a book for readers looking for a "factual" novel covering the occupation of France. It is more a study of thoughts and motivations of individuals on both sides of the conflict, and how their lives intertwine.
A real disappointment!  Can't fathom how this book won the Pulitzer prize.  Honestly, it was one of the dullest books I've ever read and certainly the dullest I've ever finished.  The only motivation that pushed me through to the end was the awareness that it had been so highly rated and rewarded, so there must be a 'dynamite' ending starting on the next page or two, but that turned out to be wishful thinking.  If I cared a little more, I would go back and read the 5-star ratings to see how badly I 'missed the mark'.
For me, this was a very long read.  I slogged thru nearly 500 pages to tie these two characters together.  The story would just start to build with one character when the author switched to the other.  Her story was wonderful, his almost an after thought.
As a former educator, I would urge this long--yet engaging to the max--book be taught side-by-side with The Diary of Anne Frank.<br/><br/>Story set in WWII , pre- and post-, blind girl has rich life with long-protected Jewish father till  wartime separation when she is targeted as having a very unique treasure. At same time, alternating chapters--done o, so skillfully--follow a reluctant German boy from Hitler youth to the killing fields.<br/>Very, very good book, one of the year 2014's best reccys, I recall.
I've never reviewed a book before but feel compelled to do so because of the effect this book had on me.  For the most part, I enjoyed reading it and found it rather suspenseful.  When it finally came together, I was thoroughly entertained.  And then, for me,  the story took an unfortunate turn.  I wish the book had ended sooner and given me a happy ending.  The final time jumps forward were emotionally draining and moved me to tears....sobbing actually.  It was a beautiful book but just too sad to be enjoyable.
A beautifully crafted story which keeps one mentally and emotionally engaged on so many levels.  The story line is revealed in non-sequential passages that give a wealth of information at exactly the time it is needed.  The pivotal object in the book is a legendary diamond deemed to have the power to impart immortality on its possessor while destroying every one and everything close to him or her.  The story begins in World War II - the European Theater - and continues to the present.  A must read for everyone!
An intriguing interweaving of intangibles: the earliest radio air waves; lives and connections across the barriers of war, distance, and time; spirits of the dead (and living); the creation of minerals and sea life over millennia; the beauty and alternative reality of a world without sight; and the tangle of invisible "wires" beaming across cyber space that brings us up to the present day. Sensitively and poetically written, but also with believable characters you care about and a plot that carries you forward.
Could it be that this story was written by two different authors?  This story is wonderfully told.  A horrific time yet the characters are filled with hope and determination.  Each character so well defined that one feels as it they could have a conversation with them outside of the story.  But the ending is so chopped and bleak.  The closure of the story, while very real and compelling in itself, seems to change the essence of who these people are.  Of the 10 novels I have read this year, this is the best one.
The book relates parallel stories of a young blind girl in France and a young German soldier whose paths eventually cross.  From the beginning you pretty sense what will happen, but the author's beautiful descriptions, especially his unusual metaphors and  analogies, make some passages literally sing.  This is not a book to race through to see what happens, but one to savor and relish.  The short chapters enable thoughtful consideration of each character and event, as well as the moral dilemmas they encounter.
Most beautifully written book I have ever read. The characters, the plot, the science, the history... PERFECTION. I never wanted this book to end and also felt like I had been reading it forever because of the depth of it all. So many different aspects come together to make this story what it is... from the two separate main characters and all of their hobbies, loves, histories to all of the supporting characters. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. Every chapter is a poem in itself, so beautiful!
It took me 3 months to finish because I was packing to move out of the country, then living with others while construction of my home was finished, and finally unpacking.  That is only shared because I normally would have given up remembering the events of a book when forced to read in snatches and long periods between.  I had no such trouble with this book.  I thought about it often during the intervals because the writing was so vivid, beautiful and compelling.  It will be remembered as one of my favorites.
Looking for an example of good writing? Then this book is for you. Besides being a wonderful story, this writer uses the language beautifully to tell a compelling story of a blind girl and an orphan boy during WWII, whose lives ultimately intersect. For me, there is only one flaw. I felt the ending went on too long. While some readers may prefer having every single thread wrapped up, I would have liked the book to end at the conclusion of the war. But the writing throughout made up for that small shortcoming.
I had been watching this book on Amazon for several months before I finally made the decision to purchase it.  I'm not really into fiction, but I am very interested in the time period that this story takes place.  I was immediately drawn into the story, and eager to see how it would end.  I've given it to a friend to read, and she too is enjoying it very much.  I've also purchased it as an audio book for my sister-in-law, as she likes fiction, and spends a lot of time in her car, so I hope she likes it too.
I returned this book to the library half read, then deciding I must have been hasty borrowed it and tried again. Well I stand by my first opinion - awful. Some find it to be a type of literary art. I find it to quote an another reviewer like 'reading a cookbook'. Back and forth between people, back and forth in time all done with no useful facts.  Read Nightingale or Bakers Daughter for a story with characters, suspense, heroes and villains, accurate history; read this if you want wasted unorganized prose.
I was in love with this book. Am in my mourning days having finished it. WW11 is usually a verboten subject for me, as I lost relatives to the Nazi's and the whole thing is so painful; but the characters are so beautifully written and so interesting, especially the young German boy Werner, that one is touched by the poetry and the vision and so I could be immersed without dry pain. There is the suffering of war and the cruelty is shown but it is anything but vicarious. Thank you Anthony Doerr. Great book.
Doerr's parallel stories of two 'children' facing into the great unknowable that was WWII, is a reminder that enormous stories begin with individuals and their experiences. Marie-Laure and Werner, like so many millions, did not deserve the fate they faced. A different time and circumstance might have brought these two together for a different outcome but their stories remind of the millions we'll never hear. Doerr has an extraordinary command of language...instead of seeing these two, we feel their lives.

This novel reveals the horrific actions and thought control used by Hitler and the Nazis during WW11.  The beautiful and exceptional component  is that is reads like a poem. The writing shows through feelings, emotions, terrors, and connections what happens when a power controls everyone in its' path.  We know each character by the end of this book. We feel strongly about what happens to each one of them.Our hopes for good are pinned on some and loathing is pinned on others. A beautifully written story.
Wonderful, touching; and beautifully written novel. Set during WWII in France, it is a character study and an uplifting story about a blind girl and a young German soldier, their journeys and connection in wartime. Not your ordinary Holocaust book. A different perspective portraying the lives and events of those living through the devastation of WWII.<br/>I read this book for my book club. I would highly recommend this novel for anyone, but it is a great book club choice. There is so much to discuss.
This was an amazing book.  The language is so beautiful in places that I would stop and just re-read a section over several times, comtemplating the beautiful way some idea was expressed.  I was surprised to read negative reviews that thought the book didn't fulfill its promise as a love story between the two main characters.  It wasn't supposed to be a love story between them!  I really liked the way it ended, giving us later updates on what happened to the people in the story.  Highly recommended.
Simply a marvelous book! Well written, insightful into the human spirit, imaginative (seeing through the feelings of a person without sight) and compelling to the end.  Set in the high drama of the years preceding WWII and during the time of occupation the book touches on the human tradegy without forgetting the experience of the person.  It is a book that I will keep in my Kindle library to return to read again.  As an advid reader, I cannot give this book higher praise than to experience it again.
The most moving account of citizens during war that I have ever read.  It belongs up there with All Quiet On The Western Front.  I couldn't put it down, the characters were so real and meant so much to the reader.  Descriptions were not only stunning, there was a balance between the horrors of war and the beauty of nature persisting through the destruction by man.  Goodness and beauty won in the end and I felt uplifted.  A novel to be highly recommended.<br/><br/>Lucille Belomy<br/>Los Gatos, CA
I loved this book so much that when I was 2/3 through it, I went back to the beginning to re-read. Then proceeded to the end. The reason I did that was to glean all the details I could from the story. I didn't want to miss a bit of it.<br/><br/>Besides the storyline, which is five star for sure, I really enjoyed the descriptive writing of the author. Read slowly and thoughtfully, the descriptions were superb.<br/><br/>This book deserves all the recognition given and would make a terrific movie!
I agree with the main point of several three star reviewers -- the ending fell far short of the riveting pace and stimulating plot that characterized so much of the book. As the pace picked up about halfway through the book, I found myself in "can't put it down" mode, but after the climactic ending scenes from WWII, the denouement that followed was like workers cleaning up a football stadium after a big game -- necessary but not very interesting after the drama and excitement of the game.
Loved this book. I had just read The Boys in the Boat, so it segued from the 1936 Olympics when Hitler was just beginning his reign to the end of World War II when the Allied Forces were liberating France. It gave a birds eye view of how the Germans recruited youth to serve them and how they proceeded to confiscate works of art for their own use. It is a touching story of how a young blind French girl survives her ordeal and the loss of so much that she hold dear and is able to survive on her own.
Though there is much to be sad about (Frederick's treatment, Werner's death, the attack on Jutta and the women by the Russian soldiers), there is much beauty. The love the LeBlancs show for one another, the care Werner and Jutta experience at the orphanage, the strength of the women in their war efforts, the comfort of bringing key characters together at the end.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to those who don't mind being reminded that both good and evil are alive and well in this world.
I thought this was an extraordinary book. Offbeat in its choice of characters and wonderfully poetic in its language and pacing. Instead of wallowing in sorrow for blindness as a tragedy or even a disability, in this author's hands it is a conduit to a different kind of sensitivity through touch. And then on to sound. Touch and sound establish links and build unimagined relationships. In the middle of a deeply dysfunctional real-world time and place, humanity is articulated in a transcendent way.
Despite the atrocities of war that pervade this book, the two protagonists gained my respect, admiration, and deep concern.  The war situations and the devastation of lives, those who survive as well as those who do not, is counterbalanced by the perseverance and inventiveness of the characters and their relationships.  Friendships go deep, especially among the persecuted villagers in France.  Anthony Doerr obviously researched his background material thoroughly because the novel seems very real.
I can understand why some might enjoy this book. If you're very into ww2 or Nazi Germany. Or if you speak French or German- otherwise this story has already been told and it's been told better. It's long winded and boring for an average reader.
Anthony Doerr has meticulously and magically recreated episodes of the German invasion of France that escape even the most accurate of accountings.  A markedly sensitive union connects two dominant characters as they painstakingly survive the horrors of war.<br/><br/>This book will touch the souls of those who want a first hand experience of how opposing countrymen overcame the challenges of war in the hopes of once again being free despite the emotional scars which challenged them thereafter.
Anyone and everyone should love this book.  It is beautifully written, has a captivating story, intriguingly presented...going back and forth in place and time...character to character.  It reminds us of why we should always be working for peace as rare good and only deep pain comes from hate and war.  It shows us how we must always look to find what is important, even if we are sighted, and to appreciate all we have.  The characters are so interesting  that we want to know them in real life...
I really loved this story!  I grew up during the Second War, thinking I learned a lot of history.  But the more I read by great authors, and<br/>historians the more I learn!  Unfortunately I am not thrilled with most of the fiction of today, and am always more interested in  history and<br/>biography .  I will certainly be interested in more of Anthony Doerr's work.  His prose is compelling , and the characters beautifully drawn.<br/>I have recently purchased this book to  add to my library
This book was recommended to me by several friends.  I had no idea what it was about and when I first started reading it, I thought "oh no, this is another WW2 book."  I had just finished 2 other WW2 books and was looking to read something from a different time period.  Despite my initial reaction, I was quickly engrossed in this story and truly enjoyed it.  The book is very well written and the story and characters are very engaging.  I would highly recommend this book and the author.
This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  At first I was skeptical about reading another WWII era book but I'm so glad I did.  You get a glimpse of not only the French, average citizen side of the story but how many young German boys had no choice but to go into Hitler's army. The author kept me engaged throughout the book and I was almost sorry when I'd finished it. I know this is nominated for the 2014 book of the year and I hope it gets the award.  It would be well deserved!
This  is a uniquely wise and lyrical tale, a fiction more vivid than reality. The world of a blind girl in WWII France comes to life with details that seem too laden  with sensory perception to have been imagined and characters too human to have been conjured from thought and artifice. There is so much compassion and understanding of the human condition in Doerr's writing that leaps off the page to captivate even the most cynical heart. A tour de force that will--and must--win a major prize.
This is a WW2 novel but it is not a holocaust story! I had the good fortune to read this book as I was travelling in Paris and Berlin so I had only to imagine time not place.  The characters are well developed and consistent.  The darkness that the blind character lives in is palpable.  One can understand how some of the "monsters" of the Nazi regime were created and coerced into the lives they led.<br/>This is a really good book that examines the themes of family and friendship.  .
Years ping back and forth like ping pong balls, their trajectories weaving a story of war and remembrance. What did I love in this book? The words creating such music, such visions, and perfect descriptions of the smallest and biggest things that make a life. It took me through a horrendous war in such a way that I was able to submit myself to it.<br/>I recommend this book to anyone who loves to be transported by words on a page.<br/>I gave five stars because that is what you give a jewel!
I totally enjoyed reading this novel for its characters, its story, its time. There is mystery, surprises, pain and hope. The moment Werner listens to Marie Laure's voice while entombed under the hotel is absolutely breathtaking. And there's an unanswered question: after all, how exactly did he get the stone?<br/>One not so accomplished aspect: we, as Europeans, can hear the author's American voice a bit too much. There too many americanisms for a story that takes place entirely in Europe.
This one had me looking for time to sit down and read. Set in France in WWII, there are two main protagonists; a young blind French girl, and a young German boy. Their story lines spiral in toward each other, building impetus to the moment when they meet; everything leads to that one moment, then the tension breaks and the moment is gone forever. This is SO well written. The development of the story and characters is SO delicate and precise. I’m off to add more of his books to my wish list!
Amazing, poetic, spiritual, scientific, political, historical, and heart-wrenching, this is a book that I had to slow myself down for as I raced through the short chapters to see what would happen next. If I had not slowed down, I might have missed some of the deeply profound subtleties in this war story that shows in such a meaningful way how morals and love for one's fellow human beings are the only things worth fighting for. One of the best books I have read in a long time.<br/>Clare Mackie
Boring.  Repetitive.  Difficult to follow with all the jumping around from one year to another and one character to another.  Poor character development.  I skipped more and more as the book progressed and finally decided this was a waste of time.
Beautiful seems to be the adjective most used when describing this book, and it truly is. The book alternates between two different lives, a young blind French girl living in Paris right before the German occupation, and a young German boy who has a gift for fixing radio receivers and is recruited into Hitlers youth academy. Heartbreaking and powerful, Doerr has created a story with unforgettable characters that should be required reading, and personally the best I've read this year.
This novel is set during WWII but unlike many war stories the war is a background to the growth of the two main characters, a sixteen year old French girl and a teenage German boy.  The two finally meet near the end of the novel.  Not your traditional love story.  It is very powerful in making you feel the long term effects of war on a people as well as on the main characters. Several frineds and I plan a discussion when all are finished reading the novel.  Not often do we do that.
The author had an interesting.way of writing that drew the reader into each phase of the story.  And while I usually do not like books that jump back in forth in time, this was not a problem in following the story line.  I found that I could relate to most of the characters in this book.  I could understand their stresses as well as their under lying current of humanity.  One of my favorite lines, "open your eyes,...and see what you can with them before they close forever".
I had been through a spate of war novels as of late and resisted picking this one up for sometime.  I saw a review here that prompted me to go ahead and get it; something about the prose being lyrical.  I did not find that to be exactly true, but the book was nonetheless gorgeous.  All the Light We Cannot See isn't your typical war novel, but is rather a study of human nature, and oh(!) the humans are lovely.  Totally engaging characters and the character development was masterful.
Like you, our book club reads a dozen books a year..some stand out and others live in Book Blur - the land of so many books so little memory of them...however, "All the light..." Is a book you will not be able to put down, nor will you forget it. Superb writing, you will be transported to another time and mentally manacled to the characters. This is the 6200th Amazon review...obviously you need to read this book - you will thank me - and the 6199 others who went before me.
Do not be fooled by the pretty sentences. Most. Boring. Book. Ever. Cloying, overwritten, precious, momentum-less, unbelievable one-note characters. Relies on ready-made portent given we already know the history; doesn't earn a smidge of it.
Growing up in Germany and having heard tales from my mother and grandmother about WWII, and having spend my early childhood in a city that had been almost completely destroyed only 20 years earlier, the book touched something close to home in me. Beautiful story, told with incredible depth, the words evoking images and smells and textures and a sense of the constant danger people lived in during those times. Exceptional book. I listened to the audio book which was very well done.
An excellent read! A rather complex story line is enhanced with short chapters which keep the reader anxiously waiting for what will come next.<br/>  Two lives come from different backgrounds and different places and yet there are many parallels between the blind girl who was raised in Paris and the young German boy who was raised in a German orphanage. Both lives were very different in some ways, but as I read I kept waiting for their lives to intertwine and they finally did.
Definite must read. This is one of those books that will stay with you long after finishing. The brave, blind French girl who keeps faith no matter the hardships. The German radio man who is forced to fight in the war in spite of being a teenager. The twists and turns while confronting the horrors of war make for constant moral decisions in war time. This is a sad and hopeful read. There are good and evil people on all sides of conflict. The story makes you feel there is hope.
I, too, am in love with Marie-Laure. The characters aren't just well-drawn, they are alive! The plot is one of those you can't wait to get back to and don't want to end. You will sneak your kindle app out standing in line, waiting for the barber, eating lunch. It will make you want to eat your lunch alone. The sentences leap out at you. It gets at things that are truly admirable and truly hateful and truly ambiguous. A multi-faceted diamond of a book with flames at the center.
Fabulous book by Anthony Doerr and the writing is amazing.  In some ways, it is on the same order as Anne Frank, but the main character is blind and does not keep a diary. Even with her handicap, she is determined to help however she can during this war and she does an excellent job of spying with her ears. I highly recommend this book to anyone. The heroine's father works at a museum and he brings books home for her to read in Braille which gives her a well rounded education.
Three and a half stars. The writing is outstanding - beautiful descriptions, well rounded characters - and it flows well. The problem is the pace. Each very short chapter leads to the next without that page-turning urgency. While there is an underlying mystery - it lacked spark and momentum. I read the entire book waiting for something to happen that never came to fruition. It just fell flat. Again, the writing is exquisite but I wanted to love it a little bit more than I did.
The beautiful descriptions in this book made me feel like I was seeing it with my own eyes. It was a bit lengthy and at first that bothered me but as I kept reading, I just got lost in the richness of the prose. The story was almost secondary to the landscape and the characters. And I loved the characters and at the end the author pulled all if them nicely together to make a perfect ending. One of the best historical fiction I've read. It was like a movie in my brain as I read
This is a beautifully written book with an engaging war time story, demonstrating what it was like to be displaced from one's home when the Nazis took over France. Told in short chapters, it is the story of a blind girl and her father forced to move from Paris to the countryside for their own security. There, the blind girl not only develops a relationship with her elusive great-uncle and his housekeeper, but also becomes part of the behind-the-scenes resistance to the Nazis.
ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE  By Anthony Doerr<br/><br/>Interesting and well researched and believable.  The short chapters helped my comprehension.  Such a good story I had to ration my reading time or I wouldn't eat.  I was a child during this time and had thought the battles were fought in a "battlefield" or at deserted buildings.  I did not realize there were people living in the buildings that were bombed.  I have a much better understanding of the history now.
This was an excellent book and I was sorry when I reached the end.  I have been reading a lot of WW II era books in the last 5 or 6 years and have learned a great deal about history while also really thinking about the characters long after I have finished the book, as has been the case with this one.  To me, that is the mark of a truly good book:  that I still think of and care about the people long after the book has been done.  You will not be disappointed in this choice.
Years ago I visited the coast of Brittany and St. Malo but I was unaware of its history at the time. I knew the Allies had landed there, saw the graves and memorial for D-Day, but never thought much about it afterwards. This book explains war from the lives of those caught up in it. It's a beautiful, inventive story that's almost like a fairy tale were it not so haunting. It's reminiscent of the beautiful, rugged coast of Brittany, and almost other-worldly in its eloquence.
A wonderful book. I loved every page of this book and wished it had continued. The author describes the horror and deprivation of WW11 and it's effects on a blind French girl and her family and a young German boy made to serve in Hitler's army.  But along with the bad he injects beauty of landscape, sky, ocean and daily life which helps these people survive though barely. Reading it was pure pleasure, so well written.  I think everyone will enjoy it and recommend it highly.
I thought that this book would be good based on the title, however, I was wrong.This a short story made into a long tedious novel because of the<br/>mostly inane details of shells, electrical systems.  The story was difficult to follow because the story would go ahead for years then go back several years. I was disappointed in the ending. I read this in two days.  It was not worth the effort, but I always finish a book I start, even though it may end up in the waste bin.
I would give this a 10 if such a rating was available.  A lovely lyrical telling of a horrible time in history. Moving, sad, heroic, all at the same time.  I have read and re-read passages so as to imprint them in my mind.  It will be a long time before I forget this story.<br/>As for those reviewers who complain that "the sentences are too long".....this is literature at its finest.  If you haven't encountered such  book before, you've been reading pulp fiction.
A poignant story set during World War Two that follows the lives of French and German people during the German invasion of France. The lives of the characters are intertwined yet each one experiences different aspects of the war. Their stories are beautifully written and reflect the horror of war, especially as it brings out the worst and best of people. If you enjoy history and beautiful character development this is the book for you.<br/>Mr. ANTHONY DOERR DOES DELIGHT.
Poetic prose which sheds light on how children are indoctrinated to be blind to the evils of prejudice, intolerance, and war.  Again, the ones who see are blind, and the blind have vision and grace.  One of the best books I have read this year , this book depicts how national pride, greed, and myths can corrupt a society and destroy innocence.  Doerr's writing is eloquent and shimmering and illustrates that despite all that is malicious in the world, goodness can survive.
There has been so much hype about this book with awards and best seller lists, but for me the book could been written in 300 pages instead of this ongoing tome.  I kept waiting for it to move along and get somewhere.  Well developed characters, but it dragged on and on. Did not like that it went back and forth from  different years; that got confusing.  I am finishing it only because my book club is reviewing it this month.  It will not be on my list of memorable reads.
Not your usual WW2 book at all, and that's good!  I am an avid reader of the Furst, et. al., genre but this is another animal entirely.  It is beautifully written and made up of many interlocking chapters that move in time, place and character.  The stories of its protagonists and minor players are satisfying and the story they tell gives a different perspective on the war years and after.  It seemed long but I could not put it down and by the end I hoped for even more.
Five stars aren't enough. This is the best book I've read in some time. Engrossing, moving -- with characters that capture your heart and imagination. I found myself alternately holding my breath and tearing up. Everything I can think of to say sounds so trite, but it truly does document the triumphs of the human spirit. These characters stay with you, as will many of the phrases. What a writer. I felt blessed to read his words. You owe it to yourself to read this one.
If you believe that any writer worth his salt liberally sprinkles simile and metaphor here there and everywhere, you will sop up this novel, like a sponge!  If, you, like me, find that the constant cleverness becomes as cliched as a Miley Cyrus tongue, you may find it a little tedious. The story, while flipping about like a trout on a hook, is sweet.  The WWII backdrop is the perfect, well metaphor, to speak to the notion that there is goodness in everyone, afterall.
This book has it all:  An excellent plot that keeps you engaged with all the characters yet is not overpowering so as to let the readers  emotions to develop.  Should be read reflectively.  Certainly the characters are very well developed and remain true to real life experiences.  You can gently feel the war and the fears and courage of youth and the caring of older loved ones.  Of course a likely ending helps to let you settle back to day restively. Just excellent.
The book held my interest from the first page & the author's choice of telling the story in the lst person for the young girl & boy made it even more believable.  Sometimes the terminology was too detailed & better understood by a scientist or mathematician but,  overall, I found the book to be very interesting in portraying the effects of the War on individuals who were caught up in it against their will & how these devastating acts remained with them until Death.
This is an amazing story.  It is about childhood interrupted by war, and how everyone is affected by war. I enjoyed how the chapters alternated between the development of the 2 main characters. Even though I did find it a bit confusing to know where we were in the timeline on a given chapter, since it is not completely chronological. That said, I think it is a brilliant way to tell the story. I love the narrating voice. I cried, I laughed, I was elated. Beautiful.

Anthony Doerr helps the reader to understand how lives are shaped and developed as a result of and in spite of terrible loss and deprivation in the most pivotal time in modern history.  Looking at the childhoods of a loved and cared for but handicapped girl in France and a poor orphan boy with little of his own except a quick mind and a hunger for knowledge in Germany at the beginning of the rise of Hitler's Third Reich is the theme.  Well written and thoughtful.
I'm struggling through this book. I should've been finished with this 2 weeks ago! I dread picking it up, but I'm trying to finish. And I bought hard cover. What a mistake. Writer writes like a German with NO emotion. The only reason I'm going to TRY to finish is because of the money I spent. Then off it goes to thrift store or resale on Amazon! What's with people voting this for Pulitzer? The one thing I have been glad to learn is the St Malo tragedy. So sad...
This was a griping novel with a story that was beautifully written, a fascinating historical backdrop and characters who were extremely well drawn.  Set against the background of war torn Europe, and the Nazi's rise to power, it tells the story of two young people who lives briefly cross and everything that happens to them and their relationship with others in between their extraordinar meeting. .  I could not put the book down and recommend it highly to others.
Reading this novel is like eating dark molten lava cake.  With every turn and twist of the story, the characters and plot become richer and more delectable.  And finally, when you reach, what is in my opinion the most poignant moment in the book, the power and emotion that drips from the pages is as molten and deep as it gets.  And, just like dark molten lava cake, you will finish this novel feeling full to bursting.  It is a literacy desert worth indulging in.
A beautifully crafted story. Every word, every phrase just perfect. Not once did I question the use of a word, or think "perhaps that could have been phrased differently." I even learned a new word or two! I highly recommend this book for its poetry and it's humanity. It made its point without being maudlin or violent or bashing you over the head with facts. It accomplished it's goal with beauty and not a little reverence for the realities of the past.
A bit of a complicated read, but I liked the characters instantly. That's important to me. I didn't like the ending. Those two things said, this was one of the best researched and most perfectly written books I've ever read. There is a lot of detail about a different aspect of the war, and from a different viewpoint, and it all seemed perfectly honest, as in, likely. It's a great read, and a great book, in that there is a story, or thought, behind the story.
Beautiful characters, creative story, well written.
I  received a recommendation of this book from a group project begun in a town in Oregon.  The book is intriguing, in many respects.  There are short and long chapters, intrigue plays an important part in the plot and clues/experiences, rivet the reader to push on and read more.  However, the end left questions for me - it seems that there is a huge build up to a climax that falls flat.  It was interesting, however and I enjoyed the book.
I knew from the beginning, somehow these characters lives would entertwine. The story slogged along and I kept reading hoping for a payoff in the end. But once the two main characters connected, it was a very unsatisfying anticlimactic event. And then I think the author trudged on hoping to make a more impactful ending, but it just didn't work for me. And what was with the raping of the women? Totally unnecessary and unconnected chapter.
Fine writing, but lacks pacing and spareness, thus rendering the plot dull and plodding for the most part. The story could have been told crisply in half the length. The ending is especially drawn out, thus eclipsing the dramatic moments of Marie's escape and Werner's death. Doerr knows how to phrase and achieves some grand eloquence in spots. In spite of those flourishes, this novel is a classic case of an author with fat-book syndrome.
I couldn't see a good flow to the story.  The writer seemed more into his writing style then creating an interesting, moving story.<br/>I was the only one at book group tonight out of seven that didn't like it.
Beautifully written but the naturalistic ending with the death of one of the main characters is unfortunate.  Readers like me believe that, despite the obviousness of chance in the world, in fiction characters should make choices and those choices create their fate.  Instead, Werner gets killed off because the author wanted to kill him off (I suppose so there wouldn't be a happy ending or something).  Too bad.  It ruined a good read.
I did not enjoy it.  Found it dragged on and on.

Grimm's Brothers fairy tale with Disney ending.
Having spent the war years in France as a teenager, in occupied territory, hungry, cold, this book was fascinating. So true to life during these years. It brought back many memories. Listening to the BBC at night, a radio tucked at the bottom of a bed under many covers, many coded<br/>messages., curfews, explosions, crashing planes.  Spellbinding narrative, well defined characters.  Best book I have read in a while.
A very poorly written novel. How did this guy win a Pulitzer? He wouldn't know a good metaphor if it hit him over the head. His feelings for his characters are fake and stereotypical; he inevitably goes for the sensational rather than the true. It looks like he does not care about his characters. He simply uses them to further the plot. If the guy can't take his subject, and his characters, seriously, why should we?
Banal and over written
It took me about half way  through the book to really get into the story as it jumps around with the two main characters throughout.  Not until  the last part of the book does the connection become clear. The author does tie everything together at the end and lets the reader know the outcomes for these people. It's a good book worth reading with a lot of thought and emotion, but  not exactly an easy enjoyable read.
This is a gloomy book.  It's very hard to find anything  enjoyable or hopeful about the book and there is no happiness I could find.  I realize this is a book about the horrors of war but the characters have such a hard time and everything is so dire, that it is a real downer. I felt the ending was rushed in a hurry to get everything wrapped up.  I especially felt Frederick and Werner could have fared a bit better.
Poorly written.  Story told in flashbacks and flashforwards - so no surprises, unrealistic scenarios.  Really a blind girl is able to hide from a sighted person, no matter how incompetent. - really.
Following the order of the story was initially confusing but once I got into the flow it was great. I am always amazed at things ordinary people would during these times T9 survive. This also showed how.war makes ordinary people wander way out of their comfort zone in order T9 get through the day. He also shows the human side of the simple German soldier.<br/>These people were truly  the greatest generation
Sorry, I could not get through this book although I tried.....read the first 150 pages and had to put it down - never to pick it up again.  May just be me, but did not like the style of writing.
I can understand why many people liked this book. The writing was very beautiful and it was a joy to be sucked into their world. You could almost taste the salt in the air.<br/><br/>(Warning: spoilers below....)<br/><br/>But, yes, I have a big BUT here. I can never like a book simply for its nice prose. It has to have a purpose, it has to take the reader on a journey that achieves something substantial. In other words, it has to have a plot. What was the plot of this book? Was it simply surviving the war, or saving the diamond, or "Verner" and "Marie Lore" falling in love? What was the point? In the end, Verner dies after all that struggle, the diamond is lost to really who knows who, Marie Lore becomes a spinster, never finding true love, "the giant" lives a lonely existence, and don't forget about poor Frederick. Even Frederick doesn't even get a small glimmer of hope when the owl comes to visit. He even said to his mother: "what are we doing here"?<br/><br/>Yes, what were all of these characters doing here? Why were we taken on this voyage? To simply delight in walking the streets of ordinary people, leading ordinary lives, and dying non-extraordinary deaths? I wasn't expecting this book to end like a romance novel, where everyone comes out ahead. But the crazy thing was, not one person came out ahead. Everyone just kept keeping on. Marie Lore once said that she doesn't consider herself brave, she just does what she has to do to live. So was that the point here? That we all just do what we have to do to survive? That we can't expect any decency from such a bleak spot in our history? I didn't find this book touching, or full of deep meaning. This book was a tool for the author to punish us for having any hope in life, that we had to suffer through to a miserable ending like so many people did during that time. Like the rape scene with Yota and the other orphans....... seriously? As if we hadn't already suffered enough with every other character coming to a dreadful end? I couldn't wait for this book to end. I seriously need a good glass of wine, and a very steamy romance novel to lift my spirits back up!<br/><br/>On a rating scale, I give 5 stars for prose, and 1 star for plot. I guess my average rating would be a 3.
This is a slightly better than average read – light and airy, considering the subject matter (a blind girl in the French Resistance and a reluctant German intelligence officer in WWII). The author keeps all the chapters under 5 pages; most of them are only 1 or 2 pages, so the story never gets bogged down in unnecessary prose or exposition. In fact – that is one of the problems with this book. It seems almost TOO light. The reviews were all gushing and singing the praises of ALL THE LIGHT… but aside from some nice alliteration, I felt as if I was watching a Hallmark movie of the week. Lots of style but no substance. Doerr is a talented writer, but this is no classic of modern literature. It’s a beach read, nothing more, nothing less. I enjoyed it, but was left with a sense that I never was able to form a picture of any of the characters in my mind. Everything in the book seems superficial and not terribly detailed. The confluence of events and coincidences at the end of the story is downright absurd and the fate of one character is capricious. There are some nice moments scattered throughout the story, but the whole is not the sum of the parts. Another thing, because of the exceedingly short chapters, there are many, many blank pages or pages with one word on them – this book could have been 50 pages shorter and I’m surprised the publisher allowed this to happen. In the NYT review, Doerr is quoted as saying about the brevity of the chapters and the abundance of blank spaces: “This was a gesture of friendliness, maybe. It’s like I’m saying to the reader, ‘I know this is going to be more lyrical than maybe 70 percent of American readers want to see, but here’s a bunch of white space for you to recover from that lyricism.” Sounds a little condescending to me. You will probably enjoy reading ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE, especially if you are a fan of WWII era novels, but anyone looking for something with a deeper or more substantial meaning will be disappointed.
A beautiful and intricately woven story of ordinary people during World War II, set primarily in France. A blind girl and a gifted boy get swept up in the turmoil of war, not knowing where it will take them or if they'll even survive. Anthony Doerr's storytelling is captivating, vivid, poignant and engaging. This is one book I'll read over and over again, knowing I'll see something new in it every time.
Beautifully written, with one subplot that doesn't deliver, some unfruitful jumps in time, and an iffy coincidence. The two main characters are unique and fully realized; others, less so. The book does suggest, in a compelling way, how many fascinating stories remain untold from what is surely the most exhaustively storied period in history. In that way, and in the beauty of the writing, it's inspiring.
Can Anthony Doerr write?  Yes, but here he has written a book that I can only describe as plodding.  Slow moving, uninteresting details and choppy (I'm one of those who did not like the too-short chapters).  One might think a story about WW II would have to be dynamic.  Uh-uh.  Not this one.<br/><br/>Cannot recommend - unless there are folks out there who want a very slow story with flat characters.
I know that this book is on the best seller list but I am not sure why as it was only average.  There are much better world war 2 books out there for instance The Invisable Bridge & The English Rendition.  Both of which are a better read, faster pace, better characters, and have better authors.<br/><br/>Everybody in my book club was disappointed in this book & none of us would recomment it
This book was ok. I made it through the whole book, but never felt captivated by it. I was able to easily set it down. The novel jumps around a lot between the two characters and years.
After reading 2/3 of this book, I had no more patience waiting for the two main characters to interact.  I did not find the author's writing amazing - many vignettes were entirely repetitive, with no real importance to moving the plot forward.  If you really want to read a great book that takes place during this same historical time period, I strongly suggest Lover's at the Chameleon Club.
The story resonated with me particularly because of its setting in St. Malo.<br/>In a city still scarred by WWII, the lovely restaurant "La Duchesse Anne",<br/>features rather ugly black paintings on its walls.  They are depictions of the<br/>destruction and residue of the Nazi occupation.  St. Malo will never forget,<br/>and "La Duchesse Anne" will never let them.

Powerful story of the suffering endured by two children caught up in WWII from opposite sides, one a young French girl going blind, and a young German orphan forced to serve the Nazi war effort because of his special skills with radio communications. All characters are beautifully drawn. Everyday I looked forward to reading and learning how these two would ultimately come together.
All the Light is a compelling read in that the author creates suspense and compels you to continue reading.<br/><br/>Alas, like many such novels, the ending leaves you feeling flat. Really? That's the best you could do? THAT is your conclusion?.<br/><br/>Maybe I should have stopped reading before the last two chapters and let my imaginations and speculations finish the story.
This is one of the books that you continue to think about , long after you read the last page.  Beautifully written, and haunting.  Anthony Doerr is a talent to be reckoned with.  He does not dodge the hard things, but he does make them easier to bear.  Ultimately,  this is a love letter to the light that continues to shine within us and among us,  even into the dark places.
I'd recommend this book but not a top priority read. The author at times uses amazing word pictures but not consistently. Good story line not as fulfilling at the end as possible. If you like WW11 stories this will interest you especially with the personal lives that go through the terrors of the bombings, etc.
Good writing of very depressing subject.
All the Light We Cannot See, tells various stories of young people in both France and Germany during WWII: their seemingly unconnected lives intertwine skillfully as the novel unfolds. Historical details anchor the characters and rivet the reader's interest as to how their various conflicts will be resolved. A great read for those who enjoy historical fiction.
I guess writers and film makers will never tire of the Holocaust and I will never tire hearing about this horrendous blot on history.  This novel is a different way to appreciate how the Nazis hatred of Jews affected a blind Jewish girl hiding with her father.  It also helped me to understand how a young German boy could become enamored of the Nazi line.
This was a promising novel that, halfway through, fell apart. Perhaps, as a novel, it was doomed from the start.<br/><br/>The parallel stories of the blind French girl, Marie Laure, and the mechanically gifted German boy, Werner, are, at first, compelling. Maybe each child should have been at the center of a short story. (I also enjoyed the portrait of Marie Laure’s father, the locksmith.)<br/>The novel, however, must bring the two teenagers together with the most improbable of glues: the story of a rare diamond hidden from the Nazis and a German officer (rotting inside from a tumor and outside from the nature of his pursuit) charged with finding it.<br/><br/>And so, in a FATED TRAJECTORY, both Werner, who becomes disillusioned with war, and the officer, who becomes crazed by it, draw ever closer to Marie Laure, in possession of the diamond and sheltering from the war in St. Malo.  The question eventually becomes: Who will get there first? By mid-book, the story becomes padded with gushing epiphanies, lots of light imagery, and so much switching back and forth between novelistic theaters of operation that the falling bombs barely register. When Werner is finally born again, crawling from a collapsed building into the light as a true good guy, I was turning pages at, uh, the speed of light.<br/><br/>“All the Light We Cannot See” is an amazing feat: a feel-good novel about World War II. I’ll bet somebody paid a lot of money for the movie rights.<br/><br/>M. Feldman
Oh boy.... What the heck was all the hype about? This book was super disappointing! I read 187 pages waiting for a real plot, to be interested  or care about the characters.... Hasn't come yet. I would like to think I enjoy reading but this book is a chore. What else do these people like if they raved about this one.... So dissatisfied with this! 👎🏻
While the author has excellent skills, the 3 intertwining plots and moving from one time frame to another, makes - at times - for reader confusion. Otherwise, the use of a blind heroine, a young innocent "hero," a decaying German officer, and a fabled diamond as main characters, could lead to a variety of interpretations of obvious metaphors.
I really enjoyed the imagery of this novel and I was drawn back in time for most of it. However, the story jumped around quite a bit and in the end, I was left disappointed and unfulfilled. It seemed rushed, and I think the story would have been better off ending as the war ended, and not in present day. It was just a bit too stretched for one novel.
two amazing children, A story of hope and desire and peace. Can we in America ever realize the inportance of family in troubled times.
Gorgeously lyrical writing, compelling characters, thoughtful insight on how World War II affected a French girl and a German boy.  The book shed light on how young German boys were lured into a horrible life of war. Loved this book even though it is heartbreaking.
One of the best books I have read! Read the book in a day because I could put it down.
This is a great WWII story, told with a different point of view, that's not only lovely and heartfelt, but brings in the horrors of it all.  The characters come to life, the ending beautiful [not what you expect].  Could be a real story told by someone who lived though the horror of it.  A well worth read!
This is the first book I have felt the need to review! It is first class on all levels! A must read!
Can't wait to turn the page...suspense and heartwarming.<br/>I would reccomend this book to those of all ages. teens and beyond
A must read! A tale of two children growing up during WWII.  A young French girl, blind, but brought up to be independent by a loving parent, and a young German boy with an abounding interest, curiosity and capability in electronics. His loving other was a younger sister.  The author gave parallel lives to both of these so very human and sensitive youths facing life and death challenges, their own and others around them.  They meet for a moment of time.<br/><br/>Intelligent, moving, each character so believable, so alive.  As an avid reader, took a bit of time to pick up another book.  Just wanted to stay with The Light that Doerr Let us See".
Will add this to my all time top 5 Books. Brilliantly written, hauntingly beautiful. I had never read Anthony Doerr, but will look up other books by him now. Easily a 5 star book.
Great story with wonderful characters that really grip your heart.  I will keep them and their stories I'm mind for a very long time. Would recommend wholeheartedly
Beautifully written.
I recommend this book to anyone who loves beautifully written historical fiction with original, rounded characters. Doerr's book demonstrates the ways war victimizes the innocent as powerfully as any book I've read.
The book had a lovely fairy tale quality about it, though the story is quite grim. Beautifully written, it had the quality of a mystery, which revealed itself slowly.  Part of it's charm, I think, is that the story is told through the eyes of children trying to make sense of living through a nightmare.
Very well written book featuring characters that you care about.  Writing is very poetic...also well researched.  Lengthy book but I could not put it down until it was finished.  Anthony Doerr is a very talented writer.
I enjoyed reading this book very much.  The descriptions were very graphic and put the reader in the action that was taking place.  A beautiful love story for the girl who couldn't visually see and the young man who just didn't see.  His sister got what life was about but he didn't get it until almost too late.
I was left wondering why her father chose to leave, but otherwise, this is a great story that is beautifully written. I will likely read other novels by this author.
This is a wonderful story, which deserved to be told well.  The author, however, fails to develop characters using a lot of cliche stereotypes, philosophies, and words.  I never quite could associate with any of the characters.  Instead of being a total tear-jerker (a LOT of potential in the storyline), the book leaves a "blah" feeling.
The book was wonderful, but when I got to page 472, the next page was 441...then on to 472  again.  The next page is 505...  So I was totally EXASPERATED to have read 472 pages and miss the main part of the book.  Page 505 + did not make any sense.  I tried to contact Amazon for a replacement copy, but no luck. You are gambling to buy this book.

This has to be one of the most beautiful books I've ever read.  Incredible and ambitious plot line, relatable and complex characters, and entrenched in some of our history's darkest hours.  Very emotional, not for the faint of heart but if you can handle WWII sagas, this is definitely for you.
Too long and no real conclusion.
Good concept / story, good writing, but just too drawn out.  Needs editing to move the story along.  At about the half way point, it was just dragging on and on.  I literally skipped about 100-150 pages because I did want to find out how it ended.  I didn't feel that I missed anything at all.
Starts so well - beautifully written, has such promise - and has such a lousy ending you have to wonder, what exactly was the point?  All these story lines that go... nowhere.  All the things of significance that, in the end, aren't.  If you think life is pointless, this is the book for you.
I loved about 3/4 of this book. The end, however, was extremely disappointing. Depressing, actually. Maybe that is the point? That war is depressing and leaves scars that time cannot resolve? Even so, there were too many plot lines that were left hanging in the wind to be a satisfying read.
The plot and the characters in this book are so intricate and so well developed that I was spellbound by them from start to finish. I turned the pages quickly, eager to discover the next twist or turn. This is another rare situation where I was truly sad to have the story come to a close.
I really wanted to love this book. It was lacking a climax and the ending was supremely disappointing. If you were disappointed with this book or even if you loved it, I recommend the nightingale by Kristin Hannah. That book deserves 6 stars and it's the same genre - just done way better!
I wanted to enjoy this book. Some parts were quite interesting. The failure to translate phrases made it a nightmare to comprehend sections. The seashells and minerals as nauseous were ridiculous. Cut the book in half to get rid of the useless verbiage and it would be an excellent read
This is a book for serious readers.  You feel the war at so many levels.  The organization of the chapters added to an overall ethereal quality.  I prefer a little more weight-- Less airy.  Doerr accomplished what he meant to accomplish. You come away feeling the nightmare of the war
This model was excellent. A must read by all. Anthony Doerr creates a story on which you shortly find yourself immersed into the lives of two families. Intertwining two stories into one. On different sides of a war, but have the same hopes, dreams, wishes. What will become of them?
One of the best World War II novels I have ever read.  The characters are exceptional.  The changing scene of the action works well and keeps the reader turning pages to keep up with developments  at each scene.  In addition, the writing is beautifully done and a pleasure to read.
Wonderful book but took me so long to read. The story and writing is beautiful but not a whole lot of action. WWII, blind French girl, German boy with white blonde hair, the diamond hidden in the tiny house in the model of the city, the siege of San Marco and all about the radios
A good read, especially for those who many not know that much about the rise of Nazism and the occupation of France, but I felt manipulated. And the ending is obvious from the beginning. That is purposeful, I realize, but a bit plodding. I would still recommend it nonetheless .
What a disappointment! The story drags on with no surprises, just lengthy descriptions that lead to no climax. I know the area in Paris where the story begins, but that didn't sway me. Yes the girl's life is well described, but that is not enough to keep the reader interested.
All The Light We Cannot See is exceptionally overrated. I am so frustrated with this book that I have actually abandoned it. I got 400 pages in, and couldn't' keep going, not even just to finish it. That's how bad this book is. I am not really understanding it's best seller status, nor its great reviews on Amazon. There is beautiful writing, but the story itself offers little to NO plot at all. The story focuses on Marie-Laure (A complicated name; I find the hyphen distracting and obnoxious to read every single time, when a simple Marie would have done, in order to convey, "she's French") who is a blind girl with a supposedly magical diamond which her father leaves her. The stories of Marie-Laure and Werner don't connect 400 pages in. This book is ridiculously boring. The most interesting thing that happens to Marie 400 pages in, is that she manages to open a can of beans. Whoopie.<br/><br/>This books reads more like meandering, prose poetry than a novel. Sure, it's got great imagery, but to what end? Amazing descriptions of what it must be like to be blind, but once again, to what end? One of the other things that annoys me, is that there are countless, numerous places where Doerr could have done some really interesting work with the setting of WW2. Countless times, he just mentions something that would have been chronistic to that time period, and expects the reader to figure it out by themselves, or maybe he just expects that the reader wouldn't care, and would be more interested in Marie's incredibly boring experiences.  There are numerous places where Doerr could have written about the work camp that Marie's father was kept in, but he doesn't. He completely disregards the Holocaust and work camps. He mentions them once, when Werner sees dead prisoners on a train. It's not that I enjoy reading about concentration camps, but how could something so central to WW2 not make at least a minimal appearance in a historical novel about WW2? The author leaves a lot unexplained, but for no discernible reason. He could have taken so many places to give the readers an interesting little explanation of the historical significance of, for example, the black cat batteries used by Americans, or the pills that Neumann Two kept taking. I picked up this book with the hopes of getting to glean more information about WW2 than I had before, through a historical novel. What I got instead was this flowery, never-ending, beautiful, but still misleading shell of a story. The story is basically nonexistent. There is literally, no plot whatsoever.<br/><br/>Other things that annoyed me were the asinine references to other books. Pointless excerpts. So much more could have been done with the story of the stone. But instead, Doerr makes it his duty to write an homage to Jules Verne for some reason. I also HATE the page long chapters. They are so staccato and they honestly feel like interruptions. But then again, an interruption of what, exactly? Because there is not story. I hate this book, and I recommend you don't buy it.<br/><br/>This book is terrible. Terrible. I am an avid reader, and I love complex, long books. But this book tried too hard. It gave too much complexity without enough back story which left me confused and frustrated. I wasn't frustrated because I didn't understand it; I have a working knowledge of WW2, and understood that I wasn't buying a non-fiction about WW2. But this was just pure fantasy, and pure disregard for the concentration camps, which once again, really annoyed me.<br/><br/>**************<br/><br/>I have now finished this book, and still maintain that it is terrible. I finished it, just to see if I could see what all the hubub was about. I could not. The book is just tepid. A lukewarm story about a blind girl.
This book is way over wordy!!!
It was depressing and too long
Too slow ... couldn't get into the characters ... I suffered through it until the end purely out of curiosity ... I simply refused to give up (considering it cost $13.99)!  I don't understand how anyone could give it 5 stars and consider it the best book they've ever read!
Excellent characterization of characters. Realistic bringing together of events that had an impact on various characters. Love,suspense, pathos, sadness, fear, determination, bravery, strength,and problem solving added to a realistic story of a terrible era of history.

For those of us that have only known about WWII through textbooks this story took you to the most basic part of it. The young German boys an their indoctrination, the brutality, all at such a young age.  The story is spell binding, ever moving from past to present.
This is a beautiful and moving book.  It was very hard to stop reading it each day.  Doerr creates characters that we can care about.  The story proceeds in a plausible yet unpredictable way.  It creates a stunning picture of wartime France that enhances the drama.
This book was WAY to long (and I like long books!), had an unfulfilling and anti-climatic ending, and one of the main characters had NO character development and I was totally unable to empathize with him. I was so let down by this book, especially after all the positive reviews I saw posted.
The story was interesting but hard to follow at times shifting between characters and past and present. Character development was so good I felt I knew the people. That is why the ending left the reader hanging with too many loose ends. Still worth the read.
This was a difficult read. Too wordy, too much descriptive detail which really did not relate to the story. The story also went back and forth in time without a clear delineation of the time frame you are in.
A beautifully written book. At times it felt a little slow, however I enjoyed the detailed imagery. When the characters describe opening a can of peaches, I could almost taste them myself. The story holds much sorrow during a time of torment.
Incredible story from an entirely different perspective. I found this book to be very moving and loved the personal and humanizing perspective intertwined with the gritty details of the war.  I enjoyed every page...and couldn't put it down.
Beautifully written book with excellent character development. The author gives the reader a good sense of the time period leading up to and during World War Two, portraying the physical and psychological problems faced by the characters.
Excellent story-telling from the perspective of youngsters who get conscripted into the Nazi service but who has a conscience, and the experiences of a blind girl in France.  I didn't care for the ending, but the story was very well told.
The story was engaging from the first page to the last.  Anthony Doerr's prose is like poetry.  I found myself thinking about the characters and haunted by the impact of war on them .  This is the best book I have read in a long time.
Great start - where is the ending.
One of the best books I've read since Unbroken.  Loved the characters and the flow from beginning to end.  May be more of a ladies book than a man's, but would recommend it for both sexes.  Sad, yet uplifting and almost spiritual.
Truly one of the best books I've read for awhile. By seeing fragments of Hitler's ruthless reign through perceptions of a blind girl, my eyes were opened to a whole new perspective of the war. Excellent writing by Anthony Doerr
I loved the language and the way the author painted pictures with his words.  Was a rather sad story but accented with some goodness of man.  Not my favorite because of the tragedies that unfolded, but a good read nonetheless.

I was bored at first.  Two children growing up in WWII...but when you see what the end results of everyone's life and efforts you realize how everyone is hurt by war.  There are no victors, there are no spoils only hurt.
Story bounced around too much. Never really connected with any of the characters. Story line was good, but just never really seemed to come together. Finished it, but was glad I was done so I could move on to a new book!
Too much skipping  between time frames and events of war.  Difficult to follow.  Rambled, could have been 100 pages shorter.  .<br/><br/>Belong to a 16 person book club.  All but two people were of the same opinion.
40% finished and i am out.  So slow and over-descriptive (those beach trips for one).  I have absolutely no desire to see the end and I can name on two fingers the number of books I have not finished in my life.
Captivating story that did not end the way I thought it would. So much bravery!<br/>The shuttling back and forth between the two main characters was satisfying -- not so enamored of going back in forth in time!
Beautifully written!  Words paint pictures. Uplifting story even through wartime that was so awful. The characters come alive.  Stories of each character are so intertwined. Suspense is built throughout the book
It's not that the book is not beautifully written, it's that it is depressing. It goes from sad, to really sad, to depressing. Also, it is so stinking slow that you can actually skip a few pages and he still will be talking about the same thing when you start reading again. It is a thought provoking read but it goes on.........and on......and on...........
The way it was constructed was not my cup of tea. Too much back and forth between characters. It did not hold my attention and I struggled to make it thru the book. It had an unsatisfying ending  and middle.
An absolutely superb book!  I became so involved with the story and the wonderfully portrayed characters that I couldn't put this down.  Highly recommended for anyone wanting a tale that will grip your soul.
Boring, boring, boring
This is a well told story  about two children on opposite sides in World War II, whose lives cross in a unique way. I'm recommending this brilliant book to all my friends. It's one that I couldn't put down
I found it hugely disappointing and not Pulitizer Prize-worthy.  While it described the war from a seldom-heard prospective, I did not find it insightful enough or descriptive enough to warrant attention.
Took a while to plough thought this one. One point of drama near the end was barely worth the struggle. And the post war ending actually subtracted from the book. Like private Ryan movie. Just got end it.
I am truly happy that I read this book.  Informative but more than that, intriguing and thought provoking.  I read it on my Kindle but will be purchasing it for my personal library.  It's a book to share!
Just OK, not a great read for me. Two much detail . Went on and on regarding radios during WW!! Probably would not recommend as it seemed to take forever to get to the point the author was trying to make
Loved this book!  Read for book club.  We found so much to talk about in this novel.  Beautiful writing.  Very engaging story  Very well drawn, complex characters.  My husband and daughter loved it too.
A great page-turner for most of the book.<br/><br/>The characters are interesting and the story lines draw you in. Unfortunately the writing seems to change at the de by mon. Nog bad just different.
This book is actually a page turner.  The setting is Germany and Occupied France of WWII.  Told from the perspective of young people on both sides, this is not just another story of that time period.
Did not love this celebrated novel. I did not care for the authors style and flashback feature throughout the book.  Was a struggle to finish for me, I am probably in the minority with this opinion
never recieved by the time i needed it. why? not happ but not worth sending back. ugh i will probably never read it. it was for a book club i got it on the 11th and the meeting was the 12th. sucky
This is a wonderfully told story is about  WWII. It is a well developed story with rich characters that recreates the history of those times. Those characters linger long after you finish.
WWII again although this is a different take on what happened during that war.  I thought the book dragged in several places.  And I don't quite get the connection between title and story.
A very somber story.
I found it "all over the place"<br/>A quick chapter on one of the characters<br/>Followed by a quick chapter on another set of characters.....<br/>Not one if my favourite books

The book is "contrived." It's really awful, and a total waste of time.
I honestly could not get into this story, no matter how many times I tried. However, my colleagues genuinely loved it. I think everyone should at least give this award-winner a chance.
This is a story with Los of people playing aroids roles during WWII.  It is a war story and shows the love of family, country and the conflicts that arise in individuals.  Google read.
It has been so long that I can say that I have read such a good book. You are left with so much emotion for all the characters that you hate for it to end. I would recommend it highly.
Interesting history, but the story did not need the mysterious stone to be a good novel.  Thought there would be more interaction between the 2 main characters when they finally met.
very difficult read I am wondering how it has been on the best selling list so long. I found it was a struggle to read the entire book. Many of my friends gave up and never finished
While a little implausible, it was a good read that showed the lives of people in the war. Unless you are a nut, it will help remind you why we need to be careful who we let lead us
Well written, could not put the book down. Gives the reader another view of how people were suffering through this terrible time in history.A wonderful story of loving and trusting.
A very interesting book.  Each character was well developed with good follow through.  Only issue for me was one of style; the book jumped back and forth in time more than I like.
Amazingly beautiful and haunting writing!!  Lyrical...but the ending is a bit anticlimactic for me.  Loved the characters and the sense of place one gets.  The ending, however....
This book held my attention to the very ended.  It was not an ending I had hoped for, but then I am a dreamer.  It is so unbelievable what the characters in the book endured.
It was disappointing in the end.  There were ok parts but the end fizzled out.  I was expecting the stone to bring riches to the family.  People died that cut the story off.
Overall, I found it a good story, but depressing.  I didn't like the way the book jumped back and forth between the two main characters, as well as the past and the present.
Enjoyed the story and her expertise in writing. However did not enjoy how she arranged the chapters and the amount of words that I had to look up or ignore. Often too wordy.
When I recently told friends, a male and female couple, that I had just read and 'loved' this book and author - they both turned to me and said, "we loved it, too".
It was ok.  Too graphic for me, and I have read better novels about WWll
very depressing novel.  I had to read the whole book to find something good about it.  The title was very misleading.<br/>there was 't  anything light  in the whole book.
The author should have stopped at war's end as the final chapters were downright dreary. Beautiful description of seasons and feelings, which became diluted at book's end.
Fantastic literature. Doerr's writing is descriptive yet plot driven. I bought this before my two week vacation and finished it in the first weekend. Couldn't put it down!
This book was recommended to me by an avid reader with whom I have similar taste in literature...in addition..., I understand it's been #1 on the NYT best seller list for quite some time.  However, I found it to be precious and irritating.  The language was inaccessible and did not speak to my heart.  I would not recommend this book to anyone, other than someone who simply wants to say they've read it and how fabulous they think it is.  Just so they can say it.
I thought this book would never end.  I got so tired of it.  There was some pretty language, but I just wanted it to move along at times.  I didn't see much light in it.
I couldn't put this book down. And, unlike many novels, it does not whimper out at the end. I have recommended it to everyone and am reading Mr. Doerr's other books now.
Well written unusual book. Good character development tugging at your heart.  Four stars for me means I cannot put the book down; therefore, three stars.  Worth a read.
Best book I've read in years. The writing is dense with details and descriptions. it draws you in and once in this beautifully imagined world, you never want it to end.
Beautifully written. Even if the story was not interesting (it is) or the character development was not deep (it is) , Mr. Doerr's prose is well worth the read. Bravo!
A good story with interesting plot lines and great characters. However, Doerr is overly verbose and it seems like half of the text is wandering and often extraneous.
A beautifully written novel that will survive as a classic!  After I enjoyed this book so much,<br/>I bought it for my 12 year old granddaughter, who also loved it.
I found this book to be a marvelous tome of the way the tedious minutiae of life is glorified by the hope of the spirit and the peace that we will all find, somehow.
This was not a bad read but I did not understand why it had all the critical praise that it had received. My generally reaction was that it was a very ordinary book.
Most unusual story, but held my interest to the very end.  Sensitive understanding of life for young and old in families overrun by the enemy during WW II in France.
I know that most everyone has loved it. I found it a bit annoying. Liked the end the best. Dark and slow to get to the point. Way too much detail for me these days.
the author weaved multiple story lines together almost seamlessly; kept your attention and provided a compelling background to all the events that were taking place
Came immediately to my Kindle.  Excellent.  I prefer hard copies of books, but this book is easy to read on a Kindle.  Short chapters.  Engrossing and well written.
I really enjoyed the book and how the author switched around the narration. The only thing I did not like was the ending and especially one unneeded graphic scene.
This is an exceptional book with well-developed characters and a fascinating look into the lives of a diverse group of people in a 1930's southern depressed town.
I am really struggling to get through this book.  I had heard wonderful things about it but I just can't seem to get invested in the characters or something...:(
I twas very good, but it was sometimes hard to follow, jumping from one character's adventures to another every other chapter.  I t all came together at the end.
JUMPED AROUND TOO MUCH .....READ IT FOR A BOOK CLUB SELECTION AND EVERYONE AGREED WITH THIS. ALL FELT THAT HISTORY IS REPEATING ITSELF IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW!
Well written and a beautiful story with well developed characters.
When a book gets all the hype this one did I guess I expect the world. It was good. I liked it fine. But did I love it? No, I didn't. Which was really too bad.
Couldn't stop reading. Characters were real, images gripping.  Highly recommend this book to all, but especially to those who enjoy historical fiction.
I was so bored at 48% through the book, that I finally gave up. Uninteresting characters with not much happening. I will say it was well written. I know I am in the majority; my husband loved it. Give it a try and let us know what you think.
I rarely stop reading books before the end but I stopped this one about half way through. It got too hard to follow the switch in characters and time.
A must read.  Incredible writing and character development.  The stories were woven together wonderfully and the end was unexpected but not contrived.
This was a good book, not a great book.  I am getting a little bit sick of these books that switch perspectives from one Character's story to another.
My wife read this book in three days and loved it.  It was the featured book in her book club.  The other book club members were equally enthusiastic
I found nothing to be really interested on this novel. The bad guys, the good ones, the blind, the bright etc....common places, a history well known.
Made so clear the deprivations of war and the resilience of the human spirit. Doer made the suffering of both sides so real. War definately is he'll.
like a baby in the end. By no means I did not like the end of the book, it was a very sad ending. loved the book! I would highly recommend the book.
Good but not great for me, although most of my friends liked it.<br/>I don't like that you have to write so much in a review.  I am not<br/>into writing.

I don't know what you are all talking about.  This book was horrible. Too rambly. Get to the point already. I couldn't stomach finishing this book
I felt like this book took me forever to finish<br/>Wanted to read it because of all the hype and greet reviews. This didn't quite do it for me !
Wonderfully compelling. I could not put it down. Very well written. The characters and the  story had so much substance they really came to life.
This was a story I felt I was living rather than just reading.  One of those books I didn't want to finish.  I've recommended it to my book club.
Bought this for my Mom for Mothers Day.  She called me twice to thank me for the book...she really enjoyed the story.  Would recommend this book.
Confusing. Too hard to keep up with who, what , where, when. Redundant. Dragged out. Also unbelievable. Too many characters to keep<br/>Up with
I kept waiting for a direction...kept asking "what's the point?, where is this headed?"<br/>I was still asking that over halfway through and considered abandoning the read.<br/>I finished the book and still asked "whats the point?" "this is the end?" Soooo unsatisfying!<br/>He is an extremely gifted writer...I only hope he uses his talent to tell real stories.<br/>Many beautifully photographed movies crash and burn because they have no story to tell.<br/>I thought this is a beautiful writer...but needs a real story.
I didn't enjoy the writer's style...waaaaaaaay too much description!  The length of the meandering descriptions took away from the story line.
It was difficult to read because it jumped back and forth from one year to another , and I didn't like the ending which just left me hanging!!
Difficult to follow the story line because the author jumped back and forth in time.  Very disappointing for the two of us who read this book.
Enthralling!  Love how the author spun two separate tales and brought them together!  Good tale of war, intrigue and a bit of unrequited love.
Took forever to finally get with any rhythm. Outcome was a let down. For all the hub-bub about this book , I thought it would have been better
I  kept reading hoping for something good to happen and it never did. How this book is rated so high is beyond me! Don't your time or money.
Well written - except disappointing ending. It failed to live up to the hype. Could have been fantastic if brought more together at the end.
Way to much detail about batteries/connectors/receivers etc<br/><br/>I would have liked more "story " to have filled those pages -
The characters were interesting but the story was somewhat slow.  The changing of dates was confusing.<br/>I would not recommend this book.
I enjoyed it, but would have written a different ending. I guess I just waned Werner to live! It seemed like his life was cut off too short.
I enjoyed All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr  a lot.  I highly recommend it.  It was a great read that I didn't want to put down.
I REALLY DIDN'T ENJOY THE BOOK.I LIKED THE CHARACTERS BUT NOT TOGETHER IN THE SAME STORY.  SORRY!  I REALLY STRUGGLED TO FINISH THIS BOOK.
Too much personal detail that didn't add to the story.  I was disappointed and I found it hard to read because it didn't have a good flow.
The only reason that I forced myself to read this book is because it was selected by my book club. Otherwise,I would have quit reading after the first few pages even though I paid so much for the book. I did not like the jumping back and forth with each chapter. War brings out the very worst in men and this was described in too much detail for me.  This book might have held my interest if it hadn't been so long and detailed.  I was glad to see other negative reviews on Amazon since there were so many five star reviews.
Didn't like it. Hard to follow.  Jumped around to much.
I thought it dragged on without mercy. Only stuck with it because it got  such good reviews but I regret that I did. But I was the one person who didn't love the movie "the English Patient" so who knows!
Book was very slow.  It took 3/4 of the book to finally get moving.  I finished it, would not have missed anything if I would not have.
This book is so well written I consider it an amazing piece of art. I will be comparing this books to any future reads for a long time.
This book moved forward and backward in time in a manner that was both creative and confusing. All in all a good story and a fun  read.
I wasn't crazy about it although good writing -<br/>Very dark and depressing until the very end.<br/>Was relieved when I finished it.
I hated the alternating time frames.  I believe it did not serve any real purpose and the story would have worked better without that.
Wonderful story but I thought the first part was far too long. Also would hav preferred a straight chronological format for this book.
It's a book that pulls on you continually. Even though I have just finished it, I can't wait to re-read it to get even more out of it.
Interesting until the ending. I finished reading it two weeks ago  and I can't even remember how it ends; that's how unmoving it was!
One of the best books I have read in a long time!<br/>Extremely well written and a captivating story with good historical reference!
Highly recommend.  A magnificent book!<br/>I could not book this book down...so vivid and wonderfully written.  A must read for all.
While it was very well written and had an interesting premise for its story line, I would have preferred a happier ending for Werner.
It was very nicely written up until the last 10%.  At that point it was a disappointing ending to what had been an interesting story.
This book engages the reader from the first page through the end.  The characters are well defined and the story touches your heart.
I really can't understand why people would like this book it was super boring and more like a book I would have to read for school.
While I very much enjoyed most of the book, I felt the ending was terrible.  Even sad, the ending could have been more interesting.
The switching back and forth was annoying. I was never quite satisfied about how the encounter with Werner and the blind girl went.
Great historical fiction.  It's the best way to learn about history - through the people's lives during the times you are studying.
This book is engaging and held my curiosity throughout. I became attached to the characters and couldn't wait to see how it ended.
I almost did not purchase this book. I am so glad I did. It was entertaining and educational. It called on every possible emotion.
This was a captivating story written in a beautiful style. I can't imagine many readers walking away from this novel disappointed.
I really enjoyed the beginning and the middle of the book, but I grew tired of the ending.  It lost it's appeal after Werner died.
Interesting plot.  Ending was more rushed in detail.
Just wasn't a good read.  Two story lines, either of which would make a good book, but not developed enough to make it enjoyable.
meh! all the rave reviews made me download this. it read like every other ww2 book. just okay. didn't capture me or stay with me.
Had trouble maintaining my interest.  Flashbacks were somewhat confusing. Characters well defined but had trouble following them.
I love good historical fiction and this was beautifully done.  Having been to St. Malo made it even more interesting.  Great book
A bit slow in places--irrelevant detail, it seems. But well written otherwise and a very interesting read. I highly recommend it.
It was a little depressing for me.  Left me feeling despair for people who feel trapped in situations they have no control over.
Beautifully embracing, sadly emotional, endlessly hopeful are just a few ways to describe this must read novel by Anthony Doerr.
Not as much history as I would've liked,  Focusing on only 2 or 3  people eliminated possibilities for more historical context.
Intriguing story set during WWII in France.  To me, it was a little slow getting started, but stay with it.  It is a good read.
Good development of characters but it was too long.  It should have ended when all characters were accounted for after the war.
A florid, overwritten Nancy Drew novel set against the backdrop of World War II. Was the Pulitzer Prize committee on crack?
I loved the story, but did'nt like the ending.  Why couldn't Werner have lived?  He had so much to contribute to the world. Hope I am not spoiling the book for other readers.
This book started out very slow for me. I almost put it down but after I was about half way through, it got me interested.
Interesting story about WWII from a different perspective than I have ever read. It just wasn't something that I enjoyed.
An intricately crafted book about three people whose lives meet during WWII.  Beautiful and tender.  I never put it down.
The book was hard to follow at times.  I would like less description and more conversation.  The plat was hard to follow.
Due to the dismal, depressing and unrelenting melancholy of the story line, it took me forever to get through this book.
Very effective weaving of two stories of WWII; two sides of the conflict that ultimately came together but tangentially.
Couldn't finish this book - it put me to sleep and didn't hold my interest.  I don't know why it got such rave reviews.
One of my new favorites. A beautiful look into the worlds of both French and German hearts during WW2. Will read again.
Moved very slowly.  The last few chapters were very good but laying the groundwork was tiresome.  Made myself finish it
I couldn't finish this. It was wrell-crafted, but it was also unoriginal tragedy-porn. Look, it's World War II. Look, everyone is suffering. Look, the blind girl is suffering especially. But also the german kid is suffering. Also, in general war is hell. I get it. Now please go write about something that has not been written to death over the last 50 years. Also, try to get past the high school English lesson of suffering and tragedy = good writing.
Very thought provoking, gripping and I learned so much. This is a book that stays in your head weeks after finishing.
Wonderful prose presenting so many concrete and abstract ideas and images.  Truly a wonder and a book to be savoured.
Wasn't wowed by the book. I had high expectations and was disappointed. I found myself struggling to finish the book.
Interesting novel about WWII.  Enjoyed the intertwined stories of the two children and how they finally got together.
This was a very interesting, well-written book. The character development and suspense made me want to keep reading.
The writing was excellent and truly made the characters come alive on the pages. The intrigue continued the very end
Very interesting story about a period of history that I enjoy reading about.  Very different ending than I expected.
Beautifully written wonderful story..interesting characters.  Spurred me on to read more of Anthony Doerr's writing.
Perfunctory ending for main character was a disappointment--too superficial after following him throughout the book
Great book and I loved how the author weaved the story back and forth.  Also the historical facts were interesting.
Perfect in every way thought for some reason I have to say more?!<br/>You should definitely read this awesome book
Beautifully written, and an interesting story and collection of characters. Like many ambitious, lengthy novels, it contained a few improbabilities and under-explained elements (How exactly is a 3-D wooden model of a medieval city supposed to help a blind adolescent find her way around? What so traumatized the otherwise normal-seeming uncle that he cannot leave his house for THIRTY YEARS?). I'd recommend this, though—very good read.
The story was so vivid, it was like reading a movie. Such a horrible time in history, told by people who lived it.
Good, interesting story but I felt there was an excess of details about too much. Could have reduced the story ...
A very thoughtful story full of hope and humanity. It is hard to set down. A pure joy to read. Highly recommended.
Several people told me how good this book was but I guess it isn't my style of writing.  Didn't care much for it.
Exquisite writing and a story of many levels. I want to read this again, page by page,  for his gems of narrative
An excellent novel that covers many aspects of history in World War II. The language is beautiful and insipiring.
Engrossing, detailed, and emotional.  A fabulous book and an insightful look at WW11 from different perspectives.
Seemly a simple story, this book has themes of resilience, loyalty, evil...all beautifully and elegantly written.
The book jumps backward and forward in time. It seemed to lack a nice flow but was presented in bits and pieces.
This was one of the best books I have read in a while.  I loved the characters and did not want the book to end.
I enjoyed the book.  It was easy to fall in love with the characters.  However, I did feel the book was lengthy.
I don't get all the great reviews on this book.  It bordered on boring and it was a struggle to even finish it.
I loved The Book Thief and thought it was one of the best books I had ever read. Love this one almost as much.
Wow
O.K
yum
sad
A++
This was a book I couldn't put down. I think it is worthy of the Pulitzer or Man Booker best fiction a award.
Writing style is very descriptive and enjoyable to read... It was a nice story based in WWII... PG material.
beautifully written, just enough 'surprises" in story to keep your interest, characters fully developed.
Ok read, but nothing special.<br/>A style reminiscent of kids books - very short chapters, no big conflict.
A quite boring story that doesn't become interesting until it is near the end. I do not recommend this book.
Too much focus on description of tanks, artillery, etc....  not enough personal story....  all in all -  ok
The story was all over the map but I liked how short the chapters were.  The writing style was exceptional.
The most beautiful story in recent history! I loved every bit of it and have been recommending it non stop.
OK story. Descriptions have too much hyperbole.  Why use ten words when you can use 500? Got a bit tedious.
Ambientado en una época difícil y sin hablar tanto de la guerra presenta una situación creíble, muy bonita.
interesting story that is all tied up nicely.  Too many words.  Diffcult to follow until late in the game.
After our book club discussion, I had a better appreciation of the book.  It was a bit sad and depressing.
It went on too long, and the subject is not new.  But some of it was intriguing and I had to stay with it.
Painfully tedious is the best way to describe this book.<br/><br/>The timeline is overly complex. There is no urgency in the story. The author is unnecessarily vague when detail would improve the experience. The pace finally quickens about 80% of the way through the book.<br/><br/>I could only think of Dickens (in a bad way) when reading this. Why say it with ten words when I can write 100.
This lyrical novel reminds me that everything we do has consequences that reach people we may never know.
I found this tedious to read.  More than I ever wanted to know about architecture and financial politics.
Excellent story, albeit an unexpectedly odd confluence of the various threads and story lines at the end.
Poetic and rich. A lovely story to highlight all the light we do not see and which is here all around us.
a beautiful book to read, a memorable story I won't forget.  One of the best books I have read in years.
AFTER ALL THE HYPE, I WAS DISAPPOINTED.<br/>MAYBE AFTER OUR BOOK DISCUSSION, IT WILL APPEAL TO ME MORE.
Gorgeously written, haunting, just a beautiful book that I didn't want to end. Loved every minute of it.
I really wanted to love this book but it just could not catch my interest.  Stopped reading it half way.
Long & difficult  to stay focused on the characters,probably because of the names.not my favorite read.
I haven't finished it yet, but it is so suspenseful.  It has grabbed my interest and kept me engrossed.
I've read too many books about the Second World War . This had a different twist. I would recommend it.
I enjoy stories that take place in war time. Now add a handicapping condition and bring without family
Well deserving of the Pulitzer.  One of the most compelling reads on World War II that I've ever read.
I found this book somewhat hard to follow. It's just not one on my top ten. Just not my kind of book.
the chapters were well written, but I felt going back and forth between characters was off putting.
Beautifully written, with interweaving stories that lay bare the human spirit simply yet poignantly
This is the type novel you look forward to reading because the prose is as compelling as the story.
I found this book to be a hard read.  I never give up on a book but I found it harder and harder to go back to.  It sure wasn't the kind of book I DIDN'T want to put down.  I'm not the find of reader that sits down and reads a book in one sitting so I kept getting lost as to what year it was on since it went back and forth, guess I needed to keep notes while reading.
Very repetitive chapter after chapter.  Story is annoyingly slow in progressing to its conclusion.
even tho I haven't finished, the writing is wonderful and a creative 'look' at the effects of WWII
artificial plot, that is visible way ahead with long and unrelated subjects.  Not worth the paper
A remarkable book.  It gave such good insights into human nature and explored the good in people.
Extremely long - could have been edited/not plausible in some aspects. Overall it is a good book.
A sensitive portrayal of growing up in a time of war. I recommend for all historical novel buffs.
I love fiction that is potentially historical and this book hit the mark  I loved reading it.
Not finished yet but it is a very interesting book about the war.  Try it!  You will love it!
Interesting premise and setting.  But, I don't particularly care for the flowery references.
The ending left me hanging a bit.  Not enough closure for the characters and the story line.
Took so long for the two main characters to meet and then it was just briefly-disappointing.
I am halfway through and finding it a tough and depressing slog. Considering packing it in.
Too slow...... Overrated .<br/>Depressing... Not a great story.<br/>Disappointed at best!
I know this was a best seller but I found not a very good read.  Did not care for the end.
Just want my bag.... The last 1/4 of the book was a complete disappointment in my opinion.
The Rent Collector was my favorite book for 2015 until I read All the Light We Cannot See.
Doer is brilliant. Wonderful read. The heroine is blind, the language is vibrantly visual.
Beautifully written and ingenious ideas.  Ending chapters were a bit of a let down though.
Ending did not match up to the beginning chapters for excitement and level of writting...
the timeframe continuously jumps around making the story line confusing  and distracting.
Excellent story. Invites you in immedialy. Well written about a horrible time in history.
There is a great deal of depth in this novel .  It was great for a book group to discuss.
Beautiful descriptive language and an excellent story but structure of book is confusing.
A good study of the collateral damage to people during times of war.  The unseen victims
Good story but too wordy. If they take out half the chapters it would make a good movie.
Story line jumped around and in the end when it was tied all together, wasn't impressed.
Wonderful book, the story is interesting and makes it a very difficult book to put down.
I could not put it down. I want to thank you for this gift.  I did not want  it to  end.
Beautifully crafted.  Well written.  Great book club read leading to lots of discussion.
I did not like this book.  Could not get passed the first 20 pages.  Bored me to tears.
I thought it was far too long and built up to a very disjointed ending. Didn't love it.
Very well written. Great plot and great character development. I strongly recommend it.
I didn't think it would ever end. Hard to follow and did not care about the characters.
This is a classic.  the author is great writer of history as well as a writer of poetry
Stunningly good read!  So well written as well as a very complex and fascinating story
Excellent story, and great insight into the German Nazi youth in the days before WWII.
Disappointed.  I LOVED this book in the beginning and it was such great writing, good character development, plot, etc.  But the ending??  Seriously? I was not looking for Cinderella here, but man, it was just awful, I wanted to throw the book across the room and wish I had not read it. Made me sad for a few days.
This was a very enlightening view of what a lot of the German soldiers were faced with<br/>during the war.  Sadly a lot of these soldiers were brainwashed from a very young age<br/>to believe that the Jews were evil and would destroy them if they were not eliminated.<br/>The counterpoint was beautifully done through the thoughts of a young blind French child, and as the<br/>story progresses, shows how their paths eventually cross.
Book was very good.  Very informative about the French Resistance also.  I enjoyed it
It is a book I enjoyed reading but I thought the two characters would together longer
The jumping back and forth every two pages is killing me.  Some "chapters" are very heavy on description in the two pages that make a chapter in this book, and not any real advancement on the story.  Then the next chapter switches to the other character and the same thing happens.  Repeat that about 50x.
Had hard time reading it.  due to it not being chronological organized.  Good story.
I found it very confusing in a lot of places, and, in the end, not a very good story
I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  It makes one think and be grateful for the senses.
Although the book was. "Page Turner", I was very disappointed in the ending.
I don't understand all the hoopla; I found it to be boring, and couldn't finish it.
It was beautifully written, if a but slow passed. The fine details were phenomenal.
I expected more from a Pulitzer prize winner......it was a slow slog to the finish
Great book. Best one I've read in months. Characters are great, writing wonderful.
The kind of book you can't put down until it's finished.  Definitely a good read!
I like the book a lot, however it dragged in the middle.  It seemed so very long.
It took me a long time to get ito it.  The ending came together nicely.  Mary Lou
I don't like books that go back and forth but good ending, how it came together.
Not an engaging read for me.  Too slow to develop and in the end it let me down.
The most tortuous reading experience I've ever had. Hours I will never get back.
Recommended in a bible study.  It makes you think about what is right and wrong.
A different take on yet another WW2 in Europe story.  It held my interest
The first 450 pages were fabulous - the last 80 pages a complete mess.  It is clear Anthony Doerr spent 10 years writing the first 450 pages and 10 minutes writing the ending to the book so he could get it published.  What a shame.  I cannot recommend this book.
Not well written; a jumbled mess...not very interesting to this reader..
I  liked it because of the unusual perspective of the youth at that time
A delicately fashioned story about people it's easy to be interested in.
Amazing imagery, very moving story.  Slow moving, however, but worth it.
ok
OK
ok
Xo
😊
Overall, I am very pleased with it.  I would recommend this to anyone.
This was a book that I just could not finish. This is only the second book in my life that I did not complete reading. I found the story very boring and disconnected. I finally gave up. My time is too precious to waste on something that I do not enjoy.
This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I loved it.
Slow start and the subject depressing but suspense was very exciting.
This was my least favorite book. I did not like the author's style of writing. Characters suddenly appeared and incidences with no identification as to who they were or where they fit in. It is a touching story but I did not like how it was written.
This book could have been written in 200 pages.  VERY long and drawn out, too descriptive.  Very boring.  The last 40 pages were good.  I couldn't wait to get through this book.  Would NOT recommend.  We read it for Book Club and no one liked it.
Everyone I know loved the book. I thought it was good but not great.
The ending is quite dark.  The whole book club was not ready for it.
Different perspective of life during WWII<br/>. Well written<br/>.
I really like this book.  It did not bore me.  Loved the characters.
This was one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read.
I thought the book could have been short er. Enjoyed the second half
Some of it was boring for me and I had trouble wanting to finish it.
Interesting story but it jumped around too much, also wordy at times
Confusing as it skips around too much in time frames and chacaters.
The ending seemed like it was an afterthought.  Very disappointing.
I loved this book. Could not put it down and it did not disappoint!
This book is well written and quite enjoyable. It was so engaging.
I was hooked from the start-would recommend this book to everyone.
Great writing and a great story--reads quickly and stays with you.
Seems like it was so broken up and the story never came together.
Although this is a tragic tale, it is a great historical fiction.
This book has been praised to the skies by better critics than I.
I wasn't able to stay engaged with this story or the characters.
excellent book very descriptive of the late years of World War11
Still reading it and not able to comment about the whole book.
Great read but the ending kind of fell flat for me personally.
This was one of the best books I've read in a long, long time.
There are so many good books out there, taking place during WWII, do not bother with this one. This is not among the best of them. The time line is skewed, the characters are flimsy.<br/>The story is contrived. This is one book I could not wait to finish, so that it would be over!
Beautifully written novel set in occupied France during WWII.
I hated the pretentious and sometimes unintelligible writing.
Excellent book, best have read in months, wonderfully written
Just an outstanding story!  I would recommend this to anyone.
liked it, didn't wow me. it felt forced, a bit too contrived.
Touching and beautiful for two young people in an ugly world.
I really enjoyed this book. I like books that are different.
World War II story  of a blind girl and her father in France
Unreadable
Excellent! I could not put it down!! I highly recommend it!
The book stated ok, but the story of the sister in post-war Germany is so offensive it ruined the book<br/>for me.  Uninformed garbage.  Write about something that you understand.  No stars would be my rating.
I stopped midway.  I found the Nightengale better reading.
Good story and a vivid account of the devastation of WWII.
Great characters but moved slow until about 2/3 into book
Written well but lacking continuity with some charachters
I always like to read books from that time.  Well written
Wonderful book!  Beautifully written!  Very special read!
I am in the process of reading this now, but so far like.
Slow and boring. Wasn't impressed with the prose either.
boring,  too much unnecessary detail I didn't care about
I thought it was a pretty good book but not exceptional.
unbelievably great prose...one of my favorite books EVER
I would comment but do not want to give the ending away.
kept wondering what it was leading up to......very slow
Beautifully written, kept me spellbound,<br/><br/>LEO
a compelling read; cleverly composed; very well written
captivating book, interesting characters, love the flow
Did not want it to end, was entranced by the characters
wonderful writer and storyteller, disappointing ending.
Kept turning the pages thinking it would get better but it NEVER did!
Not an easy read. Couldn't keep characters straight.
It is very interesting from the begining to the end
Luminescent and deeply moving. Masterfully written.
Great story. Great thoughts  A very worthwhile book
This book seems a sanitized plagiarism of Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow: from the title, to setting, to the themes of light trapped underground completing a circuit of existence (the equal and opposite of gravity's rainbow in Pynchon's work runs underground), to the zero/infinity theme (Pynchon presents it as one/zero, all/nothing). I cannot believe no one else has pointed out these similarities. Mr. Doerr seems to have written a book that does little more than rip of Pynchon, and everyone eats it up. Pynchon was denied the Pulitzer for Gravity's Rainbow (look it up sometime), yet All the Light wins high praise because it is quaint and "safe." What utter garbage.<br/><br/>If you want to read a worthwhile ORIGINAL novel, try Gravity's Rainbow.
Cliche and predictable book.  Well written though.
Definitely a book I will keep and read many times!
An excellent read. Very interesting, well written.
Beautiful writing; timely and significant message.
Did not enjoy this book at all. Boring characters.
Disappointing ending. I wanted Werner to carry on!
This book was boring and did not hold my interest
I don't have time to write a review at this time.
I am still mourning the loss of this book ending.
Just began reading this sure it wll b worth while
A lovely book that pulls you in and won't let go.
I found the book slow and challenging to follow.
One of my all-time favorite books. Wonderful!!!!
Very good book - enjoyed it from start to finish
Good historical novel about life during the war.
One of those books that you just can't put down!
Exactly what I needed to refocus my perspective.
in need of a good indian attack.  slow..........
Beautifully written--I could hardly put it down!
thought it would never end.  Not very inspiring
A very engrossing read! I couldn't put it down!
Beautifully written book. Couldn't put it down.
So beautifully written, I couldn't put it down!
This book was a disappointment to me.  I bought the book because of a strongly positive book recommendation, on a show on New Hampshire Public Radio.  When I read the book, I kept wondering, "Where is this going?"  I was hoping it was going somewhere.  It did not go anywhere.  The characters and the story had some accurate aspects, but very many very unlikely events.  As a technologist, the WW2 radio tech was not accurate.  I can forgive that.  However, the story was so unlikely.  How did this get a Pulitzer?  Was it a very bad year for literature?
confusing, exaggerated, negative, don't know what  so many reviewers see in it. Have trouble finding the right word but resent  the time I spent reading it trying to find something positive.  xxx
Absolutely beautifully written in all aspects.
Riveting story--you won't want to put it down!
Great read, but the last 80 pp slump and bore.
While the two main characters (Verner, a german boy, and Marie Laure, a french girl) are very likeable, the story itself is an absolute bore. I couldn't get into it at all--forced myself to read it and push through (since I'm head of a book club and this book was picked) and finally, after 75% I couldn't force myself anymore and read wikipedia...only to be thrilled I quit and didn't waste any more time. I don't understand why it's popular?! Maybe I shouldn't have done the audio book, but I don't think that was the problem.. the book was the problem.
Great novel that will make an excellent film.
Slow at the beginning but a really good book.
Good reading, provocative, worth one's time .
Wonderful book...I wanted it to go on and on.
I have never written a review despite numerous books, but I felt this book was necessary to save others from wasting their time. I kept seeing this book pop up as a recommended book and finally caved. As many other readers have noted, the story draws you in at first. Heck, even the middle is readable. The time-line shifts aren't even that big of a problem. It's the end of the book, where the author seems to have ran out of time. The last few chapters seem to be written in a undeveloped haze. Very disappointed, because it had potential.
I did this before, and I give it 3 ,5 stars.
Slow start but it all made sense in the end.
Wonderful book. Should have won the Pulitzer
overly descriptive. couldn't even finish it.
Well written, but a little on the dark side.
I did not finish it. Could not get into it.
I haven't finished it.  I can't get into it
It did win the Putlizer Prize!  Enuf said!!
A great book.  Had trouble putting it down.
too long since I read it to give a critique
Terrific!  I loved it from start to finish.
Loved this book. Loved everything about it.
Kept me interested, book club all liked it.
One of the very best books I've ever read.
Beautifully written. Stunningly realistic.
one of the best books i have read recently
The story was disjointed and slow reading.
Seems like I'm always on the search for a good/decent read.  This one looked like a great book with good reviews - in my opinion, definitely not so.  This book just drags on and on, and I was never excited to pick it up again and finish reading it.  I got about 1/3 of the way through it, and just can't put myself through it anymore.  Ridiculous story, difficult to read as the story keeps jumping around, and not so sure the history is correct.  Don't waste your money or your time.  Sorry I did.
Intact hard copy, always wanted this book
Jumped around a lot. During hitters time.
A very slow moving but interesting story.
Very beautifully written! Terrible ending
Very well written,I couldn't put it down!
Ok , not great<br/>Pace of book was slow
Story line hard to follow,jumped around .
I was disappointed in this book.  I found it very difficult to get into the story with all his changing back and forth with the characters.
Great story. Interesting history lesson.
Excellent, well written, engaging story!
Not the best book I have read this year.
Could be shorter and very predictable...
One of the best books I have ever read.
Parts really good.  Parts that dragged.
Rather disjointed. I enjoyed very much.
wonderful, gripping, a pleasure to read
I did not enjoy it enough to finish the book.
Good but long. Little hard to get into
On my list of all time favorite books!
I really just did not enjoy this book.
Very good read . Thoroughly enjoyable.
Fascinating story, beautifully written
Wish chapter list was in front of book
Best book I have read in a few years!!
Compelling story; beautifully written.
It did not live up to my expectations.
I will read more books by the author!
It was hard to follow the story line.
One of the best books I've read- EVER
...beautiful, even lyrical, language.
A personal look into history of WWII.
It was very good but not a five star.
Touching and haunting---a great read!
Best book I have read in a long time.
too much technical stuff about radios
If you can't say anything nice don't write a review.  Stupid book.  I do not understand the raves.  I just don't understand.
Well, most people said it was a good book.  It was ... unless that means that I enjoyed it.  No, I did not enjoy it.  It's about children and war, for heaven's sake, so what was I expecting?  I read it like it was a job I had to do, like it was somehow good for me like boiled kale.  All right, I finished it.  Now I'm going to try and find a book to read that doesn't need to be followed by a course on anti-depressants.
too disjointed,  and an unhappy read
Very boring and hard to get through.
Very fast delivery!  Happy customer.
Certainly deserving  of the Pulitzer
best book I have read in a long time
Good story, but reads way too slowly
a great book, not my kind to read.
Great book!  Couldn't put it down!
Excellent writing. Riveting story.
Excellent writing style and story.
Good book, but a little too wordy!
Touching, ethereal yet realistic.
Good, a little long getting there
Excellent book - arrived promptly
could almost predict the outcome.
Beautiful descriptions for images
Verg good a little long and wordy
Excelllent and informative bgook
Wonderful book.  So much detail.
A wonderful and absorbiing read.
Disjointed,  and slow at times.
One of the best book I've read.
Wonderfully written!! Loved it!
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
I did not like the way it ended
Interesting story.  Bad ending.
Haven't read enough to say much
Intriguing story. Well written.
Keeps your interest.  Nice book
While it wasn't too difficult as the author presented two main characters' points of view, the switching back for in the different years he was portraying along with the different main characters' stories, made it hard to follow. I had difficulty getting into this book and found it easy to put down. I had to work at finishing this book.
Well written but boring story.
Too, too precious for words...
Too descriptive. Not my thing!
i thought the ending was weak.
Intriguing well crafted story.
Captivating and  well written.
Easy read, with some interest.
Excellent story, well written.
Well written and a good story!
A little draggy and repetative
Beautifully woven back in time
Very well written but wanders.
Am enjoying this book.  Thanks
A tough read, in the beginning
Great book, highly recommend.
too long not enough substance
My favorite read of the year.
This book is written in the "Dick and Jane" style. The plot is predictable.  The writing is all noun-verb-object. "See the girl.  The girl is blind".  Next chapter: "See the boy. He is poor". The men are well described.  The women are one-dimensional.  I can't believe this won a Pulitzer Prize.
Just couldn't get into it...
Captivating prose and story.
This book was disappointing.
seems too technical in spots
I just finished the lord awful Goldfinch before picking up The Light.  So, anything was bound to be an improvement, but not by much.<br/>Like the painting in the Goldfinch, The Light has its precious stone which is supposed to be the McGuffin which drives the story; in both books this concept falls short.  While the Paris museum crates and trucks off paintings and sculptures to keep them from being confiscated by the Nazis, it decides to play cutesy with this diamond which hasn't been on public display for almost 200 years!  Who the H cares?  Really.  We don't want it to fall into Nazi hands because then we couldn't keep it locked up and out of sight forever!<br/>Spoilers<br/>The payoff you waited for is when the good Nazi meets the blind French girl, but it takes so long for that inevitability to occur you are just happy when it arrives because you know the book is finally almost over.  But, even that is a let down.
Excellent read. I loved it.
Great read....recommend it.
Well written.  A good read.
A beautifully crafted book
Absolutely amazing book!!!
Not as good as I expected.
Fabulous, compelling read.
Absolutely worth the read.
This is a beautiful story.
Just couldn't get into it!
Good cover and sent quick!
I thought it was slow to get through. Never felt like I didn't want to put it down.
Slow moving and boring!!!
did not catch my interest
Couldn't hold my interest
excellent book - loved it
I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it but am giving it 4 out of 5 Stars because the end was so terribly sad.  The realistic part of me knows it had to end this way but the romantic in me wishes that all books could have people living happily ever after.  There is so much written about World War II, that it amazes me when I come across another aspect of that War.  How far young German Boys would go to improve themselves and become a small part of what they saw as "the next Big Thing."  Also how much the French were affected by the invasion of their Country and the destruction of their Cities and Towns as well as their way of life.  There is a very good reason why this Book was chosen as one of the Best of 2014.  Read it for the beauty of it's writing, the knowledge you will gain and for the pleasure of a well told story.
great writhing and story
Hated to come to the end
Disappointed in the end.
Not the ending I wanted.
Terrific, haunting book.
Absolutely a great read.
This book evokes beauty.
The book ultimately ends
Boring for the most part
Not a bad book, but not Pulitzer-worthy. Thin characters. Plot-driven kitsch.
Rating: 2.0/5.0<br/>I chose this book because I love historical stories and secondly because it got many awards and many rave reviews. The book basically consists of two stories that are told on separate chapters. It is neatly structured. I started very much to enjoy the theme and the settings of the story until 20% of it.<br/><br/>After that book just dragged and dragged endlessly. Many chapters can be skipped without any significance. I read more than the half. About 60% of it and decided this is not for me. It is very very boring, so boring that makes me go to sleep. I hate it when the writer unnecessarily increase the length of the story.<br/><br/>This book started very well but towards 20% of its length it started to fail until made me at about 60% to totally give up on it
Very slow moving story.
did not like this book.
Interesting A good read
I WOULDN'T RECCOMEND IT
NICE STORY--A BIT WORDY
Good book.  Enjoyed it.
OK if you like history.
Didn't like the ending.
I listened to this on audio and it made me fall asleep.  This book is way too descriptive and wordy.  The end was such a major disappointment.  It started off well and I thought I would really like it, as this is one of my favorite time periods to read about.  I never found the story that compelling.  I had a heart for the main character a blind little girl, but in the end I was horrified by the way the story ended.  I had given so many hours listening hoping that it would get better and have a point.  It didn't.  I purchased this from all the amazing reviews, and I am so sorry I did not read more of the less favorable reviews..If you don't love a ton of detail and stories that just go from one character to the next, you can skip it.
Hard script to follow.
What a fabulous story!
What a beautiful book!
lyrical and wonderful.
Beautiful and tragic.
Book club - good read
Loved the whole book
Did not care for it.
Wonderful story !!!!
A truly fascinating novel, told from a different perspective than most WWII stories. While not a romance, it is a love story, juxtaposed with horror,fear and revulsion. The parrell lives of the blind French girl and orphan German boy overlap so seamlessly that you feel they must know each other, even though they only meet for a few hours toward the end of the book. Also the supporting characters are real and vibrant. I'd love to see this as a movie.  The ending is too drawn out, and pointless though. The boy is dead the girl has survived,the war is over. It seems that the author had a mandatory number of words/pages to compete. Otherwise  a wonderful story.
I read this for a book club. Otherwise, I would have stopped after a few pages. The author's style is composed of short sentences and shorter yet sentence fragments filled with imprecise adjectives and more examples of the pathetic fallacy than I have ever read in one work. Its disjointed structure is an attempt to disguise its predictability. It appears that the book's mix of determinism, magic and sentimentality is admired by readers and critics alike. (A Pulitzer! A finalist for the National Book Award! One of  NY Times 10 Best Books of the Year!)  If one needed proof of the decline of writing in this country--here it is. Tripe.
kept falling asleep
Hard to get through
Very engaging book.
Beautifully written
The book was very depressing and full of dispair.  It was about an German orphan young boy who was very bright and curious, full of dreams, with a life ahead of working in the coal mines.  The war started and how he survived during the war and a blind French very young girl and how she survived with the book switching back and forth between the two.  The prose was for the most part very well done but way too much detail on things that were not moving the story along.  I would not recommend this book.  Personally I gave it a two and a half stars and one woman only gave it a one and a half but it evened out to three stars.
Heartwrenching
I love it too!
Too drawn out.
Slow beginning
Wonderful book
Beautiful book
Fantastic book

Excellent book
EXCELLENT READ
Non stop story
Wonderful book
I started it because it was selected for our book club, but I couldn't finish it. The book club has been reading a lot of WW1, WW2 and grim Nazi stuff. Though I know I need to know and understand this time period since it occurred before my time and has many good lessons, it's still very grim, depressing, and hard to read about. That said, it is very well written with involving characters. And the similarities to where today's world is headed are scary.
This book could have been 200 pages shorter and still have told the same story. This read was my book group's  choice based on reviews.  I am the only group member who actually plowed my way through the story to its end.  The flashbacks and flash forwards were overdone.  On the positive side, shedding light on and helping readers to understand the effects of World War !! on individuals in Germany and France is a goal that is achieved by this story.
With all of its publicity, I thought this must be a great read.  I am very interested in historical fiction.  For the life of me, I cannot understand what people see in this novel.  It is not well written.  The characters do not command one's interest.  Just very boring.  I kept reading and reading thinking, "surely it will get better".  It did not.<br/><br/>Unless you have lots of free time on your hands, do not bother with this book.
First 63 pages well written and.....dull.
Disappointing
Loved it.....
A great book!
A great book.
This is a story that is so descriptive in its telling so that you feel as if you were blind and the author is describing everything to you in minute detail.  You can see in your mind's eye the cold landscape of the orphanage, the desperate situation at the military school, and the scarcity yet love that surrounds the town of saint malo.  The story unfolds in a way that is both beautiful and tragic in its telling
This had great promise for me as I started the book, but ultimately, I didn't care about any of the characters.  Incredibly slow and plodding. There is a decent short story here, but as a novel, the parallel plotting is mostly uninteresting. It's not that it was predictable. It just took too long to get to the point.  You'd think there would be more drama considering the characters are in a war zone.  Nope.
The book sounds really good to read. Unfortunately there  was a page with a paragraph inked out as well as a couple of other pages with lines inked out. I was in Barnes and Noble last evening and saw the same in the books they had on their shelves. It seems like it was a whole printing of the book that was faulty.<br/>My friend checked the book out of her local library and did not have any ink black out.
Two fascinating young characters provide a unique perspective on WW2. Book is very well written but the flipping back and forth in time caused me lots of frustrating confusion.
Great read!!

The story was interesting but dragged along.  Disappointed the 2 main characters didn't meet until the end of the book.
It was a little too heavy for me, but the characters came together well in this sad time of war novel.
Tedious reading.  Nothing happens in the first 350 pages.  it's just description of the two main characters and their lives.  Finally with 50 pages left their lives finally intertwine, but by then I didn't care.  The only interesting thing was learning how the French suffered during World War 2 and how the French resistance helped win the war.
Excellent!

This book bored me to death. I fell asleep,reading it, it was like a slow death.  Then...I don't even know if the ending was what it was suppose to be.  Stressed out.....not my kind of book.  I know it was a best seller, but like Oscar Movies, they don't mean much if they aren't my type.
The preview is not accurate<br/>I am beyond 70% of this book and I have yet to engage with the book promotion. The German soldier has not yet engaged with the blind French girl. I know when a book is bad, because I am skimming, not reading. I would not recommend this book.
Fabulous
A book without a real plot!  How did this get to be a best seller?
Barely trudging through it!!  Keep waiting for it to get better.
I was looking forward to reading this  because of all the favorable reviews. But I was very disappointed. The pace was tedious and I felt as if I were back in high school struggling with a homework assignment. Not worth the effort.
I thought it was boring and extremely confusing. It did help to have the years and dates for references, but I kept having to go back and check where in time we were. I do not like Doerr's way off writing. It is choppy. I like when the language flows rather than a few  words in a sentence to describe something. Even though I as a whole love books you can learn from I feel it was a waste of precious time to read. I would never recommend this book to any one. I only finished it because it was a book club book.
Lyrical
Just OK
Love it
Very slow and boring
LOVED the characters & I'm fascinated with the era-should have given it more stars-enjoyed it enough to order another by the author, but was disappointed-perhaps I should have read more about my 2nd choice
Interesting read. Handles a well known and difficult topic with care and respect. Provides a look at ordinary people facing individual challenges of their own respond to very extra-ordinary times.
poetic
Superb
It was an interesting story but dragged in middle. And with the constant changing of character's perspective I found it difficult to follow at times. It was  pretty depressing topic matter.
Amazing. I think one of the best books I've read in a long time. The author can write. Once Werner died, I wanted it to be over. The ending was too long but it was a great read.
Since I am not quite finished with this book I can't honestly give more opinions then I have above.  This is a very deep book and<br/>will take some time to take it all in.
I had been told by several people that this book was slow getting started and then got better. I have to disagree. It was slow, boring and sad. So glad to be done with it
Very long and drawn out.  I'm tired of reading about children in Germany and France during WWII.  (i.e., "Sarah's Keys," "The Book Thief," etc.)
Gteat
Very slow read
Beautifully written. The characters came alive as well as their surroundings.  I am now going to read 20,000 leagues under the sea for the first time.
Unlike anything I have ever read.  Felt compelled to stop reading it many times as it did not hold my attention until the latter part of the book.  The author's writing style was not to my liking.  Would not rate it as a great read, but for those who read war stories might find it interesting.
This book proves that literature is art and therefore totally subjective. So many people love this book that I feel guilty saying that for most of the book, I was thinking, "Of for chrissakes, when will this book end." This book was a catalog of descriptions of the atrocities of World War II that we've all read and seen before. Nothing new here. All German officers are monsters. All French people are noble. All Americans are brash and brave. Mr. Doerr does a beautiful job with descriptions. While reading this book, I kept channeling the character of Mr. Peterman from  Seinfeld. I liked the blind girl. I didn't care one bit about the German boy, and the crazy great uncle was also an interesting character, but he gave them little to do, but sweat, hide and shake with fear. This might have worked better as a graphic novel as Mr. Doerr does description well. I can see the house where the blind girl lives. I can visualize the town, and I can certainly visualize every oily German officer. But then he probably just triggered all the great scenes from Casablanca, so I'm probably giving him too much credit there.
This was a waste of my time and money.  I am 77 years of age and I remember the war and what happened to all my family that served in the war.
My son and daughter-in-law recommended it.  They were very thrilled with the book.  I will read it after I finish the book I am reading.
Predictable storyline that gave a decent account of the life of a lighthouseman and his family in the far reaches of the British Empire.
I don't know why this book received such stellar reviews. I thought it was boring and  pretty slow for a book with short chapters..
Boring I did not finish the book
I took too long to read this book as the novel was not addicting. In the end it got better but I haven't fallen in love for it.
Really good book....not GREAT.  7 out of 10.<br/>Definitely some endearing characters.  wanted a different ending tho. Glad I read it.  *******
i liked a lot about this book- the character of werner. what I didn't like was the over-blown prose and the plot seemed a bit contrived and romanticized.
A beautiful story about life during world war two. Out of that horrible time a story of lives are artfully woven by words. Enjoyed this book immensely.
Men don't seem to be able to create realistic female characters.  I'll admit I didn't get very far with this book.  I SOOO wanted Marie Laure to have an 'Anne of Green Gables' or Cassandra in 'I Capture the Castle' type personality. Instead, she seemed like a two dimensional cardboard character, with no spark at all.  Maybe further along in the book she comes to life, but I couldn't slog through any more of it to see if that happened.
I am in the middle of reading which was downloaded to my Kindle, and page 185 in the "Blackbirds" chapter is missing!

Edit

Way to many chapters. I read a lot and found this tiresome.  Plot was predictable and characters were often repetitive .
The story is like magic.The back and forth in time made it feel surreal at times.I wonder what happened yo the stone?
Details on book. More details on book. Can't exit until done. Nine all words required so I'm dictating nine are.
Four Seasons in Rome was so elegantly written that I was looking forward to this book.<br/>Sadly I was disappointed and gave up a third of the way in. I felt that Mr. Doerr was straining for effect;<br/>Mark Helprin can get away with waxing prolix most of the time but this was not worth the candle.
Complex story was good but it could have been covered in 300 versus 500 pgs - too many scenery details for me
Excellent
I bought it because it was so acclaimed and had gotten so many good reviews. I was expecting something special, so I was really disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better.<br/><br/>As I listened, bored to tears, I finally posted on Facebook asking if anyone else had read it;  was it worth slogging through. All of my friends told me they had ditched it, finding nothing redeeming about it.<br/><br/>My rule with books; after 100 pages, if it stinks, stop reading. I guess my rule with Audible will be, after an hour if it's hideous, stop listening; nothing is worth wasting my time,<br/><br/>Maybe you can find the good in it, but I suggest borrowing it instead of blowing almost $20. Sorry to say this, but a huge disappointment!
I couldn't keep up with which location the action was taking place and which character was speaking.
Not a cheerful book, I know that time in history was awful, but not what I wanted for summer reading
Ok.
Simply do not know where the title came from--it does not in any way relate to the story.  Story tells about two different children and how war effects each.  No good wrap up of the story or what happens to each character as story ends.
wonderful story but the ending was to me so unexpected that it ruined the experience
I did not want to read another book of German cruelty. I did not finish the book.
Just ok
Very difficult to follow.  I lost interest very early, but managed to finish it.
Well written book; gripping, sensitive, and suspenseful. Passages are poetic.
Something out of the 1940's propaganda films. Stereotypical characters, sadistic and sexual exploitation scenes, over-written descriptions, predictable plot and ending. I found the book distasteful.
Disappointed. The last time I experienced such a letdown was way back in 1957 when I saw a performance of "Waiting for Godot" in London. The critics were ecstatic, so I put that down to the simple conclusion that they had no idea what the play was all about, ergo it must be a masterpiece. Likewise with Mr. Doerr's extremely well-written novel. Around 1974  "Something drops into" Marie-Laure's "palm. An iron key." Forty year later, "She lives still."  I want to know what Marie-Laure did with that "little iron key." As for the dustcover blurb about Werner's story converging with that of Marie-Laure's in Saint-Malo. Don't hold your breath. Doesn't happen until the 469th page out of 530.
I would give it zero stars if I could.  The author writes of gang rape.
I find it very difficult to read.  Can't get past the first few pages.
Couldn't wait for this drivel to end. Go book to bore one to sleep I wouldn't recommend this one, sorry.
Well written but much too slow paced. I couldn't even finish it.
It's a tedious read.  It did have some interesting information.
Interesting but somewhat fractured and slow - in the end...sad.
Another boring war victim story.  The OT people love this crap
ok
I know that this book was well reviewed.. I was not a fan
Overly detailed.  Story dragged on with no clear ending.
Well written,but pace is pedestrian. Not a page burner.
Book Club read. Too much hype about this book...
It felt like homework reading this book. Sorry
The story was predictable . War facts were made up , it stated Paris being bombed and it was not. Why a Pulitzer ?
The young girl's character is well developed and although the situation is a bit unbelievable, the reader can identify with her and her "family."  The character, Werner and his friends, however, are very stereotyped and other than noting their occupations, they are not fully realized.  Werner shows some sense of humanity towards the end, but up to that point he is just a name.
Although the book was interesting in the beginning, it became tedious for me and I was overall disappointed in a book that is on the best seller list.
Too wordie and wouldn't recommend to friends.
This was a good book; not great, just good.
It was okay - kind of long-winded in parts.
Had to force myself to complete the book.
One of the best books I've read in years.
not the worst book I've read............
Novel was great.  Delivery took 2 weeks.
I HAVENOT READ IT YEY. GIVE ME A MONTH
Interesting, never boring , original.
This book is not my kind of book at all.  Weird and tough reading.  Not interesting to me.
I look forward to reading this book!
very well written interesting story.
Story did not meet my expectations
I was disappointed in this book.
Well written and a good story.
Very interesting - depressing!
A
Did not really appeal to me.
HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK.
Not a great read. Confusing
Very thought provoking,
I struggle reading it. I bought it base on reviews and I was disappointed after reading it. I will not recommend it to anybody.
I do not recommend thus book for young people.  There are inappropriate references to sex and foul language.  I was going to buy it for my granddaughter, but am glad I did not.
very interesting story but a little deawn out.
Slow starter
Boring
I liked the book my only problem was what the author chose to end the boys life a sad ending for a boy who only wanted to study and be a normal person.
This was a book club selection.  I had a hard time getting into this.  I was constantly going back to see if I missed something because it was not easy to keep the various people in some semblence of order.  It just did not holod my interest.  It felt like work to finish it.
Not my type of book!  I lived through the war and this book seemed disjointed.  Writer was skilled in his choice of words.
If you want a similar WWII story about amazing deep characters I recommend The Book Thief. This just labored on too long.
Why would you spend hours of tedious development of the two main characters and kill one off and ruin a good story?
joan
Did not think the book was very good overall.
A little slow reading - interesting in parts
long winded, hard to hold attention.
Somewhat disappointed because of the good reviews I had received
I am in the process of listening to the audio book now. I am waiting for it to get interesting.  It has so many good reviews, but I find it boring and disjointed...what a drag.  From other reviewers I see this does not change over the course of the book.  I am going to return this one unfinished.
Can not locate book on my iPad.
seriious insite inti naxism
It seemed that every sentence had a perfect spot, right in the middle, for a period.  That would have shortened the book by half.  An uninteresting story, poorly told.  Painful from start to finish.
I could not understand why it was a best seller,
A tedious read.
Main character is whinny, self-absorbed to the point of being uninteresting. The story line doesn't carry the weakness of the protagonist  Any comparison to "Gone Girl" is nothing more than unsupportable sale promotion. Bob Allen
It is extremely rare for me to put a book down & not finish it.<br/>Enough said.<br/>Disappointing.
Fait
Boring
Tmi tmi rim tmi try I HBO but then tmi tmi tin tin tin tin tin mri not not must
It was great until it ended it that way that critics love and readers despise. Not an escapist novel. I'm sad now.
A light read not as good as  Me Before You. Too bad as I like her style.
much too long, hard to follow. I elected not to finish the book.
Good book.  Great for a book club.  I read it twice
A Christmas gift so it's not possible to review it
Depressing but well written
It jumped around to much.
Haven't finished it.

Interesting characters set in France and Germany giving you two aspects of what happened in the lives of young people in the late 30s up to 45
Tried to pick it up a couple of times and put it down. The story starts off a bit over the top. As soon as I read that the young girl is blind I was like, really? Don't take my word for it though because I haven't even read it.
This book will capture your heart right away.  It is beautifully written with an unusual way of giving us a wonderful story of courage and devotion along with a history lesson. Read it as soon as you can!!!
Too wordy.  The author is carried away by his own verbosity,
This was one of the best books that I ever read!
Good story line but somewhat disconnects at times
A wonderfully written book and story of depth
Great book.  Good character development.
Wonderful story. Beautifully written.
Didn't like Another  hitler  story
Super reading in all ways.
I usually like ww2 books, but I just couldn't get into this one. I'm not sure why everyone else seems to love it...
not a bad read
LOVELY PROSE
Too much detail descriptions makes the book drag.
Was not able to get into the book. Never finished it
Neither odered or read.
Too long w no actual purpose. I just didn't understand the point of the book. What was the meaning? Not even worthy of a star
Not worth the time and effort to  read.
It was just ok.  Didn't like the way it jumped around so much.  I was hoping for a better ending.
Beautifully written, full of symbolism and captures  the fog of war.  Both the main characters are compelling, I did not want it to end.
I did not like the book.  I feel the author uses unnecessary metaphors and descriptions which makes the flow of language tedious. I also did not like the passages about radios. The book is taking too long for the main characters to meet.
I can't believe I finished it and was continually hoping for he story to soar,but to my major disappointment it never really took off not to mention almost every character had a very sad and depressing existence with little relief.
was not pleased with this book.maybe it had to do with the author" style .to me it was very difficult to follow..it jumpd around entirely to much. I found it very difficult to follow.wouldn"t recommend..  douglas m loyce
I did not care for this book.  It is really for young people.  Can't believe it is nominated for a national book award.
this  was one of the most contrived and poorly structured books i've read. I  recommend a pass on this book.
I found it very hard to follow
The book was excellent until the unfortunate part that involved graphic rape.  There was absolutely no need to spoil the book by putting this chapter in.  In this case, Less would have meant More.  The author made the Germans out to be rather bad guys - they ran a tough school....  The Russians are pigs and rapists.<br/><br/>I think we forgot about Holocaust! I think we forgot about millions murdered and gassed.  I think we forgot about children and women... People that did this were not just bad guys The Germans - as the author would have us believe.<br/><br/>I think we also forgot about who liberated the world from Hitler - it was not rapists and pigs.<br/><br/>This is a SAD reflection on history.  Yes, it is well written, but this book is not the paper it is written on.
A mess.
Wordy<br/>Boring<br/>Not original<br/>Not sure why this book is on nytimes list.<br/>It has already been done<br/>Save your $
I didn't finish it as it did not keep me interested
Well written,characters very affecting, wonderful,detailed descriptions, very absorbing told w. the background of WWII.What kept me from giving it 4 stars is that the end is very weak & not too plausible.
The CD is in poor quality -- It skips and repeats it self in a few spots.  I was very unhappy with this set and would like to request a refund.
I have never been so bored in my life trying to digest this novel.  I finally gave up and quit half way through.
Depressing book.
I have not received this book in my kindle
Mr. Doerr, I have read all your previous books and loved them. Especially "The Memory Wall". And I liked the idea of how important memories are, how important what we are remembered by.<br/><br/>And in this novel you chose to depict and leave the memory of the Russian soldiers that liberated the world from the evil of Nazism as scavengers and rapists of the innocent women and young girls!!  The americans are these noble men, knights is the shining armor and Russians are filthy and dirty pigs..<br/><br/>It was heartbreaking to read.  You chose to picture the whole nation as despicables.  Now everybody that is not familiar with this subject will think that the Russian Army , the army that won the WWII was just whole bunch of vengeful rapists!! Unbelievable!! These are my ancestors, my people!! I know it is not true and I will not stand a minute of it.<br/><br/>So I am regretful to say that I do not recommend this book.  I will no longer seek or read your books. Who knows, maybe it will be another story full of lies just like this one.
Not my cup of tea
I did not enjoy another book about the war. I read it for a bookclub obligation.
disappointing story line.
Fabulous book.  Really well writtwn
Very Good
could  not put it down
Good story.  Far too much skipping around
I listen to my books.<br/>On a trip out of state I tried to listen to this book.<br/>CANNOT WITHOUT SPENDING $12.99 MORE.<br/>and not even sure if that would work without a signal.<br/><br/>No where does it state this when purchasing.<br/><br/>I feel ripped off.<br/>I listen to all my kindle books.<br/>I am very upset about this.<br/>Customer service gave me back my cost supposedly....<br/>But I really wanted to enjoy this book...<br/>As well as another I just bought.<br/><br/>I bought my kindle for this feature.<br/>I am quite upset about this.<br/>I may have to change my service and get rid of Amazon.<br/><br/>Sincerely....
A 5 Star book.  I h ave recomeneded it to all those that love to read.  It captures your heart
I have a real problem with this and other couple of books that I bought from Kindle.  My wonderful experience with Kindle has been that it has the TTS (text to speech) feature, because depending on traffic I drive an hour to an hour and a half to work.  It makes such a difference to have it reading to me while I am driving, it makes me avoid concentrating in the inconvenience of the typical traffic jams, while being very aware of my driving.  Three books, so far, this one, an two others, do not have the TTS feature for some reason.  I wasn't aware of this and this kills the whole thing for me.<br/><br/>Is there anyway that I can upgrade this feature with this books?.  "Visitors within", "The Seat of the Soul", and this one "all the light we cannot see".  If you don't, I do not want them.  Let me know.  In the future, I would want to know if any book I buy is TTS friendly or not.<br/><br/>Victoria Murdock
stupid story did not enjoy
Unable to understand how a novel about WW II could not even mention the Holocaust.
Pages are missing . Very sad ,,,
Elegantly written.
it was amazing. the history, the drama and suspence.
very good
This was excellent!!! Highly recommend it!!!!  5 stars, I loved it, so informing.
This is one of the best books of the year-could not put it down!
Excellent !!<br/>Beautifully written.
The next book I will read on my Kindle.
I could not put this book down and dreaded the day I would finish it. So beautifully written, I would read passages over and over again to be sure they were engrained in my mind's eye. Anthony Doerr captures the pain, the exquisite emotions, the inexplicable overlapping of evil and beauty during this dark time in history. This book touched me deeply.
