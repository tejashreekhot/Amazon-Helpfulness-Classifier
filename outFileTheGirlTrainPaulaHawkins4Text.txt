Great storyline
Blew me away !!
This was a great book. I could not put it down. I was beyond involved in the characters and their lives. So many secrets and lies. I thought I had it figured out but I was wrong. Great read. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a suspense.<br/>The only thing I didn't like was the way it hopped around. I kept forgetting the dates and I found myself flipping back a few pages to keep up. Nothing significant happened a couple of times but overall a good book.<br/>If you're looking for something interesting, this is it! I promise you won't be disappointed!
Boring, predictable, and poorly written. Save your money. The end.
Everything is great in this story. Can't wait to watch it's movie.
I hate to use a cliche, but this book is a page-turner. It is written in a very interesting style using the first person of three different characters, which lets you see the same situation from different points of view better than any third person writing usually does. I will tell anyone who wants to read this book to pay attention to the dates. I've read lots of books with dates that don't really mean much, but this one goes back and forth in time several times so you have to pay attention. I just finished it last night and I've already recommended it to two people.
I just finished this blockbuster novel, and I have to say that while it is good, and it does keep you interested, it definitely could have been trimmed down a little bit. I really enjoyed the author told the story, all the characters gave first person, alternating accounts during the book. The novel did move along nicely, however, I found that there were points where I felt like it dragged a bit. I understand that there is a film adaptation coming out for this novel, which will be set in Boston. I am interested to see how it comes out. Solid four stars for this one!
DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!  I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  I READ GONE GIRL  THIS BOOK IS NO GONE GIRL.  THE FIRST 50-100 PAGES ARE GOOd  DO NOT READ THE SAMPLE  AND BUY THE BOOK BASED ON THE SAMPLE  THE SAMPLE IS THE BOOK!  THE AUTHOR  KEEPS WRITING THE SAME THINK OVER AND OVER  IT IS  BAD!!!!!
got about 1\3 of the way into book and could'n stand her winning
would not pay 5 cents for this book if I had it to do over!!!!!
Simply put, this is one amazing read!  Complex characters, solid writing, and one intense mystery plot that is so skillfully revealed. I loved getting the story through the voices of 3 women, Rachel, Anna, and Meghan and tried to guess where the story would go - well that was a useless endeavor on my part. When I had my ah-ha moment, I didn't think it could get worse...<br/>Perfect read for anyone interested in murder and pure subterfuge.  5++ Stars and recommendation. It's an easy read as it's so well done, and once you begin,you won't want to stop!
Dismal.
The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because it was easy to read (finished in 2-3 days) and the plot just made me want to find out who the killer was. Other than that the narrow characters were uninteresting and didn't develop. The "twist" didn't come until the very end (unlike Gone Girl which came half way through to keep you wanting to know more until the end). I can't believe this is a best seller and has all the positive reviews it does. It basically would only keep housewives entertained with wild fantasies of adultery and murder.
Predictable, boring, what a complete waste of time............

Entertaining story with a Hitchcock vibe. Predictable ending.
This novel is very well written. The characters are fully realized and alive on the page. The sense of time and place is vivid. The plotting is complex but flows easily throughout the novel. I really enjoyed this novel up until the resolution which falls terribly flat. I pegged the culprit very early on. (It wasn't hard. There are only four suspects.)  I hoped I was wrong and even believed for a while I was wrong. How could a book so well written ending be so mundane. I was expecting a surprising twist, but the twist is there is no twist.
CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I liked this book enough to finish it  I would not recommend it.  I did enjoy the twists and turns of the plot but I found the timeline hard to keep track of.  I didn't care for any of the characters.  Not having read a lot of British fiction, I didn't understand all of the British words and descriptions which deflected from the flow of the storyline.  Although most the storylines wrapped up nicely, I wish it was explained if it was clothes beside the tracks and whose they were and who the red hair man was.
Can't finish it! Sorry but not my style and had to stop at 30% since nothing happened else then the main character always drinking.
The most fascinating part of the book is the format - diary-like pages belonging to three different women. The book keeps in suspense till the very end. When everything is finished and no-one is in danger you understand that the plot is nothing new. Criminal minds series or other mystery / horror films have very similar concept, e.g. Hide-and-Seek is the first that comes to my mind. Still you cannot resist the charm and cannot but admire the skillful description of a degraded woman and a manipulative liar who believes his own lies.
Three fallible narrators and a mini-maze of relationships make this book oddly compelling. As a reader, I wasn't very fond of any of the characters--which I think was the author's intention--but still I was drawn in by their stories and couldn't put the book down!
I'm terrible at guessing mysteries, absolutely terrible. That's why I can read so many and get joy out of even the simplest ones. I knew Exactly where this book was headed about a quarter of the way through. I read suspense / mystery novels for the big reveal at the end - this book did not have that at all for me. So it basically turned into a little soap opera with these characters. I don't think I'm clever for figuring out who the "bad person" was; on the contrary, I should not have been able to figure it out so quickly.
I heard this novel was being made into a movie so it got my curiosity going I purchased the book and started reading it the same night. This novel is slow paced in the beginning. But if you can manage to push through it does pick up quite a bit and draws you in. Character development is pretty good by the end I actually cared for these characters and what happened to them. I'd put this novel in the same basket as "Gone Girl" so I'd say if you enjoyed either the Gone Girl book or movie this just might be something you'd enjoy.
This book is very interesting! There were a lot of things that made me keep flipping the pages. The part that was the most interesting, to me, was that Paula Hawkins wrote this book in three different women's points of view. That was really cool because we got to see inside of each world and what they were thinking. You will most likely not catch me with a book in my hands and reading it, but this book really kept me interested and I liked it. If you're like me and you like books with mystery then you will like this book.
One of the least appealing books I've read in a long time.
I did not want to finish it.  Nothing uplifting  pure junk
I found the opening barrage of comma splices so annoying that I almost put this book down after a few pages.  It's not particularly well-written, nor could I find it in me to care one whit about any of the characters.  The end was no surprise.  The only thing I like was the narrative format, which was somewhat creative.<br/><br/>I read this because it was a New York Times best seller, but it reinforced my predilection for borrowing rather than buying books.  If I'd spent any money on this I'd have regretted it.
Had me hooked

It was just too confusing to be an enjoyable read.  I admit to skipping through a lot of but life is too short...
I enjoyed this book, as it is basically a mystery.  As the story unfolds and you get to know the characters, none were very likable in my opinion.  I still enjoyed the mystery, though. The Girl on the Train is the main narrator and observer.  I thought the premise was unique, as all of are interested by the glimpses we see of other people's lives while riding a train, a bus, walking, or driving.  A glimpse like this is what leads to a mystery, which has a surprising solution.
Someone described this as similar to Gone Girl and in a way, the chapters shifting from one perspective to the other, I suppose it was. However, the writing was better, more electric, and the mystery more satisfying. I did not end up liking Gone Girl, but ended up really enjoying The Girl on the Train. The characters were more believable and likeable. Even though I figured out the mystery long before the end, it was such a rich story.  I would definitely recommend this book.
The Girl on the Train was a really good read. At first,it was somewhat boring,reading the first few chapters. Then,the plot twists start taking place and sparked the interest up an awful lot more. This one will have you suspecting every character of murder and getting it wrong,to boot. That is,until the end.There were so many suspects to choose from that the real murderer will be a major surprise. This is an unusually well written,thought out novel.Unexpectedly good read!
Not very impressed w/ this story, plot or characters.
The book started slowly - I admit I had to put it down and start it again later.  People told me it went better if  I read farther so I kept at it.  I used to ride a train to work in the morning and had that in my mind as I read - back and forth on the train.  I had a little trouble keeping 2 stories going (with 2 women) and then a 3rd was introduced and then a 4th.  I had to keep reading to see what happened to them all and it got so interesting I couldn't put it down.
You won't put this book down until your eyes fog over!  The three women are so different and the ride on the train reminds me of peeking into Windows and houses you drive slowly by at Christmas and make up stories about the people inside.  The days later find that there's been a murder, domestic violence, or horrific things behind-the-scenes.  It just never gave you a hint.  The end was a shock to me to me.  Maybe some others caught on before me, but I'm glad I didn't!!
I read this due to the comparisons to Gone Girl in so many of the reviews. It does have a lot of those elements and some of the twists are more compelling but if I wasn't compulsive about finishing  a book once I started, I'm not sure I would have gotten to the compelling parts of the story. Having said that, the repetitive nature of the first part of the book is worth wading through as the arch of the story builds, there are unexpected turns and an improved ending.
This is one of the worst poorly written "books" I have ever read . My older sister,an avid reader as am I, warned me to be Leary of debut books and next time I will listen. Idiotic. Never had so many "whaaaat?" moments in my life while attempting to read a book. Sorry I wasted my money on it. Slow in the beginning. How about makes no sense in the beginning, middle or end. How this ever got on the best seller list is beyond me. People are such sheep.
I first read the sample. Then it haunted me and I had to find out what happened, so I bought the Kindle book.  It was really hard to put down because the suspense was so good and I wouldn't have guessed how it came out. I had to read carefully, though, because it went from character to character and if I didn't look carefully I mixed up the information about one of the women with the other. I enjoyed the book and read it in record time because I loved the suspense!

I can't put this book down. It captured my interest.
Painfully slow is the initial way to describe it. My wife and I bought it as an audio book to listen to on a road trip. She describes it in one word as "terrible." It jumps back and forth by a number of days, sometimes months so many times that there is no continuity at all. The main character is so aggravatingly stupid and emotionally unstable that you would lose hope for the future of the human race if that person were actually a real person.
OMG!  I could not turn the pages fast enough.  The layout of the story works seamlessly, letting you know where each character is simultaneously.  If you liked Gone Girl you will love The Girl on the Train.  Instead of two characters to ponder over you have many.  I actually lost sleep over this one! I don't want to say anything more because I believe that it is more fun to discover the story as it unfolds. And you will have a page-turning time of it!
Five stars alone just for the pure entertainment factor. For a thriller I thought this was excellent and surprisingly well written. Normally I am hesitant about these hyped new releases but I think this one is worth seeking out. Every character was so flawed and downright pathetic with even a tad bit of psychosis thrown in the mix. The author tricked me a few times and of course I never figured out who was the actual killer. Lots of twists and turns.
I saw this book and the  title  interested me. I had no clue as to the subject matter. I don't read  psychological thrillers normally. The book is very dark and at  first I  didn't like it at all,  but I became hooked . I couldn't put this book down.. the plot had me .guessing right until the end with an unexpected twist! Pun intended and you will have to read right to the end to understand my pun! Enjoy this book give it a Chance I am glad I did.
I read a review of this book in a magazine and was intrigued! After peaking inside on Amazon, I knew I had to read this book immediately. I was not disappointed! The characters are well thought out and as intriguing as I expected. This is a must read! Fast paced, stimulating and a story you will want to share with your friends! My only complaint, is that The Girl on the Train, is Paula Hawkins first book and I am anxious for her to wright more!!!
WOW.  This was such an amazing story, one of those you carry around in your mind for days after finishing.  I didn't see the end coming at all and I won't give any spoilers-I want other readers to enjoy this as much as I did.  Paula Hawkins nailed these characters, their feelings and emotions, their despair and dislike of each other.  You can feel her on the train, staring, wanting, wishing she could stop.  Read this book, you won't be sorry.
A lot like Gone Girl as I had heard, and kept me guessing until the end. I wasn't bogged, in fact, I was expecting to be disappointed because of the negative reviews, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I didn't realize until a third into the book to pay attention to the timeline, and once I did, I felt it all coming together and the two tracks merging. I literally read this till it wad over, and I feel fulfilled enough to finally sleep.
Boring.  It was so bad that I stopped reading it.
fought reading it , total bomb , hated this book.
the book was good but seem to just go on forever.
I'm reading it right now -- very compelling read.
An outstanding debut thriller full of plot twists and flawed characters. I couldn't stop turning the pages. Kept me guessing right up until the end. Recommended for those who love a good psychological thriller.
This mystery is different than any other mystery I have read before.  It had some surprises, but I did have the ending figured out before I read the solution to the mystery.  The tale developed slowly at first and I was bored in the first chapter, but after sticking with it for three chapters, it finally grabbed my attention and I wanted to get to the solution.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a true "who dunnit".
I thought it was mrdiocre at best.  Dissapointed
This book was thrilling. definitely recommended!
Well done.  Well crafted.  Interesting thriller.
Bit confusing until I figured out who was speaking and when.  Note: halfway thru the book I realized 3 different women were giving their own perspectives and if I didn't look or take note at the beginning of each chapter to see who was speaking then it wasn't so bad.  I had trouble remembering who was who at times.  The author shifted from past to present between the women so don't jump ahead or you'll miss something in between.

Great book.
This was a fantastic book. I was gripped right away and finished it in less than 24 hours. The characters are complex and the plot is not at all predictable. Rachel, the main character, is well developed and very likeable. The story is well narrated and the alternating view points lend themselves to the suspense of the plot. I thought the pace at which the book developed was perfect, and the book offered a great ending.
I found this book more enjoyable than Gone Girl, although the similarities were striking.  It was well written and engaging, and a quick-read, so would be great for a summer beach-week selection.  As with Gone girl, I could never feel any real emotion for the characters and had difficulty relating to their life-choices, but the book did have a satisfactory ending.  I would recommend the book for an entertaining read.
i liked the book but i thought it was a bit too long.  the main character, after a while i got tired of reading over and over again her thoughts.  I don't know why the reader had to read her thoughts over and over again - it was driving me nuts.  The ending, i didn't expect it, so that was good.  There weren't allot of twists, the author brought you in real slow, and that as good. thanks for the recommendation.
From the citation that this might be the new Jo Nesbo, I had high hopes for this book. Fast paced, yes, but unexplained and irrational choices made by the characters as well as some obvious holes in the plot reduced the reading experience a good deal.<br/><br/>And another thing (spoiler): How come little kids manage to call the emergency number from locked phones without SIM-cards, but none of the victims?
This story got more and more interesting as it developed and I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen, but I didn't want it to end.  I read the majority of it in two days and had to get up early this morning because I couldn't wait to finish. The last books I read that had me this intrigued were The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo novels. This is an easier read, but easier to get lost into the story.
The girl went on the train, the girl got back on the train, the girl went on the train, the girl got back on the train, the girl went on the train, the girl got back on the train, the girl went on the train, the girl got back on the train, the girl went on the train, the girl got back on the train, the girl went on the train, the girl got back on the train. And goes on and on...I dropped it on the 40th page.
The book unfolds perfectly, keeping you hooked...because you just HAVE to know. I knew nothing about the story before I began, so I was a little confused at times, but it was good confusion...kept me guessing. Snippets here and there are left as little clues, making you misjudge and wonder, only to come back to them later. It has hints of Gone Girl and is just as addictive, but I liked this story much more.
I have no idea why I am bothering to leave a review for a book that already has more than 15,000 reviews—surely enough folks have left their opinions by now so that mine is irrelevant.  But still…<br/><br/>First off, I wonder about the title, when the rider on the train left her girlhood behind her quite some time ago, and is now a thirtyish, pudgy, lank-haired and utterly forgettable and serious alcoholic.  Perhaps “The Drunk on the Train” or even “The Woman on the Train” does not have the same resonance, and certainly loses the subliminal tie-in to “Gone Girl” that so many people have gone on and on about.  So we have a girl on the train.  Very well.<br/><br/>Many reviews track the plot very thoroughly, so go read those for the storyline.  I’m going to share my thoughts primarily about the characters, and then the story arc as a whole.  For those of you in my august age group who remember Hitchcock’s “Rear Window,” and the much more youthful ones who saw “Disturbia,” I think you’ll agree that the characters in both movies who were such voyeurs and did some risky things were at least likeable, and we cheered for them to succeed against the bad guys.  I did not like the characters in this book, none of them, female or male.  I thought whatever they did to be supremely idiotic, and found myself hoping they would meet a Very Bad End…and soon.  And yet, I kept reading, tapping those Kindle pages, one right after the other.<br/><br/>Rachel’s appalling alcoholism, her weaknesses and bargain-basement self-esteem led to her riding the train in the first place to a job that no longer existed because of her drinking.  She fantasized about a couple whose terrace she saw from her train window, and whose house was five doors down from the one she had shared with her ex-husband.  Her life was the pits, so this couple must have everything she did not, and that everything must be perfect.  Almost everything Rachel thought, everything she did from this point on was a frustrating mix of clichés, of stereotyping, of improbability, and just plain nuts.  I wanted to slap her about every ten pages or so, jerk some sense into her, and simply not care when she backed herself into a dangerous corner.<br/><br/>Megan the unhappy wife with a past—where have we met this character before, and how many times?  She who was to be Rachel’s perfect substitute was not, and her story, which we get in installments, had not the slightest hint of novelty in it, and therefore not much of interest.  I didn’t want to slap her for the predictable choices she made, but she did make me yawn quite a bit.<br/><br/>Anna was the worst of the three—self-satisfied mistress to Rachel’s husband, and now his wife.  She reproduced and became a boring, insufferable Earth Mother who drinks lattes, does Pilates, and whines a great deal.  I loathed her, and wanted something dreadful to happen to her.  Quickly.<br/><br/>The less said about the two men—Tom, Rachel’s former husband and Anna’s present one, and Scott, Megan’s husband and Rachel’s Mr. Perfect—the better.  Not only are they walking talking clichés but also the nearly fanatical focus of the three female protagonists.  Even now, I fail to understand why.  They were stupid, abusive, superficially charming, and as three-dimensional as cardboard.  They did not improve one iota from first to last, in my opinion.<br/><br/>So, in light of characters I thought were almost impossible to like, or for whom I couldn’t muster the slightest empathy, why did I bother?  Why should you bother?  Because in spite of the faults, the reckless actions, the out of character behavior, Anna’s incessant whining and Rachel’s non-stop drinking, and even the almost but not quite predictable denouement, I forgot all my irritations at the end…well, almost all.  Somehow the book came together then, not particularly tidy, or necessarily conventional, but oddly in line with the generally messiness of the plot and its characters.  At the end I cared about Rachel, and Anna, although I would still like to slap her.  At the end I was glad I read the book, even as I cussed as I was reading it.<br/><br/>Someone—or several someones, actually—said this is a good beach book, and it is.  A good book for a rainy evening with a glass or two of wine, or a long commute, especially on a train.  Certainly not great literature, or a great example of the genre, but worth the read, I believe.  Sometimes it’s fun to talk back to characters.
I was so excited about this book, since I loved Gone Girl so much, but I just finished it and I can honestly say I was bored through the entire thing. It started out with so much potential, but the plot dragged on and by the last page I didn't really care what happened anymore. It was an easy read, but the end of the book was evident half way through, and there was really no excitement through any of it.
Very hard to get through. Every character was depressing and hard to read about with all their problems. Almost put it down several times. Can't understand all the five stars. To be honest when I heard how good it was, I downloaded it and read it and actually it was great but in the end I had downloaded the wrong one. I had read and enjoyed the one by AJ Waines. It turned out to be a great mistake.
I really enjoyed for three reasons<br/>1. As you read further, you get to discover more about the character (especially what's wrong with them) and what happened to them in the past<br/>2. This book goes from one character to another, letting you know what each of them are thinking at certain times<br/>3. All of the characters have a problem of some sort. This made each character unique for me.
Got alittle boring. ... on and on and on. ..
This is the worst book i have ever read!!!!!
It was so Boring I didn't finish it . . .pmc
Kept me reading through the night! Loved it!
Although this debut novel has been compared to Gone Girl, there's really no contest; The Girl on the Train is much better. Just when you think you know what happened in the story, you're proved wrong. This is a tense, well-plotted narrative that keeps the reader on her toes. Have you ever wondered, as you're commuting to work, who lives in the houses you pas and what their lives are like? Don't.
The reviews said it was as good as "Gone Girl." And I have to agree..all the drunkenness in the early part of the story was so hard to read. By the end of the book glad for the drinking to be done...what a loser that husband was...how interesting Anna was...poor Meghan and her less than charmed life....she deserved more than just a simple grave...wonderful mystery...great read to start 2015.
This book was freaking fantastic!!!  Rachel wants to live in a fantasy she has created for herself, but her real life is no match.  When a murder takes place on the train, Rachel, as a result of her daily commute, is pulled into the investigation.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this book.  At times it was extremely dark, but it kept me right there from the beginning until the very end.
Although not an award winning plot, it definitely was interesting and kept my attention. I liked the plot twists that keep the reader guessing. It's unfortunate that there wasn't any rap redeeming character since all had their evil  quirks.  Here's hoping we have better people in our live!<br/><br/>I'd recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an engaging read that isn't too deep.
Once I started reading, I thought it was going to be interesting. Then the story kept switching from 3 different points of view, which gave me a headache. I got bored fast from Rachel's epic drinking disasters which happened very frequently throughout the book. Then once I got to the end, I thought it was a pitiful display that showed the women as being powerless, obsessive and desperate.
This murder mystery had me wondering if it was worth finishing, at first.  The characters are so developed with personal defect information that it's sad to realize that this is a reality for many women and men for that matter.  I read on though, because I wanted to see these ladies conquer their demons.  It was a quick read, for the most part.  Enjoyable, but not one for my book shelf!
Well, first you need to pay attention to the chapter headings or you'll be getting confused.  When you get the characters sorted out, you have to spend some time being patient with the heroine,  then the plot gets going.  I liked the book and would read another by this author.<br/>The ending was a  surprise and well done but the poor heroine continues to require this reader's patience.

Solid book
This was the best fiction book I've ever read. Except I didn't read it myself, I let the beautiful voices on Audible read them to me.<br/><br/>Typically I can't listen to audible books unless they are non-fiction, because I lose my place forget to pay attention, or forget who is talking. This book never once let me forget. The voices were so well done, so distinct, and always reminded me where I was in he story. I would recommend the audio to everyone because it truly enhanced my experience.<br/><br/>Mind you, the voices are British.<br/><br/>I'm a Licensed Professional Counselor, so I read it with a counselor's vantage point. The transference part of the book where Megan "falls in love with her therapist" was very believeable.<br/><br/>I would call this book a psychological killer. It's like a Dateline episode only much more detailed. You are constantly inside the three women's head.<br/><br/>*Rachel is the divorced women who likes to drink on the train. As she does, she stares out the window and projects pretend lives onto the people she sees. She is bitter because she couldn't get pregnant.<br/><br/>*Anna is the "other woman." She marries Rachel's "ex" Tom, and has a baby. A baby that Rachel had hoped to have.<br/><br/>*Megan and Scott are the couple that Rachel sees from the train window. They live in a house near the one where she used to live with Tom. Rachel imagines they live in perfect bliss.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, you will find each woman, and each man, have something to hide.<br/><br/>At times the action slows, so you can hear the voices inside the characters, but never for a minute does this dark psychological train slow down!
This story is told by three different women. And not one of them was likeable. I think you are suppose to sympathize with  Rachel, the girl on the train. But I found them all sad people. The two men in the book where almost interchangeable. The plot rambled on and then about two thirds of the way through it suddenly got really interesting.  Wish the first part had been  as good.
I thought it was a very confusing mystery.  I really didn't like it.  I think she was paranoid or by-polar.<br/>The writing was good.  Interesting plot with the train and how we pass the same places but never<br/>look at what is going on outside the train.  I took the train from Northbrook into Chicago for four years<br/>but I was glad I* could read.  Caryl Cat
The Girl on the Train was a well written British murder mystery that ticked all the boxes. It held my attention, kept me guessing, and did not disappoint. Paula Hawkins wove an excellent story with interesting psychological twists. Her use of alternating narrators was well served in assisting the reader to better understand the perspective of each main character.
I found this book to be difficult to read, and certainly more difficult to enjoy.  The anxiety level of this book surpassed what I was looking for in a mystery.  I story, although easy enough to follow, was not one I would care to encounter again.  I felt there was not one single, solitary positive event in this book, and regret that I took the time to finish it.
One of the worst books I have ever read.
I thought the book began just a bit slow, but as Rachel's character evolved, I found myself getting invested in it. I was feeling mad at her drunkenness, but, pity for how her ex-husband was treating her. Obvious issues of lack of self esteem  played a key role throughout. The twist and turns had me guessing throughout. Good read and I would recommend this novel.
Character development ?  Not much in this book.  I kept reading hoping to find it but alcoholic blackouts for one didn't do it. Nor was there much of it in the other characters except for unsavory manifestations. Simply cannot fathom anyone giving this book five stars. Don't waste time or money on it.  Would have given it  negative star had that been a choice.
I purchased this book after being told it was the next, "Gone Girl, but better."  It wasn't.  I thought the writing was sloppy and poor, the suspense lacking and the writing from the perspective of three women, weak.  Maybe women think the way these three do, and maybe that explains why I can't figure 'em out, but as far as holding my interest, hardly.
Read The Girl on the Train well after the peak of its popularity, I suppose. That did not detract from the book at all. I quickly saw what all the hype had been about.  The English setting, the awkward perspective of our main character, it all drew me in so quickly. I found myself immersed in Train and up for late nights stealing minutes reading when I could.
Worst book I've bought this year so far and I buy a lot. I got about half way thru and ditched it which I almost never do. The lead character is a self absorbed female twit which would be bad enough if there were any other likeable characters around, but there aren't. I just thought, I don't give a rat's what happens to any of these people so why read on?
This book is a morbid and dark travesty of literature. The plot is psychopathic and so insanely twisted that it almost seems like a joke. If this is a joke, it is a very bad one. This book has not only given me nightmares and made me wary of everyone, but it has ensured that I will never touch alcohol in my life. Also, I will never, ever use a corkscrew
This is the first book that has prompted me to comment on Goodreads.<br/>  It kept me up half the night one night last week and in bed reading this AM.  The alternating narration by the three main female characters and flashbacks required some concentration to follow, but each chapter added vital clues to the unexpected ending.  Definitely a Good Read!
It was difficult to get into the story.
Didn't hold my interest.  Jumps around.
A book of totally disfunctional people.
I did not care for the smutty language1
This book is CRAZY!!!!  Way over-rated.
Very Good,But some pages the writer changes the plot and the people without<br/>any fair warning (meanwhile back at the ranch,that's fair warning) so your reading<br/>along and suddenly figure out they are different people than the last paragraph since<br/>no name change for a few lines......<br/><br/>It is a small thing otherwise a great read!!!!
It was hard to understand at first, but it got so good I couldn't put it down.  I saw it advertised in a magazine for a book club and went home and downloaded it.  I am glad I did.  Very suspenseful..  You think you have it figured out and then you don't.  I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense.  Not exactly John Grisham, but I still enjoyed it.
I finally got around to reading this book.  I had seen the reviews and was intrigued. I did not really know what to expect but was not disappointed.  The style of the book kept me on my toes.  I found myself flipping back to be sure I knew which character was speaking.  Once I started reading, I could not stop. This would be a great book club read.
I must say I wasn't sure about this book at first. When I was 5-10% into it I thought I had it figured out. I was so wrong to question this book because it ended up being fantastic. There a few slower areas but most books have those. There are surprises throughout and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and have already started telling my friends!!

I guessed the killer about half way through.  It was an intriguing book, however it moved a little too slowly and was somewhat disjointed.  I enjoyed it and found the characters interesting, though.  I have heard it compared to Gone Girl and I really didn't see that, Gone Girl was more suspenseful and I did not guess the ending with that one.
These characters were gripping such mundane lives like the rest of the world but somehow I was surprised at how interesting and easily the demons people.face  can truly ruin everything.  I didn't like any of the characters all self absorbed but eventually your find a reason to hope for them all. I wanted to read this book and not put it down.
This is a great book set in England.  The main character is a hot mess. I felt like a voyuer watching and waiting to see what bad decision she would make next. A woman whose husband left her for his mistress.  They had the baby she desperately wanted.  She has turned to alcohol and leads a pretty pathetic life.  Surprise ending.  Recommend.
I tried to listen to this title and was thoroughly confused. So I read it. Much better. Can't think of the last time I've enjoyed the ride a good read gives me like this one. Crisp and clear writing, great characterization and lots of psychological build-up. Girl on the Train deserves all the hype it is getting as THE suspense read of 2015!
Pagingplaces is the best place to purchase books on Amazon! Not only did I get a great book in good condition at a fair price, but they sent me a complimentary book and bookmark! This kind of customer service just isn't common these days and I will forever go out of my way to purchase from here again and again! Thank you and happy reading!
I ended up listening to the audio on this one.  It was well worth my time.  I did figure out what was going on before the "Big Reveal" but I still enjoyed the storyline and how the characters paths crossed.  It definitely makes you want to drink less.  It also makes you think about your surroundings and who could be watching you.
After hearing such great reviews about this book I  stopped reading another to pick this one up. I persevered and stuck with it, then a quarter of the way thru that was all I could take. I didn't see any similarity to Gone Girl which I  couldn't put down. Too much constant back and forth I would forget who I was reading about. No thanks.
The author tells this tale of murder and deceit from the viewpoint of three women who were bound together by adultery, love, and lies.  It's so well written that the reader is constantly reviewing the evidence to determine "who did it."  I enjoyed the mystery and the search for the murderer among five people who lie throughout the book.
I enjoyed this book, although in the beginning it was hard to keep track of the characters.  After a few chapters, it all kind of clicks.  There are lots of twists to this story, and it is a bit unbelievable, but entertaining.  It is told through the voices of three different women whose stories all interconnect.  A good read overall.
I did enjoy this book. The author just seemed to give you limited information about the characters. I know I would think I had something figured out and find that I was wrong. We discussed this book at my book club and most of the members enjoyed the book. We talked about who we thought would play each character in the movie version.
This was a poorly written book... Language use very elementary, as if written for pre-teens except for the sexual content and rough language. Very trite.
I hated this book.  The only reason I finished it in the first place was because I had absolutely nothing else to read.  The only things the main character does is get drunk, snivel, have hang-overs and ride trains.  The other characters are equally unlikeable and I didn't care if any of them lived or not.  Don't waste your time.
This was an interesting fictional story that kept my attention.  I did not realize at first that there were 3 women narrators.  Each chapter told who was the narrator but on my Kindle the names did not show up very well.  I liked the English slant to the narrative and the story flowed pretty well but got a bit tedious at times.
LOVED this book.  I hadn't read a mystery in some time and this one helped me rekindle my affinity for these page-turners.  The main character is highly intriguing.  You will care and feel for her while you dart from page to page, trying to find out what happens next.  A well constructed and very readable psychological mystery.
To me this was great, despite some very obvious holes in the plot. But it had me totally, completely involved; which is all I ask for in a thriller. Good character depicting as well, ast least in Rachel: I thought she felt very real.The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is the ending, which sounded was very Scooby-dooish.
Great book! I finished it in 3 days.
Slow moving, didn't keep my interest
The book was very good I found I like the way it went back-and-forth between all three of them and I like the suspense of her not having a memory of anything until the very end when she pieced together bit by bit. It just made it harder to put the book down. I actually wanted the book to keep on going for a few more chapters.
Well written and almost engaging: an interesting study if 'the victim alcoholic.' An insight as to effects of mental abuse and the sad truth of how women become believers of the lies that men tell them. Would have been interesting to know something more of the histories of Rachel and Anna prior to their involvement with Tom.
This did get hard to put down once the story became more tense.  The characters are very complex and all have their own flaws making it difficult to determine who to trust or believe and even who the killer was until very close to the end.  I hadn't read this kind of thriller in a while, but I am glad I waited for this one.
This novel is perfect for fans of Gone Girl. Filled with twists and turns, characters that I'm not sure if I'm suppose to like, or pity, or cheer for. Three very strongly written female characters that I hope someday will be translated to film. The fun it would be to see fascinating actresses tackle these complex women.
I really enjoyed this book. I liked that each chapter was dated, and was told in the voice of one of the three women, Rachel , Anna, or Megan.The plot was interesting, set in the UK, and I finished the book quickly (I couldn't put it down). However towards the middle I had it all figured out. But all in all a fun read !
Very unhappy with this book despite being on the best seller list everywhere. Much preferred Gone Girl which was a 3 *. To think that somebody would waste money on making a movie based on this book is unbelievable. I actually bought this book rather than borrow from the library.... who does the NY Times reviews anyway?
I absolutely cannot believe this book has been #1 on the charts for weeks now.  I found the story incredibly slow due to the boring characters and the amnesia we have to constantly be reminded of.  I figured out the killer with still a 100 pages to go.  I expected so much more with all the great praise it has received.
The tone of the book is very dark and depressing, and I really had a hard time relating to the characters, they were all so sad, broken, no self respect. It did keep me guessing, but I'm more of a Moriarty fan, at least during the down time in her books you are entertained and not cringing at all the self depreciation.
The way the book was written was interesting but the overall plot was pretty predictable and by halfway in you totally know "who done it".
The author states in the afterword that this book is not necessarily based on true descriptions state mental health facilities during the 20's through 50's.  I would like to read a similar novel that is actually based on conditions, treatments, and events that reflect the state-run mental facilities during this time.
Am I the only one on the planet who DIDN"T like this book?  Maybe....but I found the characters to be very hard to like with their incredibly poor decision making skills and general spinelessness.  The plot seemed to really drag in the middle but I did finish it.  I'm just glad I didn't pay full price for this.
Rachel and Megan and Tom and Scott , oh my! And we mustn't forget Anna. What a bunch of messed up characters. They entertained me on a recent long flight.  The narrations by the different characters made me stay on my toes, and Ms. Hawkins' descriptions provided clear delineation of their personas. A fun,fine read!
I enjoyed this book, partly because it was set in England and the references to travelling on a train were very comfortable for me. I found the characters to be more complex than they first seemed. The book was remiscent to "Gone Girl" in some ways. I would recommend this book for it's originality of theme.
This story took a while to get going for me, it was a little slow towards the beginning. I really like how the story was told from the perspective of the three main women.  We never knew their whole until the very end. I loved the twist at the end and couldn't wait to see how it all came together. Worth the read.
I generally do not write reviews, but I wanted to express how much I enjoyed this book. I am an avid reader, and particular about the books I read. This book did not disappoint! The story is gripping, the characters believable, and the suspense keeps you tuning the pages. Ill be looking for the authors next book!
Didn't read it. Slow beginninging.
Hated book did not finish reading!
I couldn't put this down! Then I got close to the end and tried to make it last. What a great book! Loved every minute of it. I have a favorite new author and can't wait for her next book. No spoilers and maybe I have said too much, as I went into it with no expectations. So read without expectation and enjoy!
A very enjoyable read. Unlike some reviewers I did not find the author's switching between character voices to be in any way distracting. In fact it was a wonderful technique to build different levels of suspense one on top another. I'll be keeping a close eye on this author and plan to read her future works.
The suspense in who killed Megan was killing me! I like how this book switches point of views from each of the female characters.  You could guess who the killer is and then get completely surprised with the twist in the ending. Definitely give this 5 stars.  It was a quick read that will keep you interested.

This is an amazing book. It was a little confusing at first because there was such an entanglement of stories. The book was very well written and held my attention to the end. It amazed me that Ms. Hawkins could keep the stories straight. I look forward to reading other books she has written.
Poorly written, unlikable characters.  NOT Gone Girl...<br/><br/>Wanted to like this book, but so poorly done.  Lazy writing with an alcoholic prone to blackouts and falling down.  I couldn't wait to finish it because it was so poorly done.  Predictable.  Very disappointing on many levels.
Great story just needed to get to the end. I couldn't help feeling for Rachel and hoping for the best for her. I don't want to share much more, I don't want to spoil anything for those who want to read this. You have to read this. I read it because of the good reviews it good, so glad I did.
An interesting crime novel, built around the confused mind of an alcoholic woman. It could have been more tightly written, though. When the plot thickens the literary quality of the beginning is lost completely. The secondary characters might have been put to a better use in the denouement.
I bought this book because of its place on the best seller list. What I got was a book that did not have much depth. The writing was simple and the story line took 1/3 of the book to take off. I'm upset I wasted my money and do not understand at all why this has spent any time on any list.
A lot of hoopla for a mediocre story.  Not one character I cared about, except maybe the therapist who had listen to so many lies.
This book was a real page turner! I was completely obsessed with it up to the very end. To avoid initial confusion, make sure to pay close attention to the date noted and which character is narrating, at the head of each chapter. Then you will be in for an intriguing, thrilling read!
I did not like the book at all.
too dirty to read--sent it back
So this is a run-away best seller and probably deserves to be .  If Gone Girl is a genre then this is in that vein.  Interesting throughout and the plot twists are not initially obvious.  My only less than positive thought is " how many very flawed people can be in one story?"
Although all characters in this novel are oversimplified and stereotyped (alcohol abuse is far from scientifically correct, behaviour of all males and females in this novel is one-dimensional and unbelievable), the story is entertaining and as such a good read during train travel.
new details keep being added to this interesting narrative, causing twists and turns.  It  reminded me somewhat of Gone Girl, with unreliable narrators.  Story could be tightened a little, as it became repetitive, but then it took off and had a suspenseful,  satisfying conclusion.
this book was very similar to Gone Girl as it grabbed you when you started reading and could not put down until you found out how it ended.  I think it would be something enjoyed to read especially those of you who loved Gone Girl.<br/>I would definitely give it a 5 star rating.
You will not want to put this one down.  The author has brought you into each of the characters worlds before you even realize it. Very well done with no filler, this book is straight up a story that pulls you in and does not let go. Looking forward to more from this author !!!
Simply did not like this book.
I totally disliked the characters.  Especially Rachel until the end where she gained some strength. The story was entertaining and kept me reading. Reminds me of watching a play where there are only a dozen characters and all the action takes place on 3 rotating set changes.
Excellent weaving of characters' self doubt and insecurities, relationship ambiguities, and desire to take hold of the occasional glimmer of escape resulting in a story that provides the reader with a reinvented version of a classic "who done it" story right to the very end!
I would encourage the reader to keep reading.  I almost stopped at 40 or so pages because it was too depressing!  I also had to get used to the author switching the thoughts of the different girls.  BUT soon it was a great "who done it" that I couldn't stop reading!
I can't remember all that well.  I didn't like it.  I'm sure there are many people, who will like it.  I'm amazed I read the whole whole thing.  Beginning very confusing (to me).<br/>I already wrote this once, and now 'can't remember what I said.<br/>I hate doing reviews.
Great book - very engaging and definitely a page turner.  I really had no idea "who done it" until close to the end.  The author juggles story, time and place in a way that keeps you guessing but that isn't confusing.  Will definitely look for more from this author.
Slow beginning but the slow subtle way it builds suspense is perfection! Realistically flawed characters you feel that you have so much in common with. You are slowly drawn in to their lives and you cannot stop peering into the windows of their minds. Very hard to put down!
I loved this book. Such a dark tale about how connected people really are. I didn't figure out it was Tom until Anna found the phone. Then it all made sense. I loved the way it was written from the three women's views. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys thrillers.
To much filler going over the same thing over and over. We got it the first time. Would have been better as a short story.
This wasn't as satisfying a mystery as Gone Girl, the book I finished that this one was suggested off of, but it was a fast fun read that propelled me through my morning workouts. Twists were predictable but clever and I enjoyed it more and more the further into it I got.
I really enjoyed this book. Wasn't sure about this book at first but the more I read the better it got. Didn't know if I should feel bad for Rachel or think she was the murderer. Never would have guessed who the killer was. This book keeps you guessing till the very end.
I found it hard to get into but once I figured out all the players, etc. it was interesting.  It is just not the type book I would normally pick to read but this was the one that the book club I belong to choose so I read it.  I think for a murder/mystery, it was good.
Intriguing but dark story. I'd have liked the characters to sound more distinct, but overall, the story is engaging and the comparisons to Gillian Flynn are warranted. The protagonist is difficult at times to like, however, you never really stop wanting her to prevail.
I could no put this book down
The work merited # 1 ranking.
I enjoyed the book a great deal.  It kept my interest not only on the story line but, also, on the development of the characters.  I believe it is well-written and interesting.  If you like mysteries with various twists and turns, this is a good, gender-neutral, one.
Despite all the good reviews by NY Times and others, I did not like or enjoy this book. Most of the characters are unlikable except maybe the psychiatrist. Mainly I objected to the author's narrative style and found it easy to identify the murderer early in the book.
A great mystery that I couldn't put down.  The story kept you guessing the whole time.  The characters were complicated and realistic, and the author wove the story with believable suspense.  Furthermore, the ending was well thought out.  A thrilling, enjoyable read!
This is one of those books you shouldn't start reading if you have real life "stuff" expected of you as once you start it, you don't want to put it down.  Suddenly, working, grocery shopping, chores, etc don't seem as important as reading this well-written book.  The characters are all written very well and it's definitely a "who done it" story.  Rachel, the main character, is one that you cannot help to empathize with - a woman who is filled with haunted by the breakup of her marriage and inability to bear children and takes to drinking too much got some solace.  She sees the "perfect" couple at a regular train stop every day, creating a whole alternate life for this couple in her mind.  When her life actually starts to intersect with the perfect couple's life is where the book starts to twist and turn and strap yourself in as it's  quite the wild ride/read.  I figured out who "done it" about 80% in the book but even so the book was a wonderful read right to the last word.  This one will have you reading long past when you intended to be reading...

I really liked the way the author allows each of the three female characters to tell the story from their own perspective. That helps you really get to know them and what drives them.  But there are many twists and turns keeping you in suspense right up to the end.
This book is very easy to read. It holds your interest and moves quickly. It took me a while to like the main character, Rachel, but the story overpowers that issue, and I really enjoyed it. It would make a good movie, and I'll be surprised if that doesn't happen.
I'm sorry I take this book off my Kindle - I do not like such sexual books.  It seems that the authors feel they must make it explicit or at least reference so you know that the  person is doing in order to make the "10 Best Books".  This is not my choice!
I thought the characters were unappealing and the setting unappealing.  In fact, I have to say that I didn't really love the book until the ending - which made it all totally worthwhile.  My recommendation is to read the book, and hang in there - it grows on you.
This was an excellent story which will keep you guessing till the end.  Rachel can't believe she lost her husband because she drank.  You find yourself wanting her to start her life over. Yet, she perseveres until the total story comes out.  You"ll love this one.
This novel was a page turner! It takes a while to become sympathetic to the characters, but then you are drawn in by the whodunnits aspects of the story. What happened? Why? Eventually you distrust everyone except Rachel and you just have to read on to find out!
Not my usual genre, but I read it on a Goodreads recommendation.  Enjoyed it a lot.  It is presented in an unusual way in that it is written in the first person from each character's point of view.  You need to pay attention to the dates that head each chapter.
Excellent book and it's being made into a movie. I hope the film is as good as the book. I found that the way the author wrote by individual characters was interesting. I have read several books, seen several movies and TV productions done similarly. I like it!
I liked the style of this book - alternating voices, different time periods. I thought it would be distracting, but it served the storytelling well.  The male  characters were a bit flat but since they do not have a "voice" in the story, that is to be expected.
It is riveting, suspenseful read that keeps the reader guessing until the end. I especially enjoyed the depth of personality the author displayed in each character. The plot, as well as the characters are very well developed by the author. A must read for 2015.
I've seen the hype but I had difficulty in deciding to read this book. I think I feared that it wouldn't stand up to the reviews. I am so glad that I gave in. I finished it in 2 days, only because life intruded. Plainly stated, it was what a mystery should be.
Often books are described as " page turners that can't be put down."  But, I end up...putting books down -- even if they are very good!  Not this one!  I was mesmerized the minute I started reading it.  There are three voices in the book:  Rachel, a pathetic soul that's turned to booze, as her self-esteem has gone down the drain with her verbally abusive husband.  She still loves him, though, as he also has given her warm, rich, and romantic times.  She brings a lot of trouble on herself by being drunk and accusatory.  The second voice is Megan, the Golden Girl, but we are taunted to the very end knowing something is amiss with her.  The third voice is Anna -- Rachel's husband's new wife.  She seems the happiest of all -- basking in her new life as mother and wife to a man that dotes on her and completes her perfect new family.  This has been compared to Gone Girl, but I liked it way way better.  The resolution is much more believable.  It's not totally 'happily ever after", but the reader does have a good feeling that justice was served.
Tt's a British mystery<br/>At first I didn;t think I really liked the story. I got bogged down with not liking the main character and her drinking and feeling sorry for herself<br/>Rachel is divorced from Tom. Tom had an affair with Anna and is now married to Anna and they have a baby - and they all live happily in the house where Rachel used to live. Rachel drinks every day, gets really drunk every day, and calls Tom all of the time. She has lost her job, but she rides the train every day to London so that her roommate believes she still has a job. The train takes her past her old house.<br/>As she passes by the house - she looks at her old neighborhood. She sees a couple who live a few doors down from her old house. She makes up about them. A loving couple, madly in love. Then one day she sees the wife kissing another man...and then the wife goes missing. She becomes obsessed with telling the husband what she saw from the train. She was in the village that night - but in a black out drunk - and she has pieces of a memory<br/>A really good story
This is clearly a very popular book, but I quit reading after the vomiting scene got her thrown from her apartment.
I liked this book.  It was a bit slow at the start and even a bit confusing, but it picked up speed and had a magnificent, thrilling ending.  If you like suspense, after you've read Touch, this would be a good second read.  I say this because Touch is better.
I don't know why I like books about crazy people that do irrational things, but I love them.  This is one of those that has you questioning why does she keep doing that....she needs stop acting like an idiot & get a hold of herself, but it's hard to put down!
Boring is an understatement.
Immature and boring writing.
It did not hold my interest!
Quick read suspenseful drama
Hesitated before buying, but after reading the sample (which I love being able to do!) I decided to take a chance.  It did not disappoint.  Was reading so fast to get to the end I had to go back for the points I missed.  Second time through will be to savor.
The evolving confidence and belief in oneself is a never ending human task and this novel embodies and excels at this basic tenet. I loved it and I am really picky about spending money on kindle when I belong to a fantastic library.  Truly worth it. Margaret
I love this book! Once you start you are like.. "Hmmm it seems interesting..." but once you get around page 25 things start getting crazy and thrilling! Great book, if you like thrillers you should definitely get this one. You won't be dissapointed!
All the twists and turns!<br/><br/>I felt the author had a great sense of acceptance as she presented each character.  She could see both sides of humanity without judgement.<br/>She managed to keep me guessing.<br/>I feel the makings of a great movie .
This book was amazing. When you think that you have it figured out, the Author takes you on not just a train ride, a gut wrenching look into people's lives. I read this in a day and half, I could not put it down. What a amazing book..well, worth the read!!!
I really enjoyed this book however it was quite confusing at the beginning.  You don't really catch on until the 4-5th chapter how the lives of their characters intersect.  Loved the twists and turns of the characters- and really don't know who to believe!
This book is frustrating!  The pace is slow and repetitive and the protagonist kept making horrid choices for herself at every turn.  Final chapter, though exciting, could not make up for the rest of this story that feels as if it drags on for an eternity.
The characters were weak.  The plot was weak.  As soon as Megan disappeared I knew she was dead and who killed her.  I read the entire book, because I always finish a book that I start.  I could have never started this one and it would have been no loss!
This was a good book. I didn't think I would like it when I first started reading it. Once I got started I didn't want to put it down. I usually figure out 'who done it' almost immediately.  I didn't figure this one out until almost the end of the book.
This book was a study of three women who "loved" a man<br/>who lied, cheated, and used them.<br/>Riding the train was a constant, an observation that tied the<br/>story together.<br/>I chose a five for the mystery, which didn't unfold until the end.
Did not hold my interest!!!
Nicely paced, giving you enough time to learn who each of the characters are, without bogging you down with back story. The Girl on the Train is an entertaining who dunnit, nothing too shocking but keeps you guessing for a while. It's a good read.
I had a very hard time getting into this novel. The varying timelines and viewpoints were difficult for this casual reader to keep up with. However, once I became more invested in the story line (about 50% through the book) I couldn't put it down.
It was so hard to put the book down and I would rush back to it every chance I could. So very well written. Very clever. Many comparisons are being made to "Gone Girl" but banish that from your thoughts and expectations and settle in for the ride.
What a fun read!  It did remind me somewhat of Gone Girl in terms of the writing style, but the story was its own.  It was one that I could not put down, a true thrill ride!  I just know this is going to become a great movie like Gone Girl did :)
This book will always be one of my favorites. Beautifully written and a true page turner. The author really allows you to get to know the characters from three different women's perspectives. Plot was engaging and left me clueless until the end.
Loved it!  Just stayed up late to finish it.  Reminded me of Gone Girl. You have a sense that something isn't right, you know a character is shady, but you're not sure which one.  Also like how each chapter is a different characters perspective.
One of the best books I have read of this genre in quite some time .  I like to keep my reviews short and sweet so I will just urge those who love psychological mysteries with compelling characters and plot to run...not walk...to get this one!!
First place on Amazon??? Really? I reckon the only reason this novel made it to the first place is only because all the others are so bad. I read quite a lot, and of the latest books that I have read, there are only a few that I would absolutely recommend:<br/><br/>"Lost World of Bletchley Park: An illustrated History of the Wartime Codebreaking Centre" by Sinclair McKay.<br/>The Bell Harbor trilogy by Tracy Brogan.<br/>"Me Before You" by Jojo Moyes.<br/>"The Shadow of the Wind" by Carlos Ruiz Zafón.<br/><br/>Literature quality seems to be going to the dogs in a hand basket. Maybe it is because publishing books has become so easy nowadays? Who knows? Something I cannot fathom either is how sorry turkeys with absurdly ridiculous plots and/or zero literary worthiness frequently reap thousands of glowing reviews and become runaway best sellers. "On the Island" by Tracey Garvis Graves and the Twilight saga for instance, and many, many others.
I enjoyed this although it was a little too coincidental.  The characters were realistic, if not always likable.  A good read and kept me wanting to come back to see what happens next.  At the end, they were not characters I felt I would miss.
I did not expect anything from this book yet it is one of the best I've read. The suspense and twisting plot truly makes it hard to quit reading. I am now going to hunt for more Paula Hawkins' works. Well done, Paula. Thanks for a great read!
Didn't care for this book.
Just couldn't get into it!
This book was subtly slow paced but each chapter provided new surprises and kept me wondering about how all of the different moments could possibly be tied together in a way that would satisfy the reader (me). It was successful in doing so.
Decided to buy this book due to it being on NY Times Best Sellers.  Bought it for my honeymoon to Aruba.  Finished it in less than 48 hours (my poor husband probably felt neglected). Easy read!  If you like this book, I recommend Gone Girl.
The main character couldn't stop drinking--and about half way through the book I wanted to start drinking too.  Great last 50 pages but first 250 pages about a woman who couldn't/wouldn't control her own life was not my idea of a good read.
One of these "can't put down" books, the only reason for four star rating is that it can be a bit disjointed between the three women's stories. Perhaps a plot device, to keep the reader frenzied and confused, but it borders on distracting.
This was a great read! I loved the pace of the book and the way the story unfolds, never learning too much that you become less interested. The way you learn information about the story and characters is very clever. I highly recommend it!
This book was really hard to get into for the first part, then it really took off and held my interest. I struggled with liking the main character, but gradually got over that and could not put the book down for the last part of the book.
I thought this was done very well. It took me a couple of beats to get used to the non-chronological presentation but that helped keep me guessing and turning pages, and it held my interest. I hardly put it down once I started reading it.
Loved and hated The Girl on the Train. Writer did a stupendous job in organization of book, delineated characters well, superb writing BUT I still didn't like it. It was a downer in every aspect except for Rachel who achieves redemption.
The characters are written in a way that drew you in plot was reasonable ,believable truly riveting. Felt very much a part of the story it enticing draws you in like you are truly an observer or a friend. Could not put it down wonderful!
This book caught me from the very first sentence! It moved quickly and kept me wondering what was coming next. The book was recommended for those who liked Gone Girl.  I did not care for Gone Girl and I thought this book was much better!
This a fantastic thriller, this is not high minded literature. This is a page turning book narrated by three unreliable characters which keeps the reader on his/her toes. Reads quickly, which is even more satisfying for thriller novels.
5 star rating easily for this book! An exciting book full of twists and turns.  The author does a great job with depicting the thought process within the characters. Will definitely be interested in reading more novels by Paula Hawkins.
This book is brilliant. It has a gone girl feel but I found myself trying to solve the mystery. it was wonderful to read, loved the characters and language. i recommend reading if you like mystery. one of the best i hae read in a while.
I loved this book. The thing is I have a hard time finding books that dont bore me by the time I've read the cover flyleaf. Do yourself a favor and read the reviews here sparingly, many of them give away the whole plot and outcome. Geez! That was the part of what made the book great - discovery. I like sparse writing and 'bleak' stories, imperfect characters (i.e., those more closely reflecting reality). Something here reminded me of Paul Auster's writing. At certain points you begin to wonder if some of the narrators have lost touch with their sanity. Despite not fitting into the 'longing for a husband/child/family' syndrome, curiously I could totally relate to these women. The loss of self-esteem associated with certain harmful relationships, the specter of jealousy, the longing for love, the shame that results from excess - Yes! Love this! The author kept me anxious and concerned for the characters' safety throughout. Highly entertaining.
Took me a while to figure out that chapters were narrated by different characters and the time skipped around. However, the author pulled you through the story and you sympathized with all the damaged characters. Quiet a riveting read!
Great read! Reminiscent of Gone Girl, but truly stands on its own as a fast paced, intriguing thriller. Already recommended it to the gals at the office, I know they'll dig it! Thanks Ms. Hawkins, definitely want to read more from you!
A great read! Fast paced. The main character reminds me of Holly St. James in the psychological thriller, Stumbling Stone, by Ivy Rowsell. There are lots of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat! I highly recommend it.
This was a most intriguing story, and kept me guessing right until the end. I read it at the same time as my sister and Mom and we loved talking about it together. Characters were a bit out of the box as well. Quick, fun read overall.
Eh.  After reading all the great reviews I thought this would be a book I could not put down.  Kept waiting for it to get good, never did.  Got really repetitive in terms of weak/ stupid pushover women..........ending was predictable.
This was a really interesting story and told from cool perspectives. It was uniquely written and held my attention the entire time. There are so many interconnected stories going on. I couldn't wait to see how everything would unfold.
I found this book a bore.
Adrenaline ride throughout! One of those whodunit that piques your curiosity then sucks you in until the "who" is revealed.  Once you pick up the book, you are forced to stick with it through the end. I definitely recommend.
This was one ride I could not get off! I read this book in the course of 3 nights, I couldn't put it down. The story sucked me in and the pace was just right. None of the characters were likeable but I still cared.... fun easy read.
Great read! Kept me intrigued but I figured out who the killer was about 1/2 way through the book. I was interested, though, to find out how Rachel pieced the events together and discovers the killer. Read this, it is never boring.
Very disappointed.  The reviews were so high, describing a "real page turner" and I about gave up reading it several times.  Guess it was just not my kind of story.  However, I did finish it and was surprised in the ending.
This is such a well written novel. The characters are so intriguing. I loved Rachel even when she's drinking too much. I always felt she was going to turn out well. The storyline had many twists, kept me guessing. Loved this story!
This came highly recommended by a book club I follow. I found parts confusing trying to figure out who was narrating, some parts a little boring. Overall not a bad book, interesting storyline and setting. Liked it, didn't love it.
....the person of suspicion isn't the right one at all and the next page can't be turned quickly enough. Chapters designated with each person's story keeps the plot moving at a rapid pace. Definitely a thriller for the big screen!
I loved this book!! Excellent debut novel. I really enjoyed the first-person perception from 3 f the main characters. Very fast-moving and not a word, paragraph or sentence wasted. Looking toward to reading Ms. Hawkins next work.
Wow, what a twist.  I certainly didn't expect the amiable husband to be the villain in this.  This tale also is a warning to all those women who think they've won a man away from his wife. All they've gained is a man who  cheats.
Felt like this was 'Gone Girl Wannabe'.  It was initially hard to get into, to keep the cast of characters straight but seemed much to mired down in the main characters issues with drinking and her divorce.  Gone Girl was better.
When I first started reading The Girl on the Train, I was thinking it was going to be a great novel.  About the middle of the book I was getting bored.  It is full of suspense at the end.  Maybe I just wasn't in the reading mood!
Loved the book. Kept me intrigued the whole way through and while I kind of guessed, I was never sure about the outcome until the end. So I would definitely recommend Easy read too, had it done in 2 days of "leisure" time
There must be something wrong with me because this book is number one on the best seller list and I struggled to read it.. I had to read it for a book club but I couldn't even finish it in time. I never really got into it. Sorry.
I'm not sure what books others are reading to make them think that this is so thrilling and great. I was very bored with a lot of the book and frustrated with the characters. The end got better. I would say the book is just okay.
Rachel, the main character, was paranoid, needy, lived in a dream world and was a drunk....no redeeming qualities there.  I either want to emphathize or be able to root for someone in a book, and I just couldn't do that for her.
Truly a book that "hooks you".  It took a bit to get it straight in the beginning, but was well worth the effort.  One of those books that somehow haunts you when you least expect it.  One of the best I've read recently.
Kept my attention but the story drug on a bit and was on the verge of being made up to fit into a suspense novel category. Well written and flowed well. Overall good, but not as good as I expected going by some of the reviews.
Told from three different narrators' points of view, this book is a great page-turner. The story is intriguing. Rachel, a drunk, is a completely unsympathetic character. But that's ok, because it makes the book more realistic.

I couldn't stop reading this book! Never boring, it keeps you focused on the story line. The author did a wonderful job with the suspense and made it an easy page turner. If you like mystery and suspense this book is for you
This book was fantastic! When it started I didn't think I'd get through it due to the very whiny nature of the protagonist. But, as you proceed through the book, you cannot put it down. A most excellent book and a good read.
I could not put it down!
This is one compelling read.  I read comparisons to Gone Girl before I started this, and I see where people make that comparison, but I would say that I was more frequently surprised by this one.  Two big thumbs up from me!
What a joy to find a book that grabs you from the first page, pulls you in and keeps you there for an enjoyable ride. The characters in the story continue to linger long after I finished the last page.......Highly recommend
It was a sad story, the concept different from most mysteries.  For someone who reads for intrigue or pleasure this moved way too slow. Did not hold my interest but I finished it because I had th find out who did it!!!! Lol
The narrative switching constantly between characters, stoping at the point you are desperate to hear more, leaving you desperate to get back inside that characters head. The girl on the train will keep you wanting to read.
I saw that quite a few friends were reading and bragging on this book, so I decided to dive in. Overall it has a great story line and left me wanting to read for hours. I felt the only downfall was that it starts off slow.
This compelling story illustrates the power of human frailties - addictions, guilts, and manipulations - colliding against strengths - self-preservation, drive to set things right - in a train wreck of maternal instincts.
I am generous giving this book three stars.  Lacking in depth as to its characters, plot and style it reeks of tabloid fodder.  I find nothing memorable within its pages.  I'm giving the author a passing grade for effort.
I thoroughly enjoyed this story and couldn't put it down until the end.  It totally kept my interest which I enjoy when I read. What a wonderful imagination the writer has to keep her readers engrossed in the story line.
I enjoyed this book!<br/>It was fast going, and  Megan, Rachel and Anne just kept me on my toes!!!<br/>The only thing to pay attention to is the dates! It's important not to lose track! It kind of goes back and forth!
A real page turner!  You will not be able to put it down during the last 100 pages. All the characters are deeply flawed people but you still care what happens to them. The book is well written and decidedly a thriller.
What a great mystery told by 3 women. I couldn't put this book down because it was so suspenseful! The author ma de the characters so believable. I definitely would recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story.
The Girl on the Train is a page-turner that will keep you up at night.  The  twists and turns will keep you guessing until the end!  Highly recommend this thriller ..if you liked Gone Girl  this one is not to be missed.
I never read Paula Hawkins before, but I total enjoyed this book. It started a little slow but give it a Couple chapters and you can't put it down. Just when I thought I knew the answer, "I didn't ".. Loved it.
Bored. Couldn't even finish. Maybe I am hard to please, but I really like thriller and twists. I only got about 30-40% through and gave up. Maybe I will go back and finish it some other time. Not sure why all the hype.
Intriguing, fast read.  All seen through the eyes of a troubled young woman who rides the train to and from work every day.  Sometimes what you see is not what you get.  Great twists. I could see this as a great movie.
From what I've heard, it's a lot like Gone Girl. The main character is irritating and over the edge. I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this book, if you really want to read it, just take it out of the library.
This is a book that you won't want to put down until you have reached the unexpected conclusion. Paula Hawkins keeps you on the edge of your seat and really in suspense as to the outcome until the very end. No peeking!
I never write reviews on here, but I felt compelled to do so for this book.  I read a lot and am a tough critic... this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I literally could not put it down.  Not to be missed!!
I have seen this book around for a while and put a hold on it.  I finally got it and it was terrific! So well written.  The suspense was palpable. I read it way too fast, and I wish I had slowed down to enjoy it more.
This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I read it. It was really a great mystery that had me constantly changing my mind about who I thought the villain was. Intriguing plot and fast paced. I love it.
Not my style, not sure if girl has multiple personality disorder or if she really killed the baby and the woman down the street or if  she has delusions about the woman's husband and herself. Also she could be skitso!
This book may be the best book I have ever read. Terrific writing and a wonderful story. The only problem I foresee, is that this book has set the bar so high, I wonder where I can find another read I enjoyed as much.
I enjoyed this book.  I brought it on vacation and it was a good story and easy to read.  The main character's addiction issues were believably portrayed.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a light distraction.
An enjoyable read with a lot of suspense. The kind of story that keeps you guessing. Just when I thought I figured out who the guilty party is, another twist took my suspicions elsewhere. In the end, I was surprised.
I really didn't know what to expect.  The heroine is flawed & tragic, but you can't help but feel for her.  The storyline continually takes unexpected twists, & the ending...well, I don't want to reveal anything.  ;)
This book was NOT at ALL what I was expecting after reading the synopsis! I also could not find one redeemable quality in the main character that made me at all interested in her outcome! Waste of my time and money!!
Interesting story.  Gets a bit cumbersome.  As is typical of this genre, it stretches the imagination too far.  Not a bad read, just a bit tedious.  Rachel has a lot of problems.  Can't stop the problems of drinking.
Looved this! The suspense. And the characters. And the way you think you have the plot figured out. And then you don't. It dragged a smidge in the middle, but I was never even close to quitting this fantastic story.
What's ride!i I certainly wasn't expecting that ending! That was certainly a convoluted plot with interesting and unexpected twists and turns throughout!i loved it and recommend it highly to mystery buffs everywhere
Good God !!  I haven't read a page turner like this ages. My entire Easter  preparation plans are wrecked .  I've been reading/listening to it nonstop .  Only advice . Clear your calendar . Riveting . Bravo !!!!!!!!
Well written,plot had enough twists and turns to keep me wondering until the end.,making for a page turner,ending could have been better in my opinion.,never was a fan of killer explaining his actions,but still good
The author needs a basic lesson in writing. You can't have a woman who's being murdered narrate her own murder unless you expect your readers to believe in ghosts or to be very unsophisticated readers. In fact, all the various first-person accounts turn out to be unbelievable when you ask yourself how they got recorded--were all the women keeping diaries or blogs? Apparently we're to believe that these first-person accounts somehow appear on the pages with nothing to substantiate their existence in the world that the author creates aside from the fact that the author is putting them down on paper herself. No, it's a pretty good story but should have been handled with more attention to verisimilitude. Actually the comparisons to Hitchcock are rather appropriate, seeing as how he was very inattentive to details of verisimilitude in a number of his movies.
Very disappointing read
couldn't get through it
This was not a good book..author all over the place.  I had a hard time getting into the characters,  and kept mixing up a couple of them.  One of my book club cohorts got it right..it was like a drive by shooting.
I was torn between racing through the chapters and wanting to savor this tale as long as possible. The many layers of these characters are revealed slowly and deliciously. I will look for more books by this author.
I stayed up into the wee hours of the night to finish this. It was worth it. I did know who did it by the first few chapters but untangling the web was so thrilling I couldn't put it down. Bravo Ms. Hawkins. Bravo.
I did not know that this was going to turn out to be such an amazing book until I was about ten percent into it and noticed I could not put it down! It really surprised me. I love this style of writing. Great read!
This was a book I couldn't wait to get back to after every time I had to put it down. There were a few spots that were a little frustrating, but the rest was so good, this author has earned her five stars from me.
Story was riveting from first page. Not often I gat ensnared for hours reading. Story reveals 4 whacked characters and their involvements,all sick, with each other.  All but impossible to figure out until the end.
This book is one that catches you within the first chapter. Make sure you have free time because one you start its impossible to stop. Well written and suspenseful at every turn off the page. I give it give stars.
It's a wannabe Gone Girl. Totally predictable. I skipped ahead in 50 page blocks. The main character a is pathetic a wannabe victim. No beauty to the writing and the sensational use of alcohol abuse is offensive.
I couldn't put this story down! It's told so perfectly, I found the writing was well done. I would come this'll to Gone Girl but that would be an insult to the writer as this story in itself is much better told.
Great, quick read that feels like a movie. It is of a cadence similar to Gone Girl. Not super cerebral but an easy and interesting read with a ton of twists and turns that will keep you captivated until the end.
Generally, I enjoyed the book. Some of the characters bothered me, but you just really want to know who killed Megan. I recommend this book, generally, but know that the characters can be incredibly frustrating.
Just when you think you've figured it out, bang! Another twist. You learn early on that the narrator is unreliable (she is a drunk prone to blackouts, after all), but when and how unreliable remains to be seen.
Lots of twists and turns in the first half of the plot. The protagonist was a hard character to like or feel sympathetic for.  The last half the plot got more predictable and the main character rather pathetic.
Oh how I love me some Rachel!!  As a good Southerner all I can say is, Bless your heart girl ! The Girl on the Train characters are most dysfunctional and I could not wait to see what their next moves would be.
This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time I read it. It was a great mystery that had me constantly changing my mind about who I thought the villain was. Intriguing plot & fast paced. I loved it.
This was a great read.  Kept my interest throughout and was filled with lots of twists that were unexpected.  I liked the way Paula wrote. The words spilled out naturally. No awkwardness here!  Really enjoyed.
Good read, page turner. I put off reading this because I was afraid it was another Gone Girl, which I did not enjoy, but this had a great story, interesting characters and was well written. Recommend!!
With poetic imagery and a plot line that will keep you turning the pages, this novel is the best I've read since Gone Girl. If you appreciate multi-narrative, suspense novels, this is the book for you.
This was just okay for me.  I didn't like Gone Girl at all and there were parts of this story where I found myself making comparisons to this book.  Thankfully this one ended better than Gone Girl did.
If you are looking for an easy read mystery, this is the book for you.  It kept you wondering what would happen next to the main character.  It was almost like Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window."
A great read with surprising characters and interesting plot twists. Could not put this novel down, and was thrilled to discover I had not figured it out halfway through. Cannot wait for her next book!
Really loved this book. I liked how the author wrote from different perspectives but the content didn't repeat itself as some POV's can tend to do. I hated putting the book down-it's very suspenseful.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book - was full of suspense and twists from beginning to end.<br/>Kept of having to think about the characters and reminding myself of the story behind them - - Brilliant read
I was disappointed in the book.  It was slow in moving along with in any plot.  It was not a page turner.  It was waste of my money.  If I could of returned half of the way thru the book I would have.
Where to start?!  Picked it up and couldn't put it down. A brilliant mystery with twists and turns.  I can see why people compare it to Alfred Hitchcock, but more updated.  This is an author to watch.
I read this In one day when there was nothing to do at work during a blizzard. So good. Couldn't put it down. Don't understand the negative reviews. Not the best book I've ever read, but entertaining.
Great novel, so much raw emotion, definitely a page turner. I could not put it down even when it competed with my favorite TV shows. Well written, unexpected twists and turns, interesting characters.
I read this book because it was recommended to me since I loved Gone Girl. This was not nearly as riveting as Gone Girl but is was a good easy read. Slightly predictable but it did keep my attention.
Confusing as the girl on the train gave the one house she saw the closest made up names and time went by and she got know them, their names were not what she made or were they liked she had imagined!
It was a bit slow to start in the beginning and I had trouble understanding what was going on. After I continued to read it became clear. I needed to continue to read and find out what was going on.
A mysterious novel of angst and developing understanding. It took a while to get into the story with flipping from woman to woman but once you clicked to the style and identities is was a good read.
Easy to read, very entertaining<br/>Got cought really fast, good pace, fun and interesting unraveling of the story.<br/>Totally recommended for a plane or bus ride - or to enjoy while on vacation.
After reading some bad reviews about this book I almost quit reading but I'm glad I stuck it out. About halfway through it gets pretty intriguing. Not the best book I've ever read but worth reading.
This book was addicting. I was hooked from the first chapter. A good suspenseful read! Some of the vocabulary was off but I am very anal regarding it. Couldn't wait to get home and read it everyday.
You don't want to like Rachel. She drinks, has blackouts, desperately wants her ex husband back but as the mystery unfolds she gains your trust as she figures out the riddle that tugs at her memory.
I saw a review in People and thought this might be a decent read. It has been hard to put down. The story draws you in and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Great story and I highly recommend it!!!
This is an exciting, keep you on the edge of your seat, didn't want to put it down book.  It started a little slow but, as a train picks up speed when leaving the station, the book picked up speed.
Gone girl ON a Train.<br/><br/>Great story writing with alternating narration and a solid mystery plot and subplot. The end seemed to be phoned in. A few character plot holes also left wide open.
This was a very entertaining and exciting story.  I enjoyed reading it.  The suspense held me until the very end.  Would definitely recommend if you love a juicy mystery with many different facets.
Good read, suspensful
Couldn't put it down!
Didn't like it at all
Could have been a really awesome book, but the plot line was drug out and only got interesting in the last 30 pages or so. If you are expecting a fast-paced novel, I would not recommend this book.
The Girl on the Train is the kind of book that is hard to put down once you start. If you liked Gone Girl it has a a similar intense story line without the explicit sex scenes.  Great summer read.
This is a hard one to put down.  The main character, to me, was not someone I could relate to at all, but that did not keep me from worrying about her, and wondering what would happen to her next.
I liked the depth of the characters and how I could see the story as it developed from each of their perspectives.  I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book.  It really was a gripping story!
Confusing at first, but then I straightened out who was who and it went at a fast pace after that.  No spoiler alert....you must read it yourself!<br/>Very good book and will make a great movie!
Slow start. It was a very different book from what I read. It was really interesting and hard to put down as I continued to read. Totally surprise ending. I'm still talking and thinking about it.
Great read. Finished the book within 24 hours and it held my interest. Great book that took my mind off of everything else except what I was reading.  I would definitely read more by this author.
Riding the 'train' intices the reader to stay on board!  Characters, plot, alongside<br/>The magic if story telling...delivers those 'on board' to arrive at the depot... with anticipation sated.
This book did not deserve all the hyp it has been given. It can not compare with The Nightengale, or All the light We Cannot see, etc. It had lots of twists and turns, but was not a stellar read.
This was top notch thriller.  From the first paragraph to the last it had my undivided attention.  Great story, great pacing, great character development. I hope to see a lot more of this author.
This was a fantastic read. Couldn't put it down, and read it all in one day. The characters were well drawn out, and Ms. Hawkins keeps you guessing right up until the end. Well deserved success!
I feel that the author did a great job presenting the physical and psychological effects of alcohol on one's body and mind.  I was enrapt with this novel until the end which was a bit of a drag.
I will not write a summary of the book.  I will just say this is by far the best book I have read in the past decade, perhaps maybe the best book I have ever read and I am always reading a book.
I could not out it down. Found myself waking up and wanting to read right away. I kind of guessed a few things but a few things surprised me. I definitely recommend this book. It was very good.
I could not put this book down. Only time in my life I was thankful for a blizzard...nothing to do but read all day and soak up every word. Twists and turns and suspense from start to finish!!!
Even reading others reviews of not being able to put this book down I still started it on a Friday evening...finished around midnight Sat. Great suspense without being too graphic and grizzly.
It was a good, intriguing book that I would recommend if you're in a book slump.  Many compare to Gone Girl, and I didn't think it quite holds up to that standard, but is overall a good book.
drags most of the way, very depressing.  The last few chapters did finally grab me, but it took almost the whole book.  Really cannot understand how it has been so strong on best seller list.
I could just not guess the killer till the very end. I think this is the beauty of a thriller that it keeps you engaged, that you don't leave the book even for a second. Wonderfully written!
Purchased this book because of other reviews on Amazon.  All true, this was a great read.  Wasn't able to figure out the ending 50% into the story, which I do often with mysteries/thrillers.
Excellent!  Kept me guessing every time I turned the page.  I promised myself I would only read it while my students had independent reading time but it got harder and harder to put it down.
This was part of a "book club" book and everyone had a tough time staying on point with characters, having to go back to understand. Though at a point it does connect and takes off!
I seldom give reviews because I seldom finish a book.  Most just do not merit, at least in my humble opinion, reading them from start to finish.  This one did, and in fine style.  Good Job!
Listened to "Girl on the Train" over the course of a 4-day drive on Interstate 80 from California to Colorado. Scenery pretty desolate -- book very engrossing. The perfect antidote!
This is maybe the second review I've written.  Actually, I don't even find the need to write anything beyond saying read what the other one- and two-starred reviews have said, and I concur.
I usually don't read reality based fiction, it just doesn't do anything more me.  I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  The voices and the perspectives and the twists were gripping.
It was an ok read - however! I cannot understand why this book is a "best seller"<br/>The writer seemed to stumble around a bit & the shifts from person to person a bit confusing-
Couldn't put this book down. It kept me guessing till the very end, where all the pieces fit together  with the satisfying feeling of snapping the last piece of a jigsaw puzzle into place!
You won't forget it.
Dragged quite a bit.
I was glued and it takes a good story, with good writing in order for me to say that.<br/><br/>Just when I thought I had the story figured out, she had me guessing again.<br/><br/>WOW
What a great story.  I think it was better than "Gone Girl"which I just loved.  I hope someone makes this into a film, now that I've read this mystery, I would enjoy it on the big screen.
Absolutely LOVED this book!  Kept its secrets until the end.<br/>Characters were well developed, but not overly so.<br/>Made me remember the old adage...."All that glitters is not gold"

Written from the perspective of three women that allows insight into each one's lives. It will keep you reading to figure out the tangled stories of each character. I really enjoyed it!
I loved, loved, loved this book & completely understand how it made the top ten. I loved all the twists and turns throughout the story and every character was incredibly well developed.
This was a novel approach, to tell it through the point of view of a woman traveling to and from work by train daily. The story unfolded quite unexpectedly.  I was immediately drawn in.
What a book!  I was kept guessing almost to the end!  Good imagination with the story telling!  Very alive with action, happiness and sadness, violence and endings.  Well worth reading!
Started out as a difficult read on my Kindle. Then I realized the story was jumping back and forth between characters and dates. It held my attention and kept me guessing till the end.
Great book.  Very atmospheric.  Believable and interesting characters.  The story builds slowly at first but you know it's headed somewhere deliciously sinister.  Enjoyed it very much.
Best book I have read since the Gillian Flynn trilogy. Great narrative that keeps you guessing the whole book. Definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys mysteries and crime drama!
A wonderfully suspenseful read. If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this book.<br/>Each character has their secrets, and it's a nail-biting venture watching them all unfold. Loved it!
I found this book really exciting and I loved the twist. I found it hard to relate to the characters but I kind of think that's a good thing. Very easy to read and a page turning plot
I couldn't put it down but this isn't sunshine and rainbows. The author does a fantastic job of letting you feel the loss, panic, hurt, and desperation portrayed throughout the story.
I loved this book! I felt like a detective, finding out more information from different characters in each chapter. I couldn't put it down. Loved the surprising conclusion!
Twists and suspense made this a wonderful story. The characters were all so tragic and flawed, but I still wanted (needed?) to keep reading to find out each of their fates.
Very interesting. The character Rachel is very well written. She was real. I had it figured out several times, incorrectly, before everything came together at the very end.
Hard to put down although sometimes so disturbing that I wish I could. Not your typical low key British mystery. Outstanding character development and plotting. Well done!
What a talented, remarkable writer!  All the characters are so vividly portrayed, you feel as though you can picture them.<br/>Do yourself a favor and purchase this book!
I have never read anything by this author until I read this book. Wow what have I been missing.  From beginning to the end I felt I was part of Rachel's life.  Great book!
This book is written in the style of 'Gone Girl'. Both captivate you until the very end. The middle of 'Girl on a Train' was a little long, but the ending made up for it!
This was a fantastic story with well developed characters and plenty of twists. Once I started reading I couldn't stop. Finished it in two days. Definitely worth reading.
Each character is  brought to life; three dimensional. The story has exciting twists and chilling turns. I flew through the pages and was thoroughly satisfied at the end.
The story dragged.
I know this is a story that will not so forget. The plot was steady with a lot of twists and turns. It took a while for me to figure out who done it. Highly recommended.
Great story, told from multiple perspectives.  Keeps the reader guessing not only about the murder mystery, but about the reliability of the narrators.  A terrific read.
This book was a page turner with interesting characters and a few good plot twists. The mystery could have been a bit more elaborate but it was satisfying none the less.
Good book. I believe a book is only as good as its ending and this book delivered on that.  Too many books have a good story but then the ending bombs.  This one didn't.
Loved this book for many reasons. I liked how each chapter was narrated by the ladies in the story? It was such an easy read I polished it off in 2 days & I wanted more!
Good storyline. Hitchcock would have loved it.  Glad to hear it will become a movie.  Would love to see the movie version and who are cast for the three main characters.
Similar to Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl, the pacing was fantastic and I finished the story in just three days. I'll certainly be looking for more stories from this author.
One of those books you don't want to put down despite my disdain of several of the characters. The suspense in this book palpable and the mystery was not disappointing.
Don't read reviews. Ignore what I have written. Just read it. However, if you already did...<br/><br/>That was pretty good, eh? Being British makes everything better.
This was such a dark and brooding book with many twists.  I usually have the end figured out and this caught me by surprise.  Read it and love it!!!<br/><br/>Sherry C
I liked the inter-connectedness of the characters and the humanity of  (nearly) each character. Definitely a must read if "Gone Girl" left you empty or pissed off.
Loved the entire story line. The characters were incredibly detailed and I felt them come to life. Not a bad thing to write. Loved it. Read it straight for 3 days.
This book kept me guessing until the very end.  The story was engaging and the writing style very appealing.  I would highly recommend this one to any mystery fan.
I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It kept me interested the moment I started reading it. The ending surprised me, but that's a good thing. Anyway, it's a good read.
Psychological thriller....a page turner.....good for fans of Gone Girl!!!!!<br/>Loved the narration....especially as it's a debut book for author!<br/>Top notch.
I liked this book and couldn't stop reading once I got to the middle.  I didn't know who did it until very near the end, but then there were not a lot of clues to lead to that person.  Good tangled mystery.  I did find it difficult to read at times.  All three women in the book narrate in different chapters.  The problem is that they do it during different time periods, before and after.  I had to keep going back to check the date of when the last chapter was told.  Rachel, our main character, is an alcoholic and her entries are sometimes hard to figure out.  But all in all, the book kept me interested and is one I would recommend.
This book was a great read. It kept me guessing up to the very end.  The characters all had their own dark sides and it made it a challenge to try and figure out.
I love the parallel stories of these two women, told while providing the past experience of the third.  A modern day Scarlett and Melanie.  The macabre version.😃
Very good phsychological thriller. For all those who loved "gone girl" this novel has the same structure with different characters telling their side of the story
The book has you at page one and never lets up. Just when you think you have the answers,well maybe not. I don't think anyone could read this passively. Loved it.
Great book. Suspenseful. Loved audible version. The three readers had lovely British accents. I couldn't stop listening and then was bummed when it was finished
This book left me frustrated with the main character because she seemed so unrealistic.  I kept reading and was pleasantly surprised at the twist in this story!
Enjoyed the way the chapters were organized.  The story came together nicely at the end.  Fun read, kept my attention until the end.  Characters well developed.
This is a story about three women whose lives are forever changed by one man...it's well-written, it's suspenseful, it's a must read; I could not put it down!!!
Great book- couldn't figure out who the killer was until it was revealed! Well written and very entertaining? Couldn't stop reading it and finished it in 2 days
This books starts out a little slow,  but quickly builds. Overall, a very good book. The plot twists and turns until the surprise ending. I recommend it highly.
I couldn't put the book down. Well written and very suspenseful. The author did a great job of weaving the story and characters together for a surprise ending.
5stars. Really holds your interest and great ending<br/><br/>Loved the characters and all / each one went through.  Brilliant! Will read more by this author.
Interesting read. I like how the book was laid out and told the story from multiple people's perspectives. It was a quick and easy read that was entertaining.
Upon many recommendations, I purchased this book.  I thought it was weird when it first started, but after it got going, I couldn't put it down.  Great read!!
Slowly building, the suspense makes the reader turn the pages as fast as possible.  The story itself is haunting and addictive.  A great book about people.
The book was very suspenseful & always kept me on the edge of my seat! I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a book to get lost in!
The Girl on the Train totally captivated my interest.  I didn't want to put it down because I couldn't wait to "see" what was going to happen next.
Somebody told me this was the new "gone girl" so I had great expectations. Sorry-- not so much. Still, an interesting yet sort of predictable read.
Did not finish book, as was informed novel ended.  I was under the assumption since I purchased the book, I could read it as slowly or quickly as I wanted!
Really enjoyed it not just for the plot but the clever way it was told. Can't believe this is a first time author. I thought it was better than Gone Girl.
I loved the way the story was told from three different perspectives.  It was hard to tell who to believe.  Recommended for readers who liked "Gone Girl."
Exciting mystery. Uniquely told. Riveting. I highly recommend this book. It will keep you entertained and take you away all the while you read it. Bravo.
It is difficult to stop reading. You want to know what is coming next and answers. Surprise ending.<br/>great description. You feel as if you are there.
It was steady reading.  How a person can percieve so much from watching people interact.<br/>She lets her imagination take over and it turns to reality.
This is an intriguing read - almost uncomfortable for readers at times with its flawed characters, it draws you in and delivers an original plot line.
Excellent book!  I couldn't put it down!  I read the first 200 pages straight through on a flight and didn't want to put it down to get off the plane!
This book starts out slowly and I wondered more than once why I was still reading it. But eventually I couldn't stop reading. The ending is ingenious.
loved the book.great character development. I was able to figure out the killer early on in the book. But I still found some strange twists and turns.
It's no wonder that this book is #1 on the NYTimes best seller list.  The characters are wonderfully done along with the twists and turns of the plot.
A great read, kept me guessing to the end.  Good character development.  Enjoyed this book very much, elicited lots of conversation at book/wine club.
I loved Gone Girl and when I saw the comparison I had to check it out for myself. I was not disappointed. I would like to see this as a movie someday.
I couldn't put it down. I read it all in one sitting.  I read a lot and this is one of the best and most original story line I've read in a long time.
This book had me on the edge of my seat from the first page to the last. There was never a dull moment and will highly recommend to fans of Gone Girl
I read this book in one day, which I rarely do these days. I didn't suspect who the culprit was until the author began to reveal the truth. Loved it.
The Girl on the Train is a wild, suspenseful ride. I was so caught up in the who's, what's, and how's that I finished the book in less that two days!
All the other reviews are bang-on.  I just want to say it's a perfect book to take on a get-away trip or to read when you need to get-away but can't!
Riveting, indeed. Each characters stories in short segments keep one reading .....I'll just reading a few more and then you've been reading for hours
Smart and suspenseful, keeps you guessing and hooked. Unreliable narrator with whom you cannot help but empathize and who draws you in at every turn.
This book is captivating! I enjoyed how the author wrote it by the characters' timelines. I highly recommend it for readers who like a mystery book.
A real page-turner.  Well-written gripping novel.  Characters' voices real.  I highly recommend it even to those who are not really who-dun it fans.
Could not put this "book" down!  Best suspense I've read in a very long time. Hope I can find another book that is as gripping to read at the beach.
Such a great plot twist!!! Excellently written and the strong characterizations made the story line much deeper. Emotional confusion the whole time.
The story line was hard to keep track of at first, but then at about 15% of the way I couldn't put it down!!! Loved it, hope they make a movie of it

It took to long to get to the meat of the story. The start of the story was boring and confusing  but midway got interesting then had a good ending
Loved it. The only thing I'd say I didn't like was the way the date jumped around.  I had difficulty remembering when the "event" happened.
I know that this book has been around for a while and greatly acclaimed. I am just now reading it and I can not put it down. So good. So darn good.
This is well constructed and a good thriller. Probably more adult suitable. The author managed to convey each character very well. Would recommend.
Quick read. Definitely the next Gone Girl. It would make  a great movie! I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good summer read!
Best book I have read in 2015. I purchased it in an airport for a cross country flight. It was so good that I read it cover to cover that same day.
I liked how the author alternated the chapter telling about the 3 main characters in the story. It was a thrilling story line and hard to put down.
Did not want this book to end..loved the ending..kinda reminded me of gone girl but it was better..will look for this author in the future..5 stars
Hated this book - being in the head of a drunk girl is just too childish and desperately seeking attention.  Not believable or likable or readable.
Amazing book! Read it in a few days. Once I started reading, I couldn't stop! I finished it in just a few short on the edge of my seat days! Enjoy!
Great read. Twisty and dark. Characters are simultaneously likable and ugly. Couldn't put it down. If you like Gillian Flynn, you'll like this too.
Very good thriller/mystery.  Couldn't put it down.  Lots of twists with each character.  Would certainly make a super movie.  Highly recommend it!!
The story started slow but I was soon arrested.  I could not put it down.  The characters are very believable.  Believable<br/> but never likable.
I thought this would be another "gone girl" I was very wrong. Each character is flawed in their own way which allows one to relate & to reevaluate!
Great read for a cold, winter afternoon.  I couldn't put The Girl<br/>On the Train down!!!!  Hawkins doesn't  disappoint in this fast paced story.
Excellent book, it absolutely had me hooked the entire way through. I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves a little suspense and mystery!
I've already recommended this book to fellow suspense lovers for its twisty plot and flawed,though realistic, characters.  Was totally engrossing!
Good read. Moves along quickly while peaking your interest. The big reveal/twist is pretty obvious, but not disappointing. Definitely recommended.
I'm not crazy about novels that jump around the time line of the story. I thought it was a strange novel because the main character was so screwy.
Ugh I spent good money on this! The premise was interesting, but it was just odd how tangled the relationships were and how whiney the women were.
Didn't like it.
Slow to develop
Loved the book!
Did not like it
Long and boring
Page turner.  Characters become real.  Alcoholism well defined, along with enablers.  The horrors of a blackout - where memories are not made.
Real page turner, couldn't put it down.<br/>Well,written. I can see this as a huge movie success.<br/>I for one would love to see this movie
Fantastic suspense thriller! What a great read! A heart pounding thrill from start to finish. Hard to put down and you probably won't want to.
Took a while to get into but once started I was hooked.  I was surprised by the ending but after thinking about, I should have seen it coming.
This book was so exciting and had so many twists and turns! The characters were really well developed too! I read this in one day. I loved it!
Riveting from beginning to end.  Curiosity, addiction, isolation, and twisted perceptions woven into a murder mystery. All linked by a train.
This book hooked me and had me riveted from start to finish. What an intricate, finely crafted, surprising railway journey! It's a must-read.
This book was awesome. So many twists and turns! The only part I didn't like was the first 1-4 or so, kind of dragged on but it was worth it!
The complex characters gave depth to a tightly woven plot. I was kept guessing and genuinely surprised by the outcome of this dark storyline.
Fairly well-written but so depressing. No relief at all. Even The Goldfinch had some light in its conclusion. Unreliable narrator was clever.
Suspenseful and well written until the near end when it gets silly and unreal. Last few chapters seem like they were written by someone else.
I couldn't put the book down the entire time!  I have always enjoyed mystery and suspense novels and I can add this one to my favorites list.
I kept reading reviews in different magazines about it and then the price went down on it on amazon. I read it in one night. Really liked it.
I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Kept me guessing until the end. Well written. Pay attention to the chapter titles so you know who is talking
It was hard getting into at first but it is well worth the read! It was very good I didn't want to put it down after the first few chapters.
Fabulous book!  Constant intensity.  I loved how we got to know things from the point of view of each of the three women.  A fantastic read.
Good book. It kept me locked in and interested. I bought because I heard it was similar to gone girl and it was in a sense. Glad I bought it
I couldn't relate to the people in the story or care what happened to them. I finished the book but didn't find it particularly interesting.
Author uses the unreliable narrator to such lengths that you feel cheated when everything is revealed. Entertaining read, but hollow finish.
I highly recommend this book. Rich characters developed in an unexpected manner. I couldn't put it down. Thriller on the order of Gone Girl.
A little bit of a slow read but definitely interesting!  Suspense was definitely there.  Great description.  I'd read another by this author
Loved how there story was told from the different characters points of view. I always appreciate when the story twists and turns at the rnd.
I looked forward to reading this and enjoyed every page. Well-written and thoughtful. I recommend it and hope the author has written others.
Truly enjoyed this, well written and brilliant suspense. Believable characters...same tension as in Gone Girl, Sharp Objects and Dark Places
Great book! Finding a good book these days is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Very glad I saw this recommend on another website.
The Girl on the Train was a page turner; however, the characters were not developed enough and their lives had little substance. Two stars.
This was just ok.  Only so many times can you hear a reference to being drunk and forgetting and imagining things. It got old after a while
Good but not as compelling as Gone Girl. Enjoyed the characters but I figured out early on what was happening. Good read but not excellent.
5 star read. Hooked from page one, never saw it coming, couldn't put the book down...mere words can't explain how much I enjoyed this book.
I wasn't able to put the book down. Never fully loving any of the characters because they are all wonderfully flawed makes this book great.
Interesting characters and intertwined story lines.<br/>Well worth the energy to keep the story straight<br/>I highly recommend this book
Complex characters, good flow, mystery. Great book to read - quick bursts, nothing lags or gets boring. You'll rip through it; suspenseful.
I could not stop reading and needed to know how it would end. I did not see that coming. If you enjoy a face paced story this is for you!!!
Excellent contemporary, multilayered superb mystery. Compelling. Genuine characters who are deeply flawed and real. I read it far too fast.
Wow such a great book!!! I could not put this down. There are so many twists and turns. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time!
Starting out, I thought it a good example of chick lit, but became more engrossed after a few chapters. I would recommend for all genders.
Great flawed heroine.  I loved reading this book - it was gripping from the very first page.  I wish we could buy canned G&T;'s in the U.S.
A little slow in the beginning but then it gets good. At first you don't know who Rachel should trust but then everything falls into place
I was unable to stop reading it!  It kept you guessing almost all the way to the end. The ending didn't let you down. Highly entertaining.
I couldn't put it down. A mystery that I never figured out until it was revealed. A must read for anyone who loves a good  suspense novel.
I'm not a big mystery reader but loved this book.  Who hasn't looked out the window and created whole story of others lives.  Great read!!
Told from the perspective of 3 women whose lives intertwine in surprising ways. Rachel's story, in particular, is heartbreaking. Loved it.
complete waste of time and money . the beginning holds promise but then it drones punishingly onand on. wooden and idiotically repetitive.
This book keeps you guessing and on your toes, impossible to put down. Perfect book to enjoy on a weekend copied up with a hot cup of tea.
Enjoyed this book. It was difficult to put down. It captured my imagination and curiosity. A great read. If you enjoy mystery and intrigue
Excellent read couldn't stop I finished it in two days every page was full of suspense that you can't stop reading!!! Totally recommended.
Kept me guessing until 81% (Kindle). Very engaging and well-paced - really held my interest even after I figured out "whodunnit."
Ok,  Enjoyed the story told thru different characters "voices". Still a page turner despite not having that "wow" factor.
The author so authentically captures the world of an alcoholic. A well paced novel with wonderful twists and turns. Could not put it down
Great story. Characters are well formed. Love the writing style. Couldn't stop reading, spent a few late nights reading. Very fast paced.
Great character development.<br/>Twists and turns. A page turner<br/>you just don't want to end.<br/>Great book group discussion read.
Suspenseful! Couldn't put it down! It's been awhile since I read a book that I could not wait until I had time to get back to reading it!
Great characters. Page turner. If you like Gone Girl you will like this one! Not as suspenseful or as intricate but still, really good!!
Could not put it down !!!!  Great murder mystery !!!  Excellent writing and I always enjoy a novel being told by alternating characters.
Great read. Reminds me of the husbands secret. In a good way. Not a repeat. Just similar storytelling style. Couldn't wait to finish it.
Fantastic and suspenseful.  This novel is tightly written and hard to put down.  The synopsis does not do the book justice. A must read.
Amazingly addictive, kept craving for more. An incredible  story told by 3 different point of views that in the end collided  together.
I found this book to be very confusing.  Could not keep up with the characters.  Did not find it suspenful - but rather hard to follow.
This is a really good mystery.  Written well with many twists.  Great care was made in developing each character. Enjoyed it very much.
this book dwelled too much on the characters alcohol problems and seemed to drag. just did not like the plot nor any of the characters.
Great, suspenseful read. Perfect for beach reading or a long plane trip. Similar. To Gone Girl, but with a much more satisfying ending.
it started out with a good twist and then spiraled downward. For being #1 on the New York Times best seller list, I expected much more.
Filled with unlikable characters and predictable plot twists.  Not on the caliber of "Gone, Girl." Almost a Hitchcock wanna-be.
Exciting, suspenseful read. Well written, one of those books that is hard to put down! Hard to believe it is this author's first novel!
Gripping from beginning to end with so many twists and turns. I'm going to have to read it again to make sure I caught all the details!
Not a very believable story. I thought author was bouncing all over the place, from one character to another.,one timeline to another.
Well written! Great characters. Takes you down a long twisted road. A very good read. Excellent- excellent! Would certainly recommend!
Excellent read! I didn't put it down and finished it in one day! I definitely recommend this for those that like mystery and thrillers
Great book, grabs you from the start.  Good mystery, quick read, would definitely recommend this book.  You won't want to put it down.
The characters were very unlikable people, but the story was interesting and suspenseful. I would recommend this book to mystery fans.
Great light reading. Surprising and well written.  Makes you think about male and female stereotypes. Nice development of plot. Enjoy.
I typically read nonfiction but thought try this novel for a change of pace.  Loved every bit of it.  Love the different perspectives.
Good book, well-written and mostly suspenseful....but it's easy to figure out the ending. Nonetheless, it was still enjoyable to read.
Great book.  A little confusing at first with the back and forth on characters.  Would highly recommend.  Can't wait to see the movie!
Best read yet! I am ready for another Paula Hawkins novel! I highly recommend this book to those that seek mystery and great suspense!
Horrible story
If you pick the book up after 7:00PM don't plan on doing much the next day.  You're not going to get much sleep.  Yes it's that good.
The story was fascinating and held my interest to the end. Started to realise who the murderer was towards the end but not too soon..
Couldn't stop reading this one. Very intriguing and I couldn't put it down. Now that I'm done hopefully just can catch up on my sleep
I didn't see the end coming til I got to the end....really an easy, very enjoyable read. Recommend it to all who love a good mystery.
I don't think foul language is artistic or necessary in writing s good novel.  It makes me think the author has a limited vocabulary.
A good book to start when you have plenty of time as you won't be able to put it down.  Very entertaining with good twists and turns.
I liked the premise of this book and how it progressed at the beginning, but then it just became too unbelievable for me.  It was OK.
Loves this book, couldn't stop reading it. Great character development and the mystery keeps you wanting more. Very impressed with it
Couldn't put it down. Great writing, fast paced with an ending you don't see coming.  I've been recommending this to everyone I know.
Fun reading.  A great who dun it.<br/>Interesting characterization, one minute to the next not sure if this one did it or the other.
Couldn't put this book down. Great read. Never a dull moment.  Characters were well constructed. Kept me on my toes the entire time.
Great writing! Even when you think you have it all figured out, there's more. Read this if you like "Gone Girl" type books for sure.
Great mystery- flew through it. Starts out a bit slow but I flew thru the second half in one evening. A great beach or vacation read
Great read!!!! Kept me guessing until almost the end of the book.  In the genre of "Gone Girl".  Will make a great movie!!!!
The characters are very intermingled and telling their stories.its great to hear their side of the day and time and where they were.
Highly recommend this book.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters.  The twists and turns made it difficult to put the book down.
The twists and turns in this book were amazing. I read it in two days, although to be fair we were on vacation. Much like Gone Girl.
Awesome book, page turner stay with it, I wasn't excited at first but oh boy, it was great on my Kindle passing time at the airport.
I almost put this book down because the build up was just exhausting but once it gets going it doesn't stop. A very satisfying read.
I enjoyed the book even when it was a little slow in places.  I was totally shocked at the ending....I just knew it was the husband.
Over rated, disliked the hopping around between characters. Definitely was not a page turner and I would not recommend it to anyone.
Very good suspense novel about twists and turns of infidelity and life.  You never know one's experience until you are reading it...
It was a bit confusing yo begin with while trying to learn the characters, but once I did it was enthralling. An awesome experience.
Loved this book, kept me guessing right to the end.  Interesting characters that are both unlikeable and endearing at the same time.
This story grips you from the start. Full of suspense .... The author uses great style with alternating narrators telling the story.
So many twists and turns!  You think you have it figured out and then BAM!  Another twist!  Well done Ms. Hawkins, well done indeed!
This book was extremely exciting to read, I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a book with thrill.
Read this book in my book club. We all loved it. It really generated some great discussion. Overall, this was a real page turner!!!
Recieved the sample copy first and of course got hooked and had to purchase. Took me two days to read the story. Could'nt put down.
Great book with many twists, turns and surprises! If you enjoy a good mystery/crime novel you will find this book hard to put down!
It was an effort to read...to understand the relationships and timeline, but well worth it.  Really well written.  An intense read!
Couldn't put it down, a real page turner. Will def. recommend it to my friends. Very clever and will be looking out for the author.
This book kept me interested from start to finish.  The characters were very well written and fleshed out.  Would highly recommend.
Very well written, good amount of detail and the story took off so I was a captive audience immediately - my favorite way to read!
It was an ok read. I like the lead character. But the story became predictable, so I just finished it to see how it would play out
If you enjoyed Gone Girl, you will love Girl on the Train. It's suspenseful, mysterious, and intriguing.  It's a great quick read.
The suspense was great.  The ending wa a surprise but looking back, it wa the right one..  Looking forward to more by this author.
Very disappointed.  It was sooooo slow moving.  It was a real struggle to get through, depressing.  Could not recommend this book.
A captivating, clever story. If you like Gone Girl then this will be right up your alley!  It was impossible to put the book down.
It was a true thriller. Loved the writing and have already recommended this book to two other people. Read it with the lights on!
GREAT book! Just when I thought I had it all figured out, the story would take another sharp turn! I just had to keep on reading!
Intrigue that held me spellbound until I turned that last page What a story teller! I'm already Looking for novels by this author
Very gripping, easy to read but not trite, didn't want to put it down.  Fantastic author, will look forward to more of her books!
It was a totally boring read, impossible to follow and filled with fake soap opera moments. My advice is to read something else.
Well crafted. Good character development. Enjoyable. Not a fan of the ending though. I had hoped it would have been less rushed.
I really enjoyed this book. Kind of predictable towards the end, but I enjoyed it. Easy read. Ideal for travel and at the beach.
Fast reading, great story, some good twists and turns. Ending not what I expected.<br/>Would recommend for good summer reading.
Did not like this book. I wish I would have known they used the "f" word. I try to avoid books that use offensive words.
Dumb book.  I didn't finish it.  Don't know why most people read it. There are so many great novels to read - why this one!  Kay
This is hands down an absolute page turner . Fast paced and perfectly twisted . It makes gone girl look like a children's book
Good build up.  Lots of questions that I wanted answers to. Kept me turning the pages. Satisfying conclusions to all queries.
I loved this book! I also enjoy a book that makes me try to figure out who the "bad" guy is. This did not disappoint.
Absolutely loved this book. Read it in one sitting on a long car trip and time flew by. So well crafted and cleverly written.
This was a good thriller that kept you guessing. Characters were interesting and made for a fast read. Good vacation reading!
Well written. Quite easy to follow. I think it was little more predictable than was needed but non the less an enjoyable read
A little slow, jumps from character to character on first person accounts. Prolly will not buy another book from this author.
A bit similar to the twists of Gone Girl.  It's those twists that keep you reading...driven to find out what really happened.
Suspenseful and well written. Plot was good and kept me coming back quickly. Would definitely like to read this author again.
Well done mystery and great writing. I was excited to zee what would happen next. Page turner with well developed characters.
This is a thriller that had me hooked from the first chapter.  The writer did a wonderful job.  I highly recommend this book.
I have not so thoroughly enjoyed a book so delightfully in quite some time! Certainly a page turner and not easy to put down.
This book was hard to get into to be very honest the first few chapters but once the plot starts, you cannot put it down!!!!
This page turner will leave you unable to put it down!  Creepy, haunting, emotional, sad and a well told story.  I loved it!
This was a great read and just when you think you have it figured out bam something else happens and keeps you wanting more!
I could not put this book down!I highly recommend it to those who love a mystery. Look forward to reading more of her books.
This was a phenomenal read, couldn't put it down! This was definitely worth reading, highly recommend this book to everyone!
This book is spell-binding ---- characterization is superb and just when you think you've figured things out, you haven't!!?
This was an awesome book. The story unfolded beautifully. It was such a quick read, I finished the book in less than 2 days.
Couldn't put this book down!  Very similar to Gone Girl. Apparently, this is the author's first book. Fantastic! Quick read!
I love to read horror but this book kept me reading all the way through.  It's sort of suspense/drama.  Well worth the read
It took a few chapters to get into this book but it really holds your attention after that.  Fun read and hard to put down.
Astonishingly good. A different kind of narrative and a killer plot (pun intended). Don't know why Amazon wants more words
Amazing book! Not long but very gripping and a real page turner!! Great job of fiction!! Unique thriller. Simply narrated.
This was an amazing book! I couldn't put it down! I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a new mystery novel.
I just received my Kindle Paperwhite as a gift and this was the first book I downloaded and read.  Exciting on our fronts!
Great read with lots of twists and turns, very surprising ending. I would highly recommend this book. Five stars for sure.
So many mixed up young people. All unhappy, no self esteem. Sex and wine, or gin, wash it away find happiness in a bottle.
This is a fantastic read.  The author is a great story teller, and this story is a real thriller.  I enjoyed every moment.
So you can't stop reading thrilling but surprising till the end<br/><br/>Could not put it down great read you will enjoy
I enjoyed the suspense of having several possible suspects, along with having a flawed heroine that comes to the rescue:)
What a great  book. Suspension at it's finest. Very quick read,couldn't put it down. Glad I read this one,perfect. Great.
Absolutely one of the best books I have read in awhile!  Such great twist and turns!  Kudos to Paula Hawkins!  Well done.
Couldn't put it down. I haven't read a book in one day in years until this one. Great read if you like murder mysteries.
A suspenseful story paints a beautiful picture of human tragedy and how our stories are often intertwined. A Great read!
Couldn't stop once I started! Definitely worth picking up one rainy day and you won't want to put it down until the end.
Great reading could not put it down. Highly recommend<br/>Looking forward to reading her next book a very clever writer
Seemed to drag on forever going nowhere.  Disappointing ending, didn't have many twists and turns, a bit hard to follow.
I know nothing about this book, as I bought it for my wife.  She said it was OK, but anywhere near as good as Gone Girl.
I absolutely loved this book.  I usually can figure out who did it, but this time I never dreamed Tom did it.  Loved it.
A great story that you can't ever get ahead of.  Just when you've got it figured out, another bomb drops.  Awesome book.
Pretty good read. Suspenseful. Starts to get a little predictable towards the end, but still a good book. I'd recommend.
Interesting story with so many twists and turns. I thought I had it figured out a time or two. Very clever, I recommend!
Really enjoyed this book ,great story line , beginning a bit slow ,but then you can't put it down. Loved the characters,
Nice  written story. Easy reading. Straight to the point. Interesting and fun. Will recommend it. Read it in three days.
Very similar to Gone Girl in some ways, a story of affairs, pregnancy, a disappearing woman, and murder.  Very addicting
A fun read. A good mystery. The pages will fly by too quickly. Most interesting point of view in ages. Highly recommend.
Plot is a little fad-fetched, but the book is a page turner and with hints and cliff-hangers at the end of each chapter.
Once I started this book I could not put it down till the end! I read a lot of thrillers and this is one of the best!!!
Just do it guys. Written by and for women. But it resonates for men with imagination, drilling into your consciousness.
This book had me hooked immediately!! Such an easy quick read.  Great read with plenty of twists.  I highly recommend.
Enjoyable and interesting. A bit dark but overall enjoyable.  Best read over the course of a rainy or snowy afternoon.
Couldn't put it down.  Such a well-told story.  Felt like I was right there with her in the moment until the very end.
It was hard to put the book down. All the characters were well written. Suspenseful story. Keeps the reader  guessing.
I only have one word for this book.  WOW!!!!  I loved it and couldn't put it down.  I recommend this book to everyone.
Ok, I think I was just really annoyed with Rachel's drinking.  The story was decent and reminded me of Gillian Flynn.
Keeps you reading and guessing. One of the best I've read lately.  Not too schmoozy or far fetched and very readable.
It just kind of dragged on and on. Kept waiting for the pace to pick up, which it did in the last couple of chapters.
I finished it in two days, couldn't put it down! Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an easy summer read.
Completely pulls you in, so many shocking twists and turns. Just when you think you have it figured out, not exactly.
A great read- interesting characters that undergo 360 degree changes as you learn more about them. Very well-written!
This story had me hooked from the very beginning. Couldn't put it down and I can't wait till the author's next book!!
I did enjoy the book and the unique writing style.  The only disappointing g thing was the storyline was predictable.
I found this book to be another example of substantial hype and little substance. Perhaps it would have been best for alcoholic  Rachel to have stayed on the train.<br/>I was able to "finish" this book in just north of one and one-half hours. How? Put it down after reading some 80 pages or so. So this fails as an in-depth review but I hope it cautions potential readers to look beyond the hype before they make a purchasing decision.
I agree with all the negative reviews. Such a poorly written and sooooo depressing book! I started to skim early on l..... Then when a wave of depression from reading of such stupid people from inside their sad loser heads washed over me I thankfully stopped reading it.  My surprise is the number of people who hated the book but read it anyway. Why put that negative crap in your head?<br/>Some reviews fun and funny to read so there's that....
I could not put this book down & read it in one day.  I Can't wait to see Emily Blunt play a lead role in the Movie!
Loved this book, kept you guessing throughout, right up to the end! This is a must-read if you like a good suspense.
A little predictable. Fast and easy reading. Doesn't keep you on the edge of your seat or keep you up late at night.
Kept me interested from start to finish! Good story telling. Reminded me of Gone Girl but I think I liked this more!
An entertaining and quick read. I enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends. I was surprised by the ending.
I read this book in two days, I could not put it down. If you like a good murder mystery then this book is for you.
Didn't want the book to end! Really great from the first page to the last. Unbelievable that this is a debut novel.
It is a long time since I started reading a book that held my interest so much that I couldn't stop until the end.
Beautifully written, well drawn characters kept me guessing until the end. I felt I knew Rachel and felt her pain.
This book kept me guessing the whole way through.  Quirky characters and interesting sequencing of the story line.
This book kept you in suspense until the end.  It was a little confusing to start but then I couldn't put it down.
Really good book, I couldn't put it down. The characters make you want to know more. Suspenseful and drama filled.
Don't pick it up if you have something else to do...I thought this was great, especially if you liked "gone girl."
Lots of excitement, never knowing what would happen next, great book. A Very Fast read. I loved reading this book.
Best psychological thriller I've read in years. Better than Gone Girl and better than girl with the dragon tattoo.
Interesting story line that kept my attention. Would definitely read another by this author if and when available.
Kept me involved all through the book. A real who dunnit. Glad I took the recommendation. I highly recommend this.
The book held my attention..Very well executed! I would read more from this author.  I want to meet Rachel Watson.
This book kept my interest, but I felt it was too long, and tired of Rachel 's whining. The author is very gifted.
Could not put it down! Hard to follow  at times with flashbacks but worth it...best book I've read since Gone Girl
Awesome book! Didn't want to put it down. Don't compare it to 'Gone Girl' as other are as it is soooo much better!
A gripping story well told. The compelling narration pulls the reader in making it difficult to put down the book.
Loved it!  I can see why The Girl on the Train would be compared with Gone Girl but while there are a few similarities, there are plenty of differences.  I loved Gone Girl and everything written by Gillian Flynn but I think The Girl on the Train is better!  If you want a happy sunshine story with happy sunshine characters, this is not the book for you.  Delightfully dark with realistic characters!  I hated for this book to end!
The story is so good that I would like to see it made into a movie! Surprises throughout the book. Enjoyable read
I'm not usually interested in mysteries, this was compelling to read.  I could not even imagine how it would end.
The best I've read in a long time.  Such a page turner....I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Great read!
One of the best novels I have read in a long time. I like the switching characters. The novel kept me on my toes.
Very dark in the end, but I couldn't put the book down. Not too many like that! Congratulations to Paula Hawkins!
Loved this book from the first chapter. The interweaving of lives and stories is superb. I could not put it down.
Well written, I just didn't<br/>Ike the story line.  None of the characters felt particularly real or relatable.
This is a very well written story.  People compare it to "Gone Girl", but I don't think that is the case.
This is not a wonderful book. It is slow and the story is not interesting at all. I was surprised that it is #1 .
A real page turner. Keeps you guessing all the way to the end. If you liked Gone Girl, you will want to read this
Loved the read. Keep my in suspense and a page turner... I'm not a big reader but I couldn't put this book down..
A fantastic book that keeps the reader guessing to the very end. This would be a great movie. Highly recommended.
Best book I have read in a long time. You can't put it down and you don't want to. Everyone will enjoy this read.
Loved this book.  I could not put it down.  So many plot twists.  Loved it!!!!  Would highly recommend this book.
I really liked this story.  Very believable and had me on the edge of my seat.  I couldn't wait to finish reading
Could not put this book down! Enjoyed it very much. The characters came to life from the onset. Sorry it's over.
Great story told in many different points of view.  Kept me guessing all the way through.  Couldn't put it down.
A crafty story spun in a way that catches you unawares at first - I couldn't read fast enough to get to the end.
Really enjoyed!  Well worth the read. I would look for other novels by this author. Exciting and a real thriller
I think this one was much better than Gone Girl.  I would want to see this movie.  I couldn't put the book down.
Story stayed with me.  Although the dates and voices differ, I was able to keep the straight line.  A good read!
Really enjoyed this book. Found it to be quite entertaining and kept me wondering what was going to happen next.
This book kept my attention to the end. Each character was so descriptive they jumped off the page.  A must read
I loved this book!  The characters were very interesting.  This was a real page turner!  I couldn't put it down!
Really felt a connection with the main character . She was very troubled but I wanted her to find a way to heal.
The book had me second guessing myself at each new chapter. Terrific fast read and I highly recommend this book.
Grips from the first chapter and doesn't let go!!!! I could not put this book this book down. I highly recommend
Wow I read this book in one day.  Good old fashioned story telling at its best!  Kept me on the edge of my seat!
Couldn't put it down. I needed a good book and wasn't disappointed. I felt I was there. The writing was awesome.
Gripping tale. Makes you feel like you are in the middle of a nightmare and can't wait to get to the end of it.
This is a great story and captivated me the entire way. I could see this as a movie with great actors in roles.
If you liked Gone Girl you will like this.  Faster paced with more twists.  You won't want<br/>To put it down.
Very intriguing end, though I got a bit bored in the middle. Overall great read with surprise twist at the end
An amazing read, loaded with wonderful imagery coupled with phenomenal character strengths and idiosynchasies!
Could not put this book down! Just when I thought I knew who did it there would be a twist, such a good book!!
It was a great read. I would have liked to have seen more closure for Anna and Rachel but otherwise wonderful!
This was my first audiobook.  I highly recommend it.  It kept my attention and kept me guessing until the end.
Started off a little slow, then I couldn't put it down! Great thriller with lots of twists, and tons of turns!
I loved this book and will recommend this author to friends. It was quite a thriller with twists at every turn
The first part was a little slow but I sped thru the second part ( I couldn't put it down!). Lots of suspense.
Trying to copy a Gone Girl mystery...hmmm not sure!  It was ok not great! I was happy to just finish the book.
Extremely entertaining and grabbing.  Good plot development, incredibly entertaining and readable.  Recommend!
OK.
It was interesting, not something I would have picked out to read. It was a suggestion from a friend. Basic emotions, but just enough of a plot that kept you going one chapter after another.
Meh
Neh
:-)
Eh!
Eh!
Starts out slow, encircles you in and leads you into not being to put down the last 50 pages. I give it an 8.
Such a great read. Recommend to anyone! Very suspenseful and keeps you on edge! You can't put this book down!
Amazing!!!! One of the best books I have read in a long time! The book keeps you guessing until the very end.
It wasn't the best book I've read lately, but, I enjoyed it.<br/>I would recommend you read it. Good mystery
This book was dark and depressing, no happy characters here! That being said, I could not put this book down!
A different murder mystery with a very atypical heroine/alcaholic. Interesting and believable on some levels.
There is very good reason WHY this book has been on the best seller list for two years!!  It is fascinating!!
BRILLIANT! When will the movie be out? This debut is so well crafted- hope this writer has more in the works.
I liked the twists and turns. I especially like the ending, it seemed like the right way to finish the story.
I think I will like it.  The main character is 'messed up' I her head which makes it somewhat hard to follow.
I found the book very interesting. I didn't expect the ending and that is good.  Good start for a new writer.
Very unexpected ending! Couldn't put the book down. Took two days to read. Hope you enjoy it as much a I did.
It was a great read...right up there with Gone Girl. I never guessed the true villain. I highly recommend it!
It's been a while since I've devoured a book. I literally could not put it down and read until I was through!
Great book! Very hard to anticipate the ending. The author really takes us into the minds of the characters.
This is a well-written novel, twisty, atmospheric of commuter London. All-in-all, a highly recommended read.
I expected a lot more from this book considering the hype but it is a quick summer read. I do not recommend.
Eh😑not much to be said. It is not a bad book, and not great either.... I would recommend it, half heartedly
This book was amazing. It kept me flipping page after page, if you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book.
Loved this book, quite suspenseful and had me fooled a few times.  So glad the main character found her way.
Didn't like anything about the book. Would not recommend it & I would tell people NOT to read it.dumb. Dumb.
A little hard to follow at first, and I figured ot the protaganist about half way through.  But a good read,
It took me awhile to get into the book, but after that it was hard to put down. I almost hated to finish it.
This book is layers of mystery and intrigue!  Make sure you have time to read the whole book in one sitting.
Lots of twists and turns! Keeps you reading in a way that you can't put it down. Very familiar to Gone Girl!
Prepare to finish in 1 sitting!  You won't be able to put down!<br/>A real page turner. A truly great read.
I got so sucked I to this story....all its twists and turns.  It will keep you guessing until the very end!
I like books like this. Good for a rainy day. I am beginning to enjoy English literature more all the time.
It wasn't a book that I had trouble putting down, but it kept my interest. I finished it within a few days.
Good book. The way the book is written seems too much like "Gone Girl". Overall it was a good read.
A good mystery and the narrative point of view writing style was a very interesting and effective approach.
Not sure why this is such a popular book.  I found it a little tedious and the main character unbelievable.
Woo hoo!  Kept me guessing!  Loved it - couldn't stop reading the second half. Can't wait for the next one.
You just never know what anyone is capable of. Compelling and one of those books you Don't want to put down
Once I started reading this book I was unable to put it down. One of the best books I have read in a while.
In the same style as Gone Girl a very edgy thriller with a lot of psychological twists. Well worth reading.
Great book.
seems good.
A page turner from the start and until the end...plan a day of nothing when you take this up..well spent:)
I have never read this author before and it was slow going at first but then I couldn't put the book down.
Ruth Rendell light.  It's OK, but Rendell's characters have a lot more depth and are far more interesting.
Could not put this book down.  I'd figured out the plot 3/4 in.  Didn't stop me from devouring every page.
just did not like the way it kept jumping back and forth.  Never finished the book.  So lost all interest.
Started a little slow but once I got to the middle I couldn't put it down.Kept you guessing on who did it.
I could not put this down.  Kept you  guessing until the very last page.  Kept you guessing.  A must read.
This novel will force you to keep reading-you'll want to hurry up and finish it because of how good it is.
I could not put this book down.  it fooled me every other chapter.  What a mind bender.  You will love it.
Painful to read.<br/>Not sure what all the hype was about. Very hard to get through. Waste of time. Boo.
The suspense was great, I never saw it coming. I like how it was told from all the females point of view.
If you like a good suspense , this is the book! This book really delivered that thinking of who did it...
Read this if you loved Gone Girl. It had me guessing until the end. I hope to read more from this author.
Started slow... but glad I persisted!!  Pulled me in quietly and then, had a hard time putting it down!!
Had a little trouble keeping the characters straight. After I got into it slotted more I figured it out.
Great read! I couldn't put it down. Such a good story with a great ending. I Highly recommend this book.
This book was a terrible read to me. It was very boring and hard to get into. I did not finish the book.
I enjoyed this I've. Easy read.  Blau blog. Mobbing JG's Hugh Uggg huff light high klhg Uggg ugh JG. Ugh
Great writing and easy to digest.  Takes a lot of twisty turns all the way to the very end.  Quick read.
Brilliant book that you won't be able to put down until the end. Twists and turns you could not predict.
Couldn't lay it down  kept me intrigued and thinking about it even when I took a break  Thanks. Marine k
So many twists and turns. Starts off pretty confusing but when it picks up, you can't put the book down.
This book is an amazing read! I read the whole thing in just two days because I could not put it down!!!
Well done. I highly recommend this book. I could hardly wait for the truth to be told.<br/>A must read.
I found the book to be captivating and enjoyed getting into the mind of the main character. Quick read.
I found the book didn't get good until the end. I didn't like the main character so it was frustrating.
Started out slow, complex and as I was intrigued continued reading and the plot gets betters, good read
I literally had to stay in one night while on vacation to finish this book - I couldn't put it down!!!!
This was a great read. Very suspenseful and hard to put down. I highly recommend this book. I loved it.
I could not put it down.  So many twists and turns, it will leave your head spinning.  Loved this book.
I couldn't put this book down, but I wanted to shake Rachel for her bad choices! Satisfying in the end.
Amazing story!  Could not put down.  If you liked Gone Girl, this is the book for you!!!  Loved it!! 😂
It kept me hooked from beginning to end. I bought the book as gifts for all of the readers on my list.
A+++++++++ book!!! I will read it again and again. Such an amazing thriller mystery book. Must read!!!
Great read, very enjoyable. Good twist at the end though caught it a little before I would have liked.
I read this book in a day, unable to put it down. It kept me interested from the beginning to the end.
This was a twisty, "turny", tale I read in one day!  Good story & kept guessing until the end!
I was desperate for a good book and found it in The Girl on the Train. Easy read, finished in one day.
Excellent to the end and, although toward the end we knew that Tom did it, we didn't known how he died
The first three fourths of this book is drawn out and close to boring.  The  last fourth is good..  ll
I loved it. Well written mystery that keeps you guessing. I could not put it down - read it in 2 days!
Loved it! Could hardly put it down - haven't read something that I couldn't put down for a LONG time.
This novel is a little different than my normal read, but once I started I didn't ant to put it down!
AMAZING book! Kept me wanting more and unable to put it down. If you liked Gone Girl you'd like this.
I thought this book was amazing!  Couldn't wait to read it each day......never wanted to put it down.
Too much talk about being an alcoholic (and how she knew it was ruining her life) without redemption.
Great read, filled with suspense, could not put it down. Kept me on the edge of my seat till the end.
A fast read.  Beginning a little  slow but after a while it got my interest and Couldn't put it down.
Very disappointing!  Should never be compared to 'Gone Girl' Too much analysis and not enough action.
Too much non-sensical dialogue and not enough action.  Did not finish book as I found it very boring.
An "on the edge of your seat" thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end! A must read...
The Rear Window analogy used in other reviews is on point. This is a cross between Gone Girl and Rear Window. Sure, there will be a movie, but I had the same feeling while reading The DaVinci Code. I had a great time reading this book, and was riveted right through, and I say this in all seriousness, the last paragraph! It's a roller coaster ride of the best whodunnit kind!
This book was great. Did not expect the ending at all! Can't wait to read more Paula Hawkins novels.
This book was hard to put down.  It is also true that it was as riveting as Gone Girl.  A good read.
While the story was intriguing, I found that I did not like any of the characters or their behavior.
I did not like this book.  My daughter and her friends loved it.  I found it not to my expectations.
Terrible book.  Difficult to keep track of the characters, too muich sex, drug use, alcohol use, etc
I enjoyed the first part of the book  . However, it became more and more unrealistic and ridiculous.
It was a great read. Slow to getting into but then I couldn't put it down . The movie will be great.
Will keep you on the edge of your seat until you discover who the story is really about, a surprise.
Very gripping story. It is  One of those books you cannot put down. Would love to see it as a movie.
Really enjoyed this book - hard to put down.  If you liked Gone Girl you will enjoy this one.  Enjoy
What a wonderfully tortuous mess.  Really screwed up characters doing improvident things leading the reader to say, “Oh, this is not going to be good.”  It is told in first person by three flawed individuals, both living and dead, along with some interesting writing techniques and a heart stopping ending.  Can’t wait for the movie (if there is one) and Hawkin’s next book.
I loved this book!  First time in a long time I've read a book in 48 hours.  Could not put it down.
I really loved this book. It gripped me and confused me and made me wonder up until nearly the end.
If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
Couldn't put this one down. But, the final character development of Tom felt somewhat unbelievable.
It was slow in the beginning but the plot picked up and kept on going.  I was pleasantly surprised.
I read this book in 3 days on vacation. If you like suspense an intrigue then this book is for you.
A good read written by Hawkins. I've not read many of her books prior to  this, but, intend to now.
It was good. Not worth what I paid for it. I've read better free books. I'll read it again someday.
I'd bought this book again if I hadn't have it. I have been reading it at the first morning  coffee
I loved this book and have told many friends. Well written. Could not put it down. A must read! End
I liked the pace and the way the reader is never really sure of the direction the story will turn.
Very compelling story. It sucks you into it right away. I thought the narration was very good too.
I was looking for a good summer read and found it in The Girl on the Train!! Couldn't put it down!
Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It left u guessing as it unfolded- more than just a murder mystery.
I really was on the edge of my seat the entire book until I figured it out. Good and suspenseful !
This book had me from start to end . Not the ending I was expecting at all !!!!! Highly recommend
found the beginning of the book quite boring, at least up to about 15%, which is as far as I got.
I am giving this book a star (instead of none) simply because it had a beginning, middle and end.
What great book! It totally kept me turning those pages as fast as I could! A must read for sure.
A wild ride through emotions, fantasy & horror , with a story woven like a tapestry...well done.
Suspenseful.  Well-written.  A real "page turner" except I listened to audiobook in car.
THIS NOVEL FELT LIKE A REALLY GOOD HITCHCOCK STORY, I REALLY ENJOYED THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER
It is not a bad book, but very depressing.  I don't remember any character having a good moment.
A good read! If you liked Gone Girl you will love this book! You will not see the ending coming!
Starts out very slow and very depressing.<br/>I almost gave up on it. Picks up and gets better.
Fast paced and thrilling. Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Can't wait for Paula Hawkins next book.
I haven't read such a page-turner in a long time. A book that had me staying up past my bedtime.
Loved the novel and could not stop<br/>Reading till I finished to see what was happening next!!
Takes a while to get into...but definitely worth the read.  Keep at it; would make a great movie
Kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I loved trying to figure it out as I was reading.
Fast moving. Just like a train. Or a train wreck. Didn't want it to end. It was over too quick.
A good read . . . sometimes difficult to sort out the characters but overall a very good book!!
This book was a complete page turner u til the very end!! It was a wild ride! Excellent book!:)
Book was too repetitive and the characters rather boring.  Story dragged.  Not my type of book.
Slow start but once it picked up I had a hard time putting it down.  Love the twist at the end.
I could barely put this book down.  Had my attention from page one all the way through the end.
After the first couple of chapters, I couldn't put the book down!  Read it in a day and a half!
Loved this book.<br/><br/>I'll admit it got me and I didn't see the twist coming in the end.
This story had me thinking all the time for the next clues. Very good book. Read it in 3 days.
Not that great. I kept putting it down and reading something else.  It didn't keep me engaged.
I hated it.  I do not know why it is number one or was number one.<br/>Not an enjoyable read.
I really enjoyed this book!  It has a lot of twist & turns.  You won't be able to put it down.
I liked the book. But, I had it figured out by the time I was half way through it. Fun read.
The Girl on the Train<br/>The story was similar to Gone Girl but just didn't get it for me.
Really not that interesting or well written just unusual. Not worth the effort or the price.
Well developed story. Keeps you interested. Annoying lead character you have to get beyond.
It's been a while since I read the book but I did recommend it to my book discussion group.
Very interesting plot and character development. I loved the main character, flaws and all!
Well put together. While slow to start I really got into it even if I never liked the girl.
I did not like this book. It was confusing trying to keep track of the characters and the dates. I would not recommend this book.
Absolutely loved this book.  I couldn't put it down; finished reading this book in 2 days.
Interesting twists. Kept my attention and could not put the book down.  A quick good read.
I didn't care for the main character.  I figured out where it was going half way through.
This book read like the treatment for a movie, obviously hopes tp sell the screen rights.
It was difficult to like any of the characters. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
great book, i finished it in 2 days! kept me on the edge of my seat and my mind thinking!
Unreliable narrators mislead the reader so I couldn't figure out until close to the end.
I didn't want to put this book down from the beginning to the end.  It is a great read !
Very interesting twists and turns and nice to have a main character that isn't  perfect
I found it hard initially to get into the rhythm of the novel. After I did I enjoyed it
I couldn't put it down. If you liked Gone Girl you will love it. It is a great read. ☺️
Interesting characters, well written.<br/><br/>Loved the book, didn't want it to end.
Amazing book!  One of the best page turners I've ever read.  I loved the writing style.
Excellent book. Kept me on the edge on my seat the entire time. Finished it in two days
This story is told with a clever style always keeping you wondering what the next page will reveal.  My only small disappointment was that the big secret was never told at the end. That being said, the entire story was an incredible read, you must read this one and form your own thoughts of the its startling conclusion.
It was a good read, especially the further into the book you went.  Kept you guessing.
Excellent read. A little of Alfred hitchcock's rear window. I really enjoyed this book
It took a while for me to figure out what was going on.  Therefore it kept me reading!
This book was a great read. I never wanted to put it down and I'm not a big reader. :)
The subject of drinking got old and boring after awhile.  The book otherwise was good.
this was a really good psychological mystery.  My book club enjoyed this book as well.
Must Read! Suspenseful, Will keep you guessing! When is the movie going to come out?!
Great weaving of the characters and story line. Kept me guessing throughout the book.
Very engaging book right from the first words till the last page!!  Great story line.
I had trouble putting the book down!  It would make a great movie - very suspenseful.
Too much jumping around without a clear pattern.  Keeps you asking "Where are we?
Disappointed in bk.didn't like tge characters.story was interesting tho.waste of time
A compelling story about three women and their relationship. A mystery until the end!
I thought it was well written, but towards end, you will able to acknowledge killer.
Hard to get into at first. Pay attention to chapter headline and what the names are.
Such a stupid book. Not a thriller at all. Should be called 'girl is a train wreck'.
I really enjoyed this! It was suspenseful to the very end! I could not stop reading!
My book club read on my recommendation as compared to Gone Girl and we all loved it.
This is the kind of story where things turn so quickly, you're not sure what's truth and what is the fantasies of the characters.  I couldn't put it down, and once I finished it I wanted to reread it to see where the clues were now that I knew the truth. A  quick page turner that will make you gasp out loud!
a great read with a lot of suspense as you get into the book. Couldn't put it down.
A really good book. Couldn't put it down and certainly didn't see the twist coming!
Really enjoyed this book.  Kept my interest and I would call it a real page turner.
I enjoyed this book. It was fast paced and I like the alternating person narrative.
This is a page turner.  Grabs your interest immediately and holds you till the end.
Little hard to get into.  Picked up just over half way and then I had to finish it.
Book was a story about a psychological unhappy drunk. I can't give it a good rating
After I adjusted to a story being told from 3 perspectives, I could not put it down
Hard to follow in the begging then all of a sudden your hooked.  Very well written.
I loved this novel. My attention was held throughout the story. What a page turner!
I enjoyed the book,though I found it to be alittle dark and sad .Didn't really figure it would go this way until last chapter.A good can't put it down book.Descriptive writing, .All of the characters had their own problems.,so it was a toss up until the very end...it was really good reading..enjoyed it.
In the beginning you barely realize you are reading a mystery.  The characters are well developed - switching back & forth until you get to know them.  Then WHAM. You are hit with wonder of "who did it"!  Like trains on switch rails, the characters come together and you begin to think you've solved it.
Great book, one you start and then you don't do anything else until it's finished!
This is the first book I've read in quite some time that I could hardly put down!!
A good read.  Light enough for vacation reading and a fun steady book by the pool.
Very suspenseful and we'll written.  The story kept me engaged until the very end.
Even more than 5 stars.  I want to read another book by Paula Hawkins.  Fantastic.
Our book club loved this book.  We never guessed 'who done it'.  Hard to put down.
A fun, twisty, juicy read! I finished it in a weekend & was sad to get to the end!
What a good book. Very different but very good. Couldn't wait to see how it ended.
started a little slow, but built steadily.  Did not want to put down near the end
Did not like this book. I didn't enjoy reading about dysfunctional people's lives
Great book. Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading more by this author.
I did not care for the story at all and almost gave up on the book several times.
This is a riveting book.  I loved it, until the end seemed a bit rushed together.
I was disappointed. The two female characters are not sympathetic or interesting.
Twists and turns.  I figured it out about half way through, but good read anyway.
What can I say that hasn't already been said. I couldn't get enough of this book.
Boring..
GARBAGE!
Very interesting book.  Lots of twists and turns.  Good psychological mystery.
Great read!  Easy to see why it's been on NY Times best seller list for weeks.
Not worth my time to either finish the book or write this review! Enough said.
Enjoyed to the very end, great twist. I hope she writes more books like these.
Well written and I didn't expect the ending but at times it was a little slow
Excellent, compelling story. Kept me guessing and I really enjoyed this book.
A little difficult to get into but then loved it. Enjoyed the twists & turns.
You have to wrap our head around the back and forth. I is now getting better.
Maybe I was expecting too much based on all of the hype.  I was disappointed.
The few naysayers dismiss this book because the point of view comes from an active unlikable alcoholic. I think this is what makes it a gem. Anyone who has struggled with that disease in earnest can tell you that character is spot on. If you want cuddly mysteries read Sue Grafton.
Great read, very entertaining.  Lots of twists and turns.  No spoilers here!
Very good read but not as thrilling as I was expecting but still a good book
Absolutely riveting!!  I finished it in two days.  Puts Gone Girl to shame!!
It was good. Just have to sit a read for a few. Beginning is a little slow.
I could not put this down! Fantastic read. A truly original main character.
The book has a great twist at the end, but most of the story is repetitive.
Great read. It moves swiftly toward a satisfying and surprising conclusion.
Couldn't put it down.  An intense read that kept me guessing until the end.
A little known piece of history --- well written and.  Well worth the read.
I loved this book! There was never a dull moment and it is sure to please.
I felt after reading the book would probably be more enjoyable to females.
alternating persons telling story, but in first person.  very suspenseful.
I could not finish this novel for style, violence, etc. Personal decision.
Really good mystery.  If you like Gone Girl, you'll like this one as well.
VERY WELL WRITTEN AND HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION. I RECOMMEND IT. VERY ENJOYABLE
A good read which I recommend..not what I expected but enjoyed reading it.
A painfully slow novel about a depressed alcoholic from her point of view.
Could not finish the book. Jumped from character to character. Too screwy.
This is one of the best books I have ever written you cannot put it down
Page turner. Well written, but a bit confusing in spots. Worth the read.
I would not recommend this book.  The last three chapters were the best.
All I can say is "This is a great book...a true thriller." I could not put it down! It is so well-written...with little subtle hints (foreshadowing) along the way. I truly loved the characters and got involved with them  And it had a satisfying ending.

I don't think I've ever read a book of this type before; intensely personal, with multiple narratives.  I was hooked from the beginning, and though I read a lot of thrillers, the ending still caught me off guard.  I really enjoyed this book, and so will you.
Every time I thought I had it figured out, there was another twist. :-)
Good read but reminded me allot of gone girl - which I liked allot too.
Great suspense. May have to say the movie would be bette than the book.
enjoyed this book moved fast...couldn't wait to get back to reading it
Boring and didn't bother past the first few pages couldn't get into it
Well written and a real page turner. Good ending which was unexpected.
I was spellbound!  Couldn't put it down.  I'd recommend it and I have.
Have not read this author before but excellent book.  Full of suspense
Did not finish - just did not care for the writing and it seemed slow.
I read this on a flight and could not put it down until I finished it.
tedious
Average
Just ok
this is a deftly woven tale of foibles and flaws, and how we find ourselves trapped by our own lies, flour choices of illusions.  expertly told from multiple points of view, impossible to put down, hurtling forward like a train without a Beckerman.
good book - not a lot of dialogue - but was a very unexpected ending
I love the book I didn't expect the ending.THANK YOU HELEN WUNDERMAN
Great book with lots of twists.  Kept me interested the entire time!
I enjoyed this book a real page turner lots of twists until the end.
not finished yet.  I'm a slow reader with lots of other interests!!!
Girl on a train did not get downloaded onto my kindle. Can you help?
Boring.boring.Boring. I wish I had not spent time and money on this piece of boring booik
Great surprise at the end! I loved this book the whole way through.
The beginning was a little slow but about a 1/4 in I became hooked.
Great read with an interesting twist!  Would love to read a sequel.
If you liked Gone Girl, you're sure to love this book.  Great read!
I really loved the book it kept my interest start till the. End tks
What a simple title for such a complex and extraordinary book.  I absolutely LOVED this book.  It is one of the best books that I have read in a while.  I did not want to put it down.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good read.
A lot like Gone Girl liked the book overall was a good short read.
A great read.  Keeps you in suspense.  Great character development
Wonderful so many changes that you don't know what to expect next!
Reminded me a lot of Gone Girl.  Story did not seem very original.
Never guessed the ending Ig you liked Gone Girl you'll enjoy this!
Masterful weaving of storyline.  Although, did not care for the repeated insults of fat girl against Rachel character.  She had enough other issues, adding criticism of 'fatgirl didn't add anything necessary to the interrelationships.
A good read. It was not what I thought it would be. I enjoyed it.
Good book. Liked that it actually had an ending unlike Gone Girl.
This is a "cannot put it down" book.  Highly recommended.
Could not put it down, and I heard a movie is coming! Great read!
Liked it a bit confusing to me at first but then I figured it out
Great read. If you liked "Gone Girl", you will like this.
Started slow but whoa once I got into it, I couldn't put it down!
Well composed and executed mystery and study of the human spirit.
Really enjoyed it. Couple of unexpected twists keep you guessing!
Thourghly enjoyed the entire book and the ending was a surprise.
Plot goes back and forth too much.  Still, I'm sticking with it.
Couldn't put the book down. A page turner. Loved it. Suspenseful
I really enjoyed this book.. a fast read with a surprise ending.
Suspenseful, good twists - truly real (in a sad way) characters!
A must read....if you read and loved Gone Girl this is a must!!!
Great book, a page turner. Couldn't put down till I finished it!
Could not put this book down! I would highly recommend this book
Very good book. Ending a surprise. Characters are well written.
This book draws you in early on. It's definitely a page turner!
great book, the ending surpised me.  I would recommend the book
read this in 2 days, this story grabbed me from the first page.
I liked the book; however, I was able to figure out who did it.
The best book I've read in a  long time.  Highly recommended! !
This was a page turner. Couldn't wait to see what happened next
I zoomed through this book!  I hated to put it down!  LOVED IT!
Great book. Started a bit slow but it's worth sticking with it.
Took a while to get into it, but turned out to be a great read.
God this story took forever to develop. The last few chapters finally got exciting. One of the main characters was supposed to be an alcoholic but it was obvious that the author didn't know how they think. Good ending though.
This book was quite strange and confusing. I did not care for the whole way it was written and would not highly suggest this is worth reading. Lots of strange scenarios that are unlikely to happen and all pretty far fetched.
I really enjoyed this novel. It is quick and interesting read.
For me it was a slow start but then picked up and was awesome!
Full of suspense.  The ending is not predictable.  A bit gory.
Wasn't sure where it was going but kept my interest & liked it
Keeps the reader guessing until almost the end.  Well written!
I kept reading when I should have been doing other things.....
Great read! Highly suggest if you're a Gone Girl fan. Loved it
LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book!!  Going to buy the hardcover!!!
A well written novel with an ending I was truly surprised by.
Loved reading this book.  Great story.  Couldn't put it down.
Gripping and wonderfully written. I can't wait for the movie!
Her style will remind you a lot of Gillian Flynn. Great book!
Didn't expect the product to arrive so fast !! Good quality!!
Loved it! Should make a great movie if they decide to do one!
Wife liked this very much. I haven't finished but am enjoying
Very interesting and suspenseful book. I highly recommend it!
Great boos..truly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it 👍
Loved this book! Started it at 7:30 pm..just finished reading. .almost midnight. If you like British thrillers with twists and turns this is your book...Although, near the end I figured it out. .but a great who dunnit!
Arrived on time and was as advertised. Would buy from again.
Kepet me guessing til the very end. I really liked this book
It was hard to put this book down once I started reading it.
Confusing boring disconnected, why was it no.1 for so long??
Found the book somewhat repetitious but enjoyed the last 10%
I can't even explain it, you just HAVE to read this book!!!!
Riveting female characters, though the males lack dimension.
Perfect vacation read. Page turner and didn't have to think.
A thriller… not quite as good as Gone Girl, but close to it!
Hated it. Was bored out of my mind. Couldn't wait to end it.
boring
stupid
Great book. Easy read. Couldn't put it down toward the end!
Great read.  I couldn't put it down. Many twists and turns.
I couldn't put it down. Great writing and suspenseful plot.
Excellent book. Really keeps you concentrating!  Betty Imer
It was interesting.  She kept you thinking right to the end
IF you are up for a good mystery, you will enjoy this book.
I couldn't put this book down. Easy reading for the summer.
I thought it was very slow and I lost interest in the story
I found it confusing at the very beginning, and a bit slow.  About halfway through, the plot picked up and kept me turning the pages faster and faster!  If it were a movie, I might be too scared to watch it
This is the best book I've read in 2-3 years (and I read 60+ books per year). Terrific plot, engaging characters, wonderful writing -- this book has it all.<br/><br/>Read it now. You'll be glad you did!
What a great read! If you enjoyed "Gone Girl" you'll love this. So well written and to the point of the story. No fillers to take up page space, just gripping from start to finish. I couldn't put it down!
Great read! Finished it in one weekend! You will love it!
Great Read; Keeps you riveted, wondering and guessing....
Great book. Heard they are making it into a movie as well
I loved this book.  Can't wait for another by this author
Fast paced, unexpected, and thrilling...great summer read
Very good story and very good writer, it's a page turner.
It was a good book that was a bit on the depressing side.
The girl on the train was fabulous. It kept you guessing.
Another great book. Hard to put down.  Very suspenseful.
Characters were so unlikable, I did not finish the book.
I was guessing the whole story and couldn't put it down.
Well written but definitely did not live up to the hype.
A little convoluted, but I enjoyed the twists and turns.
I can't get past the 4th chapter. It is a slooooow read.
I could not put this book down. Really kept me guessing!
Very good book, extremely good character development, keeps you guessing until the end! Did not think the end would be what it was, very suspenseful, I loved it! I finished this book in five days!
Many greats twists to an outstanding reading adventure.
Took me awhile to get into this book but I did enjoy it
A well written and intriguing story, kept you guessing.
Captivating and haunting. I couldn't put this one down.
Great book! I did not put it down until I was finished.
A written review is annoying. Just sending star rating.
Great read.  Very fast reading.  Couldn't put it down!!
Book was suspenseful and intriguing.  was not able to figure out the end.  I would recommend this book to all readers who love a good mystery and who may have on occasion had too much to drink.
What a page turner! I could not put the book down. I read it in about a day and a half. Much suspense and I loved how the chapters went from character to character. I felt like I was there...
I cannot wait to read the next book by this new author. I'm not sure how Ms Hawkins was able to tell this story in so many voices. All I can say is I loved this book. So wonderfully twisted !
I just couldn't get into it, too much of a ladies book
Kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next!
An absolute page turner! Kept me up way past bedtime!!
One of the best books I've read lately.  A great read.
Not a bad read but a little monotonous, yet enjoyable.
i loved this book haven read that much liked what read
Easy read, entertaining, and well written<br/>4 stars
It was a very good read. A real "who done it."
I really enjoyed the book!  I couldn't stop reading...
I do hope the writer is not as sick as her characters.
This was a very good book.  I enjoyed the ploy twists.
I could not put this book down until I had finished devouring each word.  Brilliant story...unique!  The author unites the characters into a haunting story of tragedy and redemption.
Normally I can guess who "dunnit" early in the book, but not so with The Girl On The Train. I was pleasantly surprised. I am definitely looking forward to more books by this author.
I've been looking for  a good page-turner for awhile and this is it!  Intelligent and very well-written, grabs you early and keeps you engaged through to the end. Highly recommend!
Very captivating story with many twists and turns, portraying<br/>The desperate heroine in a very humane and nuanced way,ultimately redeeming her. Will recommend to all my friends
keeps you thinking, lots of twists,hard to pit down
Great book! Couldn't put it down. Read it in a day!
A fun page-turner with great character development.
It is somewhat confusing with the characters names.
Enjoyed the story very much. It isworth four stars.
Just ok, not as unpredicable as I would have liked.
It keeps you interested all the time.<br/>We all sometimes wonder about the lives of people we see, but don't know...<br/>The end is not as strong as the beginning, though.
A most depressing book that I could not put down.
The story held me all the way. Great summer read.
Great read!!! You dont want to put the book down.

WEIRD CRAZY GIRL......SOMEHOW I GOT TO THE FINISH
Too long and drawn out and conclusion was just OK
Awesome read!  Would love to see this as a movie!
The characters ate so well defined that you ate immediately drawn into the story.  Very smartly written.  The pace of the novel is just right, forcing you to keep reading.
Very intriguing thriller. Could not put it down.

reads like a soap opera.  don't waste your time.
Orriginal, funny, edgy an altogether good read.
It took a while to get into, but then was good.
good book. my copy was a little messed up thogh
Shades of Gone Girl but not quite as intricate.
Very good. It kept you guessing the whole time.
I loved this book.  It really held my interest.
First book in years that I couldn't set down!!

Hard to follow with a lot of twists and turns.
Book came on time and was exactly as described
This was a book I couldn't put down. So good!!
Very Interesting story. The pace is quie fast.
Outstanding. I was hooked from the first page.
Meh. I thought this book was highly overrated.
Reminiscent of gone girl but not as compelling
I couldn't put it down once I started reading!
I thought it was a terrible, depressing book..
What a thriller!<br/>I could not put it down.
A absolute page turner finished it in 2 days !
This book is based on what an acholic girls see as she passes by on the train. For me it was depressing, dreary I don't think I learnt anything from reading it.
I love a book I can't put down.... Or guess the ending half way through. This book hits both of these out of the park. I'm already looking forward to the movie.
Didn't want to put it down! Finished on a flight from NYC to Dallas. Was somewhat difficult to keep track of who was saying what but eventually it makes sense.
Interesting character development. Good read.
Love the story from 3 different perspectives.
What til you see who did it!  A nonstop read!
Read it cover to cover, couldn't put it down.
Ordered by mistake.  Canceled.  Did not read.
Defiantly a diffent story line ..I liked it..
I could hardly stop reading until I finished!
I did not like the girl's alcoholic behavior.
Started slow but got better as it went along.
A very good read that keeps you on your toes.
Really enjoyed this book. Cod no put it down.
Best read in a long time.  What a great book.
Not the best book in the world but an ok read

Very happy with this novel. It was a lot like Gone Girl, in that there was a lot of back and forth between characters. The ending was a satisfying surprise.
Twisted and entertaining. I couldn't put it down. unusual writing style that kept me guessing until the very end. Can't wait for this author to write more.
Was a bit confusing at first - jumping from date to date & character to character. But eventually was a story that had to play out, almost in one sitting!!
Best book I have read in ages. Couldn't put it down.  Never read Paula Hawkins before The Girl on the Train. Can't wait to read other books by this author.
Excellent !  Kept me interested til the end.
An interesting story with a surprise ending.
One of the best books I have read in awhile!
written well and good story.  A page turner.

Couldn't stop reading...a real page turner
I liked it.  Kept me guessing til the end.

Don't waste your money.  This book sucks.
Great read, even better as an audio book!
Unpredictable. Unique writing style that keeps the pages turning. Paula Hawkins certainly does know what she is doing.  I am ready for more.
nice
Poor
This was good but not a favorite, or to be compared with Gone Girl. I am disappointed by the opposing and  unbelievable favorable reviews.
Finished it but sped through some of it.

Great read. Very suspenseful. Had me on the edge, especially towards the end. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a thriller.
Not as riveting or tale twisting as Gone Girl- which is what I had expected based upon reviews. Not worth reading past your bedtime!
I couldn't put it down. Once you .start reading you're hooked. I was up all night only sleeping when my eyes would no longer focus.
I didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't put the story down.  She developed the characters well and the story was set up well.

Kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time. Rachel was a bit too pathetic to be real but overall a great thriller.

Wish I didn't waste my time.
Very Good. Nice plot twists.
Did not find it well written
The little glimmer of hope I had when I thought (YES!) Rachel was finally going to die. Please take this miserable character out of my misery! But no... of course she lives. No saving grace or satisfaction in putting up with this trainwreck of a character. I only feel angrier having finished the book.
Great read highly recommend

A real downer!
Gave book away
This was the most visceral intense bare bones terror horror seduction destruction ride on earth!! The perfectly spun web of addiction depression and non stop disbelief at the descent of madness that occurs when psychopaths invade lives.<br/>Rachel would make the most incredible heroine and now more than ever I am going to proceed with extreme caution when letting anyone in close. Real life. Scariest of all.  Earth shatteringly good!!!!  The screenplay????
Great read simply written, but intricately crafted.  Love that the three narrators were unreliable for different reasons, leaving constantly wondering who or how much to believe.  Kept me guessing.  Also do not agree with those who say it is like Gone Girl.  Aside from the missing wife, there are no other similairities.  Also found this book so much more gripping than Gone Girl.  Would definitely like to see it made into a movie.
Great book!!!

Awesome read!
As advertised
Can't read on my kindle.  When I go to open and begin reading the book, I get an error message saying the book is protected with DRM and cannot be read on my fire.  Says please remove the item from my device and download again (which I have done several times with no resolution) or purchase  a copy from the kindle store ( which I did originally ).  Not cool.  Spent the money.  Have the receipt.  No book.  What now?
Loved the book... BUT this publisher does not allow this book to be loaned. The greed of this publishing company shocks me. I will never buy from this publisher again. The concept behind a Kindle is that it should be similar to the material-book reading experience. Not allowing me to loan a good book to others (limit the number of loans if need be) is ridiculous and feels overly capitalistic.
Great book😀

From beginning to end, the pace never let's up. You're attention never wavers. I'm not going to retell you the story as many do. Read this for yourself - it's like nothing you've come across in years. So sit back, enjoy the the ride, and make sure that you have plenty of hours to be totally entertained. What a first book!!! Can't wait got the next!!
Really good, held my attention.
This was an excellent read.  Two psychologically disturbed women, Megan with her secrets and her need for excitement, Rachel always two sheets to the wind.  Megan goes missing.  Who did it?  Kept me guessing through most of the book.  Was a little surprised at who did it.  Can't say much about the book without giving it away.

Not a fan
I have only written one or two reviews, but I really had to comment on this book. It was an incredible bore by page 29. Fiction should not be work. I am sure Paula Hawkins believed the convention of having Rachel, Megan, and Anna writing in their diaries would be compelling, but I quickly tired of that convention. I cannot imagine how in the heck this book received any compliments or positive reviews. I did go to the end of the book to see if even the ending would be interesting and it was not. so Tom killed Megan, so what. Please, please find something much better, say, Dean Koontz "Innocence". Please do not encourage Paula to write more, she is at the level of my 8th grade students, and I mean no disrespect to my students. I just have a hard time finding the proper critique to offer up, other than this book did not deserve to be published.
I enjoyed the mystery, but I did not like any of the characters. I kept thinking I'd like them better if I just kept reading. Wrong. The narrators are all unreliable. And they continuously do the wrong thing. Yet the plot and mystery kept me reading. A very mixed bag for me.
Amazing!
Riveting

You will not put this down until you have finished the whole book. I read in one sitting in about 6 hours.  Terrifically inventive and with lots of surprise plot twists and turns. Can't wait til the movie come out.
I almost never quit a book that I have started, but I sure quit this one.  Guess it must be a total "chick book."  Although my wife's female book club was planning to read it, but they changed their minds!
Well written with great pace and vision. Hawkins crafts great characters and the suspense is delivered in quite a unique way, through the eyes of the three lead women. Best book I have read this year.
This book kept me guessing all the way to the end! I read at night, and stayed up late. The next morning all I could think about was Rachel. I couldn't wait to get home from work and finish this book!
A real page turner. The characterizations are unflinching and ring true. The whole stream of consciousness device keeps you on the edge of your seat and totally engaged. I highly recommend the book.
Excellent book.  The characters were very complex and the ending was not what I expected.  Hard to put the book down,<br/>as it left you hanging and you needed to read on to see what happened.
This was a true page turner. You will find yourself entangled in the lives of the main characters, rooting for each of them in some way. When the truth finally comes out, you will be stunned!
Great.
Great!

I had been reading some duds lately.  Not anymore!  This book will keep you wondering until the very end. Hard to put down.  A most enthusiastic thumbs up!!
This was great. The unreliable narrators make the story more intense. This was a quick read, probably because I just couldn't put it down until I finished.
Strictly a book for women and not for men!  I did not enjoy it and do not recommend it in spite of its being on the NY Times best seller list as #1.
I was very disappointed in this best seller.  All the characters turned out to be BAD people (except for her roommate who was not very developed).
I don't often come across a book that I can't put down. This is one of those books. I had to keep reading. It kept me guessing until the very end!
It wasnt a literary masterpiece , but I really enjoyed it. I found myself thinking about when I could get 20 minutes to read it. Would recommend.
I. Though this book was not only well put together but really interesting.  The construction was very interesting and it really moved  It along
Keeps you engrossed until the very end. Great interweaving of characters.  Not too complicated, but it does keep you guessing to the very end!
This was a quick, thrilling read.  I stayed interested from start to finish.  If you enjoy books like "Gone Girl" than you'll enjoy this book.
Really enjoyed it but it went a little off at the end when the two women came together to work against him . But otherwise very good read.
FLynn wrote an unique dark tale about characters the reader did not like. Same here but without the uniqueness. It will make a good movie.
It starts pretty slow. Had a shard time getting into it but it gained speed and became a who-done-it page turner. Solid enjoyable reading!
This is a deliciously intricate story with just enough twists and turns to keep the reader turning the pages for an all night book read.
Mesmerizing and full of twists and turns. Slow to start ,but picked up the pace quite fast. Quick read because you can't put it  down.
Loved the back and forth perspective, best thriller I've read in a long while. You'll be shocked at the ending, didn't see it coming
Don't start reading this book unless you want to devote some time-a great read. I will be looking for more books from Paula Hawkins.
This is a great book if you were a fan of Gillian Flynn's books. Twisty, with multiple perspectives. You won't want to put it down.
This book was so well constructed. Every turn you feel you know where it's going, but never do you realise it until the very end.
This book will become a movie.  It's better than Gone Girl.  It's a great book.  I read the ending twice just to enjoy it again.
Excellent book, well written, suspenseful, but with out the Gore of other books.  Lots of twists and turns, unexpected ending.
A gossipy book with highly characterized personas, you read only to get through a predictable plot, perfect for a train ride.
I accidentally purchased this book. I thought I was in the free book section. The writing is awful! I am trying so hard to get through the book since I paid for it but terrible writing is a huge pet peeve for me. I am having a hard time understanding what is going on and I don't care for any of the characters. Please save your time and money.
okay
Good
Meh.
Boo!
Blah
Meh.
good
Very good read.you can't put this one down,very tense.  Will read more of her books.stayed up two nights reading this book
Very suspenseful. Hard to put down so set a couple of days aside so you can just read. Great characters and many twists.
Fast paced and suspenseful until the end. It's a story of redemption at least in part that grabs you and never lets go.
Blows Gone Girl away! So very unpredictable. Read it today. It took me five days to read this book. Absolutely amazing.
Good good book!  Highly recommend and hope author has other books available to read. Better than gone girl book. Tx
So many twists and turns that you aren't sure of the outcome until the last few pages.  Wonderful escapist read.
Great story telling. Very well could be the next gone girl. Very quick read. Stayed up very late to finish it.
Read it in one sitting.  very well written and one of the best book I've read in a long time.
Not
Goo
Eh.
Reminiscent of a trip upon the Orient Express, Paula Hawkins' first novel is haunting, compelling, and a mystery writer's coup. While I love a good mystery, and this is certainly one, the motif of continual travel, carefully noted by different characters on differing dates, was an unusual writerly conceit that at times got old. I encourage you to press on to find rewards awaiting if you just keep at it. Ms. Hawkins has done a masterful job in rising above what could be tedious in lesser hands. She is definitely one to keep your eye on and I will look for all her next books.
Not that impressed.
where was the editor when this thing was written? I could hardly slog through it!
I loved this book!  So suspenseful!  The ending was definitely a jaw dropper.
Ok
😐
Spellbinding
Who could care what happens to any of the characters in this awful novel?  The plot is ridiculous; makes no sense at all.  Why does something like this become a best seller?
If you love a good story with fascinating ,strong, characters, suspense, that keeps you guessing until the end of the book, I recommend the girl on the train .
This was a good read, I was surprised at how much I was rooting for Rachel.  It is hard to believe what an evil piece of @#";+ Tom was.
Full of characters who range from unlikeable to detestable. Not one attractive character in the entire book. A complete waste of time. Absurd plot. If only my time could be refunded.
OK
i couldn't get past the first 2 pages. boring.
I don't know why I bought this book!  I usually avoid female authors but couldn't resist the publicity and it's continued top rating in the USA TODAY's top 50 book list.  What a waste.<br/>I noticed, after I finished, that most of the five-star reviews were written by women, and I feel  this type of writing appeals to women.  So much thinking and no real action in most of the 300+ pages.<br/>I have read only 8 female authors, mostly one or two books each, over the past 65 years - most were better than this story.  One drunk, one bad (or con artist) guy, and one nasty female coy do not make an exciting or interesting story.  Like another reviewer, I tried to skip some "filler" as I approached the end, impatient to get it over with!<br/>Norm
I gave it up after two chapters. It must be chick lit.
very interesting!  quick read
May I please give this O stars?  What a waste of time, even though it took only 20 minutes to read. Badly written, thin, boring. I cannot believe this is a best seller.  What have we come to?
None
This was a quick, intriguing read. Enjoyed immensely. I highly recommend anyone to read it. Lots of twists and turns.
I liked the book...couldn't put it down.  Has to be a 5 star for me at least.
Enjoyed reading this book.  Loved the characters, had a good ending.
Ok
The ending of this book was horrible...
Just started to read this book.
"The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins is better than the typical mediocre suspense novel. It starts off slowly, is plodding and tends to be boring at times.<br/><br/>This is far from a page turner and, disappointedly, it is not a thriller. Still, there are a good share of twists and turns in the story--and, when you least expect it, Hawkins throws in a large turn.<br/><br/>If reading is your forte, you will find "The Girl on the Train" to be an enjoyable novel.
See review above.
