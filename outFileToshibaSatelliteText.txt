~Highlights~<br/>!!!NOW!!! Updates on Tech Support (in addition to other updates)<br/>***** 802.11n band wifi- no 802.11ac except via an adapter via the USB 3.0 port<br/>***** Bluetooth readily detects and connects to speakers, headsets, headphones, keyboards and other Bluetooth devices<br/>***** RAM CAN be expanded to 16 GB, contrary to Toshiba saying the max is 8 GB (see review for RAM specs), This determination was based on the specs (I used Speccy to do the analysis) of the Motherboard, CPU, Chip set, & BIOS. (and yes, I HAVE upgraded the RAM and include a link to the brand and model I purchased for it)<br/>***** All Windows 7 & 8 computers are eligible for the Windows 10 upgrade<br/>***** Decent speed, handles multitasking well, including during videoconferencing<br/>***** Function keys can be locked into their alternate settings (This is the default)<br/>***** Windows Easy Transfer makes it easy to transfer files, but won't always transfer settings- had to transfer my email and settings manually. HOWEVER, is not available with Windows 10.  If you are simply doing the upgrade, though, your applications and settings will automatically be incorporated, and I've yet to find any of my old applications to be nonfunctional in Windows 10.<br/>***** Numeric keypad & Directional keys.  Some laptops have this, some don't. Toshiba has it. Convenient.<br/>***** Peeling off the thin green film around the edges reduces sharpness, but this can be further reduced by making "bumpers" with silicone or rubber tape<br/>***** Battery can be replaced by simply unscrewing the two screws that secure it, quite obvious to the discerning eye and also explained in the manual.<br/>*****Should you have Windows 10 questions, feel free to ask.<br/><br/>~~*UPDATES*~~ have been added to include information about the Windows 10 upgrade, as well as instructions for restoring standard function mode for the Function keys (the default is the special function mode, and Toshiba isn't very clear about how to turn that off).  6/29/15- I have now updated the review with info on the RAM upgrade, which I just performed.<br/><br/>As I come from a family of engineers, both hardware and software, and myself a currently working in data management, I will be reviewing this system from that background, and my rating will be based on my analysis of the hardware, reliability, functionality, and upgradeability.<br/><br/>First of all, no nit picking.  We all know what OS this comes with before making the purchase.  Likewise the description is clear about the general hardware specs, but avoids some of the specifics.  If you don't like Windows 8, it's no reason to bash the machine, especially as you can upgrade to Windows 10 for free come August.  The reality is, you won't find much better than this within the price range this is set at.  I have now upgraded to Windows 10, and after a couple of minor hiccups (errors in the update log- did searches on them and found fixes, which worked), Windows 10 is now running smoothly.<br/><br/>The Toshiba C55 C5240/41 is a decent mid-range laptop at a reasonable price.  While it doesn't come with all of the "bells and whistles," it comes with enough for most purposes.  However, as someone heavily into the digital arts, I like to improve things where I can, so I thoroughly researched this system and its maximum performance and upgradeablility.  This laptop has now replaced my failing Lenovo G575.  I have now used it both at home, and at work, where I'm responsible for data management.  It has had zero issues with gaming, and I had no problems multitasking while videoconferencing, something I could never do with the Lenovo or even my Dell, both of which have equivalent RAM but slower processors.<br/><br/>This system can be purchased with Windows 8.1 OR Windows 10.  It's important to keep in mind, though, that ALL computers (and phones and tablets) running Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 are ready and eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10 for one year after the July 29, 2015 release.<br/><br/>Battery:<br/>The battery appears to be very robust, with a charge lasting in excess of 5 hours.  Should anything go wrong with the battery, removal and replacement involves the removal of two screws, rather than the flip of a switch or push of a button most systems have.<br/><br/>RAM (upgradeability):<br/>The system comes with 8GB RAM at 1600Mhz, as 2x4GB (1600Mhz, Speccy shows each running at a frequency of 800Mhz, but that value gets doubled) SODIMM's.  While this is adequate for most applications, I prefer having as much as my system can handle for my digital arts activities, especially when working with 3D animation.  The manual states simply that Toshiba won't be responsible for anything that happens by swapping out the RAM.  Calling Toshiba was no better. They told me that the system is rated for a maximum of 8GB RAM, which is what it comes with. That's rather ridiculous, as most systems these days come with the ability to add additional RAM.  However, I'm not one to take them at their word.  I opened up the back and could easily see that the motherboard and processor could handle up to 16 GB RAM.  That left the question of the BIOS.  Using Piriform Speccy, I looked up the bios and contacted the company responsible for it.  The Bios can indeed handle the 16GB RAM I had already determined the motherboard and processor to be rated for.  ****UPDATE 6/29/15**** I have now replaced the two 4GB SODIMM's with two 8GB ones. All is functioning smoothly, the BIOS is recognizing the additional RAM, and the system is purring like a happy kitten.  The RAM I put in is this: <br/><br/><br/>I decided to go with CL9 instead of CL11 as it tends to be a smidgen faster.  After replacing the original DIMMs, the boot sequence initially takes you into the BIOS settings, which will reset to default. I only needed to re-establish proper date and time settings.  However, the BIOS settings also allow the user to set additional security, including passwords for booting, BIOS access, and administrative use.  The initial boot sequence after adding the RAM was quite slow, which I attribute to the BIOS updating according to the new RAM specs. After the initial boot sequence, subsequent boot speed has returned to normal.<br/><br/>The system is ASTONISHINGLY fast now, with virtually zero wait for applications to open, and zero noticeable performance issues when multitasking, including multitasking during a videoconference (i.e. screen share, browsing, Powerpoint slide show, etc all at once).<br/><br/>Bear in mind, however, that if you should require the system to be serviced by Toshiba, it will need to be restored to its original hardware configuration.<br/><br/>Wifi:<br/>The Toshiba C55 is limited to 802.11n band by its built-in wifi adapter.  For those of us with faster routers that use the AC band, an adapter will be a desirable accessory, and fortunately this system has (1) USB 3.0 port that can handle such adapters according to their full potential.<br/><br/>***** A note of caution.  Some adapters, like the 802.11ac adapter by Startech, use Realtek network drivers. While these say they are Windows 8 compatible, the driver has an inherent flaw that will cause many Windows 8.1 systems (this is OS associated, not related to the actual computer) to go into the blue screen of death, requiring one to boot in safe mode (with networking) and 1. disable the driver, 2. uninstall the driver, and 3. completely delete the driver. 802.11ac USB 3.0 adapters by Netgear and TP-Link don't use the flawed driver, and I've experienced no issues with them.  My preferred adapter is the <br/>.  Unlink the typical adapters that stick out the side of your system, making them vulnerable to breakage at the USB interface, the T4UH is a stand alone that connects via a cable.  It is extremely sturdy and has two antennae.  I've experienced zero issues with it and a strong signal from anywhere in my house.<br/><br/>In addition, not all adapters are Windows 10 compatible yet.  My <br/> has no Windows 10 drivers available, requiring me to utilize only the internal 802.11n wifi adapter until TP-Link comes out with a compatible driver.  There may be issues with other products that have not been pre-configured for Windows 10 as well.  While there are a number of things I don't like about Windows 10, this is so far the only major problem I've experienced.<br/><br/>USB and SD:<br/>With one USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports, there is no lack of availability to tack on additional accessories such as a Blu-Ray-RW drive, faster Wifi adapters, and other items.  Many people will want to get a USB 3.0 Hub to expand the availability of the USB 3.0, which is 5x faster than USB 2.0.<br/><br/>There is one SD slot, and it has thus far been quite fast and functioned perfectly with SD cards up to 128GB (I don't have any bigger ones).<br/><br/>HDMI / VGA:<br/>This system has no VGA port. Should you wish to use a separate VGA monitor, you will need to use a HDMI to VGA adapter.  The HDMI port on my system has thus far functioned perfectly, with no delays or loss of quality in either video or audio up to 1080p.  I've yet to try it with a 4K setup.  It has had zero difficulty with my 7.1 bluetooth & HDMI surround system, although the best I was able to test it with was a blu-ray with 6.1 audio, using my external Blu-Ray RW drive.<br/><br/>Audio:<br/>Considering the size of the speakers, the audio of this system is reasonable.  The internal microphone works well during the videoconferences I've been in, with no echo or sounding distant.  Still, for recordings of my singing and such, I'll still be using my Samson C01U USB mic, and for listening to music, you will prefer using either external speakers or headphones.  There is only one 3.5mm connection available for a headphone jack or microphone, but for higher fidelity 5.1 or 7.1 headsets, USB is always going to be your preferred option anyway.  Bluetooth headsets also readily connect with excellent audio.<br/><br/>DVD-RW:<br/>As noted above, this system does not have a Blu-Ray drive, much less a Blu-Ray RW drive.  The DVD-RW multi drive, however, has functioned flawlessly with DVD's, CD's, as well as both reading and writing to DVD-RW disks.<br/><br/>Graphics / Screen:<br/>Resolution for this system is limited to 1366 x 768, so it is not a 1080P system.  When watching 1080P, you will do better by utilizing the HDMI port with a 1080P monitor or television. The system does include options for a 3D display.  Color appears to be true, and I have noted no bleeding or artifacts when using HD media.<br/><br/>Fan:<br/>The fan for this system is reasonably quiet, and seems to be quite efficient, for while the bottom surface of the system gets warm during use, it does not get hot the way my previous laptops have.<br/><br/>Peripherals (keyboard, mouse):<br/>The keyboard of the Satellite C55 is a standard laptop keyboard with one major difference.  Depending on personal preference, the default for the function keys can be set to be function OR to their alternate use.  However, you cannot set the keys individually. Either all are set to function, or all are set to their alternate setting.  Those with mouse issues have likely accidentally hit F5 in its alternate setting, which turns the touch mouse on or off.  Also, the keyboard is 100% integrated into the laptop deck, which may improve durability, but also may make replacement more complicated.<br/><br/>***FUNCTION KEYS... Restoring F1-F12 to Standard Settings<br/>The default setting for the function keys is in their "special"  function mode. The manual isn't very clear about how to turn this off, should you prefer that to be reversed. Fixing this is pretty simple.  Click on your Windows Start button to bring up your Apps by category. Scroll over to the Toshiba category.  Click on "System Settings."  Then click "Keyboard." Once there, you can use the drop down to set the keys to "Standard F1-F12 Mode," as opposed to "Special Function Mode."  Select standard mode and click "ok."  Your function keys will now work normally, without the need to press FN to utilize the function modes.  Pressing FN with the keys will now activate their "special" setting.<br/><br/>The touchpad mouse seems to have high sensitivity, with all of the functions one might desire, including touch scrolling, tap select, border functions, fingertip expand and contract, and the ability to customize the functions for different actions. As with the majority of systems, one can also lock out individual functions. My preference is to lock out the tap select, preferring instead to use the left button to make my selections.<br/><br/>Security:<br/>When setting the system up, you can improve security by requiring two passwords, one to boot, and a second one to log into your Windows account.  It comes with McAfee LiveSafe pre-installed, although the registration appears to be dated to December 2014 instead of the date in which I first booted the system up.  That's a bit annoying, as it means I've lost about half of the first year of registration for my virus protection and firewall.  I have noted that while scanning, McAfee tends to utilize a significant percentage of available memory... over 30%.  That does slow the system down quite a lot, and you may prefer a more streamlined application.  I've tested McAfee, Norton, Kaspersky, ESET, AVG, Vipre, Windows Defender, and Zone Alarm on it.  McAffee, ESET, and Norton hog the CPU, using 35-67% of the CPU when NOT performing scheduled scans. Kaspersky and AVG can likewise slow things significantly due to RAM utilization during scheduled scans.  Vipre is among the leanest platforms, yet is better than any of those at blocking malware.  I used Defender for a week and had to clear over 800 files and registry entries from malware that got through.  I'm currently testing Zone Alarm on it, and an extremely pleased with performance of the laptop and the software.  A number of these do have Game mode, which minimizes the security functions in favor of processor speed and limiting RAM utilization.  Malwarebytes is a great supplement to any security platform.<br/><br/>From the applications I've tested, Vipre and Zone Alarm have been the ones I've been happiest with, with Zone Alarm currently edging out Vipre with my feature and performance preferences (but overall not any better than Vipre, and with Vipre you can purchase a lifetime license for not a whole lot more than an annual license).<br/><br/>Case:<br/>While the molding for the entire package has very defined edges, I do not find it to be flimsy in the areas where most systems have their weak points, in particular the hinges for the screen.  These are thick and robust, with smooth movement when opening and closing the laptop.  It won't be difficult to install bumpers to deal with the sharp edges and corners via the use of silicone or rubber tape, or silicone caulk.<br/><br/>*** More on Windows 10: If you are upgrading on the same system from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, your applications and settings will automatically be incorporated into the upgraded OS.  If you are transferring between computers, Windows 10 DOES NOT have Windows Easy Transfer anymore.  HOWEVER, there are a number of available applications that are capable of doing the transfer instead, and many of them are more reliable than Windows Easy Transfer ever was.<br/><br/>Other:<br/>The CPU for this system is rated for speeds up to 2.58 Ghz, which is adequately fast for most digital arts applications, including gaming.  The system appears to be fairly streamlined, without a lot of excess applications pre-installed.  Bear in mind, though, that Toshiba makes accessing the BIOS rather tricky, which is an obstacle to overclocking.<br/><br/>You also have access to OneDrive, a cloud storage utility, should you prefer to save your documents in a place other than the hard drive.  It also offers a convenient location for backing things up without the clutter of external media.<br/><br/>***UPDATE***<br/>As of May 31, an icon identical to the Windows start icon has appeared on the right side of the taskbar.  If you click it, you can now reserve your free Windows 10 upgrade, which is expected to be released in August.<br/><br/>***NEW UPDATE*** Problem encountered (Hardware) and Tech Support Experience<br/>June 3: On June 3rd, approximately after one month of use, my laptop began locking up.  While the bottom surface never got remotely hot, any time the system was warmed up, it would hang to the point where the only option to turn it off was to either remove the battery or to hold the power button down to force a shutdown.  Once this would happen a first time,it would then hang even more frequently, including during the boot process  There were other symptoms as well, but the detail would be too lengthy of this review.  What I will say is that wrapping my computer up to protect against condensation and placing it in my chest freezer for 30 minutes to an hour would allow me to boot without problems... until it warmed back up, at which point it would freeze up again.<br/>.<br/>Having diagnosed the problem, I contacted Toshiba about warranty repair.  I did not tell them I am a reviewer, as I did not wish to taint the experience and expectations for others who may require warranty repair.  For shipping, I chose the option for a pre-paid box and label, approximately $30, which would be cheaper than the $40 it would have cost me to ship it myself, even with my boyfriend's FedEx discount.  Toshiba has a nifty web tool that keeps the customer informed about where their system is in the repair process, and I monitored that closely.  I also included a detailed letter with my laptop, explaining exactly what happened, and asking that they call me prior to shipping it back so that the repair process could be discussed, leaving no questions unanswered.  However; they never called.<br/><br/>Overall, my tech support experience would rate about average. It wasn't stellar, but it could have been worse.  In spite of the problem having already been identified, they went through the usual hassles of doing a factory reset, seeing if the problem would be replicated afterward (it did, of course), and doing my best to back up my critical data by freezing the system in the freezer, as I use the system both at home and at work at the online high school where I work tech support.  Finally getting past that, I paid for my box & shipping and shipped the system to their repair center in Indiana. Daily, I followed the repair progress until I noted that it was on its way back to me.  Upon return, I booted the system without difficulty and at present am reinstalling all of my applications, including Adobe Master Collection CS6, Corel Painter 2015, Cyberlink PhotoDirector 6 Ultimate, Corel Paintshop Pro X6, Corel Videostudio X6, MS Office, etc (I have a lot of multimedia software as I also teach digital arts).  So far it has remained stable.  Should that change, I will update this review.<br/><br/> I have yet to drop a star, as the system truly is a powerhouse for a system of its price range.  You aren't going to find a system with this processor, amount of RAM, or  capabilities for any less than this, unless it's purchased used.  Complaints about keyboards not being back-lit or not having a touch screen are ridiculous, for again, you won't find anything comparable within its price range.  Software-wise, it has the essentials, but not a lot of bloatware utilizing excess CPU power or RAM.<br/><br/>This isn't a gaming computer per se, but it does plenty well as a gaming platform, provided you adjust resolution to 1366x768 rather than the preferred 1920x1080 (1080p).  The processor can be clocked to run faster via the bios and is rated for speeds up to 2.7Ghz (it is 2.2 Ghz as is).  swapping the 8GB RAM with 16GB RAM also causes a significant improvement.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>The Toshiba C55 C5240 may not be a high-end gaming laptop, but it is quite capable for most uses, including most gaming.  Even though Toshiba discourages upgrades to internal components such as RAM, I have determined that you don't have to be limited to the 8GB RAM it comes with.  Just be sure that you are matching the DIMM type (CL11 SODIMM), number of pins (204), and bandwidth (PC3-12800 - 1600 Mhz, although Speccy detection shows each running at a frequency of 800 Mhz, which you double).  While Windows 8 is not my preferred OS, I do not find that to be an issue to complain about, given that we all know what OS is installed prior to purchase- it's the hardware, compatibility, and upgradeability that matters, along with reliability and tech support.  The 1TB HDD is plenty large for most uses, and not difficult to partition, should you wish to create a partition for backups.  The system comes with security pre-installed, but it is not difficult to switch to something else, should you prefer a different security platform.  I would recommend this system for just about all levels of user, although the most advanced users will prefer to either upgrade what already exists or purchase something that's much higher end.  The only reason I can think of behind Toshiba's discouragement toward upgrading the RAM is that they would prefer a person to purchase an entirely new system, should they want something better.  This is not necessary, as two 8GB DDR3L DIMMs run around $100 (less if on sale).  I'll still give this 5 stars, but it's borderline, based on how unhelpful Toshiba was when I called to ask about expanding the RAM, and the less than stellar technical support I received for my hardware issue.<br/><br/>Overall, be you a student, working in an office, a gamer, or involved with network communications, this laptop is a great deal and has a lot to offer at a very low price.  Toshiba DOES hold up to their warranty terms, albeit sometimes grudgingly... but I didn't have to pull the reviewer card to get what I needed done taken care of, so in that respect they are at least honest.  The C55-C5240 is a nice little machine I feel quite comfortable recommending to just about anyone for most uses.<br/><br/>Please see the attached photo for an example of my photo editing using this system.  I created this image from 7 photos from 3 different countries, using Adobe Photoshop CS6 and Corel Paintshop Pro X7.
I just received my new laptop and have gone over all of the complaints people had about this computer and here is my<br/>assessment. First I must say that I did add RAM before even starting it up so I will not talk about performance except<br/>to say that I bought this to play WoW and it does that beautifully with 16 GB of RAM. For those that complain about it not<br/>having a backlit keyboard or 1080P screen or any other feature that is doesn't come with, stop complaining that you bought<br/>a computer that doesn't have what you need. All of the specs are there for you to read. Your problem if you bought it<br/>without what you need.<br/><br/>This computer is solid. Not flimsy or creaky as some say. I opened it up and grabbed each side and gave it a twist in each<br/>direction. I also picked it up with one hand as another user said it felt flimsy. Solid as can be. It is also super thin!<br/>It is as thin as my netbook without a CD/DVD drive yet this comes with one!<br/><br/>Sharp edges: when I first opened the computer I was shocked at how sharp the edges are! After investigation and knowing<br/>that there is no way anyone would sell a product that would intentionally hurt someone I investigated. There is protective<br/>plastic tape around all of the sides of both the monitor and the base. Once removed the issue resolved itself. I am not<br/>really sure how anyone could have cut themselves typing unless the keyboard is above chest level. I have huge hands and<br/>even if I rest them on the base (which is very bad form) they don't come near the edges.<br/><br/>Location of touchpad. It is located in the center of the keyboard where it belongs. This is the same location for all<br/>laptops. If it bothers you then you should buy a laptop that doesn't have a number keypad on the right side. As I type<br/>it sits nicely between my hands, mostly out of the way. If it was centered to the base instead of the keyboard it would<br/>sit under my right hand while typing and cause all kinds of problems.<br/><br/>Function of touchpad. I have different issues than others. My issue is that the touchpad required a hard tap to register<br/>a click. I am used to a very sensitive touchpad. I delved into the settings and found WAY more settings than I have ever<br/>seen on a laptop before. I could easily change the sensitivity, the click area and starting area and many other features.<br/> I still don't have it quite right but It is very close to being what I want. Playing with the settings and fine tuning<br/>it is all it will take. The detailed settings seem hidden. To get to it type in the search bar "touchpad" (or double click<br/>mouse in the hidden icons area) and select mouse and touchpad settings. After setting those as you wish click "additional<br/>mouse options." The mouse properties opens. Make your way through each tab ending with Device Settings. Once in the device<br/>settings tab click on settings button. (see photos) Here is where things get very detailed. You can click on each setting and it gives a small<br/>video about what that setting allows you to do. Once the setting is highlighted there will be a gear and ? on the right<br/>side of the highlight. Select the gear and it will allow you to customize that setting. The "Smart Sense" setting is the<br/>one for sensitivity and the one you want to adjust if you are having trouble with the mouse selecting stuff while typing<br/>etc. Check the features you want to use and uncheck the ones you don't. Play with them until you are getting the responses<br/>you want.<br/><br/>Keyboard. The keyboard misses the space bar frequently and it doesn't seem to matter if I am typing hard or soft. I may<br/>just need to find the groove because it doesn't happen all the time. Since this is used mostly for gaming for me It will<br/>not be a deal breaker but if it were my main computer it would. I will see if time and my typing style learn to accommodate<br/>this without me having to retype things. I do agree that the nubs on F and J are too small so finding the home keys without<br/>looking are an issue too.<br/><br/>Speakers. These are hands down the best speakers I have ever heard in a laptop. They are loud enough to watch a full<br/>feature film. It was so loud my husband yelled at me from another room to turn it down. Don't compare it to your home sound<br/>system because they are tiny speakers but for a laptop they can only be beat with external hookup speakers.<br/><br/>Camera. I do not use the camera on computers and tend to disable them for security purposes.<br/><br/>Windows 10. First, you know it comes with it so don't complain about the software when the review should be about the hardware. Personally, I was so happy to download windows 10 and see all of the terrible windows 8.1 issues are gone! Windows 10 starts faster, changes between users faster and actually works with all of my software! Something I cannot say about windows 8.1 which made QuickBooks almost useless and backing up to my network drive impossible. My business is very thankful for windows 10. I am loving it as much as 7 once I got used to what is new. I find new things every day and smiling because of them. Windows 8.1 I NEVER smiled. It was just a lesson in frustration.<br/><br/>Initial start up.  I do recommend NOT hitting the accepted installation settings button for windows 10. Hit configure link on left side of screen instead and turn all of the permissions off. They aren't needed and risk your security. I also did not register with a Microsoft account. That too can be skipped. You only need a Microsoft account if you will be buying aps in their ap store or gaming with your X BOX and Windows 10 (a GREAT new feature). You can always register later if you want to do that.<br/><br/>All in all it is a good machine that requires users to configure it to their liking. If anything changes as I use it I will<br/>update this review. Four stars because of the keyboard.
For the money when purchased ($449 shipped), it has to be one of the best deals going.  I've been paying attention and I have yet to see anything come very close aside from refurbs with older processors.  Performance is snappy with a processor (Core i5-5200) that benchmarks better than the AMD A6 in the desktop I am replacing with this.  Is it equivalent to a $1600 top of the line model?  No, of course not, but nothing I've seen at this price point can touch it.  Normally at this price point, you are sacrificing much more.  This thing comes with a DVD drive as well.  Considering how thin it is, that's something of an accomplishment for the money as well.  I should point out that I'm not a power user, but I do prefer to err on the side of more processor power vs. less.  If for no other reason, you simply get more life out of a more powerful computer.  This thing will do fine unless your very demanding.<br/>Negatives?<br/>Constuction - Tuffbook this isn't.  the display seem a bit flimsy to the touch as does the case on the bottom.  If your a tinkerer, you will need to remove the entire bottom cover to access the memory or the drives, rather than the typical access panels many of us are accustomed to.  The flip side of this is that the entire thing is quite light to tote around.<br/>I'll admit to not being a huge fan of the keyboard.  It does ok, but my 5 1/2 YO HP laptop has a far better keyboard.  Admittedly, it's not terrible, but when docked, I use a proper Logitech.  The touch pad, I like the fact that it has the older style buttons still.  The newer style "floating" touchpads aren't terrible, I simply prefer the buttons, I'm sure opinions vary on this.<br/>Speakers - not great, but better than I expected considering cost and form factor.  They are far superior to the gawd-awful speakers built into my Acer touchscreen monitor.  Of course proper speakers are still a step up.<br/>It should be pointed out that it's actually a decent looking product as well.  Sure there are prettier, but it could have been an eyesore for what I paid and I'd still be relatively happy.  The fact that it actually looks decent is a nice bonus.  That said, one review pointed out that the edges were a bit on the sharp side.  I haven't had an issue with it myself, but if it becomes a problem, I'll simply put a bit of tape on the edges in question.<br/>Some people might consider this a negative, but I feel it's a positive:  No Shovelware to speak of.  It comes with Windows, McAffee Anti virus, the odd DVD and other such software and some Toshiba utilities.  That's pretty much it.  No introductory, trial, free for 90days office suites or other such clutter.  All computers should come like this.  I tend to be a bit minimalist when it comes to software. No delete-athon was required to get rid of all the unneeded crapware that some builders dump in, cough, cough HP, cough cough.
This is excellent for the price, but at $500 one must expect compromises. It's got a lot of horsepower, 8 Gb of memory, and a huge hard drive. It even has an optical drive, which has pretty much vanished on newer machines. It's large, though, and can't be expected to compete with tablets or ultra-thins for portability. Since this lives by my couch, that's not an issue for me, and I do have a tablet with keyboard dock for travel. This even has a numerical key pad, which I much appreciate. The compromises are battery life (maybe 6 hours of constant use at best), the screen (the resolution is 1366x768, which is pretty low for such a big laptop, and the contrast is poor unless you tilt it back so much it wants to tip over), and the keyboard, which is very mushy and frankly sucks. It's got an i5 processor, which is very good unless you're a gamer, but it does all I need and does it quickly and well. One reviewer complained that the battery wasn't removable. It's in the usual position in the back of the machine and is held in with two screws, so I'd think it would be easily replaceable. The battery life isn't an issue for me, since as I said it sits next to the couch and the charger, and I can live with the screen. The lousy keyboard is the biggest negative for me and why I knocked off a star. Considering the price point, I'd probably still buy it again.
So far, I love this computer. It was ready to go right out of the box with Windows 8.1, and no programs extra to Windows except McAfee Antivirus installed. I uninstalled that and installed AVG because I am not a huge fan of McAfee.<br/><br/>It is a very powerful computer for the price. I was looking for a regular laptop (I don't need touchscreen and/or detachable tablet) with powerful specs, balanced with a good price. With 8 GB of RAM and a TB of hard drive space, this computer fits the bill. Also, a Windows 10 upgrade comes free with this computer, which is a huge plus. It has one USB 3 port, and two USB 2 ports, as well as HDMI out. It also comes with wi-fi, an SD card reader, Bluetooth, and a DVD Burner (it doesn't say anything about Blu-Ray and I don't use them, so someone else will have to say whether it has that capability, but I am guessing it doesn't). It isn't going to have every higher end feature or spec, but it seems to balance price with power well.<br/><br/>The battery life seems strong, and I got about 5 good hours on mine while working it to death installing programs, transferring files on an external hard drive, etc. It is thin and lightweight, but seems sturdy. I can't comment on Toshiba customer service or that aspect of the experience, but I will updated if necessary.<br/><br/>So far, everything is working well. It runs quickly and smoothly. I bought one for my wife and hers has worked perfectly as well.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, this is an amazing laptop.<br/><br/>EDIT: The one jack for both microphone and headphones is a little annoying. I may have to get a workaround if I want to use headphones and external mic at the same time.
I am tremendously disappointed with this laptop. This is the 3rd Tishiba laptop I have purchased and I have always loved and promoted their quality and durability. However, right from the start this laptop had bugs or issues with things like the sound and touchpad. Then when the display went haywire I finally said enough is enough and called Toshiba customer service, which should be renamed "Toshiba passes the buck". I was passed from specialist to specialist and misinformed about the warranty and what it would cover. Then, to add insult to injury, they referred me to an authorized repair place that quoted me a price that was more than I spent on the laptop when I bought it. It seems obvious to me that not only is Toshiba's customer service sorely lacking, but that as they've expanded their line of laptops it has come at the expense of quality and durability.  And unfortunately, Toshiba does not seem willing to stand behind an inferior product; they'd rather waste time stringing along, passing the buck and ultimately dropping the ball.  Sad but true. Suffice to say, I will never spend another penny on ANY Toshiba product. Period.
The laptop was great when I first bought it it, 6 months ago. Now the battery is totally dead, the hard drive died so I sent it back to Toshiba and 6 weeks later I get it back with the hinges broken for the monitor. I called Toshiba and they said it would cost $50 to send back to them so they could look at it even since they just looked at it, even though it is still under warranty. BEWARE>>>>>>>>>>>>> DO NOT BUY TOSHIBA LAPTOPS..<br/>Their products are cheaply made and they don't honor  their warranty.
Thanks
I bought this laptop for my wife to replace her aging Lenovo G575.  Here are my initial impressions:<br/><br/>The laptop is thin.  It is sleek and professional looking, with a black faux-metalized look.  There were lots of plastic strips along all of the edges that had to be removed.  These strips of plastic serve as scratch protection during shipping I suppose.  The design style of this laptop is nice. I like the textured look and the black color. The sculpted lines of the sides of this laptop are attractive as well, but make touching the DVD drive button a little difficult.  To place a disc in, I had to tilt the laptop up a bit to get my finger over and under the side to press the button to pop out the tray.<br/><br/>It has an SDcard reader, one USB 3.0, two USB 2.0, and one Ethernet jack.<br/><br/>Prior to the above-mentioned Lenovo, I purchased a Toshiba Satellite about 8 years ago for my wife. Over time, the power adapter port broke inside the laptop. The power adapter port inside that laptop was a barrel. The power cable and the barrel inside the laptop plug into each other. Somehow the barrel inside her old Toshiba broke off its mount points inside the laptop. Perhaps it was stress on the cable, since it sticks out quite far from the laptop when plugged in. It still works, but it is dangling inside, making the process of plugging it in more difficult. Additionally, the left mouse button broke on her old Toshiba. I mention this because this laptop has the same internal barrel-style plug, although the end of the power cord where it plugs into the laptop is now L-shaped.  This should relieve some strain on the barrel in side.  Speaking of the power cable, it is a nice 12 feet long.<br/><br/>The mouse buttons on this laptop feel significantly more robust than her old Toshiba.  They are firm and responsive.<br/><br/>The keyboard of this laptop is super low profile. It looks great, but there is practically no movement of the keys.  The keys have labels on them, which I feel may rub off over time.  I like the sleek modern font used for the keys labels, which are also all capital letters.<br/><br/>Only time will tell if the power plug, keyboard, and mouse buttons hold up to use.<br/><br/>It feels well-built and solid, but there are some fit-and-finish issues that should not have made it through Quality Assurance.  The most notable Issue I have with this laptop is that there is a visibly noticeable warp near the left speaker above the keyboard.  It doesn’t prevent the laptop from functioning, but it looks bad.  We probably are not going to return this laptop just for that though.  Regardless, it is disappointing and never should have been packaged and shipped like this, as any person could obviously see that it is defective.<br/><br/>The LCD looks nice, is  bright, and has very little color shift.  Unfortunately it has one dead pixel.  This is really only noticeable in certain situations, like the black Toshiba boot screen.<br/><br/>It only supports the 2.4 GHz wireless networking band.<br/><br/>This laptop did not come with a restore CD, so I suspect there is a restore partition, like most PCs.  The hard drive is 1TB and you get a usable 919Gb.<br/><br/>It comes with Windows 8.1 and thankfully boots to the Desktop by default.  It is also Windows 10 ready.<br/><br/>This laptop has a Core I5 Intel processor and was one of the primary reasons I chose this laptop for my wife.  On Geekbench, this Toshiba scored 2595 (single core)/4946 (multicore) on 32-bit tests.  It scored 2680 (single core)/5255 (multicore) on 64-bit tests.<br/><br/>The above scores are much better than the Toshiba C55-B5298 15.6-inch Laptop (2.1 GHz Intel Celeron N2830 Processor), which scored 991 single core and 1701 multicore on the 64-bit benchmarks. On the 32-bit benchmarks, the Toshiba C55-B5298 scored 870 single core and 1367 multicore.<br/><br/>My Thinkpad SL510 with a Core2Duo chip inside from a couple of years ago scored 64-bit: 1184 (single core)/1939 (multicore) and 32-bit: 1094 (single core)/1846 (multicore).<br/><br/>This laptop is good for its price.  I wish it did not have some of the fit-and-finish issues, but otherwise it is great. If you order one, you may not experience or see any of the issues I encountered.<br/><br/>I suppose the best test for this laptop is whether or not my wife likes it with extended use.  So far, she is happy.
I have had several Toshiba Satellite laptops over the last 10 years. I keep going back to this brand because the durability can't be beat, in my experience. I have had issues in the past, particularly with a blown motherboard after a year, and a keyboard in which the "t" and "y" didn't work. While I can't tell at this point how the motherboard is going to hold up, the keyboard is efficient and works beautifully. Love the numeric board on the right side of the keyboard, as I work a lot from home, and a numeric board makes my life so much easier.<br/><br/>To this laptop - love the graphics. The colors are rich and defined. The speed is terrific, with a 1T hard drive. The 8G memory is sufficient for my needs. There are not a lot of bells and whistles - no touch screen, no removable screen for a tablet application, but truly, who needs that? I want a laptop that is a laptop. I have a tablet for those portability needs, not to mention my phone.<br/><br/>The unit is not particularly heavy. I have traveled with it, and taken it with me to work offsite when I have somewhere I have to be. I shove it in a messenger bag, and throw it over my shoulder. (As an aside, I tore tendons in both of my shoulders last winter - ice on the porch, grabbed the doorway, bad move. Because of this, I am sensitive to how much weight I am carrying around, and this laptop doesn't bother me.)<br/><br/>Of course, it is Wi-Fi enabled because this is 2015, and everything is Wi-Fi enabled.<br/><br/>It has an optical drive, which is neat, and largely obsolete. Because I am a little old school, I really appreciate this feature.<br/><br/>The laptop is ready to go, out of the box. Very little time spent setting it up, and getting online.<br/><br/>I hate Windows 8 with all the passion of a thousand fiery suns, so I was delighted when I got the happy news that this OS would be eligible for the Windows 10 upgrade FOR FREE! come August.<br/><br/>Overall, I really like this product a lot. It's easily portable, it doesn't burn your legs as it charges, it does everything I need quickly and without processing glitches. The price is very affordable for what you get. Highly recommend.
Great product until it dies after 3 months. Toshiba claims to have a 1 year warranty, but they don't answer their support 800 number, and that's the only way to get warranty service. So if it dies, like mine did, then you're totally screwed. These days you'd think they would offer support through live chat or email or something, or even an online form, but they don't. After calling at two different times and waiting on hold for a half hour and still not being able to talk to a person, all I can do is strongly recommend you choose a different brand. Their hold message doesn't even give you any hope that somebody will pick up, like "thanks for your patience, there are 2 people in front of you". NOPE! they don't do that. Their complete lack of support is extremely discouraging, and really makes their warranty useless. You can't send it in for repair until you talk to a support person to get an RMA number.
This is the first time I've purchased a computer online and it wasn't a good decision to do that. The functionality on this computer is excellent. There are some design issues I have. The edge of the computer, where you rest your wrists when typing, it sharp! It is a definite corner and it leaves marks on my wrist. I've owned 3 toshibas in a row and I've never had this problem and I didn't think to look for it.<br/>The speakers are not good at all. I don't listen to music on my computer very often as I can cast to my TV with chromecast, but it should be noted that they are not very good.<br/>I'm not very fond of the keyboard keys and how they depress, but that is minor. Still, my previous Toshiba (a 2012) was much more satifying and easier to type. Try a computer out before you buy if you can. The price on this was excellent but I didn't know to even look for these features.
I ordered the Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 based on the three things that I absolutely loved off of first glance - The brushed resin finish, the 8GB RAM, and 1TB Hard Drive. It's never easy for me to just buy a laptop because my wonderful husband always nitpicks the little things about it because of his preference on building over buying. But this one he agreed with me on the fact it would do what I wanted it to and needed it to do, my play thing and gaming device. It boots up quickly, Windows 10 is like XP and 7 have a baby that was a god, and I've got so much space to take up that I'm not worried about lag as I did with my previous laptop. I've used another version of the C55 Satellite before and these particular models are very well made and work very well. I purchased one for my mother, not this model, but another and she loves it. It works well on Windows 10 just like it did on 8. I've had no issues with any of the functionality of my games. I've played League of Legends and a few others from my Steam list on here since I've bought it and all of them I can run on pretty decent settings with no issue in terms of lag or quality of the graphics. It has an Intel Core i5 processor and it works just like it should. This is one of the best laptops I've ever used and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a casual gaming laptop that's not into paying a lot of money to be able to play the games they like on good settings. All in all it's a good buy, even if not for gaming because you've got a lot of space to play around with. It would also work well for a student or in a business setting. The 15.6" size is just right in my opinion because it gives you enough space on the keyboard to have a number pad to your right and be able to keep your wrists where ever you are comfortable with and still be able to his all the keys. I also like how it recognizes the devices I plug in to it quickly like it did with my mouse.
I've only had this laptop for a couple of weeks, but so far I am very happy with purchase. It's fast with the intel core i5 processor. Surfing web is great. Of course having a 1TB HDD is fantastic. Lots of space to store movies, pictures, music, videos....you shouldn't run out of room on this one. I know I won't! I  haven't had a chance to try the video camera yet or DVD drive, but I'm confident they will meet my expectations fine. If your not a heavy gamer and just want a nice easy to use laptop, then this is for you! I'm a former windows 7 user, but windows 8.1 is very easy to use. I honestly don't know what all the hooplas been about with it. I'm not computer savy, so if I can use it anyone can :) I've had no problem with screen resolution. Everything I've watched has been very clear, from movies to youtube videos. Setting PC up took about 10 to 15 minutes and bam...I was online! What is also great about this laptop is that it does NOT have a bunch of pre-installed bloat/spyware. McAfee anti-virus is all that's pre - installed. Toshiba has great products and has been around for many, many years now. I've always been a fan that's why I looked for a Toshiba laptop to purchase. I personally think this is well made, and is a great price. I highly recommend this Laptop.
The short version of pros and cons:<br/>POSITIVES::<br/>**** Thin and light<br/>**** Beautiful display (1376 x 768)<br/>**** Big hard drive (1TB)<br/>**** 8 GB RAM<br/>**** Battery life (supposed)  - I haven’t had it off power enough to know .<br/>**** Numeric keypad: Some computers this size don’t have them.  Keys are smaller.<br/>**** Much speedier than a 5 year old HP, it can handle also handle tough tasks like opening multiple tabs in Firefox at once better than the HP.<br/>**** Bluetooth works nicely, I sent a photo from my phone to the laptop in approx 10 seconds.  Pairing was painless.<br/>**** Connecting a wireless mouse took a bit longer than I expected, but when it did, it added all the extra controls.  I think the delay was due to a network issue we were having not the computer.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/>**** Feels “cheap”. The surface flexes when pressed on, the 5 year old HP is solid, and my work Dell even more so.  The keypad feels cheap when compared to the HP too.  Less material equals lighter weight though. You get a hollow click when you use the mouse buttons.<br/>**** Sharp edges on the outside bottom edge where your arm lays, if you are touch typer.<br/>**** Hard drive speed - only 5400 rpm, 7200 would have been nice.<br/>**** Mouse pad is not as responsive as the 5  year old HP is to a touch.  Taps go ignored at times.  It might also be a learned thing too.<br/><br/>Other:<br/>**** I’ve had problems unmuting my speakers when in Firefox, I’ve found exiting FF, unmuting, then relaunching FF to work.  I don’t know what’s at fault - Firefox, Windows 8, the laptop, or a combination of the 3.<br/><br/>FAST, LIGHT AND EASY TO USE:<br/>Like the average computer user, I’m not an expert in laptop speeds whatever.  But, I do know what I like in equipment.  Fast, light and easy to use.<br/>This laptop seems all that.  First of all, this is my first foray into Windows 8 and it’s a little confusing at first, but I’m glad it’s the 8.1.  I’ve used Windows 8 on my daughter’s Surface tablet and was exposed to this style GUI on a Window’s phone as well.  So I’m hoping Windows 8 will not influence this review.  I know the later Windows 8 made accommodations to Windows 7 users, so I should be okay.<br/><br/>OUT OF THE BOX AND SETUP:<br/>The lightness of this laptop struck me out of the box and put next to another computer (a ~5 year older HP) it is ½ the thickness of the older computer.  Looking at the finish it is a flat brushed black, and that also makes it look unique.The textured area around the keyboard gives it a pleasant feel, compared to the shiny ones that most laptops have.  Sometimes in warm weather my bare arms would stick on other laptop surfaces. The only negative there is the edges around the outside edge of the laptop felt a bit sharp.  Imagine sitting at a table and if you are like me, your wrists scrape across this area a lot when type (touch-typing, not hen-pecking).<br/>Start up and set up were smooth and quick. Each new computer I get does this faster and easier.  One thing that struck me odd, was that this was the first computer that did not stress creating recovery disks during setup.  Mind you, it is in the quick start guide step 3. Does anyone but me read those though? Mind you, since Windows XP, I don’t think I have used my recovery disks on any computer.  We keep our virus checkers up to date and today’s computers are a lot more stable.<br/>One of Toshiba’s advantages is that this computer does not have a whole bunch of added software.  Years ago that might have been a disadvantage, but now, many of us have our email online and our applications as well.<br/><br/>USAGE:<br/>So far, after more than a few weeks of shared usage (my boyfriend and me), we have combined notes and feel this is a pretty good deal.  He likes Firefox and I like Chrome.  Both work well.  I like a separate mouse at times and he always uses the touch pad.  Both work okay.  He indicated the touch pad sometimes was not as responsive as he liked, but this might be a carryover from his laptop.  Time could change that.  I will update if it doesn’t.<br/><br/>The one thing I didn’t like was Microsoft related.  Windows 8 has all these handy things on the start screen: Mail, Calendar, etc. and to really use any of those effectively you need to use a Microsoft account.  Mind you, this can be set up with a non-Microsoft address, but it is not so easy to figure out.  Since my primary email is Yahoo and Roadrunner and my calendar and shared documents are Google, this gets complicated really fast.  I like the way my Android phone does this a whole lot better.<br/><br/>Some spec comparisons between this and a Dell Inspiron 15-5000 at a similar price<br/><br/>TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240<br/>**** 5th Generation Intel Core i5-5200U 2.2 GHz Processor<br/>DELL INSPIRON 15-5000<br/>**** 5th Generation Intel® Core™ i5-5200U Processor<br/><br/>TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240<br/>**** 8 GB DIMM RAM<br/>DELL INSPIRON 15-5000<br/>**** 8GB 2 DIMM (2x4GB) DDR3L 1600Mhz<br/><br/>TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240<br/>**** 1 TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive<br/>DELL INSPIRON 15-5000<br/>**** 1TB 5400 rpm SATA Hard Drive<br/><br/>TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240<br/>**** 15.6-Inch Screen; (1366 x 768)<br/>DELL INSPIRON 15-5000<br/>**** 15.6 inch LED Backlit Display (1376 x 768)<br/><br/>TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240<br/>**** Size: 10.20 x 14.96 x 0.93 inches; Weight: 4.8 lbs<br/>DELL INSPIRON 15-5000<br/>**** Size: 10.0” x 14.9” x 0.9” inches: Weight 5.24 lbs<br/><br/>TOSHIBA SATELLITE C55-C5240<br/>**** (2)USB 3.0 and (1)USB 2.0<br/>**** (1) SD card slot<br/>**** (1)HDMI output<br/>**** (1)Ethernet<br/>**** (1)high-speed Wireless-N connectivity<br/>**** (1)with Bluetooth<br/>DELL INSPIRON 15-5000<br/>**** (2)USB 3.0 and (1)USB 2.0<br/>**** (1)Media Card (SD, SDHC, SD3.0, MS, MS Pro)<br/>**** (1)HDMI™ 1.4a<br/>**** (1)10/100 RJ-45 Ethernet network<br/>**** Security slot
I purchased 4 of these laptops for the office.<br/><br/>The keyboard layout uses chicklet style keys. These keys are small and spaced out. After many years of using more traditional keyboards, I found it very hard to type without constantly missing keys and having to retype my words. This significantly slowed me down on my work. I recommend using a wireless mouse.<br/><br/>The trackpad I also found to be a bit on the small side. As well as the buttons for the track pad. I found it difficult to use multi-touch. It rarely recognized my commands like, scroll, pinch and zoom, etc. Again, using this trackpad for your mouse is a hassle. Get a wireless mouse.<br/><br/>The display is big, but brightness lacks a bit. Not very good in very bright environments.<br/><br/>Design, looks good in the pictures on the site. But in person this laptop looks plasticy and cheap.<br/><br/>Lastly, the specs are great on paper but in use the laptop constantly hung on me while trying to install programs and getting it setup for office use. I was installing Microsoft Office and some pdf programs. Manufacturer responded to me and said possibly the computer was doing updates in the background. I suppose that's possible since I had just turned it on.<br/><br/>I did like the size of the power adapter. It's very small.<br/><br/>Overall not a terrible or unusable computer, specially considering the price. But everyone else raved about it so I wanted to share some faults I found with it so you can make your own decision.
Well, I give this laptop and 5 Stars, but I feel like I just got ripped off. Let me start by saying this Laptop (C55-C5241) is out standing! It deserves 5 Stars easy.  I began to look for my Official Windows 10 Product sticker that should be on the bottom of the laptop (and was NOT) to prove YOU own a Genuine copy of that operating system and that it contains a valid product KEY in the event you need to wipe your hard drive clean due to system failure (Virus / Spyware / Malware) or if your HDD (Hard Disk Drive) stop working (Crashes) all together and you must replace your hard drive. You will need YOUR Official Windows 10 Product KEY in order to reinstall Windows 10, or for that matter any Windows operating system on that new or cleaned hard drive. It does not matter if there is a back up copy of you operating system on the hard drive or not. With out that Product Key and the hard drive is not working properly or is dead, Your out of luck! On a lighter note: You can upgrade from 8 gigs to 16 gigs and You can upgrade to a SSD (Solid State Drive) that makes this baby really fast! Lastly, Please make sure you install and are running a GOOD anti-Virus program before you catch something bad. Take it from someone with over 35 years of experience. Thanks for reading.
I'm so disappointed about this product. After a few hours using, just played some Youtube videos and open some browser tabs, it showed up the blue screen and tried to restart. The problem is: after that it showed the blue screens a few more times and the hard disk sounded like there was something heavily run at the background. I have no idea, just want to return it back.
This is the third Toshiba Satellite Laptop I have owned.  I don't have any particular brand loyalty when it comes to Windows PCs but it says something that twice before when I had an occasion to buy a new laptop I found that Toshiba had the best price point for the features that were important to me.  I bought two of them in 2009 a few months apart (one for my son in college and one for my use for a moonlighting job I was doing).  Back then the sweet spot was $500 for 4GB RAM, 500GB hard drive, and the wide screen.  Both of those laptops have been real workhorses for us and are still in use today.<br/><br/> This newer Satellite model is the clear descendant of those 6-year-old machines.  For a little more money you now get twice the RAM, twice the hard drive space, and a slightly faster CPU (according to cpuboss.com - I found it surprising that the newer i5 5200U is not significantly more powerful than the older T4300).<br/><br/>A characteristic of the Satellite product line is that they are much wider than other laptops - they are also quite heavy compared to the much more expensive laptops like the Toshiba Protege series (of which I have three at my day job).  This is a good, inexpensive laptop if mobility is not that important to you, but I wouldn't want to lug this around Europe on vacation, for example.<br/><br/>Similarly, the display is good for the price but it's nothing like you can get with a more expensive laptop these days.  I gave my wife a Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 "Ultrabook" for Christmas a couple of years ago and the display screen on that computer blows me away every time I see it, but it cost at least twice as much as a Toshiba Satellite.<br/><br/>This one came pre-installed with Windows 10 - getting it up and running was a bit of an adventure - to make a long story short, I made the mistake of trying to create an initial account for my son using his email address but skipping the step to use his Microsoft account (the setup instructions allow for this), thinking that he could do that later.  I think because I did this and because his email address was already known to Microsoft, I could not log in to the account I created (the only account on the machine), which necessitated the first of four calls to Toshiba customer service in the course of the first 24 hours.  Toshiba customer service was prompt and responsive, but the process of the restoring the hard drive to its original state literally took overnight (just so you know, you can wipe the hard drive on this laptop by holding the "0" (zero) key down while powering it up).  Windows 10 is so new that the first customer service rep I spoke to was convinced this would restore it to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 even though I kept telling him it was not an upgrade.  The first attempt to restore the OS to its factory state took so long that I power-cycled the machine, thinking it was hung.  A call to Toshiba literally at midnight (Saturday night) convinced me to try again but to let it finish, which is what I did.
Within three days of the product's purchase, all of the Wi-Fi and Internet connectivity dropped out. After extensive troubleshooting and efforts to get connected, I called Toshiba support. Their solution was to uninstall the network drivers and re-boot the computer. That solution worked initially, but no longer than 48 hours and I went to that process several times. After three more conductivity failures so I could not get to the Internet, I spent the interminable time with Toshiba support  voice messaging systems before I could ever talk to a live human being. Toshiba's response was the Wi-Fi card is bad and your only option is to return the computer with all of your personal and private information on it to the seller, because Toshiba has no provisions to repair or replace the Wi-Fi card in this computer.
Main issue is the sharpness of the edges on the laptop. As others have mentioned, the edges are preeeeetty sharp. They're definitely sharp enough to be uncomfortable, and while Toshiba has replied to another review stating that no part of the computer should be sharp enough to cut a user, I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if someone received minor cuts from average use. My wrists are sore and have visible marks after typing this short review (I'm not exaggerating whatsoever). Believe it or not, the attached picture is from typing this comment. It's not a cut, but it just shows how uncomfortable typing on this thing, even for short periods of time, can be.<br/><br/>I will likely return this laptop because of the sharpness issue alone.
I brought this computer mainly to use for studying purposes and overall I am satisfied.  I have a desktop that will continue to handle all the heavy lifting programs I use.  It was super easy to sync my files between my desktop, this laptop and my windows phone.  The keyboard types smoothly and the trackpad is responsive.  The Wi-Fi works perfectly and I have had no internet connection problems.<br/><br/>- Cons<br/>The edge of the laptop has a really severe angle and it will dig into you palms (when using the trackpad in your lap) and occasionally your wrists when typing from all use positions (might complain about this more in the summer when I don't have long sleeves on).  You have to be consciously aware of your resting positions and adjust accordingly.  Or get a waist pad.<br/><br/>When I first turned on the computer, I was a little taken aback by the resolution quality; I could clearly see each individual pixel, but I no longer notice it.  Again, I didn't buy this computer for graphics.  I am also smart enough to know, unlike some of the other reviewers, that the screen quality isn't supposed to be as good as say a mac.<br/><br/>From some angles, the finish does a good job at hiding smudge marks, but from other angles, the smudge marks are all you see.  Maybe my fingers are just to oily but idk.
I like this Toshiba a lot, so much so that I may start using it instead of a year old 17 inch Dell laptop with Windows 8.1. Since I am so pleased with the Toshiba, I couldn't understand the many one and two star ratings. After reading many of those low ratings, I realized that many of those lower ratings are for an earlier model of the Toshiba, one with Windows 8.  So for whatever reason, this listing is a mix of reviews for essentially two different models. Maybe more.<br/><br/>My experience so far:<br/><br/>Set up was a breeze. I just plugged in the laptop and started using it, first sharing some information with Toshiba and registering the computer.<br/>Documentation is sparse. On the computer is an extensive electronic owner's manual which isn't much help if your computer isn't working.  That once happened to me on the Dell, but luckily I had another computer for accessing the needed information.<br/><br/>I like Windows 10 quite a bit, and there's even a little bit of help with Windows 10 on the Toshiba. Eventually I may have to get a Windows 10 book or start watching some Windows 10 help videos on YouTube, but I've been figuring things out so far and like the design of Windows 10 quite a bit. This is coming from someone who doesn't like change.<br/><br/>For whatever reasons, this computer is very fast, much faster than my Dell whether I'm just using the internet or writing reviews. Pictures and sights load very fast. When watching videos on Netflix and YouTube there's never any hesitation or spinning circles on the screen.<br/>Speaking of the screen, I have no complaints about the picture quality of the screen whatsoever for viewing movies or editing photographs.<br/><br/>Cortana is a great feature. It's fun to ask her silly questions, and it is so convenient to ask her to find something for me on the computer and then open it for me. If I want to got to the Ebay site, for example, I tell Cortana and Ebay comes right up.<br/><br/>The 8 G of memory and the one terabyte hard drive are more than enough for me - with a hard drive massive enough to hold all of the photographs I've taken and will take.<br/>With Windows 10 there's a way to sync my phone and laptop and be able to easily share files between the two.  I started the process but then decided it was too convoluted for me and quit the set up halfway through. Maybe later I'll give it another shot, but at the moment I don't have a need for that feature.<br/>Some have complained about the keyboard, but I like the feel and look of it, especially having the number pad on the right as is found on 17 inch laptops.<br/>Not much bloatware on this laptop at all. Many of the computers I've had and have currently came with lots of unnecessary stuff that can be tedious to remove. This Toshiba has the bare necessities.<br/>I've read that this is not a gaming machine, something that doesn't affect me at all. The simple games I've played on this computer have been flawless. For a casual gamer , this computer is probably fine.<br/><br/>Sound - It's not amazing sound but good enough to enjoy listening to music or watching movies. True audiophiles most likely will hook up bluetooth speakers anyway.<br/><br/>Aesthetics and form - This model weighs 4.82 pounds so is easy to carry about or set on your lap. The case is plastic and the two near corners are rough and should have been rounded for looks and convenience. I like the looks of the brushed look on the black case, but do have a problem with fingerprints, even on the black.<br/>If you are looking for a reasonably priced laptop with a huge hard drive, then certainly consider this Toshiba. And don't be put off by the new Windows 10. It's actually a good upgrade.
I've only had this for a day now so will provide an update later, but so far it is super fast and I've only had one problem (with the firewall, easily solved with a little googling) and I was surprised at how easy the setup was.<br/>My last computer was also a Toshiba Satellite that I got 3 years ago, and I had ALL kinds of problems with drivers at first; even the mouse needed to be updated when I first turned it on, and had to be done with an external mouse. Also the speakers were way too quiet--these are VERY loud and they sound good! The screen resolution could be better, but at this price I'm happy with it. It is true, as some other reviewers said, that the edge is sharp, but your wrists shouldn't actually be touching it unless you're typing from below somehow. The keyboard is wonderful. Another thing--the other one came bloated with all of these programs and icons. This version had just one icon on the desktop--the recycle bin--and not too any programs.<br/>The only thing I don't like: the mouse under the touch pad. I feel like I have to press way too hard to get it to click. That could get annoying.<br/>I had the IT guy look at this and a $640 computer for me and he said the features were basically identical--happy I went with this one!!
Received this laptop on Friday and I am thoroughly satisfied.  Some things I have read about this model is the sharp edges... yes it has sharp edges...but not sharp enough to cut you, but might be annoying sometime in the future.  One annoyance that I will need to get used to is the SPACE bar.  Its smaller than a lot of other laptops and on the edges it doesn't register all the time.  I will need to get used to hitting the SPACE bar more in the center.  All in all, I am very pleases with the computer.  And Windows 10 is more user friendly than 7 or 8... but I will need to get used to where things are located.
Sleek lightweight notebook that packs a lot of power for the money. I have not seen a lot of Core i5 laptops with 8GB of memory for $450. This one has a powerful CPU, looks decent and is not very heavy. 8GB memory = you can open more apps simultaneously. Most importantly there are *NO* nagging adware garbage apps pre-loaded on this laptop. Those are painful, can slow things down and take forever to get rid of. I don't expect to ever fill up the 1TB hard drive even with all the high resolution pics from my smartphone.
I've had this laptop for almost 6 months now, and my computer knowledge/experience is expert level.<br/><br/>Overall it's decent, and I haven't had any major problems with it. However, there is one thing that drives me crazy with this laptop, and would make me NOT buy it or another like it. The spacebar has has a dead area on the sides, and needs to be hit pretty hard to get a space. I'll write the rest of this review without correcting my spacing and you'll see.<br/><br/>The rest of the keys also dont seem very responsiveand it's extremelyfrustrating whentrying to type long messages or write papers, etc. Also, and this ismost likely a windows10 problem, but the random devices just stop working. The other day the sound wasn't working,and when Iwent to check it windows said the device wasn't installed. A restart fixed it though.The other issue is that the touchpad has stopped working,and Ihaven't been able to get itfixed yet. Not sure if it's a driver issue yet or the actual hardware.<br/><br/>For the money I'drecommend someother laptop.I had an HP that was better, but the plug for the power cord broke when someone walkedinto it and bent it. Anyway, seeall those missed spaces! So annoying!
It's slim, fast, good keyboard with decently big keys and even numeric pad.<br/>The battery can provide around 5.5 hours while browsing the Internet. Tested it twice since buying. It's definitely long-lasting for me.<br/>The screen is wide and have little color degradation when viewed from sides for ordinary LCD. Good for watching movies and coding.<br/>Windows 10 is OK. I've had used win 7 for a long time and this one while got some nice additions<br/>is seemed less configurable to me, but in general it is OK.<br/>Still didn't find any means to restore windows to "factory settings" if it is broken beyond repair.<br/>Wi-Fi connecting very well, the speed is high. HD is big enough for storing good amount of data like photos, music or movies while on the trip.<br/>The sound quality of internal speakers is not amazing like expected, but either is not bad. Just ordinary.<br/>And the price tag is a lot less than similar looking competition. Clearly a bargain.
I hope I can update this review later because I had to return it due to a combination of shipping damage and or slight factory defect on the inside of the screen. I've read lots of reviews for this and haven't seen any mention of screen imperfections so it's just my bad luck. I recommend you test your screen out by using the screensaver etc to turn it completely white, black, and so on. The mark was hidden by the giant tree and would get worse the lighter the color of the background or open texts etc. It didn't interfere with reading text though.<br/><br/>The screen looks ok/big enough for me even after using my fancy LG 24". You can see the difference though, but a youtube 720p full screen clip of Conan was fine. The hard drive is ok but slower than I'm used to, I plan on using an external HDD through USB 3.0, then getting a SSD. The CPU is good and passed the Intel tests. RAM had no errors. The keyboard seems fine but I'll update more after I have more time with the replacement laptop. I like mice more than trackpads so no comment other than it worked, I'd get a tiny mouse with a wheel. The speakers are ok, I haven't tested enough but I hope I can lower the treble. The wireless worked fine after updating Win10 and drivers, passwords, etc. The DVD slot looks fragile compared to my desktop (my 1st laptop) but it works fine, I burned a lot of Macrium Image Win10 backups etc and they verified without errors. The nubs in the center of the dvd tray (that hold the DVD in) are a little scary but it seemed best to start from 1 nub then push it down over the last 2. I didn't bleed to death on the 'sharp' side of the laptop, remove the tiny tape and it's ok, and you could always carefully dull the edge after asking an expert.<br/><br/>Win10. I went from XP Pro to this and it wasn't a hard adjustment. But it is Windows so I'd recommend (very carefully) uninstalling junk, turning off useless (to you) services and 'decorations', checking what's in startup, making BACKUPS and system restore points before it all, etc. I read enough reviews of some of the programs Toshiba installed so I ended up deleting most, like $ office, video player, and mcaffee. It starts up about 20-30 seconds faster now but could probably be improved. I hear Win10's antivirus and firewall are ok. I'm glad I could shrink the icons because the taskbar took up too much space for me. The laptop will probably beep at you if you talk to yourself, not sure if it's Cortana or MS letting me know they're spying on me ;) but I assume pushing a button turned it off.<br/><br/>I recommend getting these freeware programs. CCleaner, Defraggler, Intel processor diagnostic tool 64bit, Macrium reflect free, Firefox, Tweaking.com registry backup.<br/><br/>I am impressed with how quickly Amazon handled the return, I didn't expect them to ship me the replacement before I returned the old one but this is good because it'll allow me to "clone" or use an image of all my changes/installs and put it on the replacement.
Bought two of these, one for me and one for the husband after he saw mine.  Excellent value for the price and came with windows 10.  We were both running old vista machines (mine an old HP that died and his an old Toshiba that's still going strong) and we thought it best to just jump into 10 instead of dealing with an upgrade from 7 or 8.  That was an excellent decision as it turns out.  Getting this baby up and running was about as easy as it gets.  In the past I've always had someone else get my new computers up and ready for use but this time we did a lot of homework and decided we'd do it ourselves.  A little web research made a world of difference and we got both machines up and running very easily.  Making restore flash drive was simple, working through first-time set up was simple.  Shutting off all the privacy settings we deemed instrusive was simple.<br/><br/>This new Toshiba does not have the build of older machines as many reviewers have stated but for us that's not an issue.  We're not taking either of them anywhere.  A lot of reviewers have complained about sharp edges but I discovered that once the dark green transparent tape was removed from around the bottom edge of the machine, the edges were fine.  But if you don't get that tape off it can be really uncomfortable to type.  It's hard to see but it' there and will just peel off with some patience.  I've been touch-typing for over 40 years on all kinds of keyboards so getting used to this one was easy.  It doesn't have the feel of a heftier machine but it responds well and does the job.  On arrival, everything worked correctly and<br/>one month into use everything still works.<br/><br/>I suggest that on set-up you update all your drivers.  Don't rely on auto updates for this.  Go through all your devices manually and search for driver updates and you'll find a lot of them out there.  I had some speaker issues (as another reviewer mentioned) and getting the newest drivers for the software has fixed that.<br/><br/>Neither of us really like using the touchpad so we both got inexpensive Tecknet Bluetooth mice and they run perfectly on this machine.<br/><br/>All in all, for $450.00 this machine offers great utility and value and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs something for middle of the road home use.  I would not recommend it as a machine suitable for daily portability, however, since the build just doesn't seem conducive to that.
I am going to start out by saying that I LOVE one thing with this computer.... it features Windows 10. Not that I am 100% sold that Windows 10 is a great operating system, BUT I will say that Windown 8 (and 8.1) were awful. Anything that improves on Window 8 is a major upgrade in my book. However, I don't want to turn this into a review about Windows. Just be happy that this laptop comes with Windows 10 preinstalled.<br/><br/>As for the Toshiba laptop specifically it a pretty cool device. It is only marginally larger and heavier than our ACER Chromebook, but this Toshiba has a much better processor and comes installed with 8 gigs of RAM. That makes it a pretty click option for a highly portable all-in-one device. In fact, this Toshiba checks in at a price lower than most iPads (despite having 1 TB of memory, an optical drive, a SD port, and a full processor).<br/><br/>Pros-<br/><br/>+ Plenty of power for most people. While you may find it a bit slow for many video games, or any graphics intensive software, but that is the case for most computers that do not have a dedicated graphics card (and the price tag that comes with it)<br/><br/>+ Very light and with a thin profile - again, it really isn't much larger than our chromebook<br/><br/>+ 1 TB of memory - I thought that was a misprint. I know the price of memory has come down quite a bit, but 1TB on a laptop at this price point seems .... awesome.<br/><br/>+ Bright screen - you can find a sharper screen, but for most of us... who cares?<br/><br/>+ Wifi works well - plenty strong and seems to process quickly<br/><br/>Negative<br/><br/>- One major negative , and I am taking off 1 1/2 stars for this - the edges of the computer are SHARP! In fact, the corners are not rounded or beveled and actually feels like it is cutting into skin. For this reason alone I would recommend that you try out this laptop prior to purchasing. For me it is an unbelievably bad design oversight. The whole laptop skin feels sharp and uncomfortable<br/><br/>-Comes with McAffee instead of Norton. Why is this a disadvantage? it might not be for you, but for me McAfee seems much more intrusive and annoying.<br/><br/>Final verdict- This Toshiba laptop certainly is an excellent value, and I am shocked at the features that they are able to fit into such a small package (I mean it really has a DVD drive!). However, the super sharp edges and corners can really make it uncomfortable to use ... this problem goes away with a docking station, but for me the Toshiba's portability was one its top features.<br/><br/>3 1/2 Stars
terrible  freezes up slow cant connect to internet
I've had this laptop for about 3 months now. Best purchase ever.<br/>Pros:<br/>Comes with Windows 10<br/>So much space.<br/>Great gaming Laptop<br/>When streaming or watching videos looks fantastic<br/>Camera works wonderful as well.<br/>Sound can go extremely loud.<br/>Easy Set Up<br/>Great Battery life<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Only problem is when you chat with someone just using the laptop the mic don't pick up all that well.<br/><br/>Over all 5/5
I'm having the same problems as has been reported by other reviewers here.  Right off the bat the system is extremely slow.  Problems with the synaptics touchpad driver.  Get error message as follows:  "Control panel extension is incompatible with driver version" when trying to access certain settings.  When using the touchpad, and right-clicking a menu, then I move the mouse pointer on top of the menu, it disappears constantly. Problem goes away when I connect an external USB mouse.<br/><br/>All in all a terrible out of the box experience.  I recommended this system to three other family members based on the specs and some other reviews (I am the go-to computer guy in our family and for many friends) and now I am regretting my recommendation.  I will give this a little more work (making absolutely certain that there are no other updated drivers I can still install, etc.)  but then will be returning this if I don't see some improvement.
Do not buy!  I have purchased this product and had nothing but problems.  I have contacted Toshiba and they told me it's a software problem and I have to 1) purchase their software help (annual fee) for assistance or contact Microsoft if it's not related to the actual computer even though the software came with the laptop.  Now...I am getting critical error message with...start menu and cortana aren't working.  We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in...message but I am forced to sign out and sign back in but same message.  I have tried to contact Toshiba again and I am getting the go around.  I will return this product and never purchase Toshiba product again.  I should have stuck with HP.
It's got really good hardware for the price but they must have saved on the chasis.  It's kind of a cheap flimsy plastic but, it's got way better components that competing laptops at the same pricepoint so I guess you need to pick what's more important to you.  Also, did not come with a MS sticker with serial #, but maybe that's the norm now.
Ordered this Lap-top by way of PRE-ORDER, It was shipped in the middle of Aug. And arrived , Intact, Fully Charged [LI-ION Battery ] ad Microsoft added the Windows 10 already installed.<br/>I've been using it every day and wish I could afford another one for my wife And my sister.<br/>My First laptop and I'll be coming back.
** Edit. The performance of this machine is great, but I've struggled for too many days trying to type efficiently on this with it just seeming to get increasingly more difficult to type - It's started taking me about 3 times as long to type a sentence from having to go back and correct spacing and missing letter errors.<br/><br/>I’ve only owned the C55-C for a day now, but so far it is an awesome machine.<br/> As other reviews mention, it is plastic, mucho plastic, but it is also very sturdy and there is no unnecessary give. The wood grain look also keeps it from looking cheap, so as far as plastic cases go, I give it a 4/5 plastic rating. The edges of the machine are sharp, but will not cut you, only leave indentations. Once the computer continues to work for a few days I will take something to dull it, which should be easy since it’s plastic.<br/>The screen is much better than what others have said, the viewing angles are good (for not being IPS), the colors are distinguishable, and the contrast is great. For me the resolution is just fine – the last laptop I had was 1080p, but I can honestly say I don’t miss it.<br/>The touchpad is excellent – big and perfectly responsive. Plus, it actually has buttons, which is spoiling me since many of the laptops I’ve recently had have had no independent buttons. The keyboard is also very good with one exception – the space bar. Key travel,  spacing, and placement are all very easy to work with, however the spacebar is stubby and you have to make sure you really press it unless you’re pressing the very left side, which might not be a problem if I typed correctly, but I have my own style of four-finger typing, so I’m having to train my thumbs. Overall l, the keyboard does not make me dislike this fella one little bit, just that I must evolve.<br/>It’s difficult for me to attest to the performance of the base machine, because I never booted into Windows before upgrading the hard drive to a SSD. For me it rocks through tasks, opens webpages in a an instant, plays a few older games at Ultra High settings, boots in 45 seconds or less (All of my machines with SSDs boot about 3 times slower with Win10 than when I had 8.1 installed), and resumes from sleep in what seems like less than a second. It scored 745 in Novabench benchmarking.  I’ve gotten a solid 6+ hours in the last day off a charge. I left my charger at home on 60% charge and made it through 4 hours at school with 8% left.
This is my family's fourth new computer this year. It happens to be our most reliable, too!<br/><br/>Pro<br/> -Excellent battery life<br/> -Despite moving parts, this laptop doesn't get too hot to put on my lap in shorts (big deal to me)<br/> -Very lightweight and thin<br/> -Touchpad has separate buttons (these new ones with buttons built in do not work easily)<br/><br/>Cons<br/> -Microphone and headphones share a jack.<br/> -Wi-fi is not good. Hard to say if it's "bad" but I can tell you this laptop gets kicked off the internet much more frequently than any other we own.<br/> -No free software (unless you get the trial, and even then it's only free if you're new.)<br/><br/>I purchased a similar laptop shortly before this - same size, same memory, same hard drive, same OS, HDMI and USB ports, and webcams. Here's what I found when comparing the two.<br/><br/>#1: The intel processor is much more reliable (other laptop has AMD A8-5545 and it DIED after 60 days)<br/>#2: I miss having a backlit keyboard and a touchscreen. It's quite nice to have the TS with Windows 10... it's worth the $$ I say<br/>#3: This Toshiba only has a DVD drive, and CD's are still cheaper to buy.<br/>#4: The volume on the Toshiba is pretty quiet. I need speakers to hear about half the time (when watching a CNN news story or something.)<br/>#5: The Toshiba, despite the same basic moving parts, RUNS quieter -- and DOESN'T GET TOO HOT. The competitions laptop even has a special "cooling technology" that does't work very well.<br/>#6: The product details tell me the graphics on my other computer are better. Couldn't prove it by me.<br/><br/>My final assessment rests on cost: While there are some things I really would like to have in a laptop (backlit keys, cd/dvd drive)  when considering the cost difference - TOSHIBA IS ABOUT $150 cheaper - what is important to you? I'd rather spend less $$ and not get the backlit keyboard and disc drive I like in order to get a more reliable hard drive... if my internet weren't so bad. But because my internet IS nothing short of terrible, this laptop would not be the laptop of choice.<br/><br/>True story - the internet/cable devils are digging up my yard this very month to get us new cables. Hoping this laptop won't cut in and out so often. Will advise if that problem doesn't correct itself.
Revision:  I purchased three of these laptops and two went bad. The first one I received is still running as expected.  The second one had faulty hardware; it sounded like the hard drive was grinding itself to death, so I returned it for a replacement.  After 35 days of use the replacement  completely stopped responding.  It would freeze at the login screen.<br/><br/>I advise against purchasing this model.<br/><br/>Note:  Amazon is refunding me for the purchase. Their customer service is really good.
Had a software failure on setup.  That's a big red flag for me.  Also, the keyboard didn't register every keystroke, which drove me nuts, and the mouse button configuration made it difficult to use.  I used this computer for less than an hour before deciding to return it.  Never bought a Toshiba before, and I won't again.
Ordered this the other day and it arrived today.  Spent several hours getting it set up for how I want to use it.  Then tonight, I was surfing the internet, chatting on a fan site about the football game I was watching, and it just went FUBAR.<br/><br/>There was a process running called System Interrupts, which for no reason was consuming 20% of the CPU.  I figured let me reboot and see if that helps.  So I rebooted and now the computer is bricked.  This machine is defective, which is completely unacceptable for a laptop that I received today and why my 1-star rating.<br/><br/>Hopefully, the next one will not have any problems, but now I have to wait another 2 days to get the machine and waste another several hours of my time setting the next one up, which is also not acceptable.  I would recommend staying away from this machine at this point in time.<br/><br/>I will report back and perhaps revise my review once the next machine arrives on Tuesday.  Very frustrated and angry about this.  I have been thru many desk tops and laptops in my life and never had a problem on day 1.<br/><br/>UPDATE: OK so the new laptop finally arrived and it's working so far.  I wish I could completely disable the touch pad (there is only an option to change the touchpad delay).  I always use a regular mouse, so all the touchpad does is get in the way and sometimes jump the cursor to another part of the screen if I hit it by accident.<br/><br/>Also noticed that the little bumps on the F and J keys that are put there so you know your fingers are aligned properly aren't very prominent, so you hardly notice them.  I can live with that though.<br/><br/>I have not uninstalled McAfee yet, but I hate that program to death.  It's the #1 memory usage because of the active scanner (scans every file that you access in real time, though I have not noticed a slow down in the PC.)  Cortana is a program that will not allow you to disable it.  You can go in the settings and click disable, but it will not stop running in your processes.  And if you right click and say end program, it comes back within seconds.  I don't need a digital assistant.  If I want something, I'll pull it up myself.<br/><br/>Other than that, it works fine for what I wanted it to work for, but since the first machine bricked on day 1, I am leaving this as a 1-star review.
This laptop is replacing a 6 year old Toshiba Satellite running Windows Vista.  I have migrated my data over and installed my programs with no issues with this laptop.  So far everything has worked fine.<br/><br/>Comparing it to my old Satellite, which had  3 GB of memory and an AMD processor, I would say that it is at least 3x as fast.  I like the keyboard a lot better too.  It seems more ergonomic and I don't hit the wrong key or touch pad by mistake as often as I did on the old laptop.  Given that I rarely do anything heavy duty with the laptop, I think that it is way more than I need.<br/><br/>Price wise, this system is hard to beat.  The processor is a new Intel model released at the beginning of 2015.  It is a core i5 which is their upper midrange processor.  The amount of memory is sufficient to run a lot of programs at the same time.  I know that because my Dell core i5 work laptop has 8 GB of memory and I run a ton of stuff on it. With respect to the disk size, I would say that there is no chance that I will ever fill it up.  I haven't filled a disk drive since the mid 90's.  Looking at the sales in the Sunday paper, I see a Satellite L55t with 15.6" display, core i3 processor, 1 TB drive and 6 GB memory for $479.99.<br/><br/>I have no comments on battery usage yet other than I am on battery while I am writing this and with the default settings I see the display just fine.  The battery icon reports 9 hrs 35 minutes of battery left (95% remaining) but I doubt that could be true. I have been running on battery for about 10 minutes.
Came quickly and am impressed with this laptop. Can't beat a fifth generation core i5 processor, 8 GB ram, and a 1tb hard drive for this price.<br/>The brushed metal looks really nice and while it does pick up some fingerprints, it's not nearly as bad as my previous laptop which was glossy black.<br/>I really like that there is a 3.0 USB plug and that this laptop has bluetooth connectivity built in. I'm not a huge fan of windows 8.1 but windows 10 is coming out soon and this computer will be upgraded for free. There is minimal bloatware on this machine which is really nice.<br/><br/>Toshiba builds good computers and this one really is an awesome deal considering the look and performance of this computer.
I thought people were silly complaining about sharp edges. Although there are some exaggerations out there, when typing on an uneven surface (your lap while you lay down and watch TV as I am doing) you can really feel the edges of the laptop digging into your wrists. Overall this is an excellent system. No issues to report after a month or so of use and doubt I will have any issues in the future. If you can't tolerate a little discomfort while typing (only when your wrists are hanging on the edges due to "improper" use) then you won't like this system. If you can get passed that minor flaw you'll enjoy a light weight system with a large display. I wish it were touch screen and I wish the keyboard lit up :( Hope this helps.
I started setting it up a couple of days after delivery. It wouldn't connect to the internet. Not having the time to mess with it I stuck it back in its box for a couple of weeks. I took it out and tried all of the tricks I knew to get a connection, nothing. I searched blogs for an answer and found several people who were having the same problem with the same model.  I found one answer that involved removing the battery (which required a trip to a hardware store to find a screwdriver small enough to open the battery box) and holding the power button down for a minute, then reassembling and powering up. Voila, I could connect.<br/>The next morning when I turned it on all I could get was an error message that said it had not powered up correctly. This was followed by a menu of solutions that, when checked, led back to the same error message. I rebooted and a message came up saying I needed to reinstall windows 10. That took awhile, but I was able to get online eventually. Now about every other search I do leads to a message that the page can't be found.<br/>I am thinking about calling a priest, because the zoom is constantly, inexplicably going up and down even when I'm not touching the computer and airplane mode switches on without prompt.<br/>I am also suffering the scavenger hunt for tools, etc. that I go through every time Windows changes versions. Each change is less friendly than the<br/>one before it.
Died two weeks after I got it and had to replace it
I was very hesitant about buying this laptop for 450.00.  All I was looking for was a computer that I could travel with...email, browse and write.  At work I use two 27 inch screen computers that can handle anything.  I knew I didn't want to spend that kind of money.  So I researched.  I knew exactly what I was getting when I bought this, however the reviews scared me and I had low expectations when the computer arrived.  Infact, I had already figured out that I was going to return in.<br/>NO NEED!  This computer is great for what I want to do...surf, email and write.  I could not ask for a better computer at the cost.  I have only had it a few days but it has been wonderful.  I will download a few apps, but other than that it is what it is.  I am so glad that I bought this.  I think this computer is for someone who does light computer work.  It is perfect.  If you are self employed this computer is perfect for doing your finances as long as you download excel and the programs you need.  If you are looking for something that is for the corporate world, skip.  This is perfect for a person pleasure computer.
Decent Laptop, initial set up was a little bit of chore but afterwards it became a laptop that blew me away compared to laptops I have seen that are not gaming and laptops I have had in the past.  The only flaw with this is, at least for me, I could have received a bad egg.  The wireless card is horrible! Sadly it does not pick up a 5ghz connection nor while I am practically sitting next to the router is the signal that strong nor is the connection that fast at all! If you are not going to be using a faster internet connection of 5-10mbps this laptop would be a 5 star,
First, let me say that TECHarvard, provided outstanding service. Laptop was received an excellent condition. But for me, more important, was the speed in which the package arrived. Expected arrival was 8/14/15. I received it on 8/10/15. I was like a kid at Christmas. What a nice surprise.<br/><br/>Now the Toshiba Laptop.<br/>As I sit here writing this review on my new Toshiba, I am totally satisfied about my decision. This laptop is replacing a 10 year old laptop with Win XP. So you can see, this was not going to be, I thought, an easy transition, going to the latest technology and Win10.<br/>This decision, was not made lightly. I had spent many hours at various manufactures websites, going into the stores, reading reviews on the models that met my expectations and checking, continuously at AMAZON. This was the final result. The Toshiba C55-C5241<br/>The Toshiba, performed flawlessly, right out of the box, and has done so since. Surprisingly, it did not take me very long to use and set up my various requirements with Win 10. Connecting to my LAN, my various printers, was easy. Pinning my various websites to the desk top, was also no problem. My only problem, is the lack of "OUTLOOK EXPRESS" , and the fact that my folders and address book.wab, can't be exported in their present format.<br/>I love the expanded keyboard. Having the number keypad is a real joy and having keys designed to take advantage of what Win 10 offers, is outstanding. e.g. the F1 Cortana quick key<br/>The Intel I5-5200U dual core, is a real performer, without the heat that can be generated by high performance CPU's. I did go to a website where you can compare the Intel vs the AMD. I like AMD, but in the final comparison, Intel won out by a nose.<br/>So  far the 8GB of ram is more than sufficient, and so is the 1 TB HDD.<br/>Also another big difference for me, was the screen configuration. My old laptop a 15.6 the same as the new. The difference is more narrow and longer, giving it the HDTV look. Love it. Which brings me to the image. It is sharp, crisp, clear and HD. I'll have to attribute that to the Intel processor.<br/>The keyboard has a nice feel to it. I am still getting use to the mousepad. It is larger and because of that, I've found that, I some times miss tapping  the center, and the cursor is moved to another part of the screen.<br/>I like the fact that this model also comes with a DVD read/ write player, plus all the necessary inputs, right down to  HDMI.<br/>This is also the first time I've had a computer with mike and camera. I have used both with no problem, although it takes some getting use to the reverse action of me on the screen.<br/>My previous laptop was a Toshiba. I have not experienced  Toshiba Service, because it never gave me a problem, in the ten years I've owned it. I'm hoping that this new Toshiba Laptop, gives me the same .<br/>I don't know how long this Win10 Toshiba model will be available. But I stronglyrecommend this model to anybody who still has older computers with Win XP. It is fully loaded with  a very affordable price, especially when you purchase through Amazon.<br/><br/>I am not a computer geek, nor am I a computer dummy. So I hope this review will make both types of potential buyers feel comfortable in their buying decision.
Unless you are a heavy duty gamer or video editor, this is all the computer you will need.  The i5 processor is powerful enough for everyday tasks and all functions seem really quick to me.  The hard drive is giant.  Tons of RAM.  I have had no problems with the keyboard or screen, even though others are saying they are poor.  The keyboard works great and the screen is sharp, clear and displays vivid color.  There was a bit of a learning curve with Windows 10, but it seems to work well enough; just a little hard to get used to.<br/><br/>I left this computer on for a week right after it was delivered, and could not make it fail.  The thought is to make the computer fail before the 30 day return policy window is closed.  No problems whatsoever.  I am enjoying this computer and recommend it.
I am VERY pleased with this Toshiba Laptop.  It is a replacement for a Windows 7 HP that died WAAAAAY too soon - IMHO! I was just grateful it hung on long enough to replace it with this Windows 10 machine!  Having used a Windows 8 at my job there is NO WAY I would purchase one for personal use!  Windows 10 is very user friendly... but the Edge browser that comes with it ... not so much. Just D/L Chrome or Firefox as your web browser and it works great!
every time restart its going to recovery mode and too slow with 8gig ram.
The laptop worked perfectly fine for 2 months but then the fan started showing a terribly loud sound and different apps started having trouble when re-booting (Chrome in particular). The computer also started taking forever to be shut down or be turned on. I've also noticed it has problems keeping itself connected to the wireless networks at home and the office. The 1 year guarantee extension costs approx. 30 % of the price of the laptop and Toshiba doesn't even cover the shipping cost (USD30) for repair leaving you with the feeling that you bought a disposable machine. In perspective, the price of the computer perfectly reflects its quality, a cheap piece of technology, even then it's not worth the money.
If I could give this computer zero starts, I would.  Do not waste your money on this piece of crap.  The mouse is by far the worst part of it, but the fact that I can't open google crome is beyond frustrating.  My old computer that I have had since 2009 is by far better.  This computer would make a perfect paper weight and that is about it.  Thanks for nothing Toshiba!
Pretty good overall computer. Its able to play Crysis 2 with decent performance. My main complaint is the location of the touch pad. It's not centered on the computer. It is to the left of center. This can interferes with gaming using the "wsad" keys.<br/><br/>I also had trouble with the drivers. First the track pad was faulty, then the audio driver stopped working. The problem is Windows 10, which is still buggy as of this review. I did get the drivers to work eventually.<br/><br/>I do like this computer. I recommend it for anyone who wants a mid level laptop. It boots quickly, plays DVDs, surfs the web like a breeze. Its a good value for the price.
This laptop is performing well.  I'm learning to like Windows 10.  One problem that was eventually resolved had to do with my WiFi connection.  The connection would fail after a few minutes and I had to reconnect only to have it fail again.  Apparently it had to do with the Windows 10 updates and the helpful Toshiba technician was able to fix the problem remotely.
I love the performance and still can't believe the value!  There are sharp edges, and if you use this laptop while laying down, the edges can become quite uncomfortable.  If, however, you use it sitting at a desk, then you never even notice the edges.  It's also thinner and lighter than I thought it would be.  I am very happy with this purchase.
It has been almost 4 months since I bought this laptop, so my feedback includes the issues that wouldn't usually appear within a month of purchase.<br/><br/>This laptop purchase would probably be the worst purchase I've ever made here at Amazon. When you buy high tech electronics such as a laptop, make sure to read those low rating feedback. I regret that I did not read those feedback when I purchased this laptop because I am having the same issue that many low rating feedback reported here.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of major issues I am currently having:<br/>1. My laptop screen started to fail having all these lines flickering. Since I cannot see anything in the bottom of the screen, I had to move the task bars to the top. There is a feedback with a photo, so,check it out. I contacted the customer services and noted that it is a product defect, since I never dropped the laptop and it just suddenly started happening. They asked me to send a picture of my screen. It has been a couple of weeks and no response.<br/>2. I think there is something wrong with the laptop's network devices both ethernet and wifi. When I called the customer services for the screen issue, even before I mentioned about what technical issues I was having the customer service representative asked if I was having any internet issues. I guess a lot of people have already complained about it. I think it is also a product defect. I am currently using only ethernet since wifi continues to fail (slow down significantly or no internet connection or limited connection issues). Even ethernet is causing some issues it often would not open the webpages properly.<br/><br/>Additionally, Toshiba laptops are infamous for a loud fan noise. So beware of it when you decide to purchase Toshiba product. From now on, I will not buy any of Toshiba products ever again.
Over 25 years, I have had several laptops. I waited for one with Windows 10 preinstalled. This is by far the best laptop I have had. So far, great holding the charge. Easy to use, lightweight, nice screen. I do not like the touchpads but it work well. I am using the Logitech MX Anywhere 2 Wireless Mobile Mouse with it and works well.
BEST LAPTOP EVER. If you're like casual gaming, editing videos and need a school laptop this is fantastic. It handles League of Legends on Medium at 66 fos. It can go higher but I like speed rather than looks. It plays mine craft at 120 fps. The only thing that I had a problem with is that in order to get high performance on it. You have to switch the laptop to high performance mode to get good gaming out of it. Here is a tip. Use the high performance setting to get great gaming and switch it to power saving mode when browsing the internet. Battery wise , you can expect 2-3 hours of nonstop gaming. For casual use. It's about 5-6 hours. Very great editing laptop as well. I have a YouTube channel and I can render my Adobe premiere pro cc videos and it has always been really fast. Expect great use out of this machine because it is worth your while for the price. With 8 gbs of ram and 1 tb of data, you'll be able to store a lot of files and be able to use that 8 gbs of ram on your gaming or editing.
Good, non-expensive but powerful laptop. Bought it for replacement of the recently died HP laptop (will never buy again!). This guy is working pretty fine (but I've removed hard drive (and sold it on ebay) and replaced by the "good old" SSD with Windows 7 onboard!). Migration was a painless and took only half an hour.
So far so good.  Wow, it was stressful trying to pick the right laptop.  There are so many choices and you do not want to get a 'bad deal'.  At $420, this seems like a good deal.  The PC is very responsive and quick.  To my pleasant surprise there does not seem to be much bloatware that was pre-installed, which was great.
I bought this after considerable research to replace my 5 year old ASUS that is literally falling apart. I was looking for a laptop that had an i5 processor, at least 500GB, and Windows 7, and it needed to cost less than $500. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this as a deal of the day and it had 1TB instead of 500GB. I had hoped to stay with Windows 7, but it came with Windows 10. I was also happy to see that it was a Toshiba because almost everyone I know who has a Toshiba laptop has been very happy with it.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed with this laptop is the material of the case since the old laptop's plastic case cracked and broke. I also really like how this one is thinner and more lightweight than my ASUS. The L-shaped power adapter is something I had hoped it would have (why do they never show the power cords?) and I was happy to see that. But not only that, the part that connects into the computer is a harder plastic all around (the old laptop has a power cord that is a more flexible "rubber" when it makes the vertical part of the "L" and it causes the connector to move almost like a lever, which has caused issues inside my laptop). The one thing I do not like about the power adapter is that it is a 2 prong plug instead of a 3 prong so it comes out of the outlet a little too easily (even with a surger protector). However, this laptop's battery has a pretty long battery life and I can use it for hours, even when playing my addictive Candy Crush, without having to plug it back in.<br/><br/>One thing I had read in other reviews is that the edges of the laptop were sharp and I agree. While the corners are slightly rounded off, the edge all around the keyboard portion of the laptop are a little sharp and it does make it a little uncomfortable on the forearms as they might rest in that same location. But I'm getting used to it so it's not bothering me quite as much.<br/><br/>The laptop comes with Windows 10 and I have to admit it's been a hard adjustment for me. I see that this OS is designed so it can be used on various devices, including touch screens, so I understand why it's laid out the way it is. But since I don't regularly use a tablet and don't even have a smartphone, it's not as natural for me to see layouts like this. Even though this is a brand new computer with the software installed, it did have troubles with certain things because of the  new OS and the touchpad didn't want to work exactly how I wanted it to at the beginning. But the computer had me do several updates almost at the very beginning of using it and I guess there must have been an update to fix the touchpad problem because I haven't experienced the problem since. But keep in mind that, even though this is brand new, you might still have some issues with Windows 10 and you might have to go to the Toshiba website to update drivers, etc.<br/><br/>One feature that I wish this laptop had is a backlit keyboard. I have a young child and sometimes I end up staying in his room while he is sleeping and it's too early for me to go to bed. So I usually bring in the laptop so that I'm not bored out of my mind. However, that is not a "must have" for me and I'm sure I will adjust.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this laptop and I hope that it holds up a whole lot better than my ASUS did!
I'm probably the worst person to review this laptop, but I'll give you my thoughts.<br/>I'll start with the touch pad. I wasn't prepared for this. There are so many different functions that you can do that I had to turn off many of them just so I could use it. The most frustrating is the -magnify- feature. I have the habit of resting my left index finger on the left click button and moving the cursor with my right. if my left finger moves up and contacts the touch pad, I'm magnifying as soon as I move the cursor. This is not fun when you're reading an article and the next thing you know, you're at 300% and most of the article is off the screen. I've checked the setting and this feature isn't even turned on. maybe I just don't know where to look yet. but I'll find it.<br/>The sharp edges everyone complains about are definitely sharp. This is no big problem, I took a fine grit sharpening stone and simply "dulled" the edges. Rubbing the stone over the edge at a 45 degree angle,  just a couple of passes, did the trick and took no more than 15 seconds.<br/>I love that it's start up time is virtually non existent compared to the old unit,<br/>The screen is large, clear easy on my eyes. I don't have high def eyes, so I won't comment on how the visual quality is at the finer levels.<br/>The rest is my favorite part, the learning. Stepping of a vista machine to windows 8 makes everything a learning experience. with the fin of success and the frustration of being stumped. That's when I count on my tech friends.<br/>I must assume that anything that doesn't work as I think it should, is because I'm just not doing it right. but I'm loving this laptop and am happy to learn" more about it every day.
As most of the reviews have already gone over, this laptop is pretty great for its price. I bought this laptop with the mindset that it will carry me through my college career with a breeze. So 2 weeks in on having it I have little to no complaints. It's not the most aesthetically appealing laptop in the bunch, but specs wise it packs a punch for the price you're getting it for. It runs so smooth and although there's no 1080p, it's not like you're looking through potato quality stuff. Work can be done. The speakers aren't the best by far in my opinion, but you can always hookup additional ones or use headphones (which is what I normally do anyways). It's lightweight and the fan is quite. There was some getting used to with the keyboard considering it has a numerical pad. At times I wouldn't hit the backspace button like I intended-- it's small. And the keyboard isn't backlit, but that's not a major issue. Data transfer from my old laptop was a breeze-- just take it to your local computer repair shop (and avoid best buy's geek squad at all costs) if you're a newbie/ not tech savvy like myself. I'm still having troubles with retrieving my Microsoft office software, so if anyone wants to chime in onto how to properly do that, that would be a great help.<br/>This laptop overall does an pretty great job pleasing my college student needs. I'm very happy with the purchase. If you're looking for a great working laptop at a pretty unreal price, look no further. This is it.<br/>War damn eagle
Have only had it a short time but it does what I need it to do.  Like other reviewers comments, the edge where you rest your hand/wrist is sharp so get a wireless mouse.  I really like Windows 10, and I was prepared not to, but so far it's the Windows we've been waiting for.
I am no techie and and in no way an expert on what makes one laptop better than another.  From just a regular guy's perspective (and i'm in my 50s too), this Toshiba is all that I need.  Light weight, nice keyboard, has enough bells and whistles for an everyday user, etc.  I'm sure you can spend more to get more if you are into all those added perks you may want (but maybe don't really need!), but for me, this is great.
This machine actually is a very good value.  Other than the sharpness around the edges of the keyboard I have no complaints, works great.  Is just a tad heavy, as I was used to a MacBook Air, but I don't plan on traveling with it.  Good deal.
This computer replaces an antique Dell laptop. I love the brightness of the screen, and the fact that I've got a lot more computer for less than I expected to spend. There's a bit of a learning curve with Windows 10, but I'm getting there!
So far this laptop has performed better than expected. Pros: It is lightweight, large, 15.6 inch, screen, long battery life. Cons: As other reviewers has stated, the case is plastic and feels cheap, particularly when you open and lift the screen to turn it on and use it. But, keep in mind this is an economy laptop (under $500) so you are not going to get something that you can throw around. Most users should not have a problem.<br/><br/>Some reviewers complained about the screen resolution. I have no problems with the resolution and it is comparable to my old laptop. If you are doing HD video editing or HD art, get something else. For the rest of us, the resolution is fine. I use the laptop in my office, in meetings and while I am sitting in front of the TV. The resolution meets my needs and I am sure it will meet your needs as well.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this laptop to anyone. Causal users who need something to carry around...yes. Users who are looking for a desktop replacement...yes. The installed RAM is enough for most users and the hard drive offers plenty of extra storage.<br/><br/>This laptop has quality components (Intel chip!), plenty of memory, and large HD. You cannot find a better priced laptop.<br/><br/>I am even recommending this to my parents and friends.
I am very impressed with my Toshiba. It has & does more than I will probably ever use. Windows 10 was very easy to set up which made me happy since I am not very computer literate. The sound & picture are fantastic too!
[UPDATE] - I've encountered a problem with the audio jack. This laptop does not recognize my headphones and the sound is incredibly low and flat. Doing a google search showed that multiple people have this problem. I have yet to find a solution for this problem.<br/><br/>This is a great computer for the price. I got this because I wanted to play my favorite games while travelling. I have a beefy desktop computer at home that can handle all the big graphics games. I just wanted something that could run dota, heroes of the storm, diablo, counter strike etc. These are the games I play the most anyways. It can run these games decently at high settings even. But I always prefer performance over graphics so I turn these games to low settings. At low settings I get between 40-55 fps on dota, 70 to 90 on hots.<br/><br/>The one thing that bothers me a lot about this laptop, and after a google search it seems that this is common among toshiba satellite laptops, is that the space bar doesn't function well. Specifically, when I type I tend to press the space bar near the right edge instead of the middle. For some reason the space bar doesn't work half of the time, unless you press it right in the middle.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate because besides that the computer is great for the price, it's a simple flaw that is causing me a lot of frustration when typing,<br/><br/>If anyone also has this problem please let me know, I'd like to fix this somehow.
fabulous laptop.  Lightweight (less than 5 lbs), big screen, solid keyboard and mouse. Also has a respectable amount of memory (8gb), a huge HD (1TB).  Honestly, unless you're running serious games or other resource intensive applications, this is the perfect computer for everyday use and is a good multimedia machine.<br/><br/>I love the lightweight and thin feel, and the finish looks classy with the added bonus of not attracting fingerprints, which is great! Even though it's lightweight, it feels sturdy (my toshiba before this literally had the feeling of a child's toy rather than a computer!  On this note, others have complained about the keyboard, but i liked the keyboard just fine.<br/><br/>The sound system (while a laptop sound system), is pretty good and you can achieve fairly good volume without creating distortion.  loved it!<br/><br/>If i was searching for something to complain about, there are 2 things.<br/>screen could be a little crisper.  I'd love it if the screen was higher resolution<br/>i wish there was more than 1 usb 3 port, which is kind of a bummer<br/><br/>Overall, a worthy purchase.  Buy it!
Out the box it did not work. Would not get past setup screen. Called Toshiba support and after dealing with ignorant technician was hung up on. Longtime IT engineer so attempted a recovery and reset. Still just kept looping back to "Leading Innovation" start screen. Seriously Toshiba? Only thing innovative on this brick is that you charge $500 for it. Will be returning to Amazon. Do not buy this junk notebook or any Toshiba products unless you enjoy returning items to Amazon.
This is a wonderful example of designing a product for good value.  Every component in this computer is pretty good, but no component is the latest technology, because the latest technology is generally quit a bit more expensive than the previous technology, for only modest improvement in function.  Let those who need the latest technology pay for it, while those who do not need the latest will do well to get a product like this which provides earlier, but still pretty damn good, technology, for a really good price.  The screen is really good, although better resolution is available, and this screen has noticeably limited viewing angle vertically.  The processor is i5, not i7.  The battery life is adequate, indicating that this does not have the latest components with the lowest power usage.  There are so many ways in which it *could* be better -- but making it better would significantly increase the price.  And nothing here is shabby, it's all *almost* the latest technology.  This is the choice to make if you don't have a real need for the latest (expensive) technology.
I bought this laptop for my son because I wanted to get him an affordable name-brand computer that he could use for schoolwork that was also powerful enough to run his favorite games. The machine itself is sleek, lightweight, and nice to look at. The body is slightly curved around the edges of the keyboard, and the touchpad has a bit of a rough texture, that I have not experienced on other machines. The plastic corners of the machine could be smoother, and I have found them to be fairly uncomfortable to touch. The touchpad is not centered on the body, so it's a bit awkward to use, depending on where my hands are positioned. I find myself hitting the right mouse button too frequently. Also, the numeric keypad is directly adjacent to the standard keys, so it's not uncommon to hit the wrong key when trying to press Enter.<br/><br/>The initial setup of the machine was fairly easy, even for a Windows 10 novice like myself, but I had to overcome three annoying problems in the first couple of days. First, it would not connect to my wireless network. I use an Apple Airport Extreme, which works flawlessly with all of my various computers and devices, but for some inexplicable reason, this laptop would not obtain an IP address after connecting. The network kept coming up as "Limited." It took some searching before I landed on a blog post that explained how to solve the issue by entering a series of command line codes: http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-limited-wifi-connection-problem-in-windows-8-1 Miraculously, this worked, even though I have no idea what these commands do.<br/><br/>The second issue I had was that this machine had some default settings that disabled the touchpad when keys were entered on the keyboard. I realize that this may be useful in some situations, it makes many games impossible to play. I had to spend a considerable amount of time looking through the system settings to figure out how to turn off this feature.<br/><br/>Finally, I experienced a problem where the sound would spontaneously stop working after certain programs were opened. For example, many games were silent until I restarted the machine. This seems to be a known issue in Windows 10, and specifically with these models, and I was able to overcome this problem by updating the sound driver, but it was an annoying thing to have to do.<br/><br/>These problems surprised me, as I had expected that a machine pre-installed with the latest OS would have fewer software issues. I hope these are isolated problems, but I suspect that there are probably more that I have yet to discover.
I've now had this laptop for about a month and a half. It has been great so far.<br/><br/>Things I enjoy:<br/>Great speed in every aspect. Loads new pages quickly, downloads, games etc.<br/>New windows 10 is pretty nice too, I had a macbook air previously and simply needed to have windows for grad school and didn't like the microsoft excel on mac.<br/>Large display<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>Battery life: It's not too long, it's not short by any means either. I would say it definitely lasts longer than my macbook air.<br/><br/>Cons: All too often I often randomly zoom in on my current webpage/word document/excel document because of my hand resting near the trackpad or something. It's really annoying and I try to use my mouse as often as possible.<br/><br/>Other notes: Ignore people talking about the sharp sides, I have never really noticed that and worried about it a bit when reading other reviews.<br/><br/>Overall: Great overall versatile computer for a student. Can't beat the price
I know there are great reviews on here for performance and how good the deal is. Yes it is a very good deal, yes the computer is good under the hood.  However, since there are endless reviews of that, here are some issues I personally have:<br/><br/>1. Touchpad/Mouse Buttons - they could not be more flat.  It is a nit-picky thing but I absolutely dislike laptops that have the mouse pad and the buttons feel one and the same.  And yes, I do use a BT mouse as well, but many times I use the trackpad and I still cannot get use to it. In addition, the trackpad just is not good. It is subpar at best.  Texture and feel is horrible. It is one of the most negative and most used features of this laptop.<br/><br/>2. The perimeter of the keyboard area is about as sharp as I've every seen. I have big hands and typically, in all laptops before, rested my hands on the perimeter as I navigate the keyboard/mouse.  With this laptop, the perimeter is literally at an exact 90 degree angle and actually feels sharp.  As I type this I'm trying to figure out a way to pad the corners due to their unusual sharpness.  I wish I was exageratting but if I rest my palm on the corner or sides too long, a significant redline is formed and I have to adjust my hand. This has never been an issue in any other laptop I've ever had (over 10).  It is just a really sharp corner.....sure it looks real nice at first glance, but functionally it is not comfortable if you like to rest your hands on the perimeter like I do.
I've been using the same Lenovo laptop for a few years ago and was really excited to try this one out.  The laptop came in a fairly spartan package, which I actually liked.  It was easy to find the pieces and there was no annoying packaging to deal with.  I charged the laptop overnight before getting started with it.  I started it up and went through the normal first time bootup procedures for windows.  After that was done, I looked for any bloatware to remove, I found next to none.  I disabled a bunch of Windows stuff I don't use, and then proceeded to download the things I use, Firefox, CCleaner, Open Office, and Notepad++.  I then ran CCleaner to clean up any lingering junk in the cache.<br/><br/>The laptop performs well, it takes less than 30 seconds to boot up.  The applications open quickly, and I haven't seen any compatibility issues.  Windows 10 doesn't seem all that different than the last couple of flavors of Windows.  Some things are a little odd, such as the weather app.  I kind of wish it would show the current temperature instead of just an icon.<br/><br/>Physically the laptop feels very nice.  It's made of textured plastic, it feels solid and well built.  It's thin and the jacks are logically organized.  The edges are a little sharp around the bottom half with the keyboard.  I primarily use the laptop for games, and not much typing, so it's not a huge deal for me.  The Amazon wireless mouse I bought with this laptop was immediately recognized and works great.
Exceeded expectations. Windows 10 took a little getting used to, but not a problem. Big hard drive and lots of RAM. Battery life as much as 8 hours. I am a frequent hospital patient and this is my sole source  of entertainment. It has not let me down. To complete the package I also bought a Toshiba 1TB external hard drive and a wireless mouse along with a carrying case to tote it all. The surface finish is textured and is so much better the the gloss black the you usually see which gets ugly ever time you touch it. Audio an video play just fine. If you are an average or just above computer user, this is a wonderful machine. I use lots of Microsoft products and watch lots of video and there are no problems whatsoever. If you are a heavy duty gamer you might want to look elsewhere. If you are a business or professional person that wants a kick-ass machine for a bargain price, don't hesitate to click on"buy now"
I would have given it Five stars if it wasnt for the Audio Driver ISSUE. Sound stops working every time i use the laptop and i have to reset the disable and activate the driver until sound works again, if that doesn't do it I have to restart it completely. Toshiba needs to fix this problem somehow. The driver updates so far have not helped.
Hate the Windows, but the computer is wonderful. This is my 3rd Toshiba and I agree with Consumer Reports, this is a very good laptop.
I personally Love HP items but decided to try a different brand name. I am not sorry at all that I made this purchase. This is an awesome Laptop OMG the best I have come across. huge brilliant fast lots of memory n 1TB I am very happy with my purchase n it came with windows 10. Mostly I loved the fact that it came empty no software you install what you want and that is the best about it cause most comp. n laptops come loaded with a bunch of software that you don't even use or plan to use and when you install them most of them are on a trial bases n then you need to purchase it. also it takes up a whole lot of your space. so this is extremely awesome that you get to install only what you want. Very Satisfied Customer.
I just received this a coupled of days ago.  So far the only complaint I have is that the USB ports are flimsy and too close together.  If I have a thumb drive in one of the right-hand USB ports, there's not enough room to put another next to it.  If I then plug in my mouse, it presses against the thumb drive and the wiggling makes the thumb drive rapidly disconnect and connect.  Moreover, the mouse connector won't go far enough in to connect if the thumb drive is there.  This is my second Toshiba and the previous one was pretty well-made, but that was 8 years ago.  I'm going to install Linux for a dual-boot system and we'll see how that goes.
I love this computer. No complaints. Plenty of battery life. The battery recharges quickly. Windows 10 is easy to use. I love Cortana. She is  good. The screen resolution is very good. The sound is also very good. This is a very user friendly computer. I am not a nitpicker. For the price and quality this is an excellent buy. Lots of apps offered. .Some special surprises which I won't mention. Buy your own! I have not encountered any problems which I couldn't fix. I did update the drivers manually in the device manager. I love how it works with my mac products as well as my androids. I haven't seen this mentioned. The offers are good.
Overall this has been a wonderful laptop. It is fast, which I love, because I take online classes and needed something that  wouldn't take forever to load, like the last laptop I had. The one complaint I have is that on occasion, the screen will flicker. Just a little bit, not enough to mess up anything I'm working on, just enough to be annoying. I've never looked into the problem because it is a pretty rare occurrence. I seem to notice it more when I have had the computer on for a really long period of time. I would buy this this again and definitely recommend it.
My Toshiba laptop is everything I expected and more. I am very impressed with all it's features, the screen quality, and overall performance of it.<br/>As I waited for my laptop to arrive, I went to a popular electronics store looking for another product, and was told that I could "walk out of the store with a new laptop now." The sales clerk asked me for the specs on my Toshiba and of course, I gave them to her. After a few minutes, she stated that she couldn't help me. They didn't carry anything like it in the store. I had purchased a good laptop.
It's an okay laptop for price. I am pretty much going to list some pros and cons, and let you decide if this laptop is right for you.<br/><br/>~PROS<br/><br/>- Super fast boot-up time, the exact values are below (all times with no programs open);<br/><br/>  - 11.17 seconds from shut off to Windows 8 lockscreen<br/><br/>  - 2.04 seconds from lockscreen to fully loaded desktop<br/><br/>  - 5.01 seconds from the desktop fresh after boot, to fully load a zero tab Chrome instance<br/><br/>  - 8.13 seconds to shutdown<br/><br/>- Fast processor, I can play Minecraft WITH the correct Optifine settings, at medium settings and it gives me around a 60 FPS average.<br/>- Lots of RAM (8GB)! You will probably never run out...unless you're a video editor, like me. But you can upgrade your RAM up to 16GB I believe.<br/>- A spacious 1TB hard drive.<br/>- Not too light or heavy, and not too thin or thick.<br/><br/>~CONS<br/><br/>- The display is not full HD, it's 1366 x 768. My 5 inch phone has more pixels than this 15.6 inch monster.<br/>- The battery is actually between the two side shoulders on the back, so when you pick it up when its closed, it feels like the battery is bending out of its place.<br/>- The display hinges are not very tight, which means you can open the laptop without the bottom coming up with it. It worries me though, I feel it might be its downfall in the future, as it might just not support it at all later.<br/>- The mouse pad is not the smoothest, and the mouse buttons are really hard to press down with my thumb, which after a while, makes my finger slightly sore.<br/>- Keyboard feels a bit soft, mushy. You can get used to it though.<br/>- Escape key is really and loose. If pressed, it sticks and feels like it's about to come off.<br/>- The sides of the laptop are really sharp.<br/>- The plastic feels cheap.<br/>- NUM Lock doesn't stay on if you restart the computer.<br/>- The speakers are not too loud, and they sound tinny.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are using an external mouse, and don't mind the slightly mushy keyboard, and hold it a bit differently when carrying it around closed, and don't really care that the display isn't full HD, then this laptop is for you. Unfortunately, this one is not for me, as I'm going to return it shortly.
This is my fifth laptop, my third windows machine, my second Satellite.<br/>I mention this because I do use, and pay for, laptop machines and have a firm basis for making an informed review.  I am also an apple guy even though I don't think their laptops deliver a vastly superior experience, unlike their desktops.<br/><br/>I'm coming off of a Dell Ispiron 17-3721 that I've been using for nearly two years.  I bought it on the fly after dropping my toshiba from waist height for the third or fourth time in two years of hard and heavy use.  I was super impressed by that earlier satellite machine but here's what I didn't like about it:  it looked like something from the 1990's; the start button was difficult to see; the power chord stuck out from the side of computer in an obnoxious manner; it got really hot when in use; it took a long time to boot up, and the sound wasn't great and picture was just average.  Apart from that I really liked its usablity and remakable robustness.<br/>(I hated my Dell almost immediately.  It is just a huge obnoxious rock.  Yes, it does a huge screen with good color and okay sound but it is so heavy and large that it fits comfortably almost nowhere).<br/>Here's what I like about this machine.  A) It actually looks modern and sexy B) The start button is easy to see C) The speaker position has changed to just below the screen on the horizontal lower half and it sounds comparatively excellent(but I use a Dragonfly DAC connected to speakers to listen to music). D) The screen hinges have been redesigned so that they lift the screen above the horiz part...the weak point of all of the old satellites I was told by the computer repair place I took my old satelite to...the hinge apparatus broke when I dropped it that last time...I don't know if this redesign addressed that but the new look is really good. E) The battery doesn't seem to get as hot while in use. F) The power chord was redesigned to a 90 degree angle so that the chord sits nicely along side the machine.  (I can't believe that nobody thought to do this before.....I hadn't seen this simple fix on other machines, and certainly it wasn't on my dell). F) The picture on this is good.  Alas, startup is still slow although a little faster than my older satellite. G) This machine is lighter, not only than the Dell boulder I own, but that underpowered runt of a Satellite that I used to have.<br/><br/>What I don't like about this machine is that the wifi pickup seems weak.  It doesn't pull as much signal from my downstairs router as either my dell or my older satellite.  I am still trying to get this sorted.  Causes pandora to pause and time out forever until it gets warmed up or something.<br/><br/>One thing:  I know that I am being spied on by Toshiba, Microsoft, google, amazon, ebay and all of the other pirates out there, unfortunately with this new interface the companies are rubbing our collective nose in it:  I hate that part of the experience.  What I mean by this is that I used my microsoft account to sign up but didn't realize that this has now made my email my log in.  Don't like that one bit.  Last week I tried to bypass email log in which worked so long as I kept the machine alive.  As soon as I shut it down for software updates, the cumbersome process kicked in.  I don't have a lot of time or aptitude to try to figure this stuff out....which is why I am a mac guy.  I am uneasy about using this machine as a strictly business machine which is what I wanted to do because it has already managed to link me to some of my non biz accounts.  Not good, but I also realize this is a software issue and although Toshiba is complicit, it is also not completely responsible for this negative experience.<br/>I also haven't used this computer enough to have a firm handle on all of its flaws and strengths but so far, and I think I definitely have enough usage history to be able to make an early judgment, I believe this is an well above average machine.  It has my approval and I think you'll like it:  Handsome, sounds good, screen looks good, lighter weight, cooler battery, fantastic chord layout (although I wish the power plug had remained on the right side as my other Satellite had it.
Everything works fine on the unit I recieved. The battery is removable, all you have to do is remove 2 screws and it slides out. The sound quality is okay for being a laptop, don't expect too much from it. Loading speeds on it arent lightning fast, but that could be due to the 5400 rpm drive. The i5 and 8gb ram are fine for gaming too. Overall its a decent price point for what it is. If you buy one and have problems with it just return it, Amazon will deal with it.
After some difficulty getting wifi functioning, the machine works well for browsing and light application use. I bought it primarily as a supplement for my desktop PC for radio programming; there are times when it's easier to take the programming PC to the radio in a car, for instance, than to rip the radio from its installed location for updates. I would not recommend this for heavy video editing or gaming purposes, but it certainly meets my needs.
I'm a person that - when shopping for 'big ticket' items - knows just what will work for me as I always compile a list of 'must haves'.<br/><br/>This laptop checked all the boxes, including the ability to remove the DVD drive and install a second hard drive.<br/><br/>I doubled the RAM [memory] from 8gb to 16gb and I'm a happy bunny.<br/><br/>Another plus is that there was zero bloatware as is often provided by Cyberlink, Nero and Wild Tangent . . . never easy to uninstall without calling in Revo Uninstall.<br/><br/>It's solidly built machine but lightweight, and will serve my purposes for a few years. Why spend more?
I have to admit that my last three laptops are all touchscreens so I have been spoiled for the last several years so this took a little adjustment-going old school(at least for me) to be using the touchpad which I rarely use. Usually just the screen and the keyboard. So after getting the frustrated part out of the way-inadvertently touching the screen a million times and nothing happening it is not a bad computer for the price.  It was easy to set up not one problem so that was a nice beginning. One of the things that bothered me was the sharp edge corners did not care for that. But I was holding it up in bed and was quite comfortable.<br/><br/>The best thing I liked about it was it had a slot on the side so if I wanted to use a DVD and pop it in I could(Oh the Horror!). The more expensive laptops most often skip that feature but I like that. The screen came up clear and had great sound.  The DVD was from the seventies and I wanted to check for clarity and it was very good. Extremely impressed with that feature and will be using that a lot in the future.<br/><br/>Reasonable price that you get quite a bit for the money. Would invest in if you are watching your wallet and want a dependable laptop.
I love this computer! it's pretty fast and that's exactly what I needed. The only problem I have is the audio. I plug my head phones in the sound is loud than it goes down low immediately. I tried everything looking up forums trying different settings it's really frustrating. I bought speakers for it but the same thing happens with the speakers. Only improvement this computer needs is the audio sigh.
This notebook is great for everyday computer needs. The Intel Core i5 processor works well and the 8 GB of memory is enough for everything up to advanced gaming. The notebook's physical profile is very slim (slimmer than most notebooks I've worked with). The battery life is very good - I get about 5-6 hours out of a fully charged battery. So far I have no complaints about it at all!
I'm pretty happy with this after a month or two. Edges are sharpish, but won't cut you. Battery is screwed in and I feel as though how its mounted seems fragile. Dropped it twice now, but no real problems.<br/><br/>Quite the deal to say the least. Giving 4 stars because its not the best thought out however it is the best thing for your money at the time of writing, hands down
The only problem I've found so far is with the sound, which disappears after a few days of use.  A reboot fixes it for a few days and the problem repeats.  Lots of driver updating so far, but delayed problems like this are hard to diagnose so I still have an open ticket with Toshiba tech support.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'm satisfied with performance and features.
Laptop is nearly perfect. Its very slim for a 15" screen and has very good speed, processing, and graphics for the price. The fingerpad/mouse is overly sensitive, even at lower settings, expanding or contracting the screen accidentally-but I simply disabled that feature, and I use the Ctrl function if the feature is ever needed
Didn't need (or particularly like) a touchscreen feature; if important to you this isn't the laptop for you.  So far, everything seems to be operating as it should, and I'm happy with the features/ value for the money.  If I get 3-5 years of use from this laptop it was a great value, and a smart purchase.
The Vine program offered me two different laptops for review. I took the Toshiba 17" one, <br/> and have already reviewed it. I gave my son the 15" one, and felt it would be useful to have his perspective (and rating!) for the review, so the following are his thoughts:<br/><br/>The laptop is very a nice black finish that makes it look very sleek. Being 15.6 in. the computer is on the edge of being too large for carrying around day to day. The larger size does mean that there is a separate numerical keypad which can be nice if you use it for data entry. This laptop still has an optical drive which is almost unnecessary these days but it doesn't add too much thickness.<br/><br/>The speakers on this laptop function well. It also has Bluetooth connectivity and connected to my portable speaker with no problems. I'm still getting used to the keyboard as the keys are slightly separated compared to my old laptop. Just a small complaint is the key aren't backlit.<br/><br/>There is a USB 3.0 port allowing for very quick data transfers to from my external hard drive to this computer. The battery life is pretty good. I haven't had to push it too hard but it will probably get 5 hours.<br/><br/> After the initial start-up and downloading of new software, the computer runs great! Very fast and the larger screen enable two windows to be side by side and function well. This is a great price that gives you 8GB of RAM and 1TB hard drive.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have had is with the touch pad. Windows 10 is supposed to have a lot of swipe gestures that make the laptop more user friendly. When I first started the laptop there was an issue with the driver and I had to do a restart. Everything seemed to be working until today when the 3 finger gestures stopped working. I have looked into this and it seems to be a problem with Windows as others are having similar issues on different computers.<br/><br/>So concludes my son's thoughts, and he has elected to give the product 4-stars.
This is a decent computer for the price.<br/>Pros: Decent PC for the price, Display is crisp, Keyboard has a 10 key which not many laptops have<br/>Cons: THIS LAPTOP IS HEAVY!!!, Decent for light surfing and light gaming<br/><br/>Overall, good computer for the price.
I bought this computer last month and switched totally to it since then. My previous one got broken and I had to start using this immediately. I bought it because of the cheap price, large storage space [1TB] and the i5 processor. Not to miss the 8 MB RAM. All of this is perfect! The computer is quite good. 2 years ago I remember these kinds of parameters were actually much expensive.<br/>I find this computer fast and easy to work. I do not play games, but use it mostly for documentation and internet browsing. I watch also pre-recorded video files. I do not find any issues with that. I am running multiple applications without any issues. The computer is not that heavy. It has quite large screen, making it easy to work on. My previous one was 13.3 inch. This is 15 inch. It came with Windows 10 preinstalled, so activation was the only thing needed.<br/>CONS: The screen is really poor in quality – a very small viewing angle in any direction, so if you move slightly sideways the image gets dark. To get a proper image you need to look at it almost at the front only. This is actually the only thing that annoys me really. The other less annoying thing is the HDD, not being SSD. Sometimes it lags and takes 3-5 sec to start a new file. Cover and case is totally plastic, which on the lid has a kind of rough texture, but inside around the keyboard is too smooth, causing easy fingerprinting. The battery power work: (with the least applications in the background running) allows work the most 3-4 hrs use, and the screen light must be really lowered to max.<br/>Overall, good computers for people like me - with basic requirements. It deserves its money. I wish the monitor was better quality.
The laptop itself works smoothly in every aspect. The finish is great for me, I mean the brush metal and also the light weight. I am not giving five stars due to the Windows 10 installed. There is a lot of spam, pup ups coming from every corner of the browser.
I bought it because it had about twice the ram and HD storage of anything else in the price range, along with some good reviews. It does everything I wanted and expected from it. I'm even getting used to the keyboard that others don't seem to like much.
It has a lot going for it, fast boot up, great memory space, and nice processor. I give it four stars for the facts that the design is sleek, but edges are uncomfortable, and the computer seems to lag behind sometimes. Overall I would recommend this computer to anyone who is looking for the best laptop for the price.
I chose this laptop because of the reviews it had on Amazon but now i am considering the fact that these reviews may have been made by those accused of posting bogus reviews by Amazon.  I use the laptop once a day usually in the afternoon or evening to review videos or to review movie trailers. Without fail it will not play audio without re-booting the machine. I would no recommend purchasing this unit.
Agree with the other comments about the keyboard - it's not great, but for the price and features, I'd still buy this laptop again given perfect hindsight.  This is a great bargain for what you get.  I'm happy with my purchase.
So far, so good. Exactly what you would expect for the price - and an internal DVD R/W drive. I'm having problems adjusting to the touch pad, but that is likely due to the switch to Toshiba after HP for so many years.
You really can't beat these specs for the price.  It's a great deal.  My only gripe so far is that the edges are very sharp.  If you rest your wrists on the edge while typing you will feel it diggin in after a while.
OK... mixed feelings here.  When I got this Toshiba I was really impressed with the machine.  I am a Mac user but in order to drive some Astronomy/telescope software, I had to have a PC.  I had the option of using the Mac and Boot Camp and loading Windows or buying this Windows machine and dedicating it to that one task.<br/><br/>The screen on this Toshiba is impressive.  Great color and resolution.  Speed seems reasonable and it is a whole lot less expensive than Macworld products.  Everything went fine for the first day I used it, then.......<br/><br/>Yes, there is a "then".  The second time I tried to use the Toshiba it allowed me to log on (I tried everything I could when I originally booted this to avoid being forced to have a login password.... this is my machine.  I did not want to have to use a password for reasons which will soon become clear) everything went fine and the machine accepted my username and password (which I was forced to setup even, as I mentioned above, I did not want to do... so much for choices, huh?).<br/><br/>After logging in I wanted to change the admin password but now, nothing doing!  Will not recognize my password even though I just used it seconds ago.  Did some online research and discovered this is not unusual.  Somehow the password gets corrupted.  When that happens you have a lovely looking paperweight sitting on your desk.  I had not made a password recovery disk, did not have the original operating system disks (came preloaded) so.... done.<br/><br/>Called Toshiba and tried to learn Tagalog on the phone because the young lady that answered sure did not speak any language I knew.  After floundering around enjoying the diversity of language she said, "take it to a store".  Sigh.<br/><br/>OK... there are four entities involved.  Toshiba, Microsoft, Amazon and me.  Of the four, I know for sure two have nothing to do with a corrupted file.  That would be Amazon and me.  However, Amazon is the one that is going to have to eat this one.  Sorry but I am returning it and requesting a replacement.  I am not going to waste anymore of my time or eat anymore of my stomach lining on this one.<br/><br/>Still don't know if the fault lies with the operating system or with the manufacturer.  However Amazon has a great return policy and for that I am thankful.<br/><br/>I really liked the machine and the price was amazing.  I just hope the next one works as a computer and not as a paperweight.<br/><br/>If it were not for Amazon's easy return policy I would advise against buying it.  However, with their return policy there is little risk and you are only out a few hours of frustration and research and a trip to the UPS store.  So, if you are looking for an inexpensive machine, this one might be right for you.<br/><br/>UPDATE:  OK... you can use this computer without setting a password.  On a new machine when it gets to the username/password entry area just accept the username and click on the password entry field and then just go to the bottom of the page and select "Next".  It will allow you to bypass setting a password to use your own computer.
This computer is an upgrade for me from a one-year-old ASUS with Windows 8.1. I will address the quality of the equipment first and then evaluate the Windows 10 platform. This model has a striated finish that is a bit like linen--it isn't smooth.<br/><br/>What I like about the computer:<br/>- I really like the quiet keyboard. It has a soft touch, and the keys are spaced well for typing.<br/>- I also like having the numeric key pad available.<br/>- The buttons are labeled well.<br/>- I like the screen size.<br/>- The speakers are above the keyboard. This is so much better than some laptops where they are muffled by your lap if you use it in a chair.<br/>- I like that is has bluetooth. This is nice for speakers. It pairs with, but isn't really compatible with my iPhone.<br/>- The sound quality is much better than any PC laptop I have owned.<br/>- The HD display is much better than my other PC.<br/>- Has a CD burner, 3 USB ports, SD card reader, HDMI...all the things I need.<br/>- It is fairly lightweight, yet seems sturdy.<br/>- I like the processor speed. My other PC is so slow, despite being only a year old. This one is much faster!<br/>- I like having a terabyte of space<br/><br/>Things Toshiba could improve:<br/>- It would be nice to have lighted keys at this price point.<br/>- I had a touch screen on my previous computer, and it was a cheaper model. I would think that could be a standard feature.<br/>- The edges are sharp. When I sit in my chair to type, the area between my wrist and forearm gets sore from resting it on the computer.<br/>- When the screen is closed, there isn't a cutout or indent for opening the screen/lid. I find it a little hard to get my finger in there to open it.<br/><br/>What I like about Windows 10:<br/>- This has some significant improvements over Windows 8.1. The menus are easier to find, and settings easier to access.<br/>- The Cortana help button is helpful, but you have to click the microphone symbol for voice questions. It does help find both info and computer functions.<br/>- The start menu has more options than 8.1 had. I like being able to see the file explorer from that menu. It's nice to have the list of apps there too.<br/><br/>What I don't like about Windows 10<br/>- The new Windows doesn't allow pausing of One Drive uploads. This is a pain if I want to pause it to not tie up the internet when I am doing big updates.<br/>- Cortana uses Bing. I hate Bing<br/>- I found it harder to get apps from the store. I don't know whey this was, but they were slow, and some didn't show up on a search.<br/>- The system kept trying to do Windows updates and they hung up in process. I wasn't sure if there was a firewall issue with the free McAfee that was installed or what, but I finally just uninstalled it and used Windows Defender, and then they installed.<br/>- I hate the Windows mail. Really hate it. I am thankful I have Office 365 so I can use Outlook. Windows needs to improve the mail platform that comes with computers!<br/><br/>My overall impression is that this is a decent computer for the cost. My only real drawback is the rough edge on my arms after a lot of use. I wish the designer had thought of comfort! I like the speed and could recommend it for anyone looking for a a basic computer with a log of space.<br/><br/>It was easy to use out of the box. I did have to turn the Wifi off and back on to get it to recognize my router so I could sign in. Not a problem, but including it for anyone who might have that trouble.
I've had/used many desktops, laptops and now, and all-in-one. Windows 10 is new to me, but I won't comment on that much and just stick to the Toshiba hardware and software. This is my first Toshiba laptop/computer.<br/><br/>The unit is nice and light and slim. Must less so than my last Dell laptop. But, to be fair, that was over three years ago. The laptop doesn't look particularly high end; the design is simple but nice.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/>*Keyboard is nice and easy to use. I like the low profile keys.<br/>* Display is nice and bright<br/>* Design of the laptop is simple, but classy looking. It's all plastic, but it looks pretty nice for a mid-range laptop.<br/><br/>What I didn't like:<br/>* Seems to be a little laggy with even basic things like opening a browser. Each time I got on this computer, it was slow to boot up, slow to open programs and just slow in general.<br/>* Buttons below the touchpad are a little too firm.<br/>* Display is sufficient - contrast is good and colors appear rich and vibrant.<br/><br/>Problems:<br/>* The cursor sometimes gets stuck between pointing mode and text mode. I could not get it unstuck.<br/>* The edges of the laptop on the bottom where the keyboard is are really sharp. When your arms/hands are resting on the area before the keyboard, the edges are oftentimes bothersome. A rounded edge would have been a better choice.<br/>* The space bar sometimes doesn't register. In fact, this happens a lot. You really have to hit the space bar aggressively to get it to respond sometimes. This will be a real problem for someone who types a lot.<br/><br/>For the price, it's an OK computer. Not the best, not the worst. I found that using it usually meant my palms would hurt from the sharp edges and the laggy processor meant frequent frustrations. There's nothing that really stands out about this laptop and of all the laptops and desktops I've owned, this one seems a little slow.
WOW!  This is a superb notebook computer, loaded with excellent hardware and it has a great physical appearance (exterior and graphics).  I was attracted by the high operating speed (2.7 ghz), large hard drive (1 TB) and Ram memory (8 GB), and chose one preloaded with Windows 10.  It works perfectly.  The amazing graphics in the ad photo is accurate for what is shown on my screen. There was an initial issue when I first started up the computer (it is designed to automatically load the software, except you must access a network and at first I was unable to log onto my network because of a temporary challenge with the Drivers).  I have limited technology skills, so I contacted a Toshiba technician at the official Toshiba help desk accessible by a toll free #, to assist me in setting up the computer.  The technician was great - he was highly skilled, extremely helpful, polite and patient.  I learned that the support for this product is truly exceptional.  Having experienced all of this, I concluded that I purchased a computer that satisfied my dreams for a notebook.  The price for this extraordinary computer is amazingly low, and I am thrilled that I purchased this particular Toshiba computer instead of a Dell or HP, which was what I originally considered.  If I could award six stars, I would do so.  The notebook is that good!
The exterior has an almost "woodgrain" look to it, giving an appearance of sleek and expensive.  This is a good size laptop so it does have some heft to it.<br/><br/>Start up is simple and the Microsoft instructions walk you through setting up an account if you don't already have a Microsoft account. The laptop comes with Windows 10 which I am still getting use to but so far it's an improvement over 8.<br/><br/>It's easy to navigate with the touch pad or you can add a mouse to one of the three USB ports. The keyboard is not my favorite. The plus side - it has a numeric keypad which is nice. The down side are the very small arrow keys that are practically on top of each other.  Also, the keys themselves feel thin. Until very recently I used a laptop 99% of the time and those keys felt more like traditional desktop keys whereas these feel like there is very little to press down on. This allows far more typing mistakes. It might be something I'll get use to in time.<br/><br/>The screen resolution is good but not great. I can't see using this for serious photography work. At this price point, it's about what I would expect which is fine for viewing family photos on Facebook and videos on Amazon Prime. The audio is also about what you would expect from a mid-level laptop. Adding external speakers might help. I've found using earbuds helps with the clarity.<br/><br/>The biggest positive is the 1T on the hard drive.  Otherwise, this is a fairly standard laptop.
The setup with Windows 10 was very easy.  Adjusting to the new OS but so far the laptop has performed great.  The keyboard keys are quite flat which takes some getting used to.
The computer looks great for the price, although I started using it and Wifi sometimes does't connect and when it does, connection is pretty slow. I'll continue trying it...
This laptop is the best for the price and runs very smoothly.<br/>My only gripe is the screen resolution and the sharp coreners. Though, you can't beat the 450$ price tag.
For the price it can't be beat. The first one arrived with a dead pixel. Amazon made the return process easy, and the second unit arrived in perfect working order.
Great value for this price, INTEL CORE i5 processor is quite fast for everyday use, battery life is excellent,  my only complaint is not having a backlit keyboard
I've had this computer for a few days now, and I was surprised at the quality of this computer for such a good price (On sale $425). With a new Intel i5 processor and 8GB of RAM this computer has handled all of the tasks I have thrown at it. Word processing, listening to music, and web browsing all at the same time with no slowing down. Its a very slim and portable computer which is great for students and people on the go. The case is beautiful for a plastic case, however the lid and bottom of the laptop are very prone to scuffs and scratches, I ended up getting a laptop sleeve for it.<br/><br/>Another downside is that the screen is not Full HD, its only 1366x768, but the quality is still very good. Some people have said that you can see individual pixels on the display, but only if you are looking for them. A full HD screen would make this computer that much better but for the average user it shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br/><br/>If you are a student or looking for a good computer for work, this will defiantly be a good laptop for you.
So far, I love this computer. It was ready to go right out of the box with Windows 8.1, and no programs extra to Windows except McAfee Antivirus installed. I uninstalled that and installed AVG because I am not a huge fan of McAfee.<br/><br/>It is a very powerful computer for the price. I was looking for a regular laptop (I don't need touchscreen and/or detachable tablet) with powerful specs, balanced with a good price. With 8 GB of RAM and a TB of hard drive space, this computer fits the bill. Also, a Windows 10 upgrade comes free with this computer, which is a huge plus. It has one USB 3 port, and two USB 2 ports, as well as HDMI out. It also comes with wi-fi, an SD card reader, Bluetooth, and a DVD Burner (it doesn't say anything about Blu-Ray and I don't use them, so someone else will have to say whether it has that capability, but I am guessing it doesn't). It isn't going to have every higher end feature or spec, but it seems to balance price with power well.<br/><br/>The battery life seems str... Read more
I've now had this laptop for about a month and a half. It has been great so far.<br/><br/>Things I enjoy:<br/>Great speed in every aspect. Loads new pages quickly, downloads, games etc.<br/>New windows 10 is pretty nice too, I had a macbook air previously and simply needed to have windows for grad school and didn't like the microsoft excel on mac.<br/>Large display<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>Battery life: It's not too long, it's not short by any means either. I would say it definitely lasts longer than my macbook air.<br/><br/>Cons: All too often I often randomly zoom in on my current webpage/word document/excel document because of my hand resting near the trackpad or something. It's really annoying and I try to use my mouse as often as possible.<br/><br/>Other notes: Ignore people talking about the sharp sides, I have never really noticed that and worried about it a bit when reading other reviews.<br/><br/>Overall: Great overall versatile computer for a student. Can't beat the price
I have owned a few Toshiba laptops over the years including a Toshiba Satellite, so I have some experience with them. My family also currently owns three laptops for work/play including one "gaming ready" computer as well, so we can see some of the differences in practice. Now, there are some very technologically proficient reviews up as well, so if you need specs and whatnot they are a resource to turn to. Otherwise, this is a user's review and I hope it helps some.<br/><br/>Some pros with this model include:<br/><br/>-Aesthetics (minus the corners).<br/><br/>I really like the aesthetics of the laptop, from the appearance of the outer shell in. It has a glossy look that makes reminds me somewhat of stone, with little lines through the finish that add on as accents. It is glossy and some people have noted not liking the appearance when in heavy sunlight, but I have not experienced that problem.<br/><br/>One thing I would add to that, however, are the corners. Unlike a thicker laptop, the corners protrude a bit and could potentially be an issue. I use a laptop cushion when using it away from a desk so this is no issue, but I could see people perhaps having problems with that.<br/><br/>Design and functionality -<br/><br/>When it is opened, the laptop is laid out well, with a nice surface for typing and key use and enough spacing between keys. This has been a huge issue with other laptops because I am tall and have long fingers, but there is plenty of keyboard here. Buttons are easy to locate on the device as well and everything is clearly marked.<br/><br/>I also like the responsiveness of the touchpad (not to be confused with a touchscreen, which this is not), which was an issue with my last "budget" Toshiba. This touchpad allows easy navigation via having a good surface that can pick up movement and being touch sensitive enough to resister what I am doing.<br/><br/>Window 8.1 loaded and Windows 10 ready -<br/><br/>It took me a long time to warm up to Windows 8, but this is the 5th computer I have used with it (and that is not counting tablets) so I feel proficient enough with it. One thing I have experienced with another laptop was when Windows 8 came preloaded with a lot of frills, meaning it had a lot of programs I did not want or need. This came with just enough while also reserving much of the space it notes in the specs. It is also Windows 10 ready, which means it will qualify for a Windows 10 upgrade for 1 year after release. I like the fact that you have some time to check out Windows 10 to see if you want it, too, because I hate picking up something shiny and new only to see it for the beta if oftentimes is.<br/><br/>Use -<br/><br/>I primarily use this for photo editing/ some video editing because of the weight and convenience this offers, and it has worked out well. The touchpad responsiveness allows for easy navigation and the plethora of USB ports (1 USB 3.0 and 2 USB 2.0) allows for additions like a decent programmable mouse (which I added soon after receiving this). With it comes to visuals, the system is a 1366 x 768 so it is not 1080p.  I have had no issues with video replay and add on a 1080p monitor when doing in-depth video editing. I also tried out a few movies on it and sometimes hook it to a TV when traveling, and the playback has been great. There is an HD port added,although there is no VGA port so you will need an adapter. I have not tried out the 4k yet but have used to 1080p quite a bit and it has worked really well, with no issues with loss or delays.<br/><br/>When it comes to internal speakers, they performed really well considering the size of the laptop. I always add a Bluetooth speaker system to my laptops because they are so cheap and readily available, and I also add a microphone. I have used the mircophone a couple of times for added vocals and for a voice conference and it worked fine, but I prefer something added on.<br/><br/>I also use some basic programs such as Office and whatnot, but nothing that hogs resources. I read on my laptop sometimes depending on where I am and may also view comics or other visual mediums, and this works out well. The laptop would meet basic internet gaming requirements such as flash games, but you obviously would not use it for anything that requires larger specs like Arma or the like.<br/><br/>Battery life has also been good, providing around 6 hours before charging. I honestly expected a lot less.<br/><br/>Potential Cons:<br/><br/>-The corners (as noted above).<br/><br/>- A fixed keyboard, which makes replacement a pain<br/><br/>- This has a DVD-RW, not a BluRay player. I personally like being able to access all my media so this can be annoying, but I am not removing reviewing ranking for it because this is noted in the specs.<br/><br/>- Battery replacement is not push button, so you have some additional security or more nuisance, depending on your point-of-view.<br/><br/>- Wifi limitations to 802.11n, which can be overcome by using the USB 3 (thank goodness).<br/><br/>This has been tested for 28 days before the initial review, and I will update as needed. Thank you.
So far, so good. People reported sharp edges. I peeled the protective plastic off and found no sharp edges. Sound and resolution are very good.
After my trusty old Toshiba laptop that came with Vista on it (that dates it for sure) finally gave up the ghost, I purchased this one.  It's everything the old one was, and more.  It and Windows 10 get along fine.  One glitch -- if you want to get sound out of the headphone jack you have to wiggle the earphone or audio plug just right, and hope it doesn't move.  The headphone jack obviously has a problem. My "fix" was to purchase an inexpensive outboard USB digital audio encoder/decoder for $19 here on Amazon -- it works great.  So other than this tiny glitch, I'm extremely pleased.  Oh yes, I tried to purchase a second (spare) battery. Toshiba said they're not available, and that the battery isn't replaceable.  It is, I did, and the spare from an aftermarket company works great -- the battery even says it was made by Toshiba!  I'm happy enough that my next laptop will very likely be my third Toshiba laptop!!
Awesome laptop. Love how quite and fast it is. Don't love so much the small Enter bottom on the keyboard, but other than that. Perfect
This is a perfectly good, *basic* laptop for home use. The i5 and 8GB of RAM give it plenty of ooomph for most tasks a home user would need it for. Performance is fairly snappy doing most tasks, browsing the Internet, looking at pics or email, etc. The 1TB HD is plenty of storage for most home users as well. The exterior finish is attractive and doesn't show smudges easily.<br/><br/>When you get the laptop, you should install Windows and Toshiba updates immediately. There are a number of updates that will help your laptops performance and reliability, so if you do this first you should have a bit better experience.<br/><br/>Battery life is unexceptional and the screen resolution is just ok - but if you are looking for a relative bargain laptop that will work well for most home applications, you could do a lot worse than this.
My previous laptop wasn't nearly as nice or as powerful, but it did have a rather good trackpad, so I never purchased a separate mouse for it. This laptop is excellent and inexpensive and I love it, but (so far) the only trade-off for the low price that has really been affecting me is the trackpad, which seems like it was designed for use only in the most dire of emergencies, like when there's a fire in your house and you have to quickly tweet about it before you escape. Seriously, though, the trackpad is bad. It's still not a huge deal - you can get usb mice for $10 or less, so I'm definitely not regretting my purchase of this laptop just because the trackpad is awful - but having to wait UPS to bring me my mouse is killing me. So do yourself a favor and order a usb mouse when you order this laptop. You will definitely need it.
This has been a great replacement for my old laptop and recommend it to anyone looking for a good machine to work from at home.
I've had this for about two months now. This is the first laptop I have owned, and let me tell you, it is a wonderful device! It performs just as well and fast as the desktop my parents have at home (except that sometimes it doesn't like my ancient printer). The sharp edges when typing doesn't bother me and neither does the non-centered touchpad (I'm left handed). The display is fabulous, except that sometimes it looks a bit too white, which is somewhat bothersome when watching my TV shows or movies, but I don't really care about it. I also really like how lightweight and thin it is for a 15"+ laptop, although I feel guilty of brutalizing and damaging it a lot.
I had to buy two of these. The first one I bought worked great for one week, and then it completely, inexplicably stopped working. My boyfriend, suspecting that the hard drive just came a little loose, opened it up and took a look. He carefully took out the hard drive and underneath it there was a random screw just floating around in there. My guess is the problem had something to do with the screw. Who knows. Thankfully, Amazon took it back and replaced it with a new one. I was wary at first but so far, I've had it for a couple months now and it's working great. Nice computer, very powerful and fast for the VERY low price tag. Worth it!
Edges of case are too sharp and the touch pad is on the wrong side for someone right handed.
Received this laptop on Friday and I am thoroughly satisfied. Some things I have read about this model is the sharp edges yes it has sharp edgesbut not sharp enough to cut you, but might be annoying sometime in the future. One annoyance that I will need to get used to is the SPACE bar. Its smaller than a lot of other laptops and on the edges it doesn't register all the time. I will need to get used to hitting the SPACE bar more in the center. All in all, I am very pleases with the computer. And Windows 10 is more user friendly than 7 or 8 but I will need to get used to where things are located.
I love this computer!  It's perfect for me.  The edges are much less "sharp" when the tiny invisible tape is removed, but they are sharper than I'm accustomed to.  They are not sharp enough to injure me though.  The keyboard took a little while to get used to, Windows 10 took zero time to get used to (love it!), and honestly the only complaint I have is that the right and left click buttons by the mouse pad thing are a little difficult to press and hold down.<br/>Set up for me was the easiest ever, everything happened automatically.  This Grandma is thrilled with my C55!
It's not working properly it's slow it freezes up something and the track pad doesn't work properly.
I suggest that if you get it ... swap the hard disk (SATA II in a SATA III capable laptop) ... for an SSD disk.  And maybe also swap the memory up to 16 GB.  Then I think you have something that is really pretty good for a Windows 10 PC.  The USB3 ... get a LapDock from ETEKCITY and you will be OK to use up to 3 monitors at the same time (2 on the lapdock and 1 using the HDMI socket).  I use mine with external monitors and a Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard and Mouse.  Just as good as having a desktop and there is built-in UPS since it is a laptop with battery.
Really good buy for price and usability. I bought this laptop for school and work purposes and its been really good for me. Everything works and I'm really like Windows 10 on it. The feel the laptop is unique. Its perfect size for most backpacks. The battery is excellent (I did some hw at startbucks and didn't need to charge at all for the 6 hours I was there. The only draw back is that isn't not touch screen but I'm going to rate it a 5/5 because I didn't want a touch screen.<br/>This laptop would make for a very good gift for a student going to college.
Very good laptop for the price, good performance.<br/>I think is a very good deal.
Worked fine for 33 days, 3 days after Amazon's return policy.. then failed.  $500l.00 wasted on what I thought was an above average laptop.  Amazon is putting more and more products under their PRIME items which I am finding to be many to be very poor quality.  I've been a Prime member for a long time and Prime products used to be of good quality but greed is overtaking Amazon's overall  over all merchandising practice.  Stay away from 5 star reviews because Amazon edits the reviews based on their own ideas of what's good and what's not.
Light weight enough for travel. Perfect for all of my work and personal needs
Love it so far, love windows 10... it took them 10 years to get it right :-)
I've had this for about 3 months already and I have to say that this laptop offers a cheaper and better alternative to other more expensive laptops with an Intel Core 5 CPU. Generally what you're getting for a bargain here is the CPU(Central Processing Unit), the memory which is 1TB, and the durability of the laptop. This is a really fast laptop at an affordable price. Other than that, you might find that this doesn't have an anti-glare screen so you will have to manage using the laptop inside rooms whenever you're working on something instead of outside.
I received my laptop and started using. This is my third Toshiba, impressed by the size reduction, very thin.But on my second week while browsing thru Bing, a blue screen of death popped up. Tried for hours on my phone to contact Toshiba help without any luck even to speak to a human. So restored back to new. Now it would not accept password or any passwords that was given me. Amazon has already had me return it for replacement. Hope for better luck this time.
So, I've had this laptop for about 5 months and, its great! has a lot of power! the only thing that it left me wanting was a dicrete GPU. It will easily run Sony Vegas/Adobe Premier pro and Photoshop, i bought this computer to edit video and edit photos. It will play most games at low settings at 1366x768. the build quality is decent and while you type it will start to hurt and make your wrists red. Overall i really like this laptop And recommend it!
Barebones, very slow basic laptop.  Nothing to get excited about here.
Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 15.6 Inch Laptop..Toshiba makes a solid computer. Like all Toshibas , this one gives you good crisp colour. Reliable CPU. Two problems, typical of Toshibas, though. One -- there machines have fans a bit on the noisy side. The other thing is that the power bars tend to burn out. I haven't experience this yet with this machine, but I have with previous one. Keeping my fingers crossed.
So far not very impressed...first shipment did not make it to my place although showing delivered on UPS send (not Toshibas issue obviously). Amazon remedied this quickly and overnighted me a laptop. The machine worked great for 30 minutes and suddenly the screen started going crazy with lines/flickering. Issue was not resolved with a simple restart, can only imagine the graphics chip is a dud or the connection from motherboard to screen is screwy. I set up a replacement w/ Amazon and I am getting it in 2 days. Appreciative of their help but very frustrating experience so far. I have to find another box/tape/printer to send this thing back and it has my personal info on it that I cannot remove because the machine is unusable. Worried...
So far, I love it. I'm using it for home recording. I was super worried when I read some of the negative reviews on this, but it runs very fast and everything works fine so far. I haven't had wireless connection problem at all. It was very easy to set up. I'm liking Windows 10. The keyboard is fast and perfect for me. The edges aren't sharp at all (I removed the green tapes). I think it is a very good laptop. I totally recommend it!
The product is very nice for the price we paid, the only thing is that the touch pad quality is a bit low, it should have been a little better, while scrolling I had some problem. Except that the laptop is very nice and fast. Amazon Customer service was superb and excellent. They handle customer's issues in a very good manner. Overall satisfied. 5 Stars for amazon and 4 starts for toshiba
THIS IS MY SECOND TOSHIBA COMPUTER IN 7 YEARS. EXCELLENT.
Laptop is in great condition. Just right for my purposes.
I was looking for a budget laptop and researching I found this compared to items in its specs this is a good price , 8 g ram 1 tb HD , windows 8 up-gradable , its keyboard and screen res aren't the best have to tilt screen at time when power changes. so took a star for that<br/><br/>But it works well out of the box , easy setup and use , runs well under load , and its slim and light for a 15.6 unit . happy with it.
I purchased two of these laptops for me and  my wife. I have purchased a plethora of goods in my 66 years of life and I have NEVER encountered this much difficulty trying to get these laptops to work or returned.  The vendor, expected me to contact Toshiba via the internet to address configuration issues, but I am not able to connect to the internet using these laptops. There are so many issues encompassing this purchase that I could never in good conscious recommend these products to anyone. I purchased these laptops on August 7th. Since then the product has been reduced in price by $100.00. I am not surprised!<br/>.
I am enjoying this laptop. Boots and shuts downs very quickly. I reserved my Windows 10 upgrade too.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the lack of scrolling on the touchpad and the spacebar on the keyboard has to be struck in the middle or else I risk not getting spaces between words.<br/><br/>Overall I am happy with this purchase which replaces an older Acer Aspire.
I bought this for a family remember and helped with the setup. For the price, it's really excellent. It's really thin with a cool brushed metal design. Except for virus protection there's extremely little in the way of the dreaded pre-installed software. It runs great with the Core i5 processor, has a full TB of storage, and the person I bought it for is very happy with the speed and design.
this is a great laptop for my home usage. It like it.
Got exactly what I expected.  Fast processor, not much bloatware, tons of storage and RAM, good battery life, along with cheap case with sharp edges, odd sensitivity touchpad with buttons that are hard to feel (thinking trying to rough one up or add a glue bump to it), so so screen resolution, cheap keypad....but a good value none the less.  I am a happy camper.
Be sure to run Windows update and also if you find a problem with Edge opening previous tabs after forced shutdown like I did here's how to fix it http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/edge-browser-stop-tab-restore One more thing the screen doesn't have a great viewing range before the contrast is bad but if you are reasonably facing the screen the picture is great.
I have had this product for two days now and I love it. I did upgrade it from 8 gigabytes of ram to 16 gigabytes. Some reviews said it's flimsy while others did not. I expected it to be flimsy and I can confirm it is. As long as you don't mess with it and bend it, it will be fine.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great product especially for the price.
I prefer the touch pad mouse to be sunken on the console, as it is easier to find without looking, rather than being raised. The only real complaint I had was that the Touch Pad software wasn't properly installed , which I had to reinstall. Windows 10 is not as good visually as Windows 7, which is also more intuitive.
Great laptop for the price... I use it for everything, Personal, Gamming, School, Work.<br/>The battery life is pretty good no complaints a good 8 hours for school and work and a good 5-6 hours gamming.<br/>Windows 10 is pretty nice.<br/>I personally don't have a problem with this laptop, it's great.
Inexpensive and functions just as expected.
I loved it for the first 30 hours used, then it just died.  Do not get the Toshiba page, just a bland screen.  Very quiet ticking sound.  Barely used and does not work.  I am very disappointed and would not recommend this laptop.  It has never been in a situation to overheat.  Have no idea what the problem is.
I purchased this computer for a gift and the person who received it is very happy.  He had a small problem with the computer, which turned out to be his fault.  He called Toshiba and they were on the phone with him for an hour, never rushing him.  No more  problems and the computer works great.
This was returned the Customer Service at Toshiba was very very bad we had the computer less than 24 hours could not get it to work called customer service ended up costing us $100.00 they claim it had a<br/>virus they would not take the charge off even when we said we were going to return the computer.
Ok.. It works well. Windows 10 for my age group is a challenge as I really need a teenager. I have most things working found a class on this. Over all I happy with this computer was very worried doing this over amazon shipping an then working.  Sooo I'm still cross fingers but happy.
This laptop is very functional, it has a lot of storage space and the keys are easy to see in the night. I never taught that I would love a laptop this much, only one thing I'm disappointed in is that, it attracts dust because of its colour. But it is a good buy for everyday use.
I really loved this notebook. For the price that I paid it completely cover my needs.<br/>And also it already comes with Windows 10 installed. I also loved this OS.<br/>It's a great buy! I recommend.<br/>But not everything in this OS can have the language changed (like the start menu).
Even though it has an i5 processor instead of an i3, like my previous Toshiba Satellite, I didn't notice a big difference in speed or improved performance. Windows 10 is kind of a pain at first, but I'm getting used to it. The space bar sticks a bit, which is also annoying.
Performance and quality is superb, however the screen come with a dead pixel right in the center. It's possible to received some kind of assistance on this? This device was sold directly by Amazon and so far I couldn't find how to ask them directly. I know... Sounds silly.
Love it so far was very easy to set up
The first one I ordered had a messed up fan that sounded as if it was hitting the side wall. I returned it free of charge and reordered a new one. The current one is perfect. Long battery life, fast, looks professional, and is a great deal for the price!!!
I got this computer a few days ago and I love it so far. I do not need a computer to do anything fancy, just something that can run some of my compilers and to serf the web with. This computer does all that and more. For 450$ price tag, you cant beat it.
This laptop is a lot better than expected! I bought it just to play league of legends and got 60 fps top graphics. Downloaded fallout new Vegas to try and it is great on ultra graphics. If you're looking for a gaming laptop this one would be a strong choice
I should have bought this sooner....
I have had this laptop for over a month now .I like that it boots in less than a minute ,with Windows10 it's fast .I paid far less than I thought I would .It has a great screen very sharp ,also sharp edges the only negative .I like this laptop a lot .
This computer is not worth your money! The keys and mouse stick a lot.  It is very poorly made and the edges are uncomfortable to rest your arms on. The only reason I gave it two stars was how fast it came and how quickly they picked up the return.
The plastic surrounding the screen was separated from the screen when I received the laptop. A replacement laptop had the same problem.  Amazon facilitated a call to Toshiba but the manufacturer was less than helpful.  Returned and bought a different brand.
Its a lower end laptop for sure.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Modern Processor with Broadwell<br/>8 gig ram<br/>1 tb hard drive ( but slow see below)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>Screen is not very good.  Despite the lower resolution than more expensive laptops, the panel has pretty bad contrast and viewing angles.  I've seen displays at the same resolution be much better.  The low contrast is particularly bad as everything looks washed out.<br/><br/>No discrete graphics. Not a big deal if you don't plan to game on the laptop but it will not do much graphically, although it can output video to a monitor at a decent resolution.<br/><br/>Speakers--I send this back as I was worried my laptop was defective--they seem to have a good location (on body of machine next to display) but volume output was awful.  I realize it won't be great speakers, but this was pretty bad. Your mileage may vary as I'm not sure if they were defective or not.<br/><br/>Keyboard--not great.  Travel and force actuation needed to type are not good..  This is not a click-clack keyboard--more like mush. I have certainly had some worse ones.  I do not think this would be a favorite keyboard for a touch typist.  At least the keys have decent size, have an island style spacing and a full keypad<br/><br/>Webcam--Meh.  Nothing special.  There are array micophones but did not get a chance to test very extensively. Set up to work with Cortana voice assist and microsoft windows 10.<br/><br/>DVD--one of the few new machines you can get that still comes with a dvd player/burner.  Did not use.  Sadly no playing blue rays on this thing (without an extra blue ray player!)<br/><br/>1 TB hard drive--it is slow even for a standard hard drive and much much slower than an ssd .  But at least there is plenty of room for storing data!<br/><br/>If you need a starter computer that won't travel much, this is a decent deal if you can get it for less than $500.  Any more than that and you might be overpaying.  Some are very sensitive to poor displays and you have to consider eyestrain from looking at blocky text with poor contrast for hours on end.  But using with an external monitor is a thought.<br/><br/>I do not think this is a machine that has easy access to internals due to the  size and thin profile.  So while the memory is not soldered on, having to dis-assembly most of the machine to get access to it is not fun either.<br/><br/>Battery life--I think this is still too big to really move around too much so don't get your hopes up.<br/><br/>Build quality--mostly plastic, nothing special, this is not a machine to worry about build quality given the price range.  This is a step above windows machines designed to compete with chrome books.  At least the memory, processor and hard drive are MUCH better than a cheap hp steam laptop.  But the display is the worst of the bunch (and possibly most important in a laptop).<br/><br/>Its a good basic machine with some flaws but the price does help.  Still, a better display would have helped a lot.<br/><br/>Remember, do not pay more than $500 if you can help it.  The dell inspirion  11 or 13 have IPS displays at the same resolution with easy to modify internals to add memory or a different hard drive.  They might range higher in price but probably worth it.
Round number 2 with a Toshiba Satellite lap top. So far I like the Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241. It seems to be a bit quicker than the last Toshiba I ordered (and had to send back with a problem)<br/><br/>Yes, I would recommend for a friend.
The corners are a bit sharp like the other reviews have stated. I haven't had any problems with it so far, in any way. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a blacklit keyboard, but honestly this is a great laptop for the price.
Very nice computer for the price.
This is a very nice laptop, I have had mine for about 3 weeks now and I have experienced 0 difficulties, would be great if it had more USB ports and it will not use external sound if you use the HDMI port for an extra monitor.
I hated this computer.  I had it two weeks to "try to get used to it" before throwing it in the towel.  Please look at the negative reviews.  More than once, I had to disable the wifi because it wouldn't connect- despite another computer having no problem connecting to it.  The keyboard is TERRIBLE. The space bar is located too far away from the "M" (it actually ends in the middle of it", and because of how the key is situated, won't actually press down unless you press in the middle of the key...causing A LOT of deleting just to go back to hit the space bar.  It's super annoying.<br/><br/>I just started school up again (post-masters) and I wanted an upgrade from my Mac (2008).  The Mac still runs, but doesn't update anything.  I read all the reviews and this seemed like a great computer.  It is incredibly slow when you first turn it on, and any time it actually shuts down, starting seems to take forever.  The speakers are also crappy.  I have to participate in a lot of conference calls, and the speakers have actually given me a headache with all the feedback.  The touch pad is super finicky too - even if you barely touch it, all of a sudden everythnig you've typed is highlighted.  And then deleted if you don't catch it in time.<br/><br/>I use this a lot to type, so the keyboard and touch pad issues were too big a nuisance for me to ignore. Amazon has great costumer service though, and allowed me a month to return it.  I've bought another computer and am able to return this when that arrives.<br/><br/>I will probably not buy a Toshiba again.
Just got it and like it so far.
Ok, lets be clear about what this is-- its a good midrange laptop. Compared to something like a Macbook Air its a dinosaur, but guess what? It also costs half as much.<br/><br/>Things I liked:<br/>* Came with very little crapware pre-installed.<br/>* Attractive styling.<br/>* Reasonable battery life.<br/>* Large screen.<br/>* Comes with DVD-ROM.<br/>* Reasonably fast.<br/><br/>Things I disliked:<br/>* Screen is washed.<br/>* Fairly Bulky<br/>* DVD-ROM drawer felt very flimsy.<br/>* Top of laptop scratches very easily-- it hasn't left the house yet and I have a number of scratches.<br/><br/>This lappy comes with Windows 10, and its a bit of a mixed bag. It's better than 8 for sure but it still feels awkward and strange. The OS has advertisements for products built in (mostly Microsoft stuff) which I absolutely DESPISE. Please not that this is not Toshiba's fault, and you're going to have this same problem with any Windows machine.<br/><br/>My overall feeling about this laptop is it would be a great machine for a kid going off to college or someone with a moderate workload. I would get something a little sturdier if I was a road warrior or a littler faster if I had a heavy workload, but overall its a nice machine for the price.<br/><br/>The real question however for any laptop is reliability, and that is what I suspect might be Toshiba's weakness. I plan to run this laptop 24/7 with a heavy workload to see if I can break it. I will report back very few weeks.<br/><br/>**UPDATE: As of Monday August 17th, laptop has been running for 24/7 for one week and works fine.<br/>**UPDATE: November 22nd. System has been running continuously under load for 3 months now with no problems.
Good all around home computer.
So far, So good. Seems to do everything well. For average user, anyway. Yes, there are bigger, better, faster systems available. But, not near this price point. At this point, very pleased with this product.
Before buying this laptop, I had read some good reviews and some not so good, so I had mixed feelings.<br/>Now I had it for a few days and I am very happy with it. Let me explain why.<br/>First the price. It's a deal with this config, Intel I-5, DVD player, 8 Gb RAM, 1 Tb HDD.<br/>For this price, of course I did not expect a SSD, but in a few months, if prices drop down, I may swap the HDD for a SSD.<br/>I won't say anything about Windows 10 because, so far I don't see what is better than Windows 7 that I used with my former laptop. On the contrary, it takes some time to do correct settings if one wants to avoid all the spying which is activated by default.<br/>The laptop seems reasonably happy with 8 Gb RAM. Windows 10 starts in less than 30', including a password.  I installed several of my favorite programs, including Microsoft Office and everything works fine.<br/>Some people don't like the keyboard (rubber feeling) but for me it's not really a problem. Yes it reminds me of the first Atari computers in the early 80s. However, what I like is the numeric keyboard.<br/>The screen is bright and OK to view movies. Beware, there is a tiny button to eject the DVD tray, so small that it is almost impossible to see it. To make it more convenient, I stuck a small white mark on it, and now it's okay.<br/>Overall, this laptop is fast enough for most uses. And again for the price it is difficult to beat.
Arrived quickly. Great laptop. Very fast. Screen is beautiful. Good sound. Attractive case. Windows 10 is also very fast. Very similar to Windows 7 and more sophisticated. Works great on Wi-Fi
I'm satisfied, no problems.
Decent for price, but you're better off spending more money and getting something better. I bought this in August and it constantly freezes and is slow. I already want to replace it.

great laptop for the price
Great laptop for the price !!!<br/>Only problem is couldn't able connect with WIFI or USB tethering . I think it is bec of OS driver problem .Please let me know how to fix this issue
I have been using this new laptop for a couple of weeks now and it runs great.  It is full of speed and very light to carry around.  I am also impressed with the battery life to date.
Love this computer. Works fast, only strange thing is that the corners on the bottom of computer are kind sharp, and if you lay you hands on it while typing it may hurt a little.
I knew when I saw the price it had to be too good to be true, but I went against my gut and bought this computer.  When I got it, it was nice.  It is thin, lightweight, and nice looking.  The picture resolution was sharp and clear.  And the computer was fast, the internet was quick, everything was great... for... about a week.  Then, it gave up on me.  It is a piece of JUNK!  The internet wont work, it stay connected.  I have my old computer still, it stays connected to the internet no problem.  I took it to work... it wouldn't hold the internet connection there either.  It will connect, then it will say my connection is limited, I disconnect and reconnect, and then it drops my service.  I cant even load a simple web page without it dropping the connection.  I regret my purchase, I hate the computer, and now I am stuck.  I bought this for graduate school, and it has failed me.  STAY AWAY, DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER, AVOID AT ALL COST, YOU WILL REGRET IT!
Works great. The only problem i had was when I tried to add more RAM. The computer wouldn't turn on. That said, I have been fine without the additional RAM. Pretty smooth
A great laptop without a huge cost. The Toshiba C55-C5241 is fast and convenient. I recommend this budget friendly laptop to anyone wanting quality at a low price.
A powerful laptop at a great price.  I was a little disappointed that the monitor was 1366x768, as I wanted to do some serious photo editing and assumed it would be 1920x1080.  Oh well, it still looks nice and glossy.<br/><br/>Touchpad was responsive, but I only tried it briefly as I use a mouse on all my laptops.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed to learn that the wireless adapter was 802.11n rather than 802.11ac, again assuming that a computer built in 2015 would have modern components.  Not a huge deal, but it irked me.<br/><br/>The small issues aside, when I look at the price and look at the machine in front of me it's hard to complain.  There's some serious horsepower here, running WoW and all my office apps while silently cooling that core i5 (it really is silent) not to mention the 1TB HDD (5400RPM but it seems zippy) and 8GB of ram (upgradeable to 16.)  One pleasant surprise was the lack of bloatware - this is just a pure stock windows experience.  Imagine buying a new computer and not immediately having to uninstall all the manufacturer BS.  Thank you Toshiba, I hope more companies follow your lead.
I was very happy with this purchase at first. Less than a month after I received the laptop the hard drive failed. Unable to boot or access the drive in any way, I called Toshiba for warranty service. I would have returned it to Amazon, but they would not take it back.<br/><br/>12 days after I called Toshiba and made arrangements to ship it in for service (at the cost of $29.99 for shipping and a box and 45 minutes on the phone) I received a box to use for shipping the laptop to their repair depot. The box was too small. I am now waiting to hear back from Toshiba to see if they are able to ship me a new box that will fit as the person I spoke with on the phone could not tell me one way or the other. I was able to use the machine for 27 days. I've now been without its use for 12 days.<br/><br/>The machine was fine until the hard drive failed. However, the extremely premature failure and Toshiba's awful level of service after the sale leads me to give a 2 star rating. I would not recommend purchasing this laptop and will not be purchasing any more Toshiba products in the future.
Honestly, I grabbed this laptop to go to my daughter who is now playing on the computer like her parents do.  Since she is still young, I didn't want something that was too high end or heavy.  I don't understand why people don't pay attention to weight in laptops, but this is right around 4lbs and is relatively light compared to my laptop.<br/><br/>Since I have received the laptop and began to set it up, I have decided to keep this one and give my daughter my older laptop.  This is a nice machine.  It runs quickly.  I've loaded up a few games, a video player, Adobe creative cloud, and the MS Office suite.  All of them are running smoothly without an issue.  I unloaded some of the preloaded software and added my own antivirus.  It has not disappointed me at all.  The screen is clear and bright, the graphics are good for the specs, and the speakers are pretty decent as well.  I've watched a few DVDs on it without an issue.<br/><br/>Toshiba is always a brand that I go to for laptops and this one lives up to the brand name.  Great deal for a great little machine!
it is a good value.  I got the windows 10 updgrade the day it was released - very easy change - make sure it is set to automatically install windows updates.
Good for a starter Windows 10 laptop. Upgraded to Pro as I work in IT and needed to test out the OS on hardware built for it. Biggest issue with this specific laptop is the lack of ac Wi-Fi connectivity which I fixed with a small USB adapter. As it has been said in other reviews, both the RAM and the HDD can be replaced/upgraded as long as it's with compatible hardware(don't blame me if you void your warranty). Also, booted off of a live Linux Distribution USB(Kali Linux 2.0 x64) which recognized all hardware except the built in Wi-Fi with no extra configuration. I will be trying with a more popular Linux Distribution to see if it detects the Wi-fi hardware without addition configuration. Based on what I've seen with this laptop and Windows 10 Pro, I can see corporations adopting Windows 10(Windows 8 and 8.1 had little to no chance of mass corporate adoption) as well as home consumers adopting the OS. It is clear that it is easily useable with or without the need of a touchscreen.  I have also tested Cortana and XBOX One compatibility with this device and am thoroughly impressed.
I am a bit disappointed at how fast the battery goes down, and constantly having to re charge the laptop.  Otherwise everything is really fast and convenient.
It was a disaster from the start. It was slower than our old laptops  and couldn't pick up the WiFi. I thought that it was defected from the factory.
I was looking for a modestly priced laptop. I picked up this Toshiba, and so far, I'm very satisfied with it. It's plenty fast enough for what I use it for.
This is one of the most difficult reviews I've had to write. I am so torn about whether I really like this laptop, or not. I've been using this Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 for two weeks. Performance wise, I have had very few issues with it. When I first started using the laptop, it would freeze up, and I would have to reboot. Fortunately, that issue appears  to have corrected itself, and is now operating perfectly.<br/>The laptop is speedy, but as you would expect for the money, it is a basic model. My real complaints are with the keyboard, and housing. I've never had a laptop that came in a plastic housing; it's like playing with a Fisher Price toy. The keyboard is very soft, and the track pad is challenging. It's really hard to believe that this laptop will last for any length of time. But to be fair, considering the price point on this laptop, it has a lot going for it, and I have not seen anything that can equal it. So if your interested in a good, low cost, workhorse, this computer might fit the bill.
Really liked the relation between price and what you get.<br/>Laptop has a proper performance and I liked the design (Witch  is  simple by the way)
Perfect for my daughter in college......Toshiba Satellite series has always been the most reliable laptops I have owned. Great price and well built!
Great laptop. Very stylish and wood looking laptop. My first ever experience to feel wood on laptops. You know, laptops are made of metals and coated with plastic/synthetic materials. Unlike any other laptops that I've had before, this one reminds me of nature. This is the extra pleasure you get from this laptop. That's why I give it as a gift to someone I love.<br/>It is easy to carry and move around. The battery is small compare with other laptop batteries which is again easy to carry/lift.<br/>The only concern that I noticed, sometimes when I watched videos from youtube, the videos looked very disoriented and cracked, weird look figures as in wave looking pictures displayed on the screen briefly. I am not sure if this is from the quality of those video clips on youtube or from the screen capability of this laptop. Please double check that part.<br/><br/>Overall speaking, it is a unique product. With all the defects I like it and I won't hesitate to buy it again.
I wanted a laptop and this one works. Although I have already had to reset it back to factory.  The audio was working one day and then It wasn't.
There are few things to complain about this beauty, i have used it for 1 week straight and the only thing i hate is the windows 10 home edition.
This is a great laptop for windows 10. The only thing I don't get is why Cortona will not verbally talk to me.<br/>The monitor is outstanding!
Great product, the hardware is very good, the only thing is that the buttons are a little hard, the software is cool, just adapt to Windows 10
So far so good, sort of.  First to note, I have had two previous versions of the Satellite with and Icore3 and one with an Icore5.  I have been very pleased with the previous versions of the computer.  My daughter still uses the Icore3 version from over 6 years ago and it works great.<br/><br/>This model, although much lighter than previous versions, is a little sharp along the edges and the key board is not quite as nice, but still okay.  I did have one problem with the computer not being able to access the internet on the WiFi after I was on another network.  I couldn't figure out what the issue was so I went to the blogs to figure it out.  Seems the Network Adapter has some issue with Windows 10, possibly.  It got too techie for me, so I just reset my computer to when I received it.  I haven't had the problem since.  Not sure what happened.<br/><br/>For the price it has been a very good deal.
Worth the money. Case is cheap and thin so not made for rough use. Keyboard is slow. Screen OK, not great due to narrow viewing andle.
It worked very well, I have found only a small sound and aesthetic defect. But in the rest of the functions it has worked wonderfully.
It was exactly what I expected. Aside from the fact that I can't connect it to the projectors on campus for presentations, I love it.
Dressed in Toshiba’s brand-new, modern, textured resin finish in matte black, the Satellite C55 laptop delivers sleek styling. Type comfortably on contoured keys housed in a frameless style designed to minimize key bounce and point, and scroll and swipe your way through it all on a roomy multigesture touchpad.<br/>A spacious 15.6-inch diagonal, widescreen HD (1366 x768), TruBrite display not only gives you plenty of room to work, it delivers excellent color and contrast for browsing, watching, playing, creating and more<br/>Equipped with a massive one terabyte hard drive, this Satellite C55 laptop lets you enjoy the convenience of storing your most important stuff—from thousands of files, photos, videos, pictures, music and apps—all on your laptop. And with the convenience of a built-in DVD drive, you can easily back up and share all your files, whenever you choose
This is a quad core laptop which it seemed wasn't clear anywhere on the website. I'm a pc gamer and bought this to program since I Have old laptop that doesn't quite work well anymore.<br/><br/>Pros.<br/>It runs Visual Studio 2013 pretty well<br/>Can run league of legends at about 40-60 fps depending on settings.<br/>It can probably run some games on low to medium settings<br/>Battery life is ok,<br/>1TB(912GB) hard drive more than most people would probably use<br/>sd card reader<br/>built in  bluetooth you could probably sync ps4 controllers and play some games through steam this way if you wanted<br/><br/>CONS<br/>the mouse track thing has horrible response, and the material feels weird too, Recommend getting any kind of mouse<br/>when typing the mouse track can ruin whatever it is your are typing if you are not careful<br/>keyboard can take time getting use to<br/><br/>Still worth getting if you ask me
I bought this for work. It's got good stats and seems like an ok computer. Maybe it just can't handle windows 10 though. The fan is constantly running - having chrome, outlook, and MS excel open at the same time is just too much for its CPU. Really annoying having the fan turn on and off constantly all day long. I've even had coworkers ask what the noise was when we were on a video conference call.<br/><br/>I ended up turning off all of windows 10 automatic features, like notifications, updates, etc., and that solved the fan issue for awhile. I just installed itunes so I can manage my music on my phone, and now the noise is starting again.<br/><br/>This is a fine computer if you work in a noisy place or you want to wear headphones all day. Otherwise, it's distracting and underpowered.
Bought this for my granddaughter for college. She absolutely lives this computer!  Says it makes her work soooo much easier.
Only problem I had was the screws on the bottom falling out and that is about it. Fits my needs and I am glad it works.
So far so good.  I have only had it a few weeks and I like it.  I went 4 stars as it would have to be awesome to get 5.
Windows 10 is a huge learning curve for me coming from Windows XP! Other than that it a great laptop at a great price!
I loved my old Toshiba laptop with just a few complaints.  The sound quality was the biggest issue- you could barely hear anything using the speaker.  That has dramatically improved with this model.  I have no problems at all with the sound.  Overall, I like this laptop, but again with a few complaints.  I'm not a huge fan of the keyboard (I liked the one on my old Toshiba a lot better).  I also find the WiFi doesn't seem to work as well.  There are areas in my house where the signal strength is low, which never happened with my old one. I know some people didn't like the sharp front edge.  Although it is oddly sharp, I don't have a problem with it when I rest my wrists on the edge, but I could see how that could be a problem for some people.  Other than that, I have had no concerns about this laptop for the 3 or so weeks I've been using it.
What an awful experience.<br/><br/>Laptop performance seems ok except for wifi. I barely get a signal at 5 ft away, at 10 ft, can't connect at all. Tried troubleshooting myself, followed all of Toshiba's utterly worthless guides and eventually called them. That went even worse. Toshiba's support person barely had a clue what a computer even was and recommended that I pay to ship it out to one of their service teams. At that point I had the laptop less than 48 hours. Done trying to troubleshoot what seems like a fairly common problem with this laptop and will just return it. It was my first Toshiba, and given the problems encountered and the absolutely atrocious service, it will certainly be my last.
Alot Of Plastic, Runs Smooth, Ask For Better Packing, Before They Ship, Request It....... All Round Very Good Product
Easy to operate.
Extremely fast in boot up beat my Lenovo by several minutes. Windows 10 takes some getting used to though.
Love everything about it. It runs smoothly and plays games significantly better than the intel I3. Highly recommend.
The physical aspect of the laptop is fine. Still making adjustments to working with Windows 10 after forever with 7.
toshiba makes a great tv however this computer is a hi tech piece of junk.  I sent the first unit back because it wouln't connect to the internet.<br/>The second unit worked a week and, when I got a new router, this unit wouldn't connect to the internet.  It obviously has a major problem with its<br/>wifi circuits and drivers.  The second unit went back and I'm waiting for a refund from Amazon.  I will never buy a Toshiba product again.  As for their tech support, it is non existent.  I tried callimg their help line and was on hold for over an hour.  I now have an h p laptop and in two hours spent more quality time on my new laptop than I did in two weeks with toshiba's laptop.
if you are considering to buy a laptop for a low price and an excellent performance this one fit perfect for you.
Great value.  Our second Toshiba laptop and likely not our last.  Good product packed with lots of nice features.
Very thin and sleek styling with a few drawbacks.<br/>The CONS first: The cursor is very sensitive, it will click when your not ready and when you are it stalls.<br/>The keyboard also sticks, you have to really be mindful when typing.<br/>The resin finish leaves a lot of finger marks<br/><br/>Other then that it is very fast, logging on for the first time and setting everything up was very quick.<br/>The charger is small, kind of short too, but it can be used with any other Toshiba charger.<br/>NOTE: Your Headphone and Microphone jack will be together and on the right side of the laptop.<br/> It has a very bright display.<br/>The sound is a lot better then other laptops.<br/>Voice detection linked with Cortana and quick WiFi
this ever powerful laptop lets me play high end games without heating up too much. gamer-friendly device indeed!
I like this computer except for its RAZOR SHARP EDGE. You must use a mouse with this or your hands will hurt.
we like the computer but are having alot of trouble<br/>adjusting to windows 10<br/>giving us grief
computer will not work when using the HDMI out put wish i could get help to fix this issue
Limited features but a great product for the price. In operation for 1 month and functions properly.
I was looking for a laptop mainly for gaming and for school, and it fits both needs. For this price, this laptop can run big games like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, Garry's Mod, Rocket League, and more, all at 100 fps on average! This is the best cheap option out there. I also really love the new Windows 10 OS. It's simple to use, and all in all pretty aesthetically appealing. The only flaws are that it has a slow boot-up, due to the lack of a solid state drive, and occasionally the internet is slow as well, but maybe it's just mine. I highly recommend this, and I took one star off just because of the boot-up.
I was satisfied with the specs of this laptop but the only thing that it lacked was screen resolution. Come on really, 1366x768... My Lenovo T61 is an 8 year old laptop and has a higher screen resolution than this. This laptop was on sale so I just bought it and looked at every singe spec besides the resolution.<br/><br/>CON: Not even an hour into owning this laptop, when it goes to restart for the first time it says windows failed to boot and has to go through system recovery. So it turns out that every time i restart the computer, it goes into system recovery and the hard drive cannot find the boot files. This is such a big waste of my time.
Love it!<br/>Light weight, great graphics and it does everything I need it to...<br/>5 Stars..!!
Excellent really good fast and useful for programming.<br/>really recommended for price worth it
This is the best laptop I've found by far!!! Even though its $500 its definitely worth your money
so far so good, the computer came with a few scratches and the optical disc drive wasn't working at first but i was able to making it fuctional by playing arround with the configurations.  I've been running stress analysis programs and the C55-C5240 has held it's ground so it has some performance but it does have some issues, sometimes is difficult to get a wi-fi connection and the factory settings for the mousepad sucks so much i initialy believed the mousepad was broken. The speakers are ok for watching funny videos and movies but if you wan't to hear some music better use headphones. I have to say i'm still scared about the 1 star reviews i've seen but my laptop is running great at the moment.
Great laptop for the money. Toshiba has never let me down.  Light weight with good battery life.
Do not buy this laptop!  I spent 12 hours just to get it to connect to internet and turn on.  The tech support center is ONLY in the Philippines.  I wasted an entire day talking to a variety of techs.  It must be a small operation as there is only ONE Level 2 Technician and the others couldn't get the computer to work.  My last Toshiba lasted 10+ years.... and so I was excited to get another Toshiba, expecting the same level of excellence.  DO NOT BUY ONLINE.  Make sure to purchase from a store where it's easy to purchase, get support and return!
i like the toshiba because that is what i have had in the past.  windows 10 that is another story.  unless you use all the bells and whistles its nothing fantastic.  i have a problem with staying connected to internet...the other two laptops in the house can be sitting side by side with this one and this one will loose connection .  also dont try to shut it down...it gets so far and you get a blue screen and the message dont shut it down while it is restarting???????even control alt delete doesnt do anything.  it will get in this place and stay like that for hours.  if  i could change the operating system i would.
No problems with laptop. Easy setup. The corners are very sharp as indicated in other reviews.
The laptop is thin. It is sleek and professional looking, with a black faux-metalized look. There were lots of plastic strips along all of the edges that had to be removed. These strips of plastic serve as scratch protection during shipping I suppose. The design style of this laptop is nice. I like the textured look and the black color. The sculpted lines of the sides of this laptop are attractive as well, but make touching the DVD drive button a little difficult. To place a disc in, I had to tilt the laptop up a bit to get my finger over and under the side to press the button to pop out the tray.
Been a month since I purchased it and this product has so far lived up to my expectations. :)
Using this laptop for work as well as for gaming. Works like a charm, highly recommend this.
Overall really nice! The only setback is its screen display. The screen seems glossy to me.
It's a good product. Not the best, but budget friendly. A real deal for the money you pay.
For the price it is a fine computer, my criticisms have been stated in other reviews but I will repeat them.<br/>1. Sharp edges make keying uncomfortable - I am using a wireless keyboard and mouse when I use it at home,<br/>and that works very well.<br/>2. The notifications contained in the packaging that this unit contains lead, and that a [person should always<br/>wash their hands after using the computer is concerning, but again most of my usage is t home using the wireless keyboard and mouse.<br/><br/>The computer performs well and is certainly worth the price.
Bought this for my granddaughter who is just starting College this year and she loved it!
Dead on arrival. Blank screen. Everything else seemed to work, but no display.
Love the laptop. The sleek design looks better in person (its not as generic as in the photo) & Win 10 is fairly straight forward (still trying to hunt down controls to tweak tho). The hard keys and sharp edges other reviewers mentioned, I dont even notice. The only problem with the laptop was that the dvd/cd drive was defective and it could not recognize a dvd/cd. I contacted Toshiba who troubleshooted, determined it was defective and they sent me back to Amazon where I am getting a replacement in 3 days. Since Im in grad school, I really appreciate the quick exchange. So so far, so good. I would recommend this laptop to my family & friends.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've has this laptop since 9/3 and thought I should add a couple of things: The graphics are not MacBook good, there is a lot of distortion at angles, colors are not true and I really didn't notice how flexible & fragile the outside shell was when I bought it. I'm thinking about getting a hard shell to protect it. Also, I have not had any Wifi problems as other reviewers have had, I sometimes switch connections 2-3 times a day so I guess that problem is hit or miss.
Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the Toshiba Satellite. It has all the functions I need and more. The new Windows 10 is a bit of a pain, but as the time goes by its getting easier to get use to. It loads quickly and smoothly, has excellent screen and graphics, and loads of features and extras to satisfy a novice, student or professional, with the added bonus of being at a very affordable price.<br/>So in the humble opinion of one who has owned an Asus, HP and Mac, anyone looking for a new computer need look no further than this great pc.
It is alright for the price but the disc drive will not stay shut. It constantly opens to have you put a disc in even when you don't push the button to open it. In addition the front of the laptop is sharp and will hurt your hands after using it for a little bit. I am hoping they will allow me to return it. It drives me crazy that the disc slot will not stay shut!
For the price this laptop is great. I was expecting it to be a little faster though.
great lap top , has it all for nice price.  no problems at all ...fast starting too
This is second my second Toshiba laptop. So far I am very happy with this M Series.
Don't buy this product!  Mine was shipped with a bad battery which cannot be user replaced.  I have to ship the whole unit back, after I had already downloaded all of my information into it, and will not have a laptop back again for who knows how long.  This is an example of very poor quality control by Toshiba.  Toshiba used to be a reliable brand, I can see it is not anymore.  This is a very disappointing result from what used to be an excellent company.
I bought this laptop because it has the 8 gigs of RAM, a I-5 processor, and 1 TB  memory. The price seemed like a good one. I have found the product to have a cheap plastic casing, a horrible touch pad, and a cursor that freezes up and takes a long time to figure out how to free it. The cursor problem is my #1 complaint. I have read the Toshiba forums and have found this is a problem in several different models and has been going on for years.
This is a wonderful computer I am very happy with my choice. Thank you very much
Excellent laptop for the value!! Love using it.  Description was very accurate.
Great computer! Great deal! Buy one while they still have them for this price.
Hard to rate a review when only had the laptop opened on on for couple of hours but it was long enough to go crazy thinking the screen was ever going to stop shaking.  Gut feeling told me to just return it and it will go back ASAP. Very disappointed because it had good reviews but must have been a lemon😢 and to be honest the material on keyboard seemed a little cheap and bent up slightly in one corner.<br/><br/>Hope this was lemon and others continue with their success on their purchase.
The operating system is a little hard to get use to, but it is a great laptop
Laptop works well. Not a fan of the one drive.  Definitely worth the purchase
Excellent computer. Had to get used to Windows 8. Love this computer though.
The laptop came damaged, as there was a permanent faded bluish grey streak in the middle of the screen when turned on about 3 or 4 inches long. Also, I didn't like the keyboard at all, as others have posted as well, it felt cheap and hard to know if you were keying accurately because the keys didn't press down very deeply or with any resistance. I guess not a big deal if you use an external keyboard, but this was the main reason I didn't order a Toshiba after returning this one
good price
I was looking for a replacement for my 14" Toshiba (I think the hard drive is going bad after 4 yrs) This unit is a great deal! nice looking, I forgot about the keyboard setup. I like the numbers on the side. Speed? This is fast!  I did read the reviews before purchasing.  I feel some reviews were overly critical of this unit. True, the edges of this unit is rather sharp,  but no problem so far. Nothing that a super fine file, won't take care of. This is a lot of bang, for the buck. Plus, it fits in my 14" bag, weighs the same! Lol!
Computer is OK - kind of.  I'm running a desktop monitor, to use it like a pc, and the monitor goes blank for a few seconds every once in a while.<br/><br/>Don't like windows 10.  Seems like any time you want to do anything, you have to sign into your Microsoft account.<br/>Couldn't get the email program to work...finally gave up and installed Thunderbird - that works well.
Works well.  Would rebuy.  Did take a little getting used to at first.
I got one for my son. It arrived yesterday and never worked. I started the setup process then while it said it may take a few minutes, I picked my son up from school. When I returned the screen was frozen. I had to hold the power button down to get it to shutdown. After that it never came back on.  The website said that" troubleshooting indicates that repairs are required. Really on a new out the box Christmas gift! Bad investment !!!
Works great for my needs.  Didn't realize it didn't come with office.
Awesome TV!  Clarity of pictures is exceptional and very easy to use.
This machine is outstanding.  the limitation is the slow hard drive.
This is a great laptop for the price.  I haven't tried to play games on it yet but it works great for work.  It isn't touch screen.  It has an i5 processor with 1.0 TB of ram which is hard to find for the price of this laptop.  Picture is great.  It does run Windows 8.1 which nobody likes but I plan to upgrade to Windows 10.  I would definitely recommend this laptop if you are looking for a great laptop with a low price tag.
I gave this to my wife and she loves it * she is always thanking me
very dissatisfied. Had issues turning on upon first use, then the mouse stopped working. sent in for a replacement and got a refurbished computer, with apps and spam from previous owner. I would never recommend =(
The Microsoft 10 software is too complicated for the likes of me
For the price, it works miracles. I have no issues at all.
Complete junk.<br/>This laptop will not hold a connection to my home or work network.<br/>I've downloaded the new drivers for the network card, that did not solve the problem.<br/>Then the laptop went completely blank after restarting every hour because of updates.<br/>Returning to Amazon.
Excellent laptop, I loved it: it's big, fast and elegant.
I have had my Toshiba Satellite for over a year and it worked great for about 6 months.  At that point the wheels started to fall off and one thing after another has gone bad.  I have spent more hours than I wanted to trying to get functions that used to work to repair, but no luck.  My advice, buy another laptop!  This one is nothing but headaches.
Have had it for about 6 weeks so far and have no complaints.  Can't understand others' complaints about the sharp edge or keyboard; I don't have a problem with either.  My only hesitation about giving it a 5 star is that one week after I got this Toshiba, my 2+ year old previous Toshiba laptop fan gave out.  Hummm....  So far so good on this one.
Value for money. I am not sure about thoshiba's Service.
love it it works great and the video quality is amazing
I found this notebook as I expected but with a major issue.I always remove the battery from the notebook because I use it most of the time on my desk. The battery powers also the internal clock, so everytime I turn on the notebook I've got to adjust the time and date on the bios.Come on Toshiba a simple battery to maintain the clock!!!
Laptop arrived on time, Great product Works perfectly.
Great but sharp edge cuts up your wrists. poor design.
Terrible quality, stay away. Bought a C55 2 years ago by counting on the specs. The keyboard was designed for a one finger typewriter, impossible to type at a reasobable speed. Touchpad was not responsive at all. After 10 months display developed black lines, lines of faulty pixels. I spent around a week talking on the with the tech support for hours just to get an address to ship the laptop to. The tech support had no technical knowledge whatsoever. I bet they could not tell if I was talking about a laptop display or a rotten tomato. When finally I shipped the laptop for warranty service they sent me a bill for about more than half the price of the laptop and they could not provide me any diagnosis. After another round of talk with tech support, who cam merely read the text in front of them to me instead of listening me or answering questions I was able to their supervisor. I belive only distinguishing quality of her that made her a supervisor was her slightly less terrible English. She just explained me that even the display is under the warranty too, they straightforward assume it is user's fault and they refuse to fix it.<br/>Oh by the way while shipping back and forth and packaging it I dropped the laptop from less than 2 feet and the case cracked badly.<br/>Overall, terrible build quality, and worst tech support. Stay away
Excellent computer but still not a fan of Windows 10
It takes a little to set it up but now it is great !
This laptop lacks basic usability standards due to which irrespective of what it has to offer in terms of technical specifications and performance, it sucks big time. I would start with the only pros which is its price, the cheapest among all laptop with similar configuration.<br/> Now, for Cons, this laptop consistently challenges you to make some use of it. The first thing that would irritate you would be the keys being extremely sluggish and clumsy to use. You will have to put pressure to press the keys and sometimes, you will have to pull the keys up which you had pressed earlier.Assuming that you managed to login to the system, at times, the system (windows 10) will hang with all keys and touch pad becoming insensitive. For a moment, I felt, was it the key or the system hung up since both of them suck anyway. Although all this would irritate you to great extent but the part that would bring tears to your eyes will be your encounter with its sharp edges. This laptop has got very sharp edges. Right at the moment when you would be frustrated putting your one hand on your chin resting your elbow on the laptop, its possible that you see blood coming out of your elbow. Now, this makes this laptop unsafe to use. The bottom line is If the laptop is not handled carefully, it can hurt you badly.Why would anyone buy a laptop that's not safe to use? anything, for that matter.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I wonder if they ever tested this product before they launched. If they did, marketing guys screwed up since they should have labelled the laptop as laptop cum Knife.
I absolutely love this laptop! It's an incredible buy for the specs. Unfortunately, mine shipped with a dead pixel in the screen. I'm a little bummed out, but it's not worth sending back. I would recommend this laptop, but be sure you inspect the screen on arrival. Otherwise, you can't beat the specs for the price!
Very good computer but the keyboard is not the best
Excellent value! Full-featured; excellent speakers.
really nice laptop would buy from seller again !!!
It was everything great. Fast, good.<br/>Thanks!
Sooo I odered this laptop on Monday and today on Friday the same week the laptop doesn't work. I don't think this laptop is it.<br/><br/>This message started tonight and now it will not work.
Overall, a great laptop.  This is the second Toshiba and I like the manufacturer.  My sister has another brand and i think mine performs better than hers.  Glad I bought another Toshiba.  Initially, it was slow until I updated all the software.  Now, no issues and all is great with the machine.
I'am still getting use to it but so far so good.
It's exactly what I needed for the price I paid.
Big screen. Supper easy to set up. Great deal!!!
Have only had the computer for about a month but so far so good. It came with Windows 10 which I find to be pretty friendly. One thing I don't like about the laptop is the speakers are terrible. They sometimes fuzz and the sound is weak. Ok with headphones otherwise but max volume is low.
Very good laptop for its price. Too low system.
Great machine sufficient for most personal and small office uses. For the price can't be beat. Has same stats as my $700 Lenovo except w/o the back-lit keyboard, which isn't a huge deal. Overall very happy with Toshibas, and price is great. I hope the hard drive will last a few years.
Got hooked by the cheap price for the hardware this laptop has. The case is all plastic and really cheap, leaves finger prints all over it, has sharp corners.  Decided I could not get over the bad resolution/display on the screen, seems like not enough contrast too, so I returned it.
Overall very good purchase, but there are some minor issues:<br/>1. The front edge is really sharp.<br/>2. Sometimes something seems wrong with the sound system (higher tones only)<br/>3. There is no setting to silence the fan (not a big issue, since it usually runs quiet)
I was expecting much better performance -- it's fairly sluggish. The spacebar is about the worst I've ever used. I'm not sure if it's a bad position or simply not responsive, but I end up having to hit it two or three times to get a space. I would not recommend this laptop.
Nice little laptop for the money.  Although if you are looking for loads of pre-loaded programs you may want to select something else.  I wanted a laptop that wasn't cluttered with pre-loaded trash.  The laptop boots up slow in the beginning, but does very well thereafter.
Performs as expectedexpected.  No complaints.
Works perfect so far. Everything that I need.
So far it has exceed my expectations, its a pretty well made for any college student. Its quite well in handling games (making sure that it meets the specs required). I really recommend this laptop if you wish to pay to much, i guaranty you that this laptop wont fail you.
This is the 4th lap top our household uses.  Neither of us uses laptops for our work.  That being said, this is a very nice basic computer for home use.  I primarily use it for web surfing and playing PoGo games which it works fine.<br/><br/>The screen gives a very nice high definition picture.  I did find the keyboard to be mushier than I am use to.  I must say that the computer was extremely easy to set up but one of my complaints is that instructions are some of the most barebones I have ever encountered in any electronic device.  If you are not somewhat tech savvy, then you will have to do a bit of research and a whole lot of trial and error.  I will be the first to admit that because it came loaded with Windows 10 I was behind the curve right from the start and not only did I have to fuss and muss with the variables on the computer, I also drove myself crazy figuring out this new Windows program; a program by the way, I am not overly happy with.<br/><br/>All that being said though, for the price I have much more computer on my hands than several of those I have owned in the past and  if I can override my own ignorance I am sure this thing is going to work out fine.<br/><br/>I have noted that the battery last approximately 5 to 6 hours.  I also found that my installing a wireless mouse that the computer was much easier to navigate.  I hate touch pads anyway, so this is probably a personal preference.  My companion likes the use of the touch pad.<br/><br/>Other than the newness and being a bit different from anything I have ever used before, I really have had no problems with this computer.
Nice laptop for 15 year old.<br/><br/>My son needed a laptop for school.  He is very savvy with PCs.  We evaluated several and decided on this one.  Its nice, slim and does everything he needs.  I would recommend this as a great intro to intermediate user laptop.
Pixel was out on the screen. Returned it. Received another one. Pixel was out on that screen, too. Submitted another claim for replacement, but never received. Lovely.
I've been using a macbook air a year and a half. So, windows 10 is something a bit different but I am not new to it. The screen size is good, it runs quietly and the sound isn't too bad. Its very light weight for its size. Love the look of it and the keyboard.
Very happy so far, great deal for the money
so far so good, getting used to windows 10.
This laptop is replacing my aging Toshiba Satellite C675.  My first reaction to this newer model was how lightweight it is.  This is going to make taking it on road trips so much easier. It is also much thinner than my older laptop.<br/><br/>But I must admit, I had to play around with the settings to get a feel for this new Windows10.  I went from Windows 7 to 10 so the interface and the icons on the desktop are still new to me.  The video and audio are both very good, considering the speakers are two small outlets on top of the keyboard.  The keyboard itself, though, feels shallow.  I'll get used to this, as the shallow keys also means quieter typing.<br/><br/>There are three USB ports on this device, two on the left side, one on the right.  One of the ports is a USB3 port, next to the headphone/mic jack.  I do appreciate the DVD drive.  There is one HDMI Out port and a security lock also on the right side.<br/><br/>As for software, there are many apps installed if I want to get touch screen capabilities enabled (but I won't).  The new thing for me is a program called Cortana, a "personal digital assistant" that helps search for content on my laptop.and on the web.  I'm not too cozy about this program and will keep it disabled.<br/><br/>I also appreciate how cool this laptop runs.  My older Toshiba still gets warm fast after just an hour or so.  This C50 devices runs cool.  Battery time seems to run around five hours.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Lightweight and thin<br/>Fast start up<br/>Runs cool<br/>Impressive storage<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Shallow keyboard.<br/>No Microsoft Office (just a trial version)
Perfect for my daughter to use for school.
I bought this for my Son and he loves it!!
Good bargain.  I really like this lap top.
This laptop is great. Seamless performance on most games so far and does everything wonderfully. Rarely though, it flashes repeatedly and goes a bit nuts, I don't know why, but it only happened a few times and goes away after a few seconds without having to restart it, thank goodness. Hopefully, it doesn't get worse...
Seems like a nice machine for business.  I'm not a gamer, so don't need a monster machine.  This does the job nicely, reasonably priced, light and a decent sized screen.  I've been buying Toshiba's for 30 plus years and this one doesn't disappoint.
This a good multipurpose notebook computer.  We got it for miscellaneous use around the house, and as a backup computer for use running Word, Excel, Chrome, etc., by our two young students (we have two kids entering grades 4-6 but only one desktop computer).  It's relatively large and thick, but light and well-built. Definitely portable, but a bit clunkier than a true "light and portable" notebook.  The screen is bright and colorful, but while the native resolution of 1366x768 is plenty sharp enough for browsing and office apps, it's got a noticeably lower pixel density than the typical HD screen on a modern tablet.<br/><br/>Here are some benchmarks, for people who are into that sort of thing.  Geekbench 3 scores:<br/>  32-bit / single core: 2602, multi-core: 5137<br/>  64-bit / single core: 2792, multi-core: 5528<br/>You can compare them other models on the Geekbench website.  In short, this is perfectly workmanlike performance, but it's not going set anyone's hair on fire.  When the system gets really taxed by anything (games mostly, but you'll see something similar when running intensive photo/video editing apps or benchmarks) the fan kicks in at a fairly high volume. With the system's modest speed and built-in Intel 5500 graphics, you certainly can play some games but it isn't the best use of this model. Frame rates and visual detail on 3D graphical games are going to be limited, and the fan is going to blasting all the time.
Problems with W10 when conect to WiFi...
Great product...  Excellent computer....
I'm a graphic designer, and I got this laptop for work. I plugged it to my 32" Tv and it is an awesome experience. My only complain could be that Windows 10 still needs a bit polishing, but the laptop Is awesome. I couldn't be happier.
Excellent product! many thanks!
The laptop itself is very nice, I had to return it though, there was a pixel that was already burned out on the screen.  I also noticed that when in windows the screen did this weird jump and blur thing and went back into position. The replacement is on the way so I hope it's better than the first.
Met or exceeded all of my expectations!
great
The Toshiba Satellite C55-C5241 is a workhorse laptop for a good price ($499 at time of review). The Intel i5 CPU and 8GB powers Windows 10 very well, especially w/ the reduced system requirements that come with Win10. The Intel HD graphics is capable and able to handle some light gaming. Any sort of web browsing, online video viewing, etc is not a problem although that can likely be attributed to the low resolution screen as much as the processing prowess of the Intel HD integrated graphics.<br/><br/>The notebook itself is cheaply made. The plastic cover has some nice texture to it that help mitigate the fingerprint problem so prevalent on smooth/matte finishes. It is definitely plastic. The whole unit flexes a bit when handled. This is not a sturdy unit.<br/><br/>The two real flaws for the unit are the screen and the hard drive. A 1366x768 screen is simply not acceptable anymore. The only benefit of such a low resolution screen is throttling your data use when watching online video. Websites will feel cramped as even smart phones have a higher resolution at this point. The second flaw is the hard drive. It will be the performance bottleneck for the system. It will slow your boot times and slow your application loads. In everyday use, the Intel i5 and 8GB will be waiting on the hard drive.<br/><br/>Minor annoyance but worth mentioning is the installed bloatware. I found the bundled Toshiba software to be redundant and useless. Most annoying was the link to eBay in the Start menu that I was unable to remove. It was due to the eBay link that I re-installed a clean copy of Windows 10.<br/><br/>For the price, this is decent laptop. If you can snag it on sale, it's an even better deal. I would be hesitant to use it as my primary computing device due to the screen resolution and hard drive. I would prefer to pay a bit more and get a FullHD 1080p screen and a Solid State Drive. However, if you are purchasing a laptop for a child, for business travel, or some other secondary use, its hard to fault the laptop. It packs some decent hardware to hits its price point while only cutting a few corners.
Well There are a lot of things to be mentioned about this laptop ...<br/><br/>First about it's Sharp Edges .. !! Yes This is True .. it has a real sharp edges and i don't know why they mad it this way ...<br/><br/>2nd The CD room in the left which is not common for me so i find it annoying ..<br/><br/>3rd Let's Talk about the functionality ....<br/><br/>  -  The Ethernet Card in this laptop is crazy ,,, specially with unknown networks ,,, when i connect a new network sometimes it connect to it perfectly and sometimes it give me no internet access ( Although i tested the cable some where else and it was working )  ,, But this issue sometimes disappear i have no idea what's going on with it anyway ,,,, ....<br/><br/>  - Another Funny Thing when i use the new media player in windows 10 it sometimes bug when you pause and play from the task bare viewer and you had to open it itself to play or pause .. Really i cannot blame the laptop for such thing it might be a Bug in windows 10 or something ...<br/><br/>  -  Another Funny Thing and it was so Comedic ... Then i connect an external USB Mouse things become crazy ,,, The Touch pad won't work while i am connecting the mouse ... and then if  i removed the mouse the Mouse cursor on the screen disappear .. ! So i guess the windows turned into tablet mode or something like that although i don't have a touch screen ! Why the hell it change into tablet mode !! This bug is really annoying and still i don't know who to blame ? Toshiba Or Windows 10 ! ? But the funny thing this bug is not a constant it sometimes happen and sometimes not !! ..<br/><br/>  - What annoyed me more is that the windows Came as a Home Edition and when i preordered the laptop amazon didn't give me any choices if i wanted Home or Pro or whatever higher version ! What is that a Surprise Party ? But it wasn't a good one ! That means that i have to remove the current version and replace it with another higher one ..<br/><br/>  - The Epic thing about this laptop is it's VGA Card .. ! it's 128 MG Up to 4GB !! OH MY GOD !! This was Epic when the first time i checked it out ! :D  128 MB ? Really :D ? ? lOOl i used to play Mario With such a VGA Card :D :D :D !! Although i was highly shocked  ,,,, I Didn't mind much because i already have an Alienware PC and i bought this laptop just for work .. I am a software developer and i don't use VGA Cards in my work that much ... all i need is good processing and it's Good in this laptop so far......<br/><br/>  - It's a little bit heavy while getting started .. i don't know may be i am used to the SSD HD on the Alienware that is much more faster than this Normal HD ,, But still Windows 10 is somehow strange and with many strange new configurations !<br/><br/>I Didn't give it 5 Stars because of the issues i mentioned above and i said my opinion fairly and honestly ..
Cheap keyboard with a left click button that only works if you tap it just right, low quality screen, and after ~6 weeks of use it feels bogged down.  Save yourself the headache and spend a little more $$ for a better laptop!
Works well. Good battery life so far.
Just right for my high school senior!
I do not like the key board very much
Excellent product , delivery expected
This laptop is a bang for the buck! The ram is 8gb STOCK!! and a 1 TB STOCK!!! for this price that is crazy! Toshiba is really making a name for themselves. I own this laptop and its smooth and fast! Just like any normal computer it will need the normal cleaning but its reliable.
Had it 5 months and  really like it.
Windows 10 a little different to use. Cannot put contact list in my email account to send email to a group. Computer is fine like the lightness of it wish I didn't have to tilt the screen to get the best picture.
Honestly disappointed with AMAZON with their shipping of this product. The box was barely holding together from the awful packing job they did. It was bursting open all over when it arrived! One strip of tape to seal it did not work well here! Someone could have easily reached right in and grabbed my laptop right out! Plus there was VERY little packing material in it with the large box they used (the box was 2 1/2 times the size of my laptop inside and they used a single sheet of brown paper to pack with that was smooshed flat)! So my laptop was just bouncing around all over the place in the box en route! I was really shocked at how poorly they packaged it!! The manufacturer, however, did a good job packaging the actual laptop, so it seems to have survived the trip. So far it's working well for me but I can say I truly hate where and how they placed the mouse buttons on the keyboard. They aren't comfortable to click on. They aren't the easiest to find when not looking right down at them (I'm used to not watching my fingers while I'm clicking around). I find myself thinking I'm clicking on the buttons only to find that I'm just pushing on the base itself. Not actually on the buttons. So far that's the only downside I've found!
It's everything I need in a laptop.
this replaced my old desktop and then some- I'm so glad I got this model with it's amazing speed and ease of use and will buy Toshiba again when the need arises- this model exceeded my expectations for sure
This laptop is pretty good. I have had mine for a few months and it works great. Only downfall is that the battery runs down pretty quick other than that it has great storage and is great for the price
Best laptop for gaming under $1000
Excellent service, hate windows 10
This machine arrived defective, not able to print, and after more than two hours on the phone with Toshiba customer support, and Toshiba demanding $159 for an annual service contract before they would proceed to seek resolution, the only solution for them was to return to Toshiba the computer for repair. That meant that this brand new machine, only 2 days old in my possession, was going to be out of my hands for more than a week. I had already spent more than 6 hours configuring the machine to my preferences. I requested a new machine be sent to me but Toshiba refused. In effect, this machine comes with no guarantees at all, even when it does not work out of the box.
Very pleased.  Best value around.
great price, very quality laptop.
Good for our needs and the price.
Does the trick at a great price
In general, the Satellite C55-C5240 has given me what I expected.<br/><br/>The frame in general is lighter than what I expected for a laptop of this size, plus it has a nice finish. The screen is big although it could have a better resolution for the size. The keyboard is comfortable; the keys are responsive enough. The rims are a bit rough, though, so you may run into trouble with your wrists in certain positions. The speakers are not of the best quality, but as long as you have headphones that should be no problem.<br/><br/>As for processing power, I've been using it for website development and light gaming; so far, so good. I've yet to run Photoshop here, but what I did run is Civilization V; the computer had no trouble at all. Something I really like is that even for intensive applications, I've yet to notice significant overheating.<br/><br/>The two things that really bother me are: one, the battery duration, which seems too short to me -- I've found myself carrying the charger wherever I go; two, the pre-installed programs that came with the computer, including games and a second app store that seems just redundant to me.<br/><br/>It is, however, a fine computer for its price. I'm running it with Windows 10 now and it runs even more smoothly than before. If you don't have the dough for a higher-end, I would recommend you give this Satellite a serious consideration.
This computer is fast and does all the things I need and more.  The buttons are a bit sticky and that cause me to make more typing errors but overall I think it is a fine machine.
Fast. Great for movies.
Had this for my daughter.  She uses it for her college.  Gets work done.  Writing essays and regular browsing is pretty good, and smooth.  Very much recommended for a college kid
This is a great laptop. It starts up within ten seconds.... Very fast. The speaker could be a bit louder and the edges are very sharp. But it is quite light and easy to carry around. Great computer for the price. I would recommend it!!
Amazing laptop, for the price.
GREAT PRODUCT!! VERY PLEASED!!
Shipped quickly. High quality.
8-28-2015  I could not connect to the internet.<br/>8-29-2015  I used system restore and went back to 8-25-2015 and connected to the internet.<br/>8-31-2015  No internet connection.<br/><br/>9-1-2015  I called Toshiba Tech Support at 1-800-457-7777. The first TECH tried a few times to get my computer connected to the internet with no success and passed me off to TECH #2. TECH #2 can fix my computer but it will cost me about $100.00. When I said no this is a new computer only a few days old TECH #2 said as a one time fix we will fix your computer for only $59.00 and you will get FREE VIRUS PROTECTION from McAFEE. I said NO again and TECH #2 passed me off to LADY SALES TECH #3. LADY SALES TECH #3 said my computer was virus free at this time but won't be very long. The only way they would repair my computer cost me $59.00 for McAFEE VIRUS PROTECTION not needed. This last over one hour and NO FIX.<br/><br/>AMAZON was so nice when I returned the computer to them. AMAZON reversed the payment 9-4-2015
dependable meets expectations
Perfect for what I need. I typically do photo editing, and office work. Not a lot of gaming, but I'm sure it could handle it. Excellent deal for what you get, and the 8GB RAM makes everything work at a very reasonable speed!
It works fairly well but it has a lot of issues connecting to the Internet. Almost constantly saying there is no internet access due to a "limited" connection but works fine for about a day at a time after its reset<br/><br/>Update: the speakers have stopped working for reasons unknown, headphones work but the speakers do nothing regardless of volume level or audio source. If anyone has info on how to resolve the issue it would be appreciated
Bought this computer for my daughter. It is great for her games and does not freeze like the previous one. It is working great and she has not encountered any issues.
For the most part, this is a fast computer, it has more than enough memory, and it thinner and a little smaller than the laptop i have... It actually fits on my lap
Perfect laptop for the price
great computer for the money
Trouble with this computer not able to bring up internet connection. Often telling me "can't display this page".
Ever since I got this laptop I've received error messages - today the laptop kept popping up an error message about the "cooling system" and automatically turning off.  When I googled this message it appears that this is a common problem!  I spoke with a Toshiba rep for tech support and she told me to manual erase everything my computer and reset everything to try and fix this "glitch".  Luckily I have all my files saved on the cloud otherwise I would be totally screwed! I'm a law student and this issue is extremely inconvenient and scary! I hope everything works out but in the mean time I'm...panicking!<br/><br/>On top of that this laptop is very heavy and unweildtly and this may sound odd but the corners are very point which makes it difficult to fit in my regular laptop case.<br/><br/>Bottom line - would not recommend and don't think I will be buying a Toshiba again.
OK during the first few week and a half, I loved this laptop it was easy to set up, easy to link to my WiFi and worked perfectly, similar to the older Toshiba laptop this one replaced.  Sadly last weekend I started loosing my WiFi connections and had to reset every time I signed in, then the computed stopped receiving signals totally, which had to be the unit since the other three computers in our house were working, including my 7 year old Toshiba. The unit also started shutting down for no reason in the middle of a session so after a few of those untimely shut downs I decided to do a reset and half way through the process the PC shut down again and now it will not allow me to do anything other than a shut down, so I've requested a replacement based on the fact I loved the PC prior to all the problems starting. Hopefully the problems are limited to this unit and not the model or Windows 10 operating system, which I hoped would be a game changer since I hated Windows 8.1. Hope to give this PC a better review when the replacement is received and tested but for now I'm not giving it a bad rating just middle of the road because like I said, when first received the unit was everything I had expected.
It is very good . I like it
Great computer. Great price
great computer good bargain
Tomorrow there will be a call to Toshiba....not sure what's going on but the whir of the drive is ridiculous; it constantly sounds like it is going to take off, very weird and not conducive to a comfortable feeling for a brand new computer. Beyond that, the edges are very sharp, as others have noted, and it just doesn't feel like a very good computer. Should have spent a few dollars more and gotten something better, but...in this day and age, 500 bucks still seems like a fair amount to spend and should buy you a pretty good product. This doesn't feel like a good product. Will this be returned...no, but only because I'll buy another, different one, and use this just for the rare odd need. Constantly whirring!!! Very annoying. Interesting too since one of the supposed good points of this computer is that you have a large hard drive, 1 Tb.<br/><br/>Don't buy, find something better.
It works great, love Windows 10.  The only little thing that could have been better is the keyboard area and corners of computer have a kind of rough texture.  For the price, though, I would recommend it.
fast - very clean display.
The only things stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the lack of a HDD activity indicator and it only has one USB 3 port.  If I could give it 4.5 stars I would.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is a great value.  First of all it's a Toshiba, which in my personal experience is one of the best laptop manufacturers in the market.  It has a full keyboard with a 10 key numeric pad, a current generation core i5 CPU, a beautiful display, 8 GB of RAM, and more than adequate hard drive space.  It also has an optical drive, which for some reason (size & weight perhaps?) seems to be increasingly rare.<br/><br/>It's fast, and even with the Toshiba "custom" drivers & apps, very stable.  The Toshiba recovery media tool was easy to use too and although I'm pretty sure it will re-install the "crapware" that came pre-installed, it's only a minor inconvenience.  The crapware is easy to uninstall since none of it is protected and once it's uninstalled the registry doesn't put it back on restart.<br/><br/>All-in-all, if you are looking for a solid mid-range laptop with excellent features for a good price, you can't go wrong with this.
The specs on this laptop, are nice for the price. However, if you don't need 1tb of hard drive space, I suggest you buy a 250, or 500GB SSD hard drive, clone this laptop's hard drive to it, swap the drives, and then start to actually use this laptop. With a SSD, this laptop boots to the Lock Screen in about 5 seconds.<br/><br/>Yeah, adding a SSD adds to the total price, but it's not much, compared to the total this laptop costs. Once you have a SSD in there, you'll get rid of the bottleneck of the mechanical hard-drive, and then the hardware inside this lap-top can really perform.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>- I'd like more USB 3.0 ports.<br/>- Wireless AC would be nice, but, N is OK.<br/>- The screen is 720, which is OK, but 1080 would have been nice.<br/>- The chassis isn't as heavy-duty as some others, but as long as one is careful, it should be OK.<br/>- One has to unscrew the entire bottom of the machine, to get to the hardware, such as for swapping the hard drive. Lots of screws.<br/><br/>I didn't think much of this laptop when I first turned it on, but after I popped in the SSD, everything was better than I expected.
Great laptop for the money! Love it. It's alot of computer for 500 price tag. I was very impressed! Probably going to get another one for my wife.
worked for ~2 hours. just enough time for me to download firefox and google chrome, and try to install my printer. Had to re-start the computer and a mandatory step for that and it never turned back on again. kept going into a blue screen saying system was not started correctly. re-starting and turning the machine off as well as troubleshooting via options given in the menu on that screen did not solve the problem. I called Toshiba and, after waiting for 14 minutes, I was able to talk with a technician for ~30 minutes but he could not get the laptop to work either. passed me to his supervisor, who told me it was probably a software problem as opposed to hardware and "troubleshooting was not covered" by them. They tried to blame it on the browsers I downloaded (not a joke) or the printer driver (I have 2 printers and 5 devices at home and all work well together). She went on to offer me "a great opportunity" to buy their maintenance plan for $99.99/year as opposed to $159.99/year. I don't feel like I need to pay them for fixing a machine that broke the same day It was first turned on. Returning it today.
Great computer.  Fast and easier than I thought Windows 8 would be to learn.  Lots of storage.  Not a big gamer so don't know about graphics.  Fast on the internet even with multiple windows open.
Very happy with purchase.
I got this laptop 2 weeks ago. My main complaint is the shipping. I chose Free 1 Day shipping via offered by Amazon. It was done through the carrier, Ontrac. Ontrac delivered the package to the WRONG house and indicated the package was delivered and signed off by me.  Luckily it was my at my neighbor's and they were nice enough to tell me about the package. I reported the issue to Amazon and the rep said someone would get in touch with me...yeah right. That never happened. I've never experienced this issue before after buying many items though Amazon. Makes me think twice to buy a laptop through Amazon ever again.<br/><br/>Setting up the laptop was not too bad. Be aware that Windows 10 has this eternal Automatic Repair loop bug that doesn't allow Windows to go to the main desktop once you hit restart. It is an OS error. The solution that worked for me was burning Windows 10 installation program onto a CD and reinstalling it in the laptop all together. I tried different tactics to try to get rid of them 1) Watching some youtube solution videos 2) Resetting a BIOS setting...none of them worked.
you never realize how much t rash is on a new mchine! Till you get one without. way faster boot no time spent clearing lougis skate rink iI may even keep mcgagfee. great spec's buy this one
Only had this for 4 days so far. I'm getting used to Windows 10, and the Toshiba. I've always had HP prior to this, but so far so good...
The hard disk crapped out before the machine was 60 days old -- now having to go through warranty repair hell.<br/><br/>This is an update to my previous review.  Toshiba warranty service stinks -- so the 3 star review is downgraded to the lowest I can give it.  Details:  on boot up the laptop asks for a hard drive password (but none was ever implemented).  Toshiba warranty interprets this as not a disk failure since it is returning something (an error message, to my way of thinking).  Note that I can reach the BIOS on boot up and it does not see a hard drive (true failure indication in my mind, but Toshiba does not see it that way).  I'm very upset with the machine and its manufacturer.  We are a technology company and know our way around computer equipment.  BUY A MAC !!
it is easy to use
adequate and very basic
My main purpose of purchasing this laptop was to play League of Legends and since I'm not seeing any reviewers cover this I figured I'll do it to clear anyone's worries who may be buying for the same purpose.<br/>This laptop will play League on Very High settings at 60fps (no shadows)<br/>As far as processing speed for videos and web browsing this is a perfect computer for it.<br/>My only complaint is the hinges the screen is on are pretty flimsy so it's not exactly meant for rough use or children.<br/>Overall I give it a 5/5
After considerable research, I purchased this computer. The set-up was seamless. The design of the computer is pleasing. The keyboard is VERY ice. These are my first impressions.
Computer is great. My only complaint is that the edges are extremely sharp and can be uncomfortable to lay your hands on to use.
It sometimes "wakes up" a little sluggish, but so do my other computers on occasion -- I haven't figured out if it's the computer or Windows waking up (I doubt there's grime on this one yet since I haven't been using it much). My old laptop just "bit the dust", so I'm using this a lot more now and am happy with it so far.<br/><br/>The keyboard doesn't feel so great, but that doesn't particularly bother me; I have a nice wireless keyboard hooked up to it since I usually use it in one place. If I want to use it elsewhere, I suppose I can live with the keyboard temporarily, and bring the wireless keyboard along if I go on a trip..<br/><br/>Nor am I bothered by the resolution; I have it hooked up to a nice monitor for viewing graphics and/or videos; otherwise, I just use the laptop screen, which is fine for basic use. I don't expect everything to be high-end for this price; I'm just happy that it offers all it does. I did comparison shop, and this one really is a value.
Everything ok. Thanks.
No issues. Works Finne
The grand kids love it
Cheap exterior and battery life drains rapidly when using strong applications. Other than that great laptop for the price.
When I think it, I do it and my new computer does it...no more lag time!  It's all about the processor.  I'm very happy!
It's a good computer and I like it, but Dell quality is a lot better! It doesn't have some of the software like (Microsoft Word, Excel,...) that I expected it to have!
Lovely bit of kit, and over all is a great laptop. it was mainly bought as a alternative to a tablet for my mum, but I use it just as much. the only real negative I've found is that on times the keyboard keys are not as responsive as I would like, with letters missing. This caused a bit of trouble when setting up as I was unable to sign back in as the password I wanted to use was not the actual password that I had typed it out a number of the latters did not get entered so I was left with a unknown password. but after a bit of searching I was able to completely reset the laptop, and restart again. Windows 8.1 is not the greatest, but once you get used to it, it becomes second nature. I did like the little feature that allowed me to go straight to the desktop when I stared up. over all a nice little bit of kit, for a first laptop, might not be the most powerful on the market but it does the job wonderfully for our family.
I love my new laptop.
Very good! I like it!
it works well.<br/>.
it is good but i hate it's sound and when i am skyping no one hear what i am saying
after we installed office it stop connecting to internet.had to tak to a computer shop and dont know if it will work
<br/><br/>
First brand new computer I have owned, and am thrilled with it.  I am still learning quite a bit, but with grandson guidance and assistance it is working great
Wonderful investment
excellent experience
I like it. I did a lot of searching for a laptop around this price range and I think I made the right choice.
Very nice laptop. Easy setup. My only complaint is the very sharp edges that are uncomfortable and could cut
Works well so far ☺
Excelent product!!!
Met my expectations
amazing price point
Arrived dead on arrival. Turned on and watched blue screen. Toshiba has been my manufacture of choice for years.  My Toshiba Satellite E45-B4100 was dead on mouse click after windows update. Pick it up using right had under computer and it shuts off.  I am in Philippines for months and have no access for warranty.  Toshiba...what is happening to your quality???  Found Windows drivers to not 100% support Toshiba hardware.  Was told to remove Windows auto update and drivers for touchpad then install only Toshiba drivers.  What world is Toshiba in not getting proper drivers to Windows.
Pretty awesome system.  I received it quick and it was easy to set up .. I'd buy this again if needed!!
first time I ordered and its touch pad for mouse stop working after 7 days.<br/>I had to replace it.
Best laptop for this range, I am using it for more then a month and I am happy with its performance.
Excellent product.
Great cheap laptop
Still learning my way around Microsoft windows 10.  I have to admit I am not excited about it ... I suppose because I was very comfortable with 7.  I am not tech savvy enough to review the technical aspects of the Toshiba Satellite system but I do like the speed and relative ease of navigating my way around. I know enough to recognize this will meet my needs.  That being said, overall the computer is perfect for the intention I purchased it which was to be my exclusive work computer as a small business owner.  The other reviews about it helped me in  deciding to make the purchase based on what I was looking for.  I have a mac airbook which was not suitable for my windows based software so now I use that  as my personal computer and use the Toshiba strictly for business.
I'm having major issues with the disk drive. I don't know if it's the computer or the software.
I bought this laptop for my son, so I can't really give any personal use feedback except to say that for the time being he thinks it's great and it works well.  I do know that he plays games on it and he said that the processor is kind of lacking a little with some of the games that he plays. I did see it freeze on him a time or two as well, but I think that might be because he likes to multitask on it.  He's only 12 years old and he's technologically advanced for his age.  I don't think this computer will follow him into his teenage years because it looks like he's thinking a little faster than this computer can  handle. Overall, I think if the computer was for my own needs, it would suffice.  I'm sure I will be using it when my son outruns this one.
100% recommendent
Excellent product
Excelent product.
excellent product
I have purchased Toshiba products for many years and they have always been a great product.  This is the best computer I have had.
Great display! Loads quickly. Keyboard is a little awkward until you become accustomed. Overall very pleased and would recommend.
I bought this for my niece who is starting college in August. She needed a new computer and asked my Wife and I to set it up for her. I'm jealous now because she has a better computer than I do. I got to work with this great laptop for about a week and was impressed with its performance, even with screen reading software. Its amazing at how they can fit so much computer into such a thin laptop. I like the number key pad, as its an actual keypad and not part of the regular qwerty keyboard. That will help my niece, as she is going to be an accounting major. It was easy to create backup media and a system image, so if anything gets messed up, she can restore it to the way it was when she opened the box.
Received on May 19th, 2015.<br/><br/>First Impression:<br/><br/>The latptop is a solid build. The wifi connection at first seemed to be pretty poor, but that could be blamed on the router. After getting the local account set up, everything is functioning fast and properly.<br/><br/>The only issue so far (which seems to be a common one with this laptop) is a stuck red pixel right out of the box. I did some pixel fixing software, which I seem to have to run every time I close the laptop. So the pixel is getting fixed, and then stuck constantly. Not big enough of a problem to send in under the warranty for now.<br/><br/>I will leave a more thorough review after playing with it for a week.
Turning out to be a great computer. Takes awhile to get to new Windows and finally had to make a start menu to find programs without searching a cluttered desktop.Easy to set up and wireless is nice and it integrates well with other computer and printer.Plenty of memory to run all and work with photos and Lightroom and Photoshop so far. My Mother plays Solitaire and scores American Contract League Bridge on it. Grandkids play some simple games on it. Searches well on various search engines. Very pleased with it so far. I removed much of the bloatare that came prinstlled that I won't use. So far photo editing is working for me as a beginner. Time will tell. Fun new machine to fiddle with.
I replaced my old toshiba with this one. No problems so far, fits easily in my bag, and I really like the updated interface.
I like that it can handle games I could not play on my older computer. I really do not like windows 8, and it seems to make finding some features needlessly difficult, but I can deal with that. What I do NOT like is how the screen will slightly dim randomly, even though I have changed the settings to stay as bright as possible, on both battery and charger. This is not happening from it being idle for a while; I can be actively looking at stuff online, and it will slightly dim, then revert back to the brightest setting. It is really annoying. I also wish the screen could be brighter; it seems like the older Toshiba laptop that I have has a noticeably brighter screen.
Good every day computer, but the display is horrible. I don't watch videos on this computer because of the display quality.
Good bargain. Fast, smooth sharp picture. We purchased 2 and are not disappointed.
Worth the price
The product works great, but had several things I really hate.  It maybe because of Win8.  Function key function and function key+FN key work opposite.  TouchPad one finger scroll is disabled as default.  After activating one finger scroll, it scrolls opposite way.  Ten key width is narrower than the others and causing a lot of typing error.  Key springs are harder than my favorite especially space key, so I often end up typing without space.
I've had no problems.  I would like a better design to assist in opening the lid.
My 18 year old daughter is very satisfied.  She came off of using a very expensive Sony Vaio that melted in her lap.
Bought this for my Dad as a present after his desktop died.  Cost was about the same as a desktop with the same spec's and gave him the chance to take it with him when he and my Mom travel.  Not a ton of bloatware and getting rid of what was there wasn't too much of a problem.  Good construction for the most part.  Didn't feel too flimsy and the keyboard had solid key movement.  It was pretty lightweight and my dad has enjoyed using it.  He's not one for touchpads, so he generally hooks up a keyboard and mouse to the laptop.  That said, it's more about age and new technology than it is about the design of the laptop.
Bought for my mom as a replacement for her old laptop and she loves it. Very fast and a great deal for the price.
Love my laptop
computer is just what they say .sharp edges made of plastic but for the money it was a good buy. I paid 424.85
I just love this laptop. Ever since i got it, i have had no problems and does everything i expected it to do
I got no problem. With all the complete information. And this going great . I therefore recommend purchase.
Ready to go right out of the box and way faster than my current one.  Only takes about one minute to load.
Good product!
Great Product
Nice computer
Keypad is not good, I feel like the keys will come off within a year unless used with utmost care. The edges are really sharp, it hurts when you type. Speakers are also not that great. Touchpad is not responsive and its buttons are too hard.<br/><br/>I was so excited for this laptop as it had all the desired software specs, but I wish they would have taken care of these issues...
I really wanted to like this laptop.  It was a great price, looked sharp, had some decent reviews.  When I received it things got off to a tricky start, because the first thing I loaded was iTunes... and I press play, and the song sits at 00:00.  This is true in Windows media player too...  Then I check if there's any sound at all -- e.g., Windows system sounds -- they don't work either.  Long story short, I update this and that, and it works!  Then a few hours later, it doesn't.  Seemingly no rhyme or reason to when.  I come to find there are whole discussion forums dedicated to this issue, which seems to have to do with the audio driver and windows 8, and maybe heat (google "toshiba no sound").  There's really no solution as far as I can figure.  A few hours of diagnostics for a new laptop with no certain solution in sight is about as much fun as I can handle, so I'm sending it back.<br/><br/>Maybe this issue doesn't affect everybody, I don't know.  But other items to note: I like the value point, and the screen is nice looking, has solid feel.  On the down side, as other commenters have note, the front edge of the laptop is SHARP.  This isn't a problem if you use it on a desk, but if you transfer it to your lap, it bites into your palms.  I'm not talking 90 degree sharp, either, it is more like 85 degree.
Great deal and solid featured basic laptop. Whiners need not apply
It's simple amazing how Toshiba could do such a good laptop with this price! This is a really robust mid-range laptop. If you go to benchmark websites, you'll see that this laptop is powerful. You can't go wrong with this laptop!<br/><br/>PS: First thing that you MUST do after turn this laptop on for the first time is uninstall the MacAfee antivirus. My laptop was very slow in the first time and I saw that MacAfee was using 30%+ of the processor without doing anything. After I had uninstalled it, the laptop was perfect!
A good buy for the price but the keyboard is not user friendly. I can't press one key consecutively without waiting a second or two, like its got to take a deep breath first. So if i want to type "week" I would type "w", "e" and have to wait to type "e" again then "k". It is like this with all the keys.  you can't keep your hand on backspace to let it delete a word, instead you have to press it one second at a time.  I find this super annoying. in addition it runs very well.
Satisfactory
good product
Good so far.
Super Great!
excellent!!!
Awesome buy#
Works great!
Excelente...
Works great, its been a couple of months so far. Trouble free.
Good laptop
I love it ！
Had to send it back. Trouble connecting to my wi-fi. Had another one sent to me it did not work. Had to send it back.I call Toshiba tech support<br/>they did not help. Call Intel Tech support they did not help. Not very happy with Toshiba, or Intel in this case.
Good laptop. Lots if ram and good amount of memory
Technically it all seems fine and is doing the basic home pc tasks without issue.  I've taken 2 stars off as I really really dislike the fit, form and finish of the external plastics.  The edges are actually sharp and it irritates me every time I place my hands on the machine!  The price is great for the spec but I'd happily pay extra dollars for a better external finish with higher quality materials
So far great computer for what I needed it for. Windows 10 much better than 8
I LOVE THIS LAPTOP.... Perfect for business mobile-use. This laptop enables me to take my work on the road from state-to-state. I am confident with Toshiba products for consistent excellence in quality and durability! Reliable battery life, clear audio, good speed, comfortable keyboard and cap/num lock lights have been useful during travel. This laptop met every expectation for the price point.
As described. Seems to work well so far and very lightweight. One complaint is that the edges are sharp, which is true, but it is not so uncomfortable that it bothers me or that you couldn't buy a guard to shield your wrists. The only disappointing part is that it didn't come with Microsoft Office as I anticipated, but it did come with McAfee. Great price for the product. Shipped quickly.
My daughter uses this laptop for homework, writing, and light internet searches -- she uses her iPhone for most everything else.  I've used it for movies, and my son has borrowed it for games.  It's a great laptop, especially for the price.  Though the build quality does not seem very good (cheap plastic), it seems more than good enough for the purpose and has not had any issues so far.
i purchased same product but better quality and price from here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VFY8LY2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B00VFY8LY2&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazonbfc-20&linkId;=N3R5OOVUTIQEWDKV
excellent
Excellent
Nice 👍👍
Excellent
Like it so far real test will start at end of August when college starts.
I am having to send it back because it has a flaw in it. There is a horrible buzzing sound when watching videos and or movies or really while doing anything on it. Not happy at all I paid 450.00 for it and doesn't work correctly.
I had a 4 year old Samsung computer before this so my love comes with a little bias.  I love this computer.  It's fast, the memory is huge, I've been able to play games on it in high resolution with no problems.  The only complaint I have is that the trackpad is a little slow and sticky which makes using it difficult but plug in a mouse and you'll be good.
At first I was so happy with the laptop. Light weight, beautiful, super fast, and user friendly. Plus great price for an Intel i5 chip! Bought this on September 7th and a week ago a pop up came up...something about having to shut down laptop and ship back to company??!?!?!? I am so confused. Nothing was altered to the lap top. I am not a gamer nor did I use this laptop for demanding programs. I literally was typing up my assigned class papers and browsing the web (like searching my school's research library base, YouTube, Facebook)  I am a college student and need this laptop to function properly. I understand that this was refurnished, but still...I took the risk.<br/><br/>Several hours of research on the problem (system warning cooling system not functioning properly, even though checking temperatures nothing was to hot. Several people say it's a common Toshbia problem) showed many several similar cases but no real solutions. I tried all of them and unfortunately none ended up working. Would of course like to just have it fixed and be happy but it is a pain.<br/><br/>To sum up my review: buy this laptop at your own risk.
Great deal for the money, keyboard feels a bit cheap, but a good buy
Solid light laptop. Great for basic gaming and for streaming videos.
Update:<br/>I HATE this computer. It sucks. It froze and crashed straight out of the box and continues to do so. I was hoping that by uninstalling the dozen useless programs that come pre-installed on it would make it work better, but no.<br/><br/>The physical design of the computer body is horrible. Random people in my office keep coming up to me and asking if I'm okay. I thought that maybe I seemed sad or something, so I tried to perk up a little bit. Then I found out that the cuts on my wrist caused by the razor sharp edges of the keyboard for this steaming pile of tech excrement made people think that I was a cutter. I don't know who the idiot was at Toshiba that thought making the edges of the keyboard razor sharp was a good idea, but that person needs to be taken out back and shot (that is if they haven't already done it themselves after being forced to work 20 hour days in a Toshiba sweatshop). It leaves me wondering if anyone at Toshiba actually went over it to make sure that their product wouldn't actually injure people<br/><br/>Finally, the whole computer just feels cheap. The plastic feels brittle and the design seems as though it was just slapped together a pushed out of the factory without a concern for the quality of the product.<br/><br/>This is, by far, the WORST COMPUTER I HAVE EVER BOUGHT.<br/><br/>My last 2 laptops were Toshiba Satellites. This third one has made me not want to buy another Toshiba product again.
Toshiba's Satellite Laptops come in different series. This particular model is their C series which is aimed at the budget-minded consumer who wants a basic laptop without the extra features.  As such, this is a great entry-level laptop for school work or for someone who just requires a basic computer for email and other household tasks.  This is not the laptop to buy if you do graphic design or gaming. Toshiba offers other series with more features for more intensive activities.  Other series are the S (more power and speed, better display), P (their premium line, way more features), L (next level up from C, a few more features), and the CL (designed to be more portable).  This is reviewed accordingly as a basic feature laptop.  For a basic feature laptop, I think they have done a very good job of packaging a lot into this value-positioned machine.  This computer comes with a very respectable 8 GB RAM, 1 TB storage, and a very nice Core i5 processor. This was ready-to-use out of the box and set-up was an absolute breeze.  I set this up for myself and for my school-age son who has been using this for school work and online academic programs.  Very simple set up.<br/><br/>This laptop has one USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0, an HDMI connector, and a DVD  player/burner. Also comes with video camera.  Wireless is only 802.11 b/g/n (not ac).<br/><br/>This laptop does not have a touchscreen and the screen quality is really pretty average  The keyboard is not backlit and definitely feels on the cheap side.  I have noticed keys getting a bit stuck under the edges of the keyboard.  Not a big problem but definitely contributes to the cheap feel. I guess if you are going to scrimp somewhere on a value laptop, I'd rather it be the keyboard then the hardware. The cons are mostly minor and outweighed by the pros (good  processor, RAM, and storage) so I would definitely recommend this laptop.  It would be perfect for kids who need a computer for school or for the casual home user.
I've been a desktop person all my life so this was my first foray into a laptop, though I've been around plenty of laptops in the past. Only having 3 USB ports and the audio jack being headphone/mic only is a bit unfortunate but not at all a deal breaker. The keyboard is so very flat and the keys so close together, more so than other laptops I've been around, I'm needing to adjust to actually watching where my fingers are. I can't feel where I am, but I'm sure that's just something I need to get used to. Having a number pad was definitely a plus though. And there's definitely a lot of power for the price in here, as it's out performing my old desktop computer in most regards. If I had to say there was a true negative, it's that the pad is extremely sensitive one moment and almost non existent the next. I've been messing around with settings but when you end up dragging and dropping your entire Windows desktop when you're just trying to move the cursor from one side to the other, that's a bit unnerving. Especially when you can turn around and click away with nothing happening with both the pad or the buttons. It's definitely finicky, but I've not had it but a few days, I'll keep messing with settings and get used to its quirks eventually. Plus, if all else fails, I'll just use a mouse. :P Otherwise, I'm quite happy with it so far. As long as it keeps running well (and I got the extra warranty to ensure that), I'm sure it will serve me well until the old desktop computer gets officially replaced. And then I'll have a very beefy little travel and support computer!
Very nice computer.  Really happy with this purchase and I like the new updates Toshiba has made as I've been a Toshiba user for many years now.  This includes a better cord & adapter for the power cord, a better and more keyboard and layout, much nicer screen, and more user friendly interface all around.
Great buy!  Didn't realize it was a 64-bit machine when I placed the order, so came as a nice surprise! The weight is light for a machine with a screen this large.  I mainly use Excel for a small business needs (purchased office prof separately).  This computer has many nice features for the price.
din like laptop at all
Perfect
Horrible keyboard lay out. Overall the computer is to big and bulky to travel with on a regular basis. Windows 10 is as horrible as the last update. Everything is hidden under new names. Screen has a great picture and overall speed is good, just to hard to move around as a portable lap top.
i've always had dell laptops but i think i'm a convert to toshiba.  This thing is awesome! Windows 8 is garbage but you can pretty much ignore all the retard proof/ apple like settings they tried to put in and the software is not the fault of the operating system.  Best buy for the price!
I scoffed at reviews that stated how uncomfortable this laptop is because of the sharp edges, but they were right and I returned it. Even Toshiba did not deny the manufacturing flaws. This is a three year old model that has been discontinued because of complaints. There's a reason why it's on sale and seems to be such a great buy.
Good computer overall. Note** for some reason there is very sharp edges on all sides of keyboard top, so you will rub your elbows raw. Also mine came with a very small dead pin size pixel. I am going to replace the 1tb hdd with a pny 250ssd as the response time seems slow for an I5.
Very poor build.<br/><br/>1. The laptop stays on sometimes when you close it; it ended up staying on inside my bag and if I hadn't noticed it would have overheated inside.<br/><br/>2. The webcam does not work with Skype OR Hangout despite working on its own application.<br/><br/>3. The keyboard is very poor quality.<br/><br/>4. The trackpad hangs/freezes occasionally for 5 seconds.<br/><br/>5. The worst issue is the audio - it's just faulty; any device plugged will have the sound go up and down and fade out and then come back. I have to waste a USB port for a headset on this laptop. The same goes for built-in speakers, but when they don't go waco they are of decent sound quality.<br/><br/>6. The design is just so hacked - the function keys (F1-F12) need to have the Fn button pressed to work. What would otherwise be the custom laptop controls are the default control when you press them. E.g. the refresh button (F5) also works as a button to enable/disable the trackpad, but to refresh it is Fn+F5 and to disable/enable trackpad it's just F5.<br/><br/>Besides #6, I am not sure if I got a defective model or if it is just designed like this.<br/><br/>The sad thing is I can't even return it right now as I am in the middle of the semester and need a laptop for school work. It sucks being a poor student. All the pricing probably went into the exterior finish because frankly it is a gorgeous laptop, which is the only reason it's not 0 stars. I guess you get what you pay for.
Good value. For the price this is a reasonable choice for the average home user. However there are a few things that are sacrificed for the low price. My biggest issue is with the DVD drive. Though the drive is very fast, it is very poorly constructed. It is made out of very cheap and flimsy plastic (significantly more flimsy than your average flimsy DVD drive). Out of the box, it made a terrible grinding/rattling sound. I can tell it is just something not secured properly or out of alignment. The biggest problem with an issue like the drive is that Amazon will not provide any solution other than return or exchange. I would much prefer exchanging the drive only, or possibly offering to repair it. After spending hours loading all of my data on my new machine and changing all of the settings, the last thing I want to do is erase the drive, pack it up, send it back, and start all over again. If I didn't know that I won't be using the drive very often, than I would be more disappointed. I saw the drive as a bonus, and therefore can justify keeping the semi defective product. Other than the drive, it is a good value.
Excelent but window 10 soso
Horrible quality. The wireless card is low end and does not pick up a wireless router when laptop right next to it has 5 bars.  If you are a person who connects to many different network devices on multiple networks you will not be able to use this computer because it does not release the network connection and just hangs when trying to open a local file.  Would not recommend this laptop.
The Toshiba line of computers is a lot of computer for the price.  However, the keyboard is not working like it should be.  You can type and it can't keep up with the speed.  Many times a whole sentence will be missing.
I'm waiting for windows 10
Just the laptop I wanted, an order your competitors were unable to fill twice from HP during the days leading up to Windows 10. While I slept it downloaded Win 10 and upgrading the next morning was flawless. Thank you.
Purchased this for our niece who will be starting college in the fall.  This laptop had all of the features we were looking for, and came at a great price.  There is enough memory to run multiple programs efficiently.
Light weight, easy setup, and user friendly
Everything is as expected
So far i am happy with it

I think that this is a good deal for under $500 with a few extra features for the price compared to others in the price range. The design is similar to the C655, that I bought a few years back, with the 10 key number pad keyboard, DVD RW drive, and 15.6" screen; but it is a little more squared off and slightly thinner. I only have good things to say about my older Satellite after a few years of what I would call normal laptop use (on the go type use). This one even seems like it is a bit more rigid than the older one. Battery life seems to be in the 5-6 hour range for general use (on and off-line usage).<br/><br/>Initial setup was pretty quick and easy, with Windows 8.1 pre-installed, but several hundred MB of updates were necessary, so depending on your internet speed, this will affect your setup time. A reserved upgrade to Windows 10 is currently available for free (once available). With an I-5 processor and 8GB of RAM, it isn't the fastest most powerful workhorse out there, but should handle the majority of general users with ease. I use some resource intensive programs (ArcGIS) that run easy enough on this machine, so for general household or production type applications, I think it will do alright. Some features that I think I would call "extras" in it's price range (under five-hundred) are the DVD/CD writer, 8GB RAM and the 1TB hard drive. No included DVD drive is becoming more common as laptops get thinner and lighter, and there are still enough competitors out there in the same price range with half the RAM and/or half the hard drive. I also like that this didn't come overloaded with bloatware. While there are some Toshiba branded applications and McAffee and Office 365 trials, I wouldn't consider this to be overly problematic. I uninstalled the McAffee and Office trials before even running Windows update, and Windows automatically prompted me to turn on Defender when I restarted without the McAffee.<br/><br/>Like the other laptops in this price range, it does not have a touch screen -I didn't expect that it would, but thought I'd mention it just to put it out there. The camera is actually pretty good for the price of the laptop, and I would rate the built in mics at above average. The mic pickup is sensitive enough to be clearly heard at low conversational tones, and the setup is good for skyping or similar applications like GoToMeeting etc. The speakers are better than those on my C655, but still not great. For anything other than computer alert sounds or spoken audio, you will want headphones or external speakers -but this is usually the case with most laptops, including my $2k work HP. The only other shortcomings that I have noticed are the hard drive speed (I would rather have a smaller faster HD than a 1TB 5400 RPM drive -with USB 3.0 and cloud storage, speed is preferable over size IMO), and the graphics. I am having compatibility issues with several HD TVs due to limitations of the graphics card, and haven't found the built-in display to be anything but mediocre in terms of overall quality. With that said, I still believe it to be a good deal overall for features vs. price. It is just worth mentioning because these items may be deal breakers for certain buyers.
Great price, good quality, works perfectly
It is freat and faster. I love it Toshiba.
This laptop is a great value ... powerful, lightweight, strong construction, fast start and shutdown.<br/> Only thing I added was a small wireless mouse. Love this product !!!
Great computer... Battery life fair.
The screen keeps rotating on its own
Bought it for my wife, she loves it.
Boyfriend is happy...I gave this to him as a gift for him returning to school.  His old machine was having issues and so I ordered this as a replacement.  So far, so good.
The key 'pageup' came out while using the first time. The down key works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.<br/>Laptop heats up quite quickly<br/>Make A LOT OF NOISE
This is my second Toshiba and it's as good as or better than my old one.  I decided to update after 5 years.  I'm satisfied and recommend a mid priced laptop to anyone
I  am enjoying this computer.  Couldn't have made a better choice for my needs. Its fast and the programs are so easy to use.  Deserves a 5 star rating in my opinion.
good
👍🏻
Great laptop, well worth the price
Always been a strong supporter of the Toshiba Satellite line, and the new generation has not let me down.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>- Windows 10 is really nice. It's the best one yet I think. ( I hated Windows 8)<br/>- The visual quality is good, everything appears to be in HD<br/>- Processing speed is pretty fast for a midrange computer<br/>- Comes with Edge, the successor to Internet Explorer. It's my favorite browser already, Chrome has too many bugs.<br/>- Thin and lightweight. It's definitely portable and can fit in any bag<br/>- Long battery life. I think it gets like 9 or 10 hours.<br/><br/>Cons -<br/>- If you want a big screen, this is not it. If you have trouble seeing, or just want good screen for your movies/gaming, you'll want to go up to a 17 inch screen.
Good value for reasonable price, light weight, long lasting battery.  Do wish the touch pad had a scrolling feature, but for the price I can manage without it.
Very good piece of contraption, light weight, fast processor, high RAM, high storage. Only thing I ca on moan about is that key board feels slightly crammed.
I purchased this computer less than a month ago and have been frustrated by it time and time again. The first issue was when I started it up right out of the box. One of the pixels in the left part of the screen didn't work. It is only noticeable when the screen is a dark color so I decided to just live with that vs returning it. Then, a few days later, I started dealing with a sound issue. One minute it works fine and then the next thing I know there is no sound and I have to restart the computer to get the sound working again. My BIGGEST complaint is that now the computer will not run on just the battery alone. It must be plugged in. As soon as I unplug it, the computer shuts off. There is a red X over the battery icon  (while it is plugged in) but when you click on it, it says 100% fully charged. However, like I stated, as soon as it is unplugged it dies. I find this incredible frustrating! I have been trying to google a solution but I'm not finding anything very helpful. The idea of purchasing a new battery for a BRAND NEW computer is annoying. I would not purchase this computer again!
Good student laptop. Lightweight, decent Ram and plenty of processing power, not to mention a DVD Rom drive that is becoming increasingly rare in laptops.
Does anyone know what to do about the edges? I have considered some options like; sanding edges, tape, silicone. Anyone try something that worked. Thanks!
AWESOME FOR THE $$
Hooked up to the internet for two or three days  and of course windows garbage and it can't connect to the internet again.  I bought a 500 dollar paper weight.  If you want to be on the internet buy something else because this garbage machine can't connect to the internet after three days of use.  Would never buy windows or Toshiba again.  Spend the extra money get a Mac and get something that actually works
I am satisfied with the purchase
Nice computer. Very good value. A little on the large side.<br/> Not too crazy about this windows version..10? Why don't they bring back Windows XP?
great quality, very good seller
i really loved my computer, is not heavy, the texture is beautiful, the system is really fast, it starts in just a couple of seconds. just amazing
Very nice system.
I have been trying to use this laptop for several weeks now.  It is a nice product in all respects, except the keyboard and especially the mouse functions.  Many times it is hard to get a word started and usually after the first letter is entered, the next several letters will not register.  Must watch the screen closely for when the cursor is there and when it disappears.  The most frustrating part is the mouse.  Sometimes it registers; sometimes it will not.  It is built thinly and I really believe that when I finally can't take it anymore, it will make an excellent Frisbee, a least for one throw.<br/>P.S. - I tried to hit the submit button and it won't work. )) It will eventually.
After less an month of buying it it started getting little lines on the screen, and no, I never dropped it. It has been on my desk all the time.
I ordered this thinking it might be a good replacement for my husband's Dell. However, I didn't consider software. This computer does not come with Microsoft Office, and I only have Office for Mac on disc, so we cannot put Office on it without buying the program. My husband's previous laptop came with Office, and it didn't occur to me that this one would not. That is not a knock against the laptop, however. I should have checked that detail and didn't and only share it here in case someone else forgets to check the same thing.<br/><br/>We are not fans of the numerical keyboard being it's own square area, like on a full-size desktop keyboard. Again, other people may love that feature. If you do a lot of accounting, etc... In our case, that is not helpful.<br/><br/>Everything else about this laptop is great. It operates a lot like a Mac, as far as the trackpad and scrolling, etc... The graphics are superb. It's speed is perfectly acceptable. The battery life is wonderful. It is a bit heavy. My husband attributes that to the extra numerical keypad. It is sleek laptop, over all. I am considering letting the kids have it, because they use Google Drive for school stuff and don't require any of the Office programs.
Great value.  This laptop has no deficiencies for our home use.  Comes stock with only HDMI port, so adapter may be necessary for VGA hookup.
It was such easy and fast service I was impressed. I bought 2 computers for christmas...if they work well I will be extremely  satisfied
I was very happy with the laptop it's fast and I haven't found a issue with it, it was a great buy, all the programs I run, run smooth
the new laptop can't get connected when i start it the first time. The lower the price, the worse the quality of the product will be.
My new computer is wonderful.  I seem to be able to do any thing I want.  It is very fast and efficient.  I  am very pleased with it.
I bought this for my husband and he LOVES IT. It was a fathers day gift and he still tells me thanks because he loves it so much,
This was a gift to a nephew, he is very pleased with it. He uses it for playing games and school. He is a Senior in High School.
It is a great computer since all the features it has  make it an useful divisive, but the plastic hardware is not as I expected.
Not happy with the sharp edges and how flexing the whole  system is
After looking at a bunch of Laptops I went with the C55-C5240  So far I have been loving it, and no bloatware to speak of !
Try before you buy one. This was the first time I bought a laptop without trying a similar model first. It was a huge mistake. The edges are really sharp and uncomfortable. I also cannot get the touchpad to scroll. There is no setting to change this on mine. I don't know how this thing has so many positive reviews. The components are good the case is just really bad. I thought all companies had mastered how to make a laptop by now. I'm resetting it know so maybe I can at least get to the setting to allowing scrolling. Otherwise it's just a really expensive paper weight.
I received the product with impecable timing, the laptop box was inside a bigger amazon box with some paper, nothing fancy. I opened the box you get the charger, manuals and the laptop, picked it up and thought (FOR ME) it was heavy. Does not have a minimum charge so you can't turn it off right away but at that time I was focused in the looks and feels of the laptop itself. Heavy as I said before, 4.85 lbs (2.2kg), you may argue it's a 15.6 inch, no problem, that's my personal opinion. I did not like what I saw, the keyboard seems like it's gonna fail soon, the body is all plastic (Absolutely hated that) the borders are almost razor sharp, felt like I was going to cut myself. If you don't care about how it is in your hand or your are not going to move with it often, go for it, the specs are very good in relation with the price. I decided to return it right away, I may have to expand my budget or just wait for a laptop that fits my needs in the near future (as it was supposed to be a gift, and I won't gift something I wouldn't personally use).
Great laptop for the price
I bought this for my wife, she opens it up turns it on and the first thing that pops up is this error<br/><br/>Check cable connection!<br/>PXE-M0F: Exiting Intel PXE ROM.<br/>No bootable device --  insert boot disk and press any key<br/><br/>I hope this is fixable on my end because this kind of blows.
So far its a good computer, only has McAfee preinstalled (which I removed and installed Norton). Its both light and thing, has a full keyboard. Only complaints is that it is the corners are a bit sharp. Also be careful of anything falling onto it as the screen will crack (sadly found this out after a stupid accident....). Will try to get the screen replaced because this computer is good for the price<br/><br/>IMPORTANT, GET THE ACCIDENT PROTECTION.<br/><br/>Apon sending my laptop to Toshiba to get a replacement screen I recieved an estimate back of 390$ dollars. This 390$ includes shipping, labor, and parts replacement. I would highly recommend spending the extra 78$ because you never know what can happen. Of this 390$, 110 is nonrefundable just to get the computer looked at.
The only negative is that you have to remove two screws to remove the battery. It doesnt have a quick release mechanism.
Very nice machine for my needs. Had to get familiar with windows 8 but I am learning its peculiarities and am satisfied.<br/>Free upgrade to 10 went easily and I like the new system.
Very good laptop so far. My only complaint is that it's not the size they claimed. It's 17 inches instead of 15 inches.
My wife loves this computer. Her only complaint, no CD/DVD drive. But that seems to have become the industry standard.
Would have given 5 stars if not for Windows 10 which is a massive invasion of privacy, with Cortana that I can't get rid of. Oh guess what? Microsoft will let ANYONE charge your account to buy xbox games without having any record of your name, number, email... NOTHING. THen you will have to dispute it with your bank. I find this to be pretty shady happening a month after I got my laptop, with an xbox app pre-installed that I can't remove. The laptop is nice, but Microsoft will sell any info they can find on you to the highest bidder.
I have given myself almost a month to get used to using this computer.<br/>Within that time, I've downloaded and used only three applications: Spotify, Chrome, and Firefox. All three of them freeze multiple times a day and operate very slowly the rest of the time. The WiFi is constantly dropping connection regardless of where I am in proximity to my router; my other wireless devices aren't having issues, so it certainly isn't an issue with the router. The webcam is decent quality, but the microphone is terrible and has created an echo in every video call I've made. My image is apparently really clear to other people, but I have had to put video quality to the lowest setting in order for the video not to freeze for me. My internet connection is incredibly fast for all other devices in my home. Battery quality is mediocre at best: a little over three hours of light use on Eco mode. The black plastic build of the laptop has oddly sharp edges, and the touchpad is EXTREMELY slow to respond (I broke down after two days of trying to get it to work and bought a wireless mouse).<br/><br/>What DO I like about this? The picture quality of the screen is beautiful. The bluetooth has amazing range with my different devices, and it is easy to switch between devices that I'm using. The keyboard is nice to type on, and I really enjoy having the 9-key on the side.<br/><br/>I don't know if this is an issue with Toshiba; I have never bought one of their computers before.<br/>Perhaps it is an issue with Windows 8 being absolute garbage (though the world only has to suffer with it for another month before 10 is released).<br/>Personally, I use computers almost primarily for internet browsing, listening to streaming music via Spotify, and keeping in touch with colleagues and family with Google Hangouts. I don't know much about computers nor do I use them for gaming or any large programs. My previous laptop has better connection to wifi, a more-responsive touch pad, operates all kinds of programs faster, and has excellent webcam/microphone - all despite having half the RAM and being nearly 5 years old. I CAN tell you that when a product barely performs basic tasks with basic programs, I'm baffled how it can some how become ranked as #1 Best Seller.
we are pleased with the C55-C5240 laptops.  We purchased two in April.  We have owned several Toshiba computers.
Weird shape of inside face. Sharp edges make for  uncomfortable hold . OK display. Not so responsive touch pad.
Has been everything we thought it would be.  Good computer for everyday at home projects and internet browsing!
So far so good. Great bang for your buck. Only complaint so far is the iffy trackpad and the cheap outer build
I bought this laptop for online classes and I couldn't be happier. A great price and its working beautifully.
Very easy to operate. I already had one myself and bought this one for my wife. Best computer I've ever had.
nagging sporadic problems..... have talked to toshiba folks... windows 10 ??  close to sending it back...
Great buy-very fast with 8 gig of ram and 1 TB storage and windows 10 is a nice upgrade over windows 8.
This is a great computer. Takes a little getting used to, but it exceeded my expectations in every way.
Great everyday home and work laptop.. Very easy to use and quiet powerful. I recommend it highly AAA+++
The computer arrived fast, and works great. The lack of packaging had me concerned, but it made it ok.
It meets absolutely all my expectations as far as hardware, software, keyboard, dimensions and weight.
Generally solid top performer for the money, good battery life, good screen, ok but clunky key board.
Bought to replace my wife's old lap top. This fit the bill, it's quick and easy to use. She loves it
dear sir<br/>can you make wish for me<br/>I want this computer with arabic key board please thanks
Really disappointed with this laptop. Had a Toshiba for years. Quality poor and screen is terrible.
Attempted to do the initial media back up as was directed by the instructions in the manual. Note when you do this, (when Windows 10 is updated), Toshiba requests you use a Kingston 16GB USB drive.<br/>I was told by Toshiba customer service that I was not able to do the complete back up due to Windows 10 does not have the available update to complete the back up properly. I was instructed to return periodically to their website to check if the update was available/installed for the recovery.<br/>However, I could purchase the back up from them for $39 dollars, so if windows 10 doesn't have the update for me to do this, how do they have the back up?<br/>Toshiba customer service personnel are great! Just not sure what is going on with Toshiba and Microsoft with this Windows 10 update for the recovery?  But they have this back up to purchase...um?
The laptop began to errors immediately after setup.
The sharp edges on this thing hurts your wrists after using it for an hour.  Debating on sanding it down or something to fix the issue or just returning the product.  Clearly this is a design flaw that should be rethought.  The touchpad also isn't a smooth surface so it irritates your fingertips after a while.<br/><br/>Bought this to tool around on the internet at home so I don't have much commentary on performance at this time.
Very nice laptop for the price. I've had no problems with this laptop. Easy to use and setup.
Arrived perfectly, already installed with Windows 10.  Very fast, really happy with purchase. Love my new computer I love Toshiba pc my previous laptop was a Toshiba lasted me 5 plus years. Never had any problems with it. Until the last couple years keys started going out. So needless to,say that laptop was well loved!
I would have given this five stars, but the keyboard/touchpad design leaves much to be desired. I guess I will get used to it, and I would buy this computer again for the price. It's a really fast computer, was easy to set up, and the screen is nice and large. Very sleek looking computer. Lightweight. Great, great price and value. But, the touch pad is positioned off to the left and is close to the front edge, which is very sharp against your hands (yes, I peeled the protective strips off). It seems like the product designer was going for "pretty" rather than function. It's a LAPTOP, it should feel and work nicely when it's sitting on your lap. It fails in that area. Thankfully for me this is a computer that is used mostly for surfing the web. I wouldn't want to work on it all day long.
I had hope for an easier keyboard for those of us who use excel for statistical data entry
Laptop had everything that we needed.  The laptop arrived on time and the screen is great.
Do not i repeat Do not spend your money on this laptop. Right after the 30 day return date a huge line came up in the middle of the screen. not worthy it, do not waste your money.. Plz do not waste your money.
Works great windows 10 looks to be good after I turned off all the add related programs.
Great unit
I received the laptop on Saturday, 08/22/15. The main reason I bought is because it comes with Windows 10 and the great price.After some difficulty in adding the Yahoo Toolbar things went ok. This morning 08/25/15 when I tried to log on through my wireless connection the icon showed limited connectivity. I called my service provider who is ATT and after over an hour on the phone with a tech he could not resolve the problem. I researched on Amazon and found that a lot of people have had the same problem. I called Toshiba Customer Support at 1-800-457-7777. The tech ask a few questions and said he would have to refer me to another department. He placed me on hold and that is where I have stayed for the last 45 minutes waiting for someone to answer the phone. If I can't get this problem resolved today I am going to call Amazon Customer Support and find out what I need to do to return. I think there is a restocking fee which I find disturbing especially if the product is defective. What is  also bad is I ordered one of these as a gift for a friend which will be received today. Now I am wondering if they are going to have the same problem and will have to return. MY ADVICE IS DON'T BUY THIS MODEL. FIND SOMETHING ELSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO GET WITH WINDOWS 8.1. THERE WILL BE A FREE UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After reaching a Toshiba tech trained to handle my problem I am very satisfied with my purchase. I have owned numerous Toshiba products in the past and never had problems which I believe is what got me so upset with this laptop. However the tech was extremely helpful and corrected the problem within about 15 minutes. Since then I have ordered another one as a gift to a friend of mine and she loves it. I am confident that should any problems arise the well trained techs at Toshiba will be able to resolve them.
This is a very nice looking laptop. The user interface is clean and easy to use. However, this computer was a software mess, requiring three separate calls to toshiba for tech support because to wifi would not connect for anything. We eventually had to do a complete PC reset to get it to work. It works great now but you might want to wait until the software problems are fixed.
The item was delivered on time. in prfecto estdo and runs may I recommend purchase
The computer is everything I thought it would be, fast, comfortable to operate,etc
The screen went black and wont turn on, the product is not even 3 months old. Disappointing because my other toshiba is 9 years old and still works. Quality of toshiba's laptops went down.
The computer its great , but it came with a tiny microscopic damage on the screen . Unfortunately the item was shipped to Peru as a Birthday gift so i wont be able to repair it in the U.S
Great!!!!
relatvly good computer.<br/><br/>has some bags and I don't like the keypad.
love it, fast enough to do what I need and more than enough space for my work
Keyboard absolutely sucks.. have to back track and delete, retype constantly.  Shift key especially is non functional. Generally loads slowly. So  far I am Not impressed. The issue with keyboard significantly slows everything down so much that I am seriously  Considering returning it.  I can't type a single sentence without backtracking.
Not Impressed! I guess I'm used to Dell laptops...  Sound card did not work from day one, but my daughter waited a week after Amazon return period to tell me about it.  Now I've got to track down if it is the sound driver or card itself.  Runs pitifully slow with Windows 8 (even though i5 processor).  Has locked up already on three occasions for no apparent reason! Wi-Fi reception is weak. I truly hate having to work on a new computer or go through the hassle of dealing with customer service. Now my daughter is upset because she started back to college this week & cannot use all the needed functions of her new laptop... Regretting this purchase!
Fast shipping with the awesome Amazon prime. The computer is bigger than I expected. I'm still playing around with it trying to get use to windows considering I have been using a Mac book for a few years. All features are great just need to purchase Microsoft office since it doesn't come with the computer. Great purchase
Hardware is fine good performance & size for me. Win 10. Not happy with.
Not bad. Good enough for a 91 yr old senior. Email and Word..he is good.
Worth the price.
Great selection!
It's really good
Extremely slow since I got it. Internet connections never seen to be stable, even though the rest of my family's devices connect just fine. I need a laptop, so I don't have time to return it.<br/><br/>Also, as others have mentioned, the corners feel pretty sharp, so handling the laptop just isn't very pleasant.
The speakers / sound keeps going out and you need to reboot; this appears to be an on going problem with Toshiba Satellite C55.  The DVD tray I am sure is going to break / fail it is loose and wobbles.  If my old laptop had not died I would return this.  I will never buy another Toshiba basedon this one.
Great laptop for the prices. Upgraded to Win 10 Pro and works great!
Awesome product for the price. It actually exceeded my expectations.
Good product. My only question:why are these screens so reflective?
I really liked the laptop over all.  Unfortunately when typing the space bar did not work.  Kind of a big deal.  I called Toshiba, who's only answer was to return.  I googled the problem and found it to be pretty common with Toshiba.  They have decided to ignore so far regardless of lost sales.
I replaced my HP computer with this one thinking that Toshiba would be a lot better after the problems that I had encountered with my HP over the past 3 years. I had a toshiba in the past and it was the best computer i had ever owned. I got this one sent to me from Toshiba and right out of the box i was having problems. The mouse stopped working which caused me to have to do a master reset on a brand new computer, it  continuously froze and lagged which we all know if annoying when your in a hurry and trying to get things done at a fast pace. After about 2 weeks of this the computer did something strange and blew the page up in big porportions and froze up. I turned the computer off thinking that by turning it back on it would fix what ever just happened but turning it back on did nothing but show me that the mouse was again not working at all. So now I'm stuck with a paperweight until i can get back into Toshiba for a warranty claim that you have to pay to send back to them. Toshiba computers are not what i remember them to be. If i was you i would skip the 50/50 chance of maybe maybe not having a computer you can depend on and get a macbook. This thing is useless and for it having so much memory and ram there is no reason for it to be acting like this. So disappointed in this product.
excelent product , i like it , if you buy it ,you will enjoy a lot
great computer. does everything I need done. enjoying it so far.
Great performance, one of my best purchases in the year so far.
My c55_c5241 Toshiba has met my expectations  I will recommend
Gave to my daughter for high school graduation.  She loves it.
This laptop is perfect as an addition to my desk top computer.
Nice machine for the price i got it for $463.00 incl. shipping
I ordered it becuase my friend said it was perfect for everything I need. When it got here it seemed great until I tried to listen to music.  The speakers didn't work.  No sound.  So I had to return it and now wait 8 days for the next one to get here and pray it works.
Bought this mainly for school. So far it's nit disappointing!
Nice. Has a lot of memory and the screen is easy on the eyes.
Great computer for the price. Does everything I need thanks.
great upgrade, learning windows 8.1 isn't too onerous either
I've only had it for month and thus far it has been great!!
Very good value for price.  Works fine, no user complaints.
Quickest return decision I've ever made.<br/><br/>The edges where you rest your wrists are so sharp, I couldn't use the computer without my wrists feeling like a knife was stabbing them.<br/>Also, the touch pad was only like 85% responsive; every 5th or so stroke of the mouse would freeze and not register the movement. (This could be a problem with my specific computer and could probably be fixed with an update or something)<br/><br/>Conclusion: If you want this computer, buy some sweat bands to protect your wrists.
Overall not to bad, just quite a bit slower than expected.
Looks good, that's the best I got of the price till date.
Excellent buy
Works wee so far. Lets see when windows 10 is installed.
Great value although beware of wireless network issues.
What a deal.  Works great and it showed up really fast!
Hate windows 8, but the computer so far has been great!
Within one week I have been online with Toshiba support twice and computer still isn't working properly. Locks up, loses internet, loses sound, etc and laptop is brand new!! Returning....price was a little "too good to be true...."
It's good. It has the value for the price. That's it.
This is a really good computer at an affordable price. It comes with the all new Windows 10. it has an Intel i5 core processor with Intel turbo boost technology. It gives the laptop some speed but if you are a gamer I suggest looking elsewhere. This laptop looks great in a sleek matte black. It has a nice 15.6 inch screen that looks great but at times I wish it was brighter. The sound is average and nothing special. I had to use an external Bluetooth speaker to get better sound. It does come with an optical drive which I was shocked to see since past satellite laptops I have looked at did not have one. For me the 1TB hard drive was the selling point. That is more memory than I will ever need. Also you get 3 USB ports, an SD card slot, HDMI output, Ethernet and high speed wireless connectivity. And the high speed wireless is very fast, depending on your service provider. so overall I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a hardworking laptop at an affordable price.
Had to replace this thing twice. The first one showed and worked fine until day two when the audio card decided to start acting up or not work, which was a good majority of the time. The second's hard drive failed in two days. I'm on my third now and it arrived with a scratch across the top, also has sound card issues that require me to restart the laptop sometimes (a pain in the ass since I have this specifically for music), and just a little while before writing this it turned itself off automatically, making me fear I may be looking at another replacement, or requesting a refund and looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>It's powerful for it's size, though I wish the graphics card was a little better than just your standard integrated HD card. I also love the metal look of it (truthfully, that's one of the main reasons I bought the laptop), though the edges are surprisingly sharp. While I can't really recommend this one , it's a nice little laptop for what it is.
This is probably one of the best things I've ever purchased in here. You're getting all this features for a reasonable price. The keyboard might be the only thing that does not keep it up, but overall is a great computer.
Very fat computer. It is excellent for everyday use
Great battery life.  Good graphics.  Light weight.
Love it.  Still trying to get used to Windows 10.
Perfect for my requirements, very easy to set up.
I bought this computer to supplement my Apple MaBook Air. I always had a PC at home for business work. My old desktop was cobbled together from bits and pieces of three previous models and worked well until it was killed by a virus. I bought Toshiba because of its good reputation, but after opening the box and setting up I immediately noticed problems. The scroll pad never worked properly. I think the failure to scroll at all was the most bothersome but at other times it sent the screen scrolling wildly out of control. On day two the cursor disappeared and couldn't be retrieved. I got around this by using a usb bluetooth mouse. By day three I had trouble getting the laptop to power up so  boxed it up immediately and sent it back. Thank goodness for Amazon. They refunded the cost in full including the extra warranty I purchased. I only purchase online from Amazon for that very reason.
Nice design
The problem -- which is basically unfixable without applying some sort of padding -- is that Toshiba did not bevel or round off the edges on the surface with the keyboard!  In fact, they even look and feel slightly raised, which makes the angle your wrists rest on slightly less than 90 degrees, and thus even sharper than if Toshiba had done nothing. I had to keep adjusting my hand positioning just to keep it from leaving marks on my wrists.  Being constantly made uncomfortable by the laptop just won't do, because I use it for work everyday.<br/><br/>My family have been happily using Toshiba laptops for years.  The screen, the processor, and the fact it was pre-loaded with Windows 10 would have made it a great value.  But I cannot keep an item that hurts me.  Sorry Toshiba.  Unfortunately, this is not something that tech support can fix.  It is being returned.
So far, this has been an amazing replacement to my old HP.  The battery life, for the games and dvd's I play on it, goes about 5 hours until bone dead.  The screen color is bright and the unit is very light.  Did not get 5 stars due to the low output volume of the speakers, and the odd design of the edges of the unit when open: they are kinda sharp.  It's something to get used to on your wrists when you type.
My Acer three year old Acer Aspire laptop is dying a slow death. Freezing, hanging, slowing down, and intermittent reliability forced me to look around for a replacement. First, I love my Acer laptop. I've owner two different Aspires to date and had really hoped to purchase another one. For me, they're an easy computer to operate and offered everything I needed and I'm far from being biased as I also owned a Dell Inspiron that I also loved. Unfortunately, a lot of computer manufacturers are ceasing to install optical drives as part of the laptop. Acer is one of them. I don't know about anyone else, but I value an optical drive. I use it to both view DVDs and backing up on. I also didn't want to spend a great deal of money. I wasn't looking for a laptop with a lot of bells and whistles. I just wanted something to work on with documents and surfing the email. After comparing a number of laptops and canvassing the reviews, I settled on this one. Sad to say, that I'm not impressed with either this laptop or Windows 10. To say, I'm disappointed with it is an understatement. I've owned it for over a week so far and it still hasn't grow on me. Unlike my Acer Aspire and Dell Inspiron laptops from earlier days, straight out of the box, I was not impressed with its operation. Considering the fact that this computer is brand new without much software on it, it is very slow compared to my older Acer Aspire running Windows 7 with the same RAM of 8 GB. also, the mouse and keys are not easy to operate without significant pressure. Another caveat I have is an issue with trying to make a recovery drive. The instructions are easy to follow. I made one copy on a required flash drive no problem. but when I tried to make another copy, it didn't work. No matter what size or brand of flash drive I used, this laptop couldn't copy to it. Plus, with this computer it seems that to do anything you have to be connected to the internet, which I detest. The default settings are not private. I had to go in and change every setting for that. Worse it that I cannot choose what Windows updates I want to install and how to install them. That, I don't like at all.<br/>Looking for a new laptop that won't cost a great deal of money yet offers speed and convenience to keep up with all your work? Sadly, for me, this isn't it.<br/>Giving it a quick glance it looks like a toy and I have no idea how long it will last. I don't think it'll last anywhere near three years. It's funny because this laptop costs more now than what I paid for my Acer Aspire I purchased from amazon three years before.<br/>Further, packaging of this item from amazon was terrible. The box arrived wet, damaged and crushed. I'm surprised the laptop inside wasn't. Plus, it was sent by USPS Priority mail without any kind of markings stating that it was fragile.<br/>Overall, this was a very disappointing purchase. I purchased three computers from Amazon to date, but this is the first one I really don't like.<br/>UPDATE on November 29, 2015. Still don't like this computer. Worse with WIN 10 the PC owner has no choice as to how to download and when to install WIN updates. You can no longer pick "Notify me when to download and install." You can only choose when to restart it. If there is a way to change this, I'd like to know because I can't find it. Still hate Windows 10, and this laptop but getting used to laptop.
After a few days, I think I'm ready to post a review on this unit. It's fine for $450. I'd be sending it back if I paid more than that. There are so many small incredibly annoying things:<br/>- Function keys are also media keys (brightness, sound, mousepad on/off, etc), which is fine and dandy. Except, the media keys are the default. So, F5 (Refresh hotkey in browsers) = mousepad off. As an IT guy, that's really REALLY annoying. So, fn+F-key it is.<br/>- The edges are sharp, I don't know why. Bad if your desk is high enough that your wrists need to rest. Not such an issue if you're using this on your lap though.<br/>- Really s***ty wifi card. Works great in the same room, HORRIBLE and drops frequently if there are any obsticles. Difficult to replae this as it is located on the top of the motherboard (Under the keyboard, not accessible without taking the entire thing apart).<br/>- Windows 10 is really really bad if you have a lot of not name brand stuff you use with your computer. A lot of my bluetooth peripherals don't work on this. I'm not docking points from the product for this. Note you have downgrade rights all the way to Windows 8.1 or 7.<br/>- The screen is really mediocre. It reproduces colors alright enough and the colors are rich and lovely. However, who the heck thought putting half-1080p resolution into a 15.6" screen was a good idea? Everything is HUGE. I set Chrome to default 80% zoom so I could use the internet without needing to put the laptop 5 feet away. This also makes many things a bit unsharp, not supremely blurry, but not sharp. For example, the Spotify logo's black lines are a bit blurry but the green circle is pretty crisp. This just grates on me as I keep using it. The contrast looking from different angles really shows the quality of the screen, it's just really not great for primarily dark scenes.<br/>- The screen only goes back to about 110 degrees, which is just below comfortable while it is propped up on your knees in bed watching Netflix.<br/>-Small .25" deadzones on bottom and side of the track pad makes me want to break something.<br/>-Flimsy screen really freaks me out.<br/><br/>The good parts:<br/>-It's a great deal for day to day light use.<br/>-Feels a lot thinner than it looks in the pictures. Well balanced.<br/>-Easy to replace the hard drive after you get through the 10 screws holding in the bottom plate. Just be very careful as the bottom snaps off, so use a small flathead to gently pry.<br/>- No hard drive activity light. Thank GOD! Who the hell needs that?<br/>- All of the lights on the laptop are fairly dim or diffuse so they don't blind you at night.<br/>- It's relatively cheap. I'm not afraid of getting it stolen like I would be with a $1200 notebook.<br/><br/>I did upgrade the license to Windows 10 Pro since I didn't know prior that was required for Hyper-V functionality. Putting an SSD (120GB, $70) made this about 5 times better. All of the little performance issues I was having went away immediately. So much happier with it now.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Put an SSD in it and you will be happy with this as a web surfing machine or school machine. You won't be playing anything intense on it. I would have paid $100 more for a screen that was at least 1080p though, this just sucks for young eyes but would be great for Mom.
The computer is great, Windows 10 just so so.
Delivered in time and as expected. Thank you.
Lightweight, thin shape is ideal for school.
Love this laptop and enjoy using Windows 10
NICE COMPACT COMPUTER FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS.
haven't had product long, but great so far.
Perfect.<br/>Right on time and no demages.
Had it 1 month.  Super speedy, great price!
Outstanding unit. And delivered darn fast !
was impress with item great Toshiba laptop
The computer worked well until I got a critical error message on my screen. I understand this is a problem with Windows 10. Now I have to find someone to fix my computer.
This  is very heavy.  Very good  lap top
Very Good computer for the Price I like
DefinitelyToshiba quality! Works great!
Great Delivery! Clear and Nice Product!
Give me Windows 7 back any day, and put me out of my misery.  This is one senior citizen that doesn't get it. The hardware is fine, but doesn't seem any faster, maybe due to our basic DSL connection. The software is just too complicated and cumbersome for everyday use.  Then, there's no commonality with Windows 7, XP, etc. to ease the learning process.
It is everything I expected and more
It's an excelent computer, i love it
The sharp keyboard edge renders this machine just about useless if you want to use it for any extended length of typing. . .at least in every typing position I've encountered. It really is the most shocking piece of industrial design I've ever seen. The front edge of the machine is truly "knife" sharp and has the ability to leave scratches and even tiny cuts on the insides of one's wrists. I truly have no idea how this design made it into production. I can only hope for the sake of other people who have purchased it that our unit has a manufacturing or finish defect. Worst feeling device I've ever used.
I really wanted to like this laptop because the specs were on point and the price was within my budget. But, I had to return after two days because it was such a pain in the butt!  The computer did not read my key strokes and would freeze while typing. Also, the 'mouse' pad had to be pressed down quite hard, a few times,  for the computer to catch on. The computer would freeze and worked very slow. Keep in mind, at this point I have not downloaded anything but Skype and Dropbox so nothing is bogging it down. Already sent back to Amazon and bought an HP instead. Thank you Latoya at Amazon CS for your help!
Sadly, I was forced to buy a new laptop. I have an old Toshiba with a cheap processor that is still a working laptop. I've since gone through two HPs with supposedly better processors. I'm expecting good things from this Toshiba based on the fact that the old Toshiba serves as backup when the HPs crashed and burned.
Love the Toshiba, hate Windows 10.
outstanding! waiting for the W10
The best quality and performance
Great laptop for the price...
Great computer for the price!
perfect laptop for the price!
OMG!!! This laptop is horrible not only was it slow the 2-3 times I've used it this month but now it's completely not working. I turned it on yesterday and the Toshiba logo came on the screen and a message came up that said computer running diagnostics. I tried restarting it and the same. I tried to reset the PC and that didn't work. Did this all afternoon and this morning and couldn't get anywhere. I CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN IT. I am willing to pay more money to get something worth it.
Display resolution is bad. If you really want nice experience, go for some high resolution one by adding some 50-100$.
The video on this is great. But, it is heavy and the touchpad is not responsive enough because it is made of plastic.
I'm not a tech savvy person, this was easy to use at set up.  I don't know much about computers but this is my 3rd laptop and it's okay.  I thought the color clarity would be better,, maybe I just need to adjust it???  either way I am satisfied with my laptop.
Nice laptop for the money, it is quick and I never have to wait too long for apps to open or update, but then I upgraded my router at the same time. Windows 10 is nice too, and so is the 8G or RAM, and the I5 processor. I have had a succession of four different toshiba laptops, over about 12 years counting this one, and no repairs have been needed on any of them, they all still run, but two of them are no longer in use because they are too "slow" for what I want out of them today.<br/><br/>The only drawback is that the battery is not user replaceable, not without taking a few screws out, not ideal but OK, at least for me. I called Toshiba support about the battery replacement issue before buying to confirm that, with a screw driver I can still replace the battery myself. Maybe this is the trend now on these slimmer laptops.<br/><br/>I am watching this one to see if and when it goes on sale again and then I will buy it again.
Good price, great computer.
The computer started making noises and the cd drive worked but made a bunch of noise and was really annoying.
Nice computer clear screen
Really worth for the price
so far, so good 1 month in
Purchased it in May 2015. This laptop gives a warning message about over heating and shuts down abruptly.
Love my laptop. However the wifi worked for two days then stopped functioning. Keep getting a message the wifi configuration is invalid. A search on the Internet shows that it is a common problem with Windows 10. Laptop is fantastic though
Small black rectangles keep popping up on the screen. They appear and disappear in different locations as I move the cursor. I'm not sure what the issue is. They're not really burnt out pixels. In any case, I will be returning this soon.
Ok for a cheap Toshiba laptop.  The display is sharp and crisp.  I absolutely hate the trackpad and keyboard.  The keyboard feels like one of those ultra-cheap chicklet keyboards.  The keys have virtually no travel and no feedback.  I couldn't even feel the little bumps on the F/J keys to help position your hand on the home keys.  When I tried to adjust the trackpad sensitivity, the control panel mouse tool crashed complaining about being incompatible with the driver.  I reinstalled the driver from synaptics (sp?) and the control panel tool started working. Then,  I immediately disabled the trackpad and got my trusty wireless mouse out.  It runs Windows 10 which is a disaster in my opinion.  But, I can't really blame Toshiba or Amazon for Microsoft's garbage.<br/><br/>Can tell much about the performance yet.  It should be fairly good given the specs provided.  I'll find out about the performance after my grandson tries his gaming on it.
Great price. Good to use.
Laptop is preety good.<br/>Pros:<br/>Light weight<br/>Thin<br/>good 5th gen processor and 8 gig ram<br/>competitive price<br/>Sound is loud enough<br/>Cons:<br/>Edges are bit too sharp though manageable.<br/>Body is plastic
The specs on this laptop are amazing for the price, but the deal comes with some user experience drawbacks that are hard to overlook. These things seem minor, but when you're actually using the computer, they are very annoying. I wish we had spent more and gotten something we like better overall. Having only had this computer in my possession for 12 hours, here are the things I already find bothersome:<br/><br/>1. The machine feels cheap. The keyboard, the screen, everything. They keyboard is actually reasonably pleasant to use, but I feel like it won't hold up well. The screen seems like it could easily snap off.<br/><br/>2. The display is glossy, which makes it difficult to see when there's direct sunlight or a window nearby. I'm currently sitting on a couch with a window behind me, and I have to keep moving my head to read parts of the screen. I've never seen a computer with a screen like this.<br/><br/>3. The edges of the computer are at hard right angles. When you're wearing shorts and the computer is sitting on your legs, it's uncomfortable. Again, this is not something I'd ever have thought about, but now that I have the computer sitting on my lap, it is awkward and a little painful, and I've never experienced this with any other laptop. I can imagine if I were using it for hours on end, this would be a real problem.<br/><br/>4. The speakers are EXCEPTIONALLY bad. I'm playing music through the built-in speakers, and it sounds like there is a towel over them.<br/><br/>All that said, it is still a great computer for the price. If it weren't for the 15% restocking fee, though, I would definitely return this and pay the extra bucks for a better overall experience.
This is an excellent laptop for the money.  I've had Toshiba Satellites before and I can say just out of the box this one seems to have a much better build quality.  I'm impressed with the display and how it plays movies and videos.  Very bright and clear.  The processor is fast (but I don't play games).  It has more memory than I need and a nice big hard drive that I will never fill up.
I've had this laptop for a few months now and recently noticed my battery would not hold a charge. In order for me to use the laptop it had to be plugged in at all times which completely takes away from the portability feature of a laptop. When I contacted toshiba tech support I was told that I would have to have the laptop serviced as the battery is not user replaceable. However, when I called customer service they immediately sent a new battery. I was super excited to get the new battery until I installed it and noticed my laptop would say "plugged in and charging" but not holding a charge. I just received this new battery yesterday and have attempted to trouble shoot and everything. It's incredibly frustrating to pay $400 plus dollars for an item that doesn't function like it should. Looks like I will have to contact toshiba support, yet again.
When I get this laptop the sealing was broken, the box was opened, and the screen was damaged
Fast and a great display. As an accountant I love having the number pad.  Only  a few minor issue so far with windows 10 but that is to be expected with new software.  Very happy with the price and the performance.
Great laptop for the money. Really like the brushed finish. Very happy with this purchase.
Exceeded expectations!
Perfect nice very good
Came super fast.  Packaged well. Would not connect to the wi fi in my house.  Thought it was a setting, took it to the local computer repair business, they said it was fixed, paid 64 dollars for that. Came home, turned it on, same thing as before. Recognizes the wi fi, good signal, but won't connect. Tried all the fixes online from forums. Sent it back
Good laptop but it had dead pixels on day one. I have to return this laptop as a result.
This shop was Amazing, the best price and I received as well Amazon dit it... Thanks...
Completely satisfied.
keyboard not the best
Well the product is great and the price is greater Iam very happy with the laptop.
Horrible experience with the laptop and key pad. Returned the laptop in an hour.
Great!!! Im in love!
Exactly as described
It's great thank you
Value for the money.
Just received the product yesterday and my first day of use today September 19, 2015 and the mouse pad is not working the mouse do not move at will, I can not do anything on this equipment at the moment. I want a full refund or new product. It's ridiculous that I can not even get one day of use out of this product.
Great
Would be 4-5 stars if touch-pad was located a bit to the right. With standard hand placement I keep pressing it with my palm when I dont want to, closing files, re-sizing windows  etc
Excelente producto
Great Laptop. Fast
Works great Thanks
Does it work properly?  Sometimes  Would I buy it again?  NO!<br/><br/>I decided to pay a little more for this computer because I expected good performance and and a nice HD screen.  It was ultimately a waste! This computer is slower than my 7 year old Sony VAIO (that has less RAM and a slower processor) and for a computer that I've only had a few weeks, I  am already having to completely reboot about half the time I use it because the computer locks up.  The HD screen is pathetic!  I can't believe they are even allow to call it HD.<br/><br/>Bottom line...if you want a computer that actually works, go buy a macbook (that's what I'm about to do)!
This system is great for the price I have no complaints except for some very proprietary and not easy of use of toshiba's driver download website.<br/>The only bad thing is the hard drive, it is way too slow and the system drags. I replaced the internal HDD with a SSD and this thing just flies...<br/>If you are thinking the slowness is because of the processor or memory, well you are mistaken. A definite need is the SSD upgrade but the installation might be a bit complicated for some people, basically remove all screws from the back, pop the battery out and pry open the back panel (it clicks in place so don't worry about using some force).
We need seller to contact us.  Can't get online with wireless adapter or Ethernet most of the time. Says "limited" or "no Internet access". Geek squad couldn't hook it up to Best Buy free WiFi. Said driver seems to be corrupted or something. Worthless!
Great computer at a great price. Delivered on time and as described.
Best Value laptop
I was quite happy with this computer for about 10 days.  There were a few minor issues (keyboard wouldn't function at times) which seemed to magically fix themselves after a short period of time.  Then I got the dreaded Critical Error---Start Up Menu Not Functioning message.  Spent hours trying to fix problem myself and when I contacted Toshiba CSR, their only solution was to attempt a factory reinstall, meaning I'd have to reload all of my programs and apps.  Since I'd have to do that with this model or another brand, I opted to return the Toshiba to Amazon.  Too bad, since I really liked this computer.
this very good
so far so good
Wonderful item
When I first bought this, I had problems with the screen locking, and could not unlock.  I had to go through Amazon to reach Toshiba as there were not phone contacts on any paperwork.  Finally got that item resolved, even though at times when I am on the internet I have to shut it down because it freezes.  I would have given them a 5 star review if not for these problems.  Also, it will suddenly go into windows mode.  Rather than go through the hassle of contacting Toshiba, I just let it ride
** Very Fragile **  I got this, after reading a lot of the good reviews...with great hopes [it was #1 on the Amazon's 'Best Selling Laptops' list at the time, and on sale]. When I got it, I was dismayed on how cheap it felt - It is made of really cheap plastic and cheaply built.  The DVD drive, for example, was especially fragile (I felt it would break after a few uses).  The screen clamps were cheap as well... and felt they could also break easily.  I currently have a Dell Inspiron...which is much more solidly-built than this Toshiba.  Bottom line:  I felt it was very cheaply built and very fragile ...  I had no confidence it would hold up under normal usage, so I returned it.  PS.  Also, the corners were sharp also… not so nice.
Great product
Nice computer
I bought this laptop because the specs seem pretty good for the price..it arrived pretty quickly took it out the box an it looked cheap the edges are sharp, the screen quality is poor. My biggest problem though is the internet i connect to wifi once after it kept saying no connection limited access even though the wifi works fine else where  i got the problem fixed an after two days it has started happening again if i could i would certainly return it.
Most aspects of this computer seem to come as advertised and I was happy with the specs for a great price. Screen resolution is good. As others noted, there was not much pre-loaded bloatware, except for McAfee.<br/><br/>However within 24 hrs of receiving, the mouse has become completely unresponsive twice, requiring a shutdown and restart before it would operate again. If the problem persists and no solution is found, will have to return.<br/><br/>Update 5/20/15 - no further problems with mouse. Will update if any other occur. Upgrading rating to 4/5 until then.
I just bought this computer and I am terribly disappointed. I am not a computer person. I am not looking for anything fancy, but this computer is a total disappointment. The keyboard is unusable for someone accustomed to typing fairly quickly. I'll be working on a document, I'll stop to look at what I've just written and see that only 50% of my words are there. It just doesn't keep up. I've never had this experience with a keyboard before.
It didn't work when it arrived and I couldn't get any help without buying a support package for Toshiba and there was no Windows 10 help available online.  Very frustrating.
Worth buying
Great value
all of a sudden i cant connect to the internet!!!! it keeps saying "wifi doesnt have a valid ip configuration". when i first got the laptop it was fine.  i have tried uninstalling the drivers and re-installing but no luck. restarted my wifi router/modem and still there is no change. VERY disappointed. does anyone else have this problem? im not sure if its a hardware issue or software.
great deal
Works fine
Great laptop for an affordable price
The computer is actually decent.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Processor is peppy, not overly fast but good enough. Hindered by the HDD.<br/>Battery life was very sufficient, got 6-8 hours mixed use<br/>Keyboard was natural, except the num keys are awkward and too tight<br/>Camera is decent<br/>Windows 10<br/>Looks slick<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Screen is super low quality, I could count the pixels<br/>TouchPad is a joke. Very inaccurate often had to click things 2 even 3 times. It is a matte texture and is hard to smoothly slide. Multi touch functions, even scrolling, were useless<br/>Whole body of the computer flexes and creeks when you pick it up with 1 hand<br/>Fingerprint magnet!<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>Some people had issues with the edges being sharp, I didn't notice this at all and wouldn't make that a breaking point in purchase.<br/>The charging plug feels like it will break, doesn't really feel secure in the computer. Never came out or had an issue, but feels like it'll last a few months then need a new one.<br/><br/>Overall I returned it. I could have lived with the bad screen and cheap build quality if the mouse worked like aa mouse should. This is a great first laptop or college laptop. Beyond that though, spend an extra 100 and get a nicer HP or something.
Wow!! What I nice laptop. It's sleek and lightweight. It's the nicest one I've ever owned
Excelente
Great buy
Very good
It's fine
Very good
nice fast
Excellent
Good deal
System after starting,throwing some error...which when called toll free numbers no response<br/>Really waste of money and time
Basic model , light and efficient
Good producto for a reasonable price. nice shape, color, and most of all : PERFORMANCE
Great laptop couldn't be happier
Disappointed in the case/keyboard. It felt and looked like a cheap toy. It even had sharp edges. My last Toshiba had a beautiful and durable case. I still have it and just wanted to upgrade. Windows 8.1 was no problem. Guess I will spend a little more just to get a better quality case. Hate to change brands!
I was logging my personal info in then I received a message saying "Oops something went wrong". I have been able to log on, finish setting up or get off that page! Only one little quick set up book came along with it. No other instruction booklets or who to call came with it. Very disappointed!
My last five laptops have been Toshibas.  I bought Toshibas for three daughters for graduation gifts.  This one may be my last.  Some of the problems I'm experiencing may be the fault of Windows 8.1.  But some are definitely not.<br/><br/>What I don't like.<br/>1.  The surface of the case shows every fingerprint.  My brand new laptop looks dirty all the time.<br/>2. The keyboard surface curves at the edge.  This causes a painful pressure on my arms where they meet the sharp edge of the keyboard.  It is uncomfortable to type on.  These are design flaws.  I could live with the first, but the second is going to annoy me endlessly.  I wish I could return it.<br/><br/>In addition (and I don't know if this a Toshiba thing or a Windows 8.1 thing) but this computer, although an upgrade from my last computer, doesn't run as efficiently.  It's slower.  This is particularly true when running Firefox rather than Explorer.  Also, my computer also will stop loading in either Explorer or Firefox, and I'll get a white screen, have to back out and reload.
Edges are too sharp on the wrists when typing but other than that it's perfect!
Excelent
Love it!
love it!
This is my third C55-C5241, the first encountered a software problem with Windows 10, the second had a defective ear plug jack,my current C55-C5241 functions perfectly,and is in my opinion well worth the price,although the build is a little on the inexpensive plastic side.
Great laptop; very pleased.
Exceeds all my expectations
It's a great everyday laptop, but the support is pretty bad for a new computer. The drivers are very hard to find, even on toshiba's support website, and the webcam has some issues. But it runs fast and quietly and is pretty good for those in school.
Like it
The computer arrived as promised, shipped promptly after ordering. However, there were problems connecting with Internet, and a $50 charge was incurred for the professional help required. That was disappointing, but now it is up and running well.
I was impressed with the light weight and the screen. It came with Windows 10 which is very impressive except for the fact that I had to completely restart my computer twice within the first 2 weeks. I returned it and purchased a MACBOOK AIRE.
Not very happy with it after a week of use. Edges of the computer are actually pretty sharp. Seems like that could be an easy fix when creating the computer. Frame is made of plastic which isn't that bad. For a brand new computer, it's pretty slow for updates, getting internet to run and to boot up. Took 8 Seconds for Google Chrome to come up (I counted) which seems long. I was not use to the sound at all, it's not very clear and is muffled when playing. Played a YouTube video listening to some music and the sound started to scratch. Which I tried with other sounds and still had the same problem. Screen isn't very clear, and the mouse pad can get real frustrating real quick. It lags out and the typing buttons are real sunk into the keyboard. I don't like to be picky but spending $430 I want to be sure I like something. I think I'm going to be returning it.
the battery doesn't come out, its a built in battery- and for me its a big NO NO.<br/>otherwise  its an ok computer, i didn't like it very much.<br/>also- i ordered it on Sunday, and it was supposed to come on Monday, but for some reason i got it on Thursday, was very disappointed<br/>ended up returning it..
The wifi card is rubbish - it hardly picks up signal 10 feet away, whereas my mac would pick up signal anywhere in the house. Also, the screen is cheap and cracked in <2 months - keeps cracking and warranty doesn't cover it. The headache this computer causes is not worth the money saved
Good for the money... But very sharp edges... Not for children
Works great.  Super thin and lightweight.  Plenty fast.  I upgraded the memory to 16GB.  Not sure how much that helped but it sure can't hurt.  May swap out for a SSD in the future - not really a big deal at the moment.
Really sleek and stylish but is also very functional, thanks!
Hi, I like it the product and your delivery was fast. But I need to know if You could send me the invoice with this name CARMELINA MARTINEZ because this person will bring me the laptop to Venezuela.<br/>Thanks you!
Don't think you can beat a computer like this at it's price.  Trackpad is a little shifty though.  When trying to scroll down a page sometimes it zooms instead.  There's probably a setting, just haven't looked yet.
This is it, I’m done scouring the internet for something that actually works.
No complaints at all.
Perfect for my needs.
This is a great laptop for a great price!  College laptop.
First Toshiba laptop I purchased and it was a bad investment. its only been 12 hrs and there already a problem. setup my laptop by logging into windows, after which i restarted laptop to finish off avast protection and now im in a loop where it says preparing automatic repair. called tech support and was told i have to reset my pc (which took the whole night) woke up and i was back to square one, still having the same problem. decided to call again and was told to do the same thing even after I mention Ive been through the process already.  I regret investing in this laptop (which i needed for school) and because of this problem and the lack of support i got from Toshiba tech support, i will not by this brand again.
I purchased software for the Toshiba Satellite, the Toshiba doesn't (for some reason) like the software and is creating a real problem.  I've always liked Toshiba's but this one is not worth the trouble!
Very good computer, especially for the price.  Ignoring the aesthetic issues, like the edges being rather uncomfortable, it's worth every cent.  Now if windows 8 could be removed with  a wish ....
Excellent features with this price, has a metallic look
No back lit keyboard makes it difficult to type in dark. Dislike new Windows 10. Know it's got some necessary features, but program too busy and functions too hidden to find easily.
GREAT
had to return mine due to 3 problems.<br/><br/>1. right click on touch pad didn't work despite attempt to adjust settings.  Right click menu would vanish after one second or so in a flash no matter what setting I choose.<br/><br/>2. system stopped booting.<br/><br/>3. software to create recovery disk/USB thumb drive would crash.<br/><br/>That said, external appearance was very modern and eye catching.  I did notice very sharp plastic edges.<br/><br/>I might try one more time to see if the version I got was typical or not.  I really liked the component and also how the laptop performed.
It stopped working after 2 months using , I am disappointed.
Everything works as advertised with good speed.
Worst laptop I have owned in 20 years. Touchpad rarely works with most current driver which is reinstalled when I roll back to old one that works. Computer either locks completely when I plug in any usb device or the mouse pointer goes dead and a reboot is required.<br/>Windows installation media is not included, nor can you create it with the included program. The process fails every time regardless of which of many supposed solutions are implemented after numerous hours of research on the problem. This machine is not ready for primetime with Windows 10. .
I had great expectations for this laptop after reading all the reviews. The computer did not work right out of of the box. The keys on the keyboard kept sticking or lagging. It was very frustrating to type anything. After a week of hoping it will sort out somehow, I finally called Toshiba service and was told it was a hardware problem and to either return it or send it to a service center, which would take 10 days. I decided to return it. I'm just glad it was still within the warranty window.
Super light, and nice quality casing/panels.  Very sleek.  So far, it stays cool and is getting my moderate gaming needs done (Civ 5).  Happy!
good
So this really is just an OK machine. It simply isn't very solid. The keyboard is obnoxious to use because you really have to hit the keys pretty hard to type, especially the space bar. The USB ports don't feel overly solid, and thus connectivity has been a bit of an issue (ex: had to use a different wireless mouse).<br/><br/>If given the choice I probably wouldn't buy this machine again.
bought it...<br/>good price good appearance good<br/>however,,,,WiFI<br/>as soon as I got it set up was snap..fast<br/>after all, kept failing WiFi connection..<br/>even though, My router was working perfectly..<br/>i googled it and tried to fix it...service center, tech support<br/>nobody picked up,,, only voice instruction was kept going over and over<br/>Byebye return
Nice laptop
Fine laptop, I'm enjoying win 10.
Great computer for my teenage son
Computer worked great the first 20 days I had it. It was a birthday present. As we speak it is now being sent to Toshiba for hardware repair issues. It was bought as a replacement to an older computer and now I have to get this computer repaired as well. It was fantastic the first 20 days. Now I'm annoyed that it has a hardware issue so soon after being purchased.
I returned it.  It felt cheap, really cheap, with a poor keyboard and terrible speakers.  And you know what I did?  I bought a cheaper laptop with somewhat less impressive specs (ASUS F555LA-AB31).  The ASUS performed better, actually, with a better keyboard, sound, and overall build quality.  And I didn't feel ripped off because I paid $100 less.
so many problems with the windows update/ wifi connection and so on..<br/>Other than that, it is okay
The laptop works fine, the problem is that the edges are very sharp and uncomfortable to lay your palms or writs when you use the keyboard. First laptop I have that is this uncomfortable to use. The edges should be rounded.<br/><br/>The audio sounds distorted even at low volumes.<br/><br/>You get what you pay for, quality isn't as nice as others.
I absolutely love my new lap top.. It's so light weight. I love the set up and it's easy to use.
Very Impressed with that it is a Windows Ten Ready laptop. Also Impressive is it is I5 and 1tb and 8 gb of ram
This computer arrived and I took it out of the box and it will not connect to internet. I call tech support and they do some resets and LAN works. WiFi shows but no connection. They escalate support. Now I get someone who try to sell me support for 200. I say no, just need it to connect wirelessly. They say computer comes only with hardware warranty so there are "two possibilities", I "got a virus" online or "I put corrupted software" in the computer. I tryed to explain that I literally took it out of the box plugged it in and it would not  connect.  They would discount for 89 one time support...I ask why.  I have requested a return; the more I think about it the madder I get because the crux of it is they think I am lying, how am I to defend that; I will ask for a refund. No more toshiba! I'm done.<br/><br/>My question now goes to amazon.... the computer is not doa, just defective. Will I get hit with a restock fee?<br/><br/>Lesson I wish toshiba would learn.... be nice, not everybody lies.
love my new laptop very good
I ordered this Computer for the price. Within an hour of having it it would not power on properly. I got a replacement from amazon and within a day the same thing on a different computer. Both hard drives failed within 12 hours. Do not buy this. as always Amazon gets 5 stars for taking it back for a refund.
Very nice affordable laptop
everything seems to be fine.  I really hate being forced to switch to windows 10, but .... what can we do?  Ok, about the computer:  I don't know what the heck Toshiba was thinking but the edges on this thing is so sharp, I'm surprised they haven't been sued yet.  I'm not joking.  I read lots of others talking about sharp edges, but I was like, "eh",  and they were right!  I had to buy a wireless keyboard now just so I don't have to cut my wrists all up and speed up carpel tunnel surgery along with it.  my last Toshiba I got two years ago was so comfortable.  I don't know why they had a brain fart with this design.  Seems to be the American way with products these days especially when it comes to upgrades, so enjoy this computer... I have no  complaints with its performance, but it lost two stars on the rating because I could barely type this review due to the comfort.  it's REALLY REALLY BAD.
Good  computer for the pos
This is excellent for the price, but the screen is awful. Mine has 2 dead pixels.
Good morning, I bought this laptop on jun 2 and received it on jun 17 whist being excited with my purchase. I was really disappointed to be checking the camera and noticing that it is very grainy. Is it possible to get some feedback on this please.
Worse computer ever, I hardly use It and after a Month It just locked, I tried by taking the batery off and It did not work, I guess I had even more bad luck since I am from Costa Rica and It It hard to get a change, trust me di not buy this one
To be a new computer, it was very slow and the screen size was too small.
The price was much more affordable than the brick and motar outlets.
Pretty user friendly!
Ok
I thought this would be a great product. The first time I dropped it, the case split open on the area of the power supply. The biggest problem is that I cannot transfer the data. THANK GOD I GOT A WARANTEE.
Looks really delicate. All made of plactic! Ive had a Toshiba Same size and within 1 year the screen broke the part that opens. The screen is to big and the material used on it doesnt seem to handle it!.
Thanks
Computer is slow for the ram / memory and wasn't overall impressed with the computer. Great for its weight and screen picture, but overall I feel could speed up the start up and use of applications.
Graphics are amazing. It almost hurts my eyes it is so crisp. I really haven't had time to dive right in but I'm still trying to get a feel for Windows 8. It is very confusing. Overall, initially I had some trouble let with lagging but it seemed to clear up. Everything was nice and neat comibg right out of the box. People are right though,  the edges all around the front and the side are extremely sharp. It feels like if you rest your arm the wrong way you might get sliced so in that sense it is very uncomfortable to rest your arms as you are typing. I personally don't think you can go wrong with a Satillete.
delivered as advertised (2 days).  appeared as described.<br/><br/>However, when attempting to access internet to activate, unable!  Internet providers were visible but could not complete connections.  Double frustrating as all suggested fixes required internet access.  And phone connections dropped after 9 minutes!<br/><br/>Finally brought in technician.  Internet protocols were corrupted (W10 over pervious system? )  Tech deleted drivers, updated wireless adapter and reset all TPC/IP protocols.  I now have internet access and can post this review.<br/><br/>You do not want this aggravation.
Its a great working computer, but keyboard and battery are a big issue. I use it as my home laptop to do some work related activities from home, and I really like the speed of this laptop, but keyboard is really flat and doesnt make typing easy on this. Battery is attached with screws. dont know why battery is like this? i bought it on amazon and paying very reasonable price, but probably will keep it for a year and give it to my son.
Remedied with software update.
Excellent....
Nice Laptop, fast, and beautiful machine
It's a good standard function computer.
excellent laptop, it runs very smoothly
I ordered this laptop a couple of days ago and just got it delivered  today. All I can really say is that you get what you pay for. This thing has locked up on me at least 10 times already. I previously bought two other laptops off of Amazon and didn't really have any problems until they got a few years old. This one is one of the worst laptops that I've ever bought. I honestly can't recommend this to anyone.
I bought it and delivered it to yesterday. Here I am, half day later, I am returning. The screen clarity is just not there. Uploaded photos looks so bad so I had to compare with my ten years old laptop. Of course, my old laptop was much better. It was hard to type in the low lighted room because the keyboard is not lit and mouse left and right buttons were not smooth so I had to push really harder.
I bought my Toshiba laptop because of all the positive reviews, but I have to say this is the worst laptop I've ever owned. As someone who listens to music on my laptop all day long the quality of sound is a -50. The sound crackles, cuts off and is just horrible, to say the least. I've updated the drivers and no change. I dread being on a webinar because the audio is constantly cutting off and more than once I've had to reboot and get back on the webinar to listen to the audio.<br/><br/>The worst part is Toshiba laptops have had this problem for years but the company has done nothing about it. Just Google 'Toshiba laptop sound'... and you'll see the searches that come up. I really thought Toshiba stood for quality but not so. Needless to say this is the last Toshiba product I will ever buy, and I've told all my friends about the problem. To say I'm upset is an understatement. The laptop is total garbage.
OS malfunctioned within  amonth
Great machine and a great price!
Excellent
The price vs specs relationship is ok, but this laptop feels very cheap on hands, i started noticing some scratches on the front lid, and every day there is a new one im very carefull with electronics in this case i think it is beacause it is made of veeery cheap plastic, perfonmance is ok till now, but did not like that detail
Good deal.
The edges are slightly sharp and the keyboard is a bit too spaced out. The display is decent, but nothing to write home about. What is really lacking is the touchpad. It is barely responsive. The left-and right-click buttons take a lot of force to respond as well. The sound quality was  pretty good at first but now after 6 months there is a constant crackling and popping sound. Windows 10 is extremely problematic, the only good thing is that start up is quick.
This computer seems to have everything that you need for travel but unfortunately it seems unable to work in the Windows 10 operating system.  First the internet connection is lousy even with the updated driver both slow and continually disconnects for no particular reason. Then there are a lot of little nagging issues when Windows 10 applications are installed, possibly unrelated to the computer but unusual when compared with the simplicity and lack of drama when same apps are loaded on other computers.  So I'm kind of stumped.  There is no way to tell if there is hard drive activity so you don't know if an application has completed.  The touch pad is directly under the heel of your hand and so that while typing it many times wipes out or stops what you are doing.  The edges of the computer are not rounded and are uncomfortable.  And I could just go on.  Got to return it.
excellent
I have not been able to access the online user guide. One can write up to five words in the Help site, but it just refers back to a link that does not load up a user guide. There is no phone number listed to call. So be prepared to buy user guides from an outside source.
1 Month since I bought it and I am regretting it!<br/>Functional issue-<br/>Display graphics - in general slow<br/>CPU - performance is slow althougth it claims to have i5 processor and 8 GB RAM.<br/><br/>Key pad stopped working! within a month<br/><br/>Design issues-<br/>The edges of the computer are design by a genius, it is so sharp that you will probably have to buy a pair of gloves along with it<br/>The Placement of the mouse pad is towards the left side, which is super weird or it is built specifically for the south paws<br/>The microphone sucks.<br/><br/>Hey Toshiba, can I get a refund? I hate using this laptop!
i bought this toshiba satellite C55- c5241 and my laptop has diferent problems. the trackpad is not working full time, sometimes is blocked can't explain why. The wi fi network don't recognize all the wireless. How can i do to resolve it or to change my product?
brand new computer and the wifi keeps cutting out.  It's not the wifi as I have two other computers in the same room.  Their support links are not up to date with Windows 10 so its not solving the problem.  Two more days and if no success, it's going back.
Poor wifi connectivity.
Started out with no problems, except learning windows 8.1. Has already slowed down with just a few programs installed. Wish the keyboard was more like the older keyboards. Keys are low profile & it seems like I  have to hit them pretty firmly.
Speedy laptop but poor touchpad whose buttons are a bit stiff and sometimes not responsive, terrible webcam which gives a terrible image regardless of day or night and the display could be a bit sharper but I guess you get what you pay for.
Ok I did not have the best experiences with Toshiba Laptops in the past but I decided to try one more time. The price is excellent  for what you get out of this machine. It is superfast and I am on the fence with this new windows 10. However I had some issues with the system already  sad to say . The touch pad stopped working after the upgrade to the Windows 10 ( which I read is a common occurrence ). Lastly I can not connect to the internet ( wifi or via LAN) . I changed the settings like 1000 times and I still cant seem to connect. Up to this date I still have that issue. Overall the system is great . It is very user friendly and the new windows 10 has is pros.
Not what i expected at all. laptop have all kinds of issues.
Great machine.....FAST.....but:<br/>1. Win10 was so intrusive and would not allow me to dump included trash.<br/>2. Signing the license allowed Windoze to disable any included -- even third party -- software, ANYTIME I WAS ON LINE, for any reason they see fit.<br/>3. It was a HUGE hassle to stop automatic updates (a money burner for anyone on restricted data).<br/>4. Microsoft was way to smarmy and nasty in support when asked about the above, saying it was all for my own good.<br/><br/>....so I returned the computer.  Amazon was cordial and polite and credited my card immediately.<br/><br/>I may buy it again, after I learn more about Linux.
The  right touch touchpad button did not work.  Tried uninstalling the driver and then reinstalling it, even a complete reset of the computer, but the button would not work at all...all on the same day of delivery.  Returned for replacement, hoping it's just a bad unit.  If it does it again, I will not hesitate to say this is a badly made and poor quality controlled unit.  It's a shame that Toshiba's quality control dept allows these to ship out these new units without making sure they work.  Amazon's return policy made  it a no brainer with regards to returning the unit.  Great job, Amazon! Toshiba...show a little more pride in your work, please!
I set it up and logged on to the net everything works fine
The laptop is good no doubt. But don't only problem I felt is the corners are too sharp to handle. As you type the corner is literally scratch your hand so it's difficult to manage thus returning the laptop again.
It won't connect to wifi. I'm not in airplane mode, and my other devices connect just fine. Oh and yes the sharp edges were an unfortunate mistake that my wrists are paying the price for.
I ordered this twice and had trouble with the keyboard. Various letters and the space bar would not work with normal pressure typing. I had to keep going back and making corrections.
My Wifi  driver "disappeared" just after the 90 day "bumper to bumper software" warranty expired so when I called for help, I was told that a  telephone consultation  to troubleshoot my issue would be somewhere between $69 and $159?? a computer that is 3 months old should work. PERIOD! and if it doesn't Toshiba should make it work without a charge...should have stuck with Samsung! Prior to this, computer worked fine...if you don't need internet  then this computer is top notch! : /
So upset.  Just got this and runs soooo slow and comes up with errors.  Seriously, such a disappointment.  Will need to return
I bought this computer a little over two months ago, blue screened, RAM or motherboard hardware failure, tech support didn't know. Needless to say, I want a refund, who's gonna trust a computer that blue screens after two months. Reached out to Toshiba for technical support, spent 3 hours on the phone and $159.99 with them to fix it remotely, claimed it was due to a Trojan, it wasn't. No fix, its still under warranty, but they haven't refunded my money. I've called three time to talk to their refunds folks, nothings happened. Now I'm sending it to their depot, with my wife's PhD research on the HDD, What a piece of junk. I've owned dozens of computers, dropped them, left them out in sun and cold and never had a problem. This was my first Toshiba computer, if you want a new computer, find a different brand, learn from my mistake.<br/><br/>Update: Just got it back from the Toshiba Repair Depot. They didn't fix it, said it was my fault. Problem is, I had a friend run a forensic tool on it, its a HDD failure. 100% a hardware failure that should have been covered under warranty. My friend and I were able to recover the data after a few hours adjusting the position of the HDD, but I guess I'm out the $$ to get a new HDD. Lesson learned. Avoid the frustration and get another brand. Toshiba if you read this my repair order is TP-10571864. You know how to find me.
Good No problem
I had lots of problem in connecting to internet. I have to unchcek the the WIFI adapter properties option use power saving mode. Then it worked for a Day. And Again i was forced to connect with LAN and repeat the same for Ethernet properties. Now it is working with internet.<br/><br/>Thoshiba Support team is not guiding on this any thing.<br/>I would not recomend to Buy this if you are not a tech savy and like to configure and explore yourself.
Worked for me.
Very impressed
Great laptop.
Audio is not clear enough and gets in operative once in a while<br/>Mouse pad is very hard to use and the heating fan never stops rotating
Given the specs, this thing should be fast.  It is not.  Maybe it is Windows 10 that is making it clunky.  Web pages take way too long to load up.  The edges are freakin brutal.  It hurts your wrists to rest on this thing.  Maybe it was designed by folks who only wear long sleeves?  Fan is always running.  Keys aren't the best.  Audio is good, specs are nice, video quality is great
I used it for a 2 months and the screen stop working out of a sudden. I am really disappointed.
I received the wrong computer. Someone contact me asap on how I can obtain what I paid for.
This computer is GREAT!  The right price for some heavy duty hardware.<br/><br/>The reason for the 1 star?  Amazon tried to sell me an opened, used, defective one of these first.<br/><br/>Here's what happened:  I purchased.  It arrived.  The packaging was already opened.  Everything was fine, except for the spacebar.  The spacebar was defective and broken.  I returned the defective one, and received a new, unopened one.  I'm extremely happy with the current one I now have.<br/><br/>Advice:  Only accept closed, sealed, unused computers from amazon.  If the packaging is open and the seals are broken, then someone else received the computer first,  found a problem with it, and returned it.  Amazon tried to sell me a used defective computer that someone else had already returned.<br/><br/>In conclusion:  This is the computer to buy.  It's great.  Just make sure you keep the new, unopened computer.  If you receive anything already opened, someone else already had it.  Amazon was swift on the replacement.
I brought this laptop 3 months ago......for the price its a good deal. The only problem is that the laptop fan makes huge noise.
GOOD COMPUTER FOR THE MONEY. KEYS AREN'T BACK-LIT,  THE FEEL OF IT IN HAND IS CHEAP TO ME. IT SEEMS TO PERFORM WELL FOR NORMAL DAILY TASKS, THIS IS THE SECOND ONE, THE FIRST STOPPED WORKING TWO WEEKS IN-- AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB OF REPLACING IT.  IT OK FOR THE MONEY..JUST WOULD EXPECT A LITTLE MORE QUALITY FEEL FROM TOSHIBA IN THE MANUFACTURING.
Great price
I want to love it but I can't. Works perfectly fine but the edges are so sharp were the wrist lie. This is my 10th Toshiba since 1990 and this must be a knock off or something. I can't believe Toshiba/Amazon would allow a product like this to be sold! I will return it this week and go to Bestbuy. I wanted badly to buy a Computer on Amazon.
Started having problems after day one. Was very excited to use the new labtop. Ended being a major disappointment.
Setup was great, very easy to get started. I bought this for my better half and she was not impressed with the speed. It took awhile to load medium sized web sites. Perfect for the average user who isn't looking for a quick machine. We ended up sending this machine back to invest in a much quicker machine.
I started using a Toshiba at home in 2004. After that, for home use, I have had two MacBooks, one Dell, and this Toshiba. The 2004 Toshiba was very good and the first MacBook after that was excellent. The second MacBook had a flaw, which is why I decided to go to Dell, but that Dell was bad. This Toshiba, which I bought through Amazon, is worse than the Dell. I keep thinking that maybe it's a Chinese knock-off and not a real Toshiba (does Amazon sell counterfeits? I don't know). This computer takes a good 10-15  minutes after turning it on before I can do anything with it. Internet pages load very slowly. Using MS products is also slow. I never know if a program will just close. I have checked for a virus, and that is not the issue.  I am not a computer guy but just wanted something for moderate home use and this is not it. UPDATE: I sent the computer to Toshiba for a repair under warranty and received in back in August 2015. After a few weeks of use, it seems that the repair guys did something useful, so I changed the review to two stars.
Works well right out of the box, seems to have decent battery life as well (5 hrs of constant use). Great buy.
The ad stated the computer came with Microsoft Office. In fact it was only a 30 trial. After wards you pay a monthly or yearly fee.The computer does not even come with Microsoft Word.<br/>Another disappointment is that I am unable to open e mail without going through " all apps."
Thank you
Windows 10 does not even have the limited Easy Transfer program anymore. You will need to use a tool like PCmover from Laplink to get your apps, data and setting from your old PC to your new Windows 10 computer.<br/>
+10
Computer is ok, but was hoping for security software and Microsoft Office to be included.
If you like razor sharp edges cutting into your hands while you use the touch pad....then this is your laptop. My hands are literally raw from using this laptop for the last 20 minutes. The laptop functions wonderfully. It's fast and clean looking. Great capabilities. No lighting on the keyboard keys and the keyboard in general is weak and frail. I would look elsewhere for a computer. Spend another $50 and get something that wont hurt you. The speed helps because then you get on and do what you need to do before your hands start bleeding from the sharp edge......I have to go...I need to go get a bandage for my hands. Good luck.
good little laptop,  runs quiet, speakers could be better, I like windows 8.1 on it.
This is a horrible laptop do not recommended I got it and I've had problems with it since day one not satisfied not worth the price😠😠😠
good!!!
Amazing
Product is solid. Finish is rough. Operating system works well. No surprises.
It's a laptop, and it works. Nothing special, but no complaints either.
Grate buy shipped on time and is really fast a must buy easy set up.
So far so good!
Dead on arrival
The keyboard is poor and not type able
Great laptop on the inside. Horrible on the outside. The end he's where you rest your wrist are sharp! Very uncomfortable to type. Just returned the laptop.
This is the worst operating laptop I have ever owned. I bought it for school a few months before the semester started. I just got it booted up and it hardly runs. I have to restart it almost every time I try and use it. I will probably have to get a new laptop and since I did not boot it up right away I cannot return it. If I had the option to send it back I would do it today.
I'm happy with the computer but am having trouble with the Windows 10 os.  It doesn't like some of my older programs that I use daily.  For instance, I use Quicken 2008 and have virtually all my data since 1988 and I can't get any of it to work with Windows 10.  I need to spend more time to learn the Windows 10 os.  So far, it is not too user friendly.
Been a very nice laptop. Would highly recommend it.
I have a problem with the activation of windows 8
nice
good
Was happy with it till it broke. After 3 weeks.
The battery does not run 7 hours as description
Excellent Laptop. Very good price/value ratio.
Just as expected , high capacity at low price.
Great comp.  Perfect for gaming and school.
I have a three-year old Toshiba to compare this to. I'll make this quick. I'm by no means a computer expert, but after using this computer a few times, I came to the following conclusions:<br/>--I love how thin and lightweight it is.<br/>--I don't really mind the new Windows program, though I confess after plugging in my Kindle Fire and seeing the system go nuts, I have to say I'm not a fan. When downloading azw files and attempting to transfer them to my Kindle, it was a huge PITA. This is a situation I don't have with the older Toshiba computer with the older Windows program. With that computer, I merely plug in the Kindle, go to my email, download the file, and transfer with the drag of my mouse. (it's a wireless mouse that connects to a laptop). With this program/computer, it was a mess. Once I plugged in the Kindle, these annoying screens kept popping up long after I was done with it. The mouse didn't work for dragging the file. I wasn't impressed.<br/>--Blogger dash does not agree with this system. I have no clue what it is, but every time I want to do something on my blog, I have to get the older Toshiba out. Is it the fact I can't seem to find a Google Chrome option on this thing? Until I figure THAT out, I'm forced to use IE and it's not doing so well with blogger.<br/>--I like that this computer stays charged a lot longer than my other one.<br/>--Watched a movie on it, didn't notice any better screen resolution.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I'm not 100% happy with thing and I find it's taking more time to my computer business because I'm switching back and forth between computers as this one simply isn't as easy with some things.
so far so good. very light...large screen.
Not as fast as expected; otherwise fine.
I am hesitant to give this computer 3 stars as it performs great and is super-fast.  I love the performance.  However, I cannot believe that Toshiba would design a computer with this super sharp edge around the perimeter.  I mean, it's so sharp that it is painful.  I've been working on this computer all day and when I use the mouse (which is a lot) and rest my hand on the edge of the computer, I am in pain and get red marks/lines on my hand.  I wasn't sure if I was being silly, so I had my husband sit down and use the mouse and tell me if he noticed anything wrong.  He almost immediately said the edge seemed sharp.  I have never had an issue like this with any laptop -- and I've had quite a few.  The edges are always rounded and you don't even think about it.  I've been using a folded kleenex under my palm the past half hour as a cushion between my hand and the computer.  This seems ridiculous, though.  I really don't want to return the computer as it works great.  But, I'm baffled as to why it was built like this.  I'm trying to think of a more permanent solution -- like a cushion that I could stick on.  Not sure what to do yet, but it hurts.
I'm kind of disappointed with this product.<br/><br/>MATERIAL QUALITY - It is not really good! I feel like it's too weak and can break easily. However the design is not that bad. I like it!<br/><br/>KEYBOARD - It's not retro illuminated. That's really bad considering that nowadays I guess at least 80% of the laptops come with it. It's not really smooth comparing to a Macbook Pro. It makes a lot of noise when you are typing. I guess quality is missing.<br/>MOUSE PAD - I feel like is not really accurate and you don't have as much gestures as you would probably need.<br/>P.S. I'm a Macbook user, so I don't know about the quality of laptops that run Windows in general.<br/><br/>SCREEN - I think the resolution is not enough for a 15 inches screen! I can see the pixels! (Again, I'm complaining about it maybe because my Macbook has Retina screen)<br/>PERFORMANCE - Since it's a gift to my brother, I haven't tested playing games on it, but I think it will be fine even though it does not have a discrete graphics (dedicated). It turns on quickly.<br/><br/>I had a Dell before, so I was struggling between this one and a Dell Inspiron 5000 series, which had the same configuration but was little more expensive. I think I should have chosen Dell.<br/><br/>Anyways, like I said, it's a gift and the configuration is much better than his actual laptop, so he is gonna be happy with it. Then, because of that I guess 3 stars is fair enough even though I expected more especially about quality.
very good configuration in less price
I've always had good experiences with Toshiba laptops, but was leery of the Windows 10 software in this one. Went ahead and ordered, and would have rated this machine with the highest rating, except that "10" and the browsers don't work well. Amazon took good care of me, however. Sent first machine back, ordered a second one hoping issues with browsers and "10" were just a fluke, - but same problems with replacement.<br/><br/>If you do an Internet keyword search using "windows 10 chrome edge browser issues" you will find out what I experienced: Windows 10 thinks the Internet is not connected - intermittently. The screen you are working on turns white and an error message comes: "No Internet access." A refresh sometimes corrects the problem - if not, you will lose your work. I just replaced this machine with a new Toshiba Windows 7 laptop, and all is well! My suggestion: Stay away from Toshiba and "10" until the first big Windows 10 service pack is out, and make sure Chrome is updated to run correctly in the 64 bit version.
No back-light keyboard...not so smooth windows 8.1.<br/>Otherwise...an alright laptop!
Laptop starts up, but wont get past the boot screen the moment it came out of the box.We will be returning this and will be buying an Asus instead. Never going to buy a Toshiba product ever again.
I've had the machine all of 10 hours and in that time, I've had to reset it to factory defaults twice due to unknown reasons.<br/><br/>Also, it does not detect 5 Ghz Wifi.... are you seriously telling me that my nearly 6 year old Dell Studio laptop is more advanced than this thing?<br/><br/>I'm returning for a replacement. Maybe I just got a bum machine. I'll update once i get the replacement.<br/><br/>also, the machine doesn't feel all that solid.
Did not stay connected to intrrnet. Just would no connect. we sent first one back n got another one. It did not connect to internet either, returned second one. waiting for credit to clear.
Go for it.<br/>Good configuration.
Toshiba has the worst tech support ever. they do not even asnwer their phones.
i have no idea how this works because it was supposed to be a new laptop and it came locked. i am so pissed right now. aparently it is not new if someone has locked it
Cons<br/>You would think that for a $600 laptop (not including warranty, screen protector, etc) would be a whole lot better than the cheap $300 f024wm you get at Walmart... I do not notice much of a difference at all. Also, there were a ton of registry links that had no use at all and were just slowing down the laptop. The edges are very sharp and will cut you if you run your finger across it unknowingly. The wireless card absolutely sucks and the laptop gets hot easily where your right palm rests. The laptop itself feels cheaper made than the $300 f024wm and the plastic is incredibly weak. The track-pad is pretty small, especially if you have thick fingers. The number pad on the right of the keyboard looks like it was squeezed in because they keys are really elongated and small. Finger prints on the top of the laptop are hard to remove. The DVD thingy is hard to open and you might have to lift the laptop to push the button. Browsing on ANY browser is pretty slow, so probably due to the wireless card. The RAM stick should be up-gradable and makes me mad as to why Toshiba would even due that because it's counter productive for both them and the customer. An unzipping program is essential, so it should have come with the laptop. The laptops life is pretty short compared to even cheaper computers.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>This laptop has Bluetooth that actually works. The screen display is better than most cheap laptops. Has a fast boot up and shut down once the registries are fixed (it isn't a SDD however). It is pretty quiet and hardly makes any noise under normal use. The keyboard is pretty freaking awesome and the plastic skin has a nice finish to it. Battery life is better than average. No bloatware came pre-installed which made me very happy. Has a webcam (though could be improved since laptop is $600). Has 8 gig of RAM. The weight is lighter than you would expect. *Toshiba included the drives necessary to update the laptop so you do not have to find it on the internet.* The laptop is MADE for windows 10, so you can sit easy knowing the laptop is compatible.
I just started it up for the first time and so far I hate it. The reason is the inside edge of the case is sharp and unfomfortable to use. Anytime my hand or wrist comes in contact with the corners or edge by the touch pad, it scratches my skin. I don't know how Toshiba could have designed something so annoying.  My old laptop is an HP with rounded edges and comfortable to use.  If I tried this laptop in a store, I never would have bought it.  Does anyone have a suggestion for making this easier to use?
It's ok.
Its okay
mouse is very bad
For about $420 this computer shouldn't freeze as much as it has for me. Also the random times when it will refuse to open google chrome no matter which way i try to open it. Internet Explorer which is pre-loaded on it will open fine though. The last time is when the internet connection acts up when all my other devices can connect fine. Other than its iffy problems it runs alright and is good for all around use.
Do NOT buy this laptop. Windows 10 is incredibly buggy. I have issues with every browser I've used, with no direct fixes available. There are absolutely no versions of a free Microsoft Word included, so forget it if you want to do homework.<br/><br/>Possibly the worst thing about this computer are the sharp edges of the keyboard that dig into your wrist. There is no fix. Just move along and use something else.
so for so good
Now that I have gotten to know my new Toshiba, I can say without hesitation that it is the biggest piece of crap on the planet.
I returned it
I purchased this and it has some display problem.And i returned it and got new one.But its not a good laptop to discuss.The fan inside the laptop is making very noise and automatically the display drivers are crashing sometimes.<br/>Not able to use fire fox browser in this laptop means very hanging.So using only IE.
cheap built
I pre-ordered the newest version of this laptop because it was advertised as coming pre-installed with Windows 10 and I thought that would be easier than buying a Windows 8.1 laptop and going through the update process.<br/><br/>OH, HOW WRONG I WAS!<br/><br/>First, the pre-order process took a week longer than it was supposed to--not a HUGE deal, but I work from home, and need a computer to do my work, so I had to burn most of my PTO to cover the days I wasn't able to work.<br/><br/>After the laptop FINALLY arrived, I was excited to open it up and check it out! Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do that. The laptop got to the very end of the setup process and then froze.<br/><br/>"Wtf? It's a brand new laptop," I thought, staring at the unwelcoming "Welcome" screen.<br/><br/>FOUR HOURS LATER, I decided to try rebooting the computer and starting the process again. For some, insane reason, this caused a fatal error in the Windows installation process--or something like that (I never found out WHY this happened exactly, because Microsoft, Toshiba AND Amazon were all remarkably UNHELPFUL when it came to troubleshooting, diagnosing and re-installing the software). Eventually, I was able to follow the software prompts and reinstall Windows, but, for some f***ing reason, Toshiba decided NOT to include a "product activation key" with the computer, so the screen was constantly marred with a warning at the bottom right corner, reminding me that my legit copy of Windows, was SOMEHOW not legit.<br/><br/>I told Amazon to take this demon computer back to the fires from whence it spawned and they agreed to send me a replacement--a process that ended up taking ANOTHER F***ING WEEK!!  By this point, I've already used up all my paid time-off, and my boss is PISSED; I promise him that I'll have a new, working computer in a week, and he tells me that I had better make it happen.<br/><br/>So, after an unpaid week of anxiety and anticipation, glaring at the defect computer across the coffee table and eagerly awaiting its replacement, FINALLY--the replacement arrives!<br/><br/>I'm so relieved! I open it up and, what do I see? Two, thin, plastic-coated, copper wires, sticking out from the BRAND NEW LAPTOP'S screen.<br/><br/>WWWWWTTTTTTTFFFFFFFF?!?!?!<br/><br/>Long story short, I ended up returning both laptops AND losing my job. After I told my boss that I'd need a few more days to get a new laptop, he told me to take that time to find a job somewhere else.<br/><br/>Adding insult to injury, a phone representative at Amazon told me I'd be receiving a $150 credit for the trouble the laptop had caused me. I got my refund, but no $150 credit.<br/><br/>Now I have no job, no computer, and no $150 credit.<br/><br/>Awesome.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this computer. Also, if Amazon ever promises you a credit to your account--of any amount--just expect to never ACTUALLY receive that credit.<br/><br/>I've been a loyal Amazon customer for over 10 years, but, after this experience, I think I'll be taking my business elsewhere.
Great
Not happy at all with a laptop. First one had a problem with power and screen. Waiting for replacement. Let's c how it goes..
Laptops are so laggy, slow and underpowered.  With that said, I guess it serves basic web functions on the go without issue.
Toshiba claims ultra high speed, what they do not tell you the Wifi card will only go up to 75mb.<br/>it took an hour and two calls to get to the bottom of this, Bottom it doesnt matter if it reads B,G,N it will not do high speed.<br/>They told me it was router, they told be i needed a special one to work with the laptop, but the truth is they are selling old technology, on a new laptop..<br/>I have gone through three in a week and not one works properly .DO NOT BUY
The sharp edges almost ruined this laptop. I took a nail file to the edges and now I am able to use it without getting scratches on my wrist.  The super sensitive mouse pad is a negative especially since you can't use it to enlarge or shrink pages. I had no idea this was something to look for in a new laptop.I just assumed it was a standard feature in newer laptops. The internet is also slower than my previous 4 year old Toshiba laptop.
Good
good

I could not find a way to contact Amazon as it has been 2 days past the 30 day return policy for the laptop so I must write a review. Only used this laptop twice and it stopped working already. The power button just flashes white and the computer does not even turn on. Even tried holding the power button down for a bit but still nothing. Even left the charger on it overnight which of course did not help anything. I read that it might work if I remove the battery and install it again but do not believe a new laptop should already have this type of problem.
DON'T BUY<br/><br/>This laptop has some serious design issues - right side of the palm rest area gets hot and the edges are very sharp. Someone really has to be stupid enough to let this laptop go through production. Configuration is good but flaws are greater.
Arrived on time and was as expected.<br/>Have had no issues so far.
This one is THE BEST VALUE you can get, it comes with 5th Gen core i5, Bluetooth, 8GB RAM, and the best of all IT COMES WITH AN OPTICAL DRIVE!! I'll be able once again to watch DVDs on my laptop.<br/><br/>Many of you dont mind about having the optical drive, but in my case, I use specialized equipment (Laboratory) and the software comes in this format<br/><br/>The laptop is fast, the only bloatware I found is the AntiVirus software which i changed for Microsoft SE.<br/><br/>The hard disk is the only thing slowing this laptop down so I upgraded it to a Samsung 850 EVO http://amzn.to/1cjzMDq<br/><br/>The 8gb of ram lets me photoshop and AutoCad at the same time painlessly<br/><br/>I got paired with no problem via bluetooth my speakers and enjoyed once again my dvd movies. The Speaker is a Bose Soundlink Mini http://amzn.to/1QkdAHL<br/><br/>If you're looking for a laptop for more than just browsing the web/facebook/email but instead for real work get this one!! if not get any Celeron that will be just fine for doing just that. http://amzn.to/1GNCit1
Does not come with any office products expect to pay for additional products, Antivirus and Office
It has to must control, Toshiba Satellite a105-s4384 which is 9 yrs old & is still working.
DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.<br/><br/>I had this laptop for not even a full 24 hours and it already will not start up.<br/><br/>DO NOT BUY THIS
For most of my adult life I have used PCs and laptops. About 2 1/2 years ago I switched to a Mac and bought an iPad and iPhone.  Recently I purchased this Toshiba laptop for graduate school. It has decent functionality and is a pretty good bargain when you look at all the functions and memory etc., but the design is very inferior compared to Apple products. Maybe I am just spoiled but the sharp corners bother me when I'm laying in bed with the laptop on a pillow trying to do my work. The built-in mouse pad is awful and cumbersome. I long for the touch screen of the iPad. It's just very bulky and seems like it has a dinosaur exterior and shell but with a fresh and modern performing interior. I guess I will keep it because it's easier for me to maintain a laptop rather than a Macbook or notebook. I would have paid a little bit more money for smoother, rounded edges and less bulk and better design.
This thing is one of the worst laptops that I have ever seen in my entire life. Here is why:<br/>1- Quality: absolute disaster, made out of cheap recycled plastic, very weak and cheap design and you think its gonna break every moment. I am also concerned about the health issues of coming in contact with this kind of plastic on a daily basis.<br/><br/>2- DVD drive is made of the same kind of plastic, so weak and flimsy.<br/><br/>3- Screen quality: very bad, picture are not sharp at all for this resolution. Again, cheap design.<br/><br/>4- Sharp edges: I saw this on reviews before buying this laptop and I thought these guys are just making a fuss, it was not the case. You can literally cut your steak with the edges of this laptop.<br/><br/>5- not compatible with Windows 7: there is virtually no driver available for this laptop for Win 7.<br/><br/>6- Graphics, very bad, after a week of use, the LCD started flashing on and off randomly until I restarted the PC.<br/><br/>7- Very slow hard drive: for some reason, the hard drive on this is slower than other HDDs with the same RPM.<br/><br/>Overall, Toshiba cut every corner possible on this laptop to increase their profit. Unless you want to waste your money or end up returning the laptop, don't buy this. Its also a shame that amazon advertizes this laptop constantly on the main laptops page.
he keyboard & track pad are cheap ass pieces of stinky poo.
It's not as good as I expected
Not what I expected, but okay.
Good product but Amazon prime shipping fails again
I've used an Acer Chromebook as my primary computer for the last year and a half or so, and fell in love with the speed and ease of use. Needing something with better on-board file storage capabilities (vs. cloud storage), I decided to give this Toshiba a shot...big mistake! Connecting to the internet was easy enough, but once into the browser (Internet Explorer, I guess), the computer was immediately besieged by bloatware and pop-ups. My attempts to install Chrome were so frustrated by the endless annoyances, that I eventually gave up. Might be time to save up for a Mac...
Extremely disappointed. It came with scratches and it will not connect to the Internet!! My first and last item from toshiba !
I hate this laptop. I simply hate the keyboard button and touchpad. I have so much trouble typing on it and the clicks just hayware.<br/>The laptop is light weight but the touch and feel of the laptop looks not durable at all. I just used in for 2 days and decided I cannot have it anymore. I need to return it. Thanks Amazon for that.
Trouble from day one.
Going to return it today. .......so disappointed. ....!
Lots of things to learn on this machine. Even with anti virus control, I had problems. It is light and compact and also has much more on it than I need. Windows 10 is a whole other challenge. I need to take classes. Beautiful graphics and colors.
bery good
Large piece of plastic, brushed black finish, lol, brushed PLASTIC black finish. Super cheap feel. In 20 years of buying laptops, this has to be the cheapest feeling one ever. Think $25 entry level phone, cheap plastic feel.<br/><br/>Read review about sharp corners, yes, even my 9 year old noticed right away.<br/><br/>Track pad buttons sounds like one of those counting clicking devices from 40 years ago - um, SUPER loud; take it out in public everyone will be looking at your "clicker laptop". CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICKITY, CLICK!<br/><br/>My first Toshiba, and last!
Not impressed. Apps don't work, no office software. I would have been better off using my smart phone as a computer rather than this paper weight.
Very Slow
Be ready to get a keyboard and mouse. Sound is very good, screen looks awesome. Windows 10 sucks. All in all, okay
Not to sure about this Windows 10 thing.<br/>Laptop is as good as the OS.
I want my money back.<br/>this computer is the worst.  I purchase  it a month and a half ago and stopped working every time you turn on the PC and put my password  stops and does not move. please I need my money back or a new one that works
Slow, slow, slow. I bought this to replace my 6 year old satellite, this one was SLooooowwer than that one ever was. I returned it. I love Toshiba though.  Oh, I think is was broken to begin with, the screen had some streaks through it and there were marks on the surface.
I ordered this laptop and there is something wrong with keyboard technology
not slow
It's more smart phone than laptop. I has so many apps. running that used up my data plan in two days. It also won't work with my HP printer.  I'm sorry I didn't try it 1st, that's the problem with buying on line ! It also took over a week to get here.
Good laptop for basic and advance usage.
The edges are real sharp and are very uncomfortable, this was a very big disappointment.
Fan motor was defective. Returned item.
All these laptops are made in China so quality is similar.  In the end all that matters is customer service. I had this for about 2 years and started to have problems. That was OK,  I called Toshiba tech support, they said it needed to do a reset so I did and they told me for the 39.00 ( out of warrantee) they would after the reset they would check software, hardware and re install what was deleted.  None of this was done. The reset took 2 hours and then when I called back to do the testing they said it would be another 120 dollars.  Tried to talk to a manager but no one ever returned the call.  Tried twice. Worst customer service I have seen.  Go with Lenovo or HP.<br/><br/>Robert Simon MD
Has to be the worst computer experience I've ever had out of the box.  Packed it up and sent back for a full refund, the day i opened it.  The laptop is extremely slow, the fan was obnoxiously loud and it just felt cheap.  I wasn't expecting an Alienware but it was still below my expectations in terms of feel.  The fan was the kicker. It sounded like someone was holding a piece of paper to the edge of the internal fan anytime it was blowing.  When I decided to return it, ten minutes after turning it on for the first time.  It took three hours to reset back to factory settings for return, even though all I did was add my username.
Getting to know it
I just received mine looks great what I did not like I was suppose to get 1T of HDD storage and it had 931gb everything else looks perfect.
Please do not buy any Toshiba laptop, I had a very bad experience with it. Foremost reason is they will charge you for nothing if you want to reinstall any windows on your laptop or any other service.
Solid performer, with good specs, a nice, slim design, and a terrific keyboard, the only disappointment is an inferior screen.  But, for this price, I suppose it's to be expected.
Thanks
Toshiba is horrible.... You will waste your money purchasing anything with the name Toshiba on it!!!! Terrible support if you can find any??
Updated 18 Aug 2015 after Windows 10 update.<br/><br/>Great PC for mid range performance.  For me vast improvement from 2007 pc. Came just in the price range I was looking for and bought due to good reviews and Amazon pointing it out after a long struggle and search to find a replacement for my old desktop.  This is a good choice. Minus a few minor things.  I'm happy with it.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>0) Windows 10 upgrade successful.<br/>1) Set up was easy.<br/>2) Toshiba has onscreen help videos such as using the track pad!<br/>3) Had a learning curve for the track pad as requires two fingers to scroll up and down or sideways depending on where you are on the screen, and for signing back into Windows 8.1 requires up arrow on keyboard.  How to video by Toshiba showed how to adjust if I wanted.  Once I got past a few learning curves like that, who needs a touch screen as long as I can scroll with the touch pad?  In some ways easier.<br/>4) Speed is good.<br/>5) Keyboard comfortable.  Got because it still had Function keys, print screen, delete and break.  (Need those for older stuff.)<br/>6) Beautiful design of outside and keyboard.<br/>7) Screen nice size for viewing.<br/>8) Easy to charge.  Power button very visible.<br/>9) 30 day trial of McAfee automatically kicks in once you start app.<br/>10) Minimal stuff preloaded.  Starts off with desktop and power button is available on the Modern Start Screen.  So seems good basic software setup of Windows 8.1.<br/>11) Wifi was great at home the first day and was able to do all updates and downloads as good as if on LAN.  On other days with other people using WIFI, I do find the speed for streaming video is still contingent on the WIFI competition or interference with other devices just like my older computer was as far as loading video.  Downloading or uploading speeds are good, and seems to depend on which website streaming.  Haven't tested LAN speed yet because the WIFI has been really comparable to LAN speeds most times.<br/>12) OneDrive seems available for 30GB.  Not sure how long before I have to purchase anything.<br/>13) I have been monitoring the heat under it where the vents are, and so far, it has not been an issue or does not seem very hot, as I have been resting it on the box it came in as a cooling rack and to provide a more stable surface if on the bed.  It seems to work fine that way plus a good way to keep the box and laptop together for the moment.<br/>14)  I used on battery for long time and after four hours was 50%.<br/><br/>Con:<br/>1) Several scary warnings when I opened about not resting palms on too long or heat underneath and not to open due to chemicals from battery and stuff and about radio frequency use in some countries like Canada may be limited to indoors only because the WIFI frequency range may conflict with range used.  However I had to realize that was true of most computers having those warnings so the company covers their liability.  Also some reviewers indicated the screen may be fragile if laptop is dropped.  Warnings about only keeping on stable surface.  So, I rest it on the box it came in if I use it on the bed or small table and that seems to work just fine and also raised it enough it made it more comfortable and kept it cooler.  I intend to use that when I put it on the desk where my old desktop is as well.  That will help keep it cool plus is a good storing place for the box.  That is what I did with my old laptop that also had a heating issue.  It worked just fine that way.<br/>2) 15.6 verges on 16 inches, so found my old 15 inch sleeve too small :(  So buy 16 inch sleeves or case.  (Still fits in my messenger bag.)<br/>3) Sharp edge for wrists on keyboard front.  Not that bad but something to note.  A wrist rest might help if needed, but I don't think it will bother me.<br/>4) Office has to be purchased - no trial.  Not necessarily an issue as there are other substitutes.<br/>5) Learning curve for track pad, but great video tutorial straightened that out.  It defaulted to two-fingers for scrolling up and down.  Responsive once learned.<br/>6) Spacebar occassionally does not work on the one I have, so have to hit three times or make sure I hit just right.  I have been typing quite a bit after updating to Windows 10.  I am making sure insert is on.  It just glitches quite often.  Other people in past sometimes had issues with laptop keyboards on the Toshiba forum.  It may be unique to how I am hitting they key.<br/>7) Keys are dark and hard to see.  I am thinking of recovering them to be more visual.  Delete key hard to see in particular.<br/>8) Finish does scratch off easily against stand, so use protection for it.<br/>9) Due to sleek dark design, I had to put a post it/sticker to mark volume buttons on keyboard and for headphone jack, so function buttons and ports need some orientation as they easily fade into background.<br/><br/>Just to note:  Microphone combined with headphone jack.
nothing good about it compared with my Toshiba of 4 years ago
I bought this just one and half month ago...I keep this with such a care that as It's bought from my first salary.. but i donno since from a week its  making such a  sounds that  i'm not able to work peacefully.. Its disturbing when i was working on it.never expected. Dissappointed
Slow and glitchy. Trying to browse the web literally 5 minutes after setup and its struggles to scroll the page. Then I started getting errors saying the touchpad was disconnected. The "HD Display" looks terrible. Not very impressed after owning a Mac for the last few years.
this is no sale.... price jacked then reduced.......
Hate the operating system
Jeez, I thought I would check out this laptop as a lifelong Mac user to see what I thought. As opposed to the care with which Apple takes with design, Toshiba starts off on the wrong foot with meh packaging and then a laptop for which it is not even apparent how to even open it -- I'm not the only one (judging by Google) who tried to open the hinge side. With its black case finish and big hinges, it's all kind of Tinkertoy compared to Apple.<br/><br/>Keyboard feel isn't as fantastic ... And I haven't had to look at the Internet Explorer emblem in more than a decade, but here it comes again on the menu bar at the bottom once you key it up.  ... Jumbly Windows 10 interface. I'll poke around the Get Started button here to "Get to know Windows 10," but honestly, this whole thing seems like asking a butter knife to do the job of a chef's set of tools.<br/><br/>So, I hope the other reviewers can help you with whether this is a good-for-the-price Windows laptop. I come from the Mac perspective of someone curious as to what a PC would be like, and am thinking, You get what you pay for, and it's no wonder that a MacBook Pro costs 4x as much!!
Mouse pad doesnt work
was going to send back but I will jest keep it
Nice computer but it took 8 days to get it.
I bought a brand new custom build toshiba, and spent well over $1000 about 4 months ago now.  2 weeks after I got it, the wireless card and NIC start going out, so I called Toshiba to start a trouble ticket, and get a new computer, since their warranty said 30 days from purchase, full refund, or exchange, and parts for a year.  They told me to send my new laptop end, and they would repair it.  I said this is a brand new expensive computer,...etc.  and I am a certified/degreed professional on computers...I was told that they could not allow for a refund, or exchange, so I spent two weeks on the phone with the highest level of mostly oversees, managers, or team leaders, or finally a Review Manager something or rather in California(I got the number by calling a number for CA I found on Google and got a security guard, who was probably new, and who had not been told how to handle calls, because she gave me this lady's number to call  the next day, the overseas calling centers I had talked to previous had told me they did not give out there boss's number and they were the boss, I asked them if they were the owner of Toshiba then, and they said no, so I said, well then your not the boss are you, still no phone number or contact information was given out) by the time I talked to them it was 2 weeks later and she said also nothing would be done, so I nothing. Toshiba as a company should be very ashamed of the way they treat customers and the values their business has, they don;t even follow through on their warranty for people who spend good money. I was given 4 different case #'s from toshiba, talked to roughly 70-100 employees, spent about all of the two weeks for 4 + hours a day on hold, and about 30 minutes of that time talking to, Toshiba's very well-trained to not satisfy customers employees.  F*** TOSHIBA!!!!
