This is the list of items I use for coloring all the beautiful intricate details of this amazing coloring book.<br/><br/>* Prismacolor Premier Soft Core Colored Pencils<br/>* Prismacolor Premier Verithin Colored Pencils<br/>* Pilot G2 07 Fine Point Retractable Gel Ink Pens-Multiple Color 20 pen pack<br/>* Small Aluminum handheld pencil sharpener<br/>* Sanford Peel-off Magic Rub #1960 Eraser<br/><br/>I color each page using all mediums, and haven't had any problems of colors seeping through to other pages, getting smudged, rubbing off or flaking off.<br/><br/>*  I keep my colored pencils sharpened and pointy to be able to color tiny areas of the designs.<br/><br/>*  I purchased the set of 150 colored pencils, but I think a set of 48, or at the most 60 colored pencils, is more than adequate.<br/>Prismacolors are easy to blend so by combining colors you can achieve the colors you need/want.<br/>If you purchase the 48 or 60 color set and later on decide you want a color not in your set, you can purchase other colors individually.<br/><br/>*  I had tried using other brands of colored pencils for a mandala coloring book, but none of the other colors had enough color pigment. So I  found myself having to press hard on the pages to deposit enough color, but having Rheumatoid Arthritis made my already painful hands hurt even more.<br/><br/>* Prismacolors are more expensive than the other brands I had, but for me it was worth the price because I was able to color without pain in my hands.
I adore this adult coloring book. Beautiful drawings that take some time and patience to color but it's worth it. I mostly use Faber-Castell or Prismacolor color pencils. Love it!
This is an absolutely beautiful book!<br/>BUT - on the first page, the authors suggest we "use felt tip pens". However, the pages are absorbent and the ink seeps through to the other side. I ruined several pages of my precious copy by doodling and colouring in a few items here and there on the most enticing designs before realising what was happening on the back! This is the only reason I did not give the book five stars. Other than this It is completely entrancing!<br/> I am going to get colouring pencils!
As lovely as the designs are, too bad the production of this is on thin paper and the art is double sided. I'm not that impressed with the practical application of it.
Beautiful Book. I could doodle myself but nothing like this. I could have downloaded  images from the net but the paper I print on would not be this quality. I'm on a budget and his was well worth the money. A+++<br/><br/>Edit after a couple days of coloring :-)<br/><br/>I still adore this book, even to glance through and just imagine! I  do have some issues with it and possibly some suggestions if there is another book being published.<br/><br/>I'm having the bleed-through problem with 3 different brands of markers. Pity. Using gel pens works for certain but they are pricey...still I tend to think that's what this book was designed for.<br/><br/>I've used colored pencils but some pencils require a heavy hand and you can tear through the page to get any color. And when I use pointy sharp pencils I've torn the paper! Ugh!<br/><br/>I did scan a picture in and print it and I find that printer/copier paper is horrible stuff for colored pencils - just no texture to make the pencil sing. I've ordered some multi-use artists paper (comes in a pad of  15) which I'll put through my printer and hope to get a better result. Fingers crossed. Might also try parchment paper.<br/><br/>For my gel pens printer paper is also frustrating because the pens often need some thickness 'behind' them. I've been using an acrylic  clipboard and 'penning' that is like fingernails on a chalkboard! Gels are definitely better used on this 'construction' paper than on a copied image of one of these pics.<br/><br/>I think gel pens are going to be the way to color this book. I love it, don't get me wrong. I'm  just a bit disappointed with the printing on both sides of the papers like many of you are.<br/><br/>I also would have liked to see this book in A more user friendly format. These are scrap  book sized pages and holding the book is hard, lol! There's nothing this size I can place the book on to make the book stronger to color in, as if it was a hardback. And copying them on a printer...not going to get the whole image.<br/><br/>I would have been willing to pay  more for this book if it had been spiral bound to lay flat, and printed only in one side - definitely. Then I wouldn't mind the square pages as much. I could use 2-3-4 mediums to color including watercolor pencils. Now I'm pretty much stuck with one medium - gels pens. Some colored pencils I have will work - trial and error I guess.<br/><br/>I soundlike a complainer don't I? Not really, just hoping this review helps others.

I bought several coloring books for my nieces and nephews during Christmas shopping, so naturally my "Related items" bar on Amazon's homepage was filled with coloring books the next day. This book immediately caught my attention because I often find myself doodling flowers, leaves, and vines when I'm stuck on a sketch or if I'm just procrastinating. I figured this could be a fun way get my creative juices flowing in the morning, so I bought this coloring book for myself.<br/>The book itself, uncolored, is gorgeous. I want to buy a second copy just to have on my bookshelf. The dust-cover, front cover, back cover, and the inside of the dust-cover, are all available coloring surfaces. It's a bit hard to determine where to begin and then I realize I haven't even looked at the actual pages yet. The coloring surfaces on the pages are so fun and whimsical that I want to color each and every one. However, to my disappointment the images are back to back and the paper thickness isn't conducive for inking each image without the colors showing through the reverse side. OK, I could use pencils but this was supposed to be "An Inky" adventure not a colored pencil adventure. Oh well, as I took stock of how many of my favorite images ended up back to back with each other there ended up being only one conflict, so that's doable. See there are several pages designed for your own doodles and pages with mazes and most of those back up to the purely-for-coloring images so it works out fine.<br/>Overall, this is definitely a must have delight for anyone who loves to color. I find myself trying to make time in my day just to sit down and work on a page, if even for just a few minutes. I know I'll be buying more of these books to give as gifts.
I love this book. Received it as a gift for my 50th birthday. I also love to use prismacolor premier pencils with it.  They are a little pricey, but are soft enough to blend, yet firm enough to sharpen to a tiny point that is needed for this book.  My only complaint is I wish the designs were one sided.  I would gladly pay another $5 to have the designs only be on one side of each page.  I gave it 5 stars because I would only take a way half a star for my one complaint.
I had to wait two longs weeks to receive my copy of Secret Garden because it was out of stock when I purchased it, but it was well worth the wait - it's a book full of amazing and beautifully detailed pictures that are very fun to color.<br/><br/>Every picture is so detailed and unique - some are full scenes, while others are more pattern-like; all are very pretty and follow the same style of drawing and, of course, theme (I am absolutely in love, and possible obsessed, with Johanna's style of drawing). What I also love is that when I add color to the drawings, I really am making it my own; everyone has their own style of coloring - compare the same drawing that was colored in by two different people, and you would see that the drawings are almost like two different pictures.<br/><br/>Some of the details can be harder to color because of how small some of them are, but I've been using assorted gel pens, and it's been working out very well. I've only used gel pens, and so far, I love it - the colors come out just as vibrant as markers, but dry more evenly and don't bleed through.<br/>The paper takes the gel pen ink very well - it is heavier weighted paper (not quite as heavy as card stock) and a tiny bit waxy, which allows the ink to flow more easily before drying. The paper is heavy enough that I don't mind the pictures being double sided at all.<br/><br/>There are so many things to color that I also don't mind one bit that Johanna has added unfinished, detailed inky drawings for us to add in our own inky doodles in order to continue/finish her drawings - I really like this aspect of the book; her art inspires and shows me how I can add my own doodles; it also makes doodling much less intimating because it's not just a blank page, she's started it for you, but leaves plenty of space for you to make it your own. But again, if you aren't one to doodle, and are just looking to color her art, there are tons of full drawings to keep you occupied for quite some time.<br/><br/>I have been consumed with spending almost all of my spare time coloring this book, while Netflix plays in the background. It's a peaceful and entertaining activity that gets your creative juices flowing that was much needed for me, since I wasn't using my creative skills enough til now. I can't say how much I love this product and that I am very happy Johanna Basford decided to make a coloring book. I can't wait for my copy of Enchanted Forest to come in and to see what her third book will look like - I know I will definitely be ordering a copy for sure!
Beautiful designs and good quality of paper. It's a lot of fun turning all the black and white pages into colorful pieces of arts (at least to my own satisfaction). I also enjoy seeing everyone else's work on the artist's personal website http://www.johannabasford.com/colouring-gallery and you can upload your work as well!
Fantastic book! I saw a post on Facebook about this coloring book.  I've been an adult colorer for years and have many adult coloring books and mandala coloring books.  But THIS book, blows me away and I'm obsessed (in a good way) and it's helping me to manage my stress level.  The detail is amazing and literally takes hours for one page.  I've attached a photo of the cover and the inside cover that I have completed.  I absolutely love nature and so it's almost like this book was made for me!  I can get as creative as I want and use as many different colors as I want.  I have done the first 2 pages using colored pencils; Prismacolor Premier pencils which are amazing..the color is rich and there's not a lot of pencil dust like some other brands.  On the recommendations of some others, I also have purchased the Fiskars Gel Pen set.  I used the gel pens a little bit on the inside cover.  I have two complaints about them; they are not as fine a point as I would like and some of this detail work requires a VERY fine point; and the second problem is that they need time to dry.  I thought a dot that I had made had dried and when I pressed my palm on it to color in another spot, I realized the gel pen spot was still wet!  ARGH!  So if you're going to use gel pens, be prepared to have to wait between applications for them to dry thoroughly; otherwise, you'll have little splotches if you happen to touch them or close the book!  The few places that I used the gel pens, they DID NOT bleed through.  The pages are nice and thick, but I wouldn't use markers...pencils and gel pens are the way to go for sure.  I'm anxiously awaiting the "Enchanted Forest" by the same artist, but this book will probably take me the rest of the year to complete, so I guess there's no hurry!  Thanks Johanna for creating such a beautiful book!
The art is beautiful.  However, I'm afraid the poor paper quality makes it unusable.  I love coloring books.  I'd love this one - if it was on paper that could be used for coloring - and single sided.  Yes, I understand that there would be less pages (a lot less), but I've never been one to sacrifice quality for quantity.  This certainly is not the artist's fault.  She made a beautiful coloring book - she just needs a better publisher.  I hope she dumps this publisher and finds one that recognizes the artistry in the actual coloring, and provides paper to achieve that. Fellow coloring enthusiasts - if you haven't, check out Sue Coccia.  Amazon has two of her books, but there are many more (single-sided on 80# paper).  Sadly, I'm sending my copy of Secret Garden back.
I love using pencils. Prism color pencils soft core are wonderful. I press pretty hard and layer a lot as well.<br/><br/>I find the paper is very thick and not textured. So harder cored pencils are difficult to use.<br/><br/>I am worried about coloring on the opposite side of pages already colored and I am considering buying tracing paper to slide in to protect my work.<br/><br/>I love this book. And I am working with the double sided issues.<br/><br/>It is a true stress reliever.
So relaxing to sit down with this book and my adult colored pencils (Faber Castel) and just color away to my heart's content. Every page is different and unique.
I'm not sure why people are complaining about paper quality...  My pens do not go through this paper at all.
The illustrations in the Secret Garden are amazing! It is a very detailed high-level of difficulty. My only complaint is the coloring pages seem to be on regular 20lb paper. And the binding prevents fully opening the book. I have to do all of the coloring with a cardboard piece underneath each page, or take out the page I am working on. If I want to hang or frame my completed art (they are beautiful enough to do so!) I forfeit the underside drawing. I tried to copy any pages to fix this problem, but the pages will not fit a normal home scanner/copier bed. I am still glad I purchased this item.
This book is fabulous.  I'm using Prismacolors on it and it looks absolutely beautiful.  I'm not even all that great at selecting colors, but the artist did such an amazing job with the drawings that it's tough to make something look bad as long as you stay inside the lines--which can, at times, be tough.  Speaking as a grown-up, I was amazed at how extremely relaxing the act of coloring is.  I'm looking forward to picking up the latest book from the same artist because I can't wait for more of this sweet, charming art, AND because I can't believe just how much fun I'm having doing it.  I'm a very anxious person by nature, but when I get my pencils out and sit down to color, I can almost feel the stressors draining away.<br/><br/>This really isn't so much a kid's book, unless your kid's a super careful one and takes their time with it.  I was a careful kid, and wow, do I wish they'd made books like this when I was a child.  I would have been so in love.  Just heavenly fun.  The pieces within are quite detailed and so, so very pretty.<br/><br/>Kind of silly story but, when I first began working on it, I realized, to my eternal horror, that I finally need bifocals!  I looked down to start, frowned, then looked up.  Everything seemed okay.  Down at the blurry page, then back up again.  What was this?  Couldn't be!  I wailed out to my husband, who's been wearing them for quite a while now, "Honey!  I can't SEE this!  What's going on?"  He had a good laugh at my expense, which I think I richly deserved since I teased him to pieces the day he got his.<br/><br/>If you like to draw at night, as I do, plan on having a good lamp for light.  I use an old clamp lamp and swivel it around so I can really see what I'm doing.  Do I sound a little obsessed with this book?  Maybe.  But the truth is that coloring these images is a such a relaxing, pleasant experience, and it's helped me a ton with my stress.<br/><br/>Make sure to use nice soft pencils.  You can't use marker since the images are printed both front and back.  Even if they weren't, you'd have to use a very fine nib and the paper is porous, so bleeding might happen whether you wanted it to or not.  You *could* scan them and print them out on a thicker paper, and then color with marker, which is something I've been thinking about.<br/><br/>I'm so proud of one of my pages that I actually hung it on the wall.  Absolutely silly of me, right?  That's how lovely the images are, though.  I love this book and I recommend it to anyone who needs a little extra help in letting go of the worries and troubles of everyday life.  I can't say enough how much this book was worth the ten dollars I spent on it.  Just great.
The paper is really...not great.  I have Staedtler pens and they don't really work for anything bigger than a straight line.  The paper is very fibrous and the ink bleeds terribly.  Trying to color a leaf?  Forget about it.  The color comes out splotchy and uneven.  It's so beautiful so I'll get colored pencils.
I am an adult colorer or is it colorist??? Whatever, I love this book. I use thin markers mostly and find it very therapeutic to make these pages come alive with color!
I prefer her other book, Enchanted Forest, to this one only because the paper is thicker in that book.  In this book, I cannot use markers or they bleed through the pages, so have to use colored pencils.  The pictures are great, but I wish this was in the same thick paper as her second book.
I bought this book for my adult daughter who still loves to colour and the intricate drawings will delight her. The paper is of a quality suitable for felt tip pens and there are even pages with gentle spaces to encourage the user to pen a few designs in black fine point. Along the way there are also hidden images to find on every page. What I didn't expect was how much I would be inspired by the designs. These would make beautiful needlework conversions into cross stitch or embroidery works of art. The layout and dust jacket are small but important features and make giving this a joy.
Super thin paper when coloring it rubs off onto other page!  Disappointing you have to choose which side you want to color on otherwise back side of paper is ruined.  Bad quality paper!  This is with using colored pencils lightly!!
The artwork in this book is incredible, as it is in all of her books. But it's so disappointing that not only are the pictures printed on both sides of the page, but they also go right up to the spine, so it's tough to take them out to copy, or to display colored pages torn from the book. Also, for such a popular and relatively expensive coloring book, I was surprised by the poor quality of the paper. I'll enjoy coloring this, but it's not at the top of my list simply because other books are published with more serious coloring in mind. (Do keep in mind that coloring is my main hobby and I've very serious about it. If coloring is casual fun for you, my complaints may not be of concern to you.)<br/><br/>The postcard set released in conjunction with this book is excellent, and I would recommend that any day over this book.
I have several complaints about this book.  The most annoying one is that she really does very beautiful drawings which she ruins by adding little suggestions in writing sometimes right in the middle of the picture.  She suggests you "add a bunch of butterflies" or "draw a swarm of bumblebees".  First, it is a "treasure hunt and coloring book" nowhere does it say it is a drawing book and I can't draw. And I cant color it in because it's wasted with the stupid writing in the middle of it.  You can't give it away or frame it when her silly little suggestions are all over it. She simply could have suggested that you fill in blank spots on the pages with your own drawings if you wish in the introduction. Next, she suggests you use felt tip pens for coloring but it bleeds through the page and there is another picture on the other side.  Also, I don't think felt tips are sharp enough for coloring some of the very tiny details.  I'm not sure that you can sharpen color pencils sharp enough for some of them. Thirdly, you  have to take the book apart if you want to color the things that are on the edges of the pages.  Some pictures take up two pages but some of it is lost in the fold of the book.  While I really do feel the written suggestions on the coloring pages ruin the book, fortunately they're usually only on one page so the opposing page could be used to give away or frame.  The drawings are very good and the ideas for coloring them in are unlimited.  They are for the most part extremely detailed and very interesting to even just look at.  If you just enjoy coloring or enjoy very detailed artwork this is a nice book.
I bought this based on the many rave reviews.  I bought 2 copies, one for myself and one for a friend. My friend absolutely loves it, and couldn't stop gushing about it when I gave it to her.  For the record we are both 50-something women.  I have many Dover coloring books and love using colored pencils for stress relief and creativity.  So bleed through is not my issue w/ this book.  I just find the pictures too repetitive (vines, leaves, etc), too intricate and somehow too "cutesy".  The 'treasure hunt' aspect was ridiculously easy, I scanned  through the book and quickly found everything.  I also do not like the pages where you are asked to finish the drawings.  I want a coloring book, not a drawing book.  The pictures are indeed very beautiful and I think the book is very nicely made on good quality paper but I just find the whole thing somehow pretentious.  Or something.  I will be sending it back and will stick to my Dover paisley, mandala, and other coloring books.
I have looked for a coloring book like this for quite sometime. This is absolutely beautiful. I would give this as a gift.
Absolutely love this beautiful book! I have both the 2013 print and the 2015 print and I'm so glad the paper is the same as enchanted forest! I use all kinds of fineliners and markers and there's no bleed through! I love my Tombow dual brush pens! They work AMAZINGLY in this book as well as the enchanted forest! They glide right across the paper and even blending two colours (with modesty) I didn't experience bleed through! Amazing book, amazing markers :) ***i used Tombow Dual Brush pens and Fantasia pencils in my picture :)***
I just received this book and I was so exciting to open it, but my book is not flat, there is a clear line made by folding for the whole book, every page!  And it is not that clean.  I was thinking to return it, but the shipping fee is close to the price of book. I am sooooo disappointed!!!
This is a fun book with almost a hundred pages of great images to color.  There is also a seeking game - you need to find different animals or plants on the pages.  I'm having fun with it and I haven't even given it to my grandsons yet.
Pretty images. Impossible to color with markers because it bleeds through the page onto the image on the next page.  I tried several different art and journaling markers and pens and they all bled through. I tried colored pencils but it didnt give me the vibrant color i was hoping to achieve. I tried to photocopy a couple pages but the book doesnt open wide enough to get the full image. The only way to achieve this would be to tear out the pages and photocopy them. Very disappointing.
I'm sure if you are a dedicated colorist you will like this imaginative coloring book.The dust jackets are accented in gold hot foil and are quite elegant as is book concept.<br/><br/>We sent back the Millie Marotta and Basford 3-book combo because Amazon threw these delicate oversize paperbacks in box with no protection. So, of course, they arrived damaged on the corners with creases that went thru all the pages.We re-purchased the books at out local bookstore even though the cost was somewhat higher.<br/><br/>So if you cut out the pages to frame or just want to practice coloring and don't care that the books are damaged, Amazon is your place to buy.
I like to color with markers and this paper is terrible and bleeds. If you are a colored pencil person, this is a lovely book. I wish the pages didn't have art on both sides.
This book is absolutely stunning. I was in awe from the second I received it. I am using colored pencils, but some of the spaces are so small I considered investing in some gel pens, but I don't want any bleeding. I have now also ordered her second book and am eagerly awaiting it's arrival. Coloring this book is so relaxing and I love seeing the page come alive with color. Highly recommended!
Save your money. Unbelievable choice of paper for a coloring book. I'm back to my much better quality mandala coloring books.
If I were only rating the artwork I would give it a 10+ but there are two major drawbacks to this work of art.  1) artwork is double sided; and 2) paper is very poor quality allowing bleed through of markers.  Colored pencils leave too much impression and you have to be very light with the touch or the paper will tear.  All other mediums are off the table as options due to the poor paper quality.  It's a real shame because the artwork is exquisite and the detailed work is "wow"!
Gorgeous art!
I think they must have updated the paper quality of the pages since some of the other previews, because the pages are nice & thick. I haven't had any problem with bleed-through using markers, even the dark colors.
This book is more than just a coloring/activity book...this book is magnificent!<br/>I bought one for each of my daughters for Christmas, along with a case of gel pens...the pictures are absolutely gorgeous. My girls (10 and 13) will work on a picture for days. It's wonderful for giving them a chance to relax and unwind, and also wonderful for keeping them occupied on long car trips! There are so many pages, it will take them quite a while to get through this. I am hoping that the author/illustrator publishes more of these books...I will certainly purchase them!
I had to wait for about 3 months for this but it was totally worth it!  The illustrations are simply beautiful.<br/><br/>I don't understand other reviewers problems with bleeding through the paper, though.  The paper is pretty thick and I use the Staedtler Triplus Fineliner 0.3mm markers and they work perfectly.  No bleeding through the paper whatsoever. I bought them on Amazon.<br/><br/>I would never recommend using a Sharpie-type marker.<br/><br/>I recommend picking one of the pages you like the least to begin with so you can practice if you've never done this kind of coloring before.  That's hard to do with this book because every page is so amazing.<br/><br/>The only thing I would change is to make each page a single page instead of double because it's hard to color into the binding portion of the double pages.  Still gave it 5 stars!!
Ok. Everyone has gone nuts over this book. I've been collecting grown-up coloring books for 30 years. I am SO disappointed with this one. I gave 3 stars because it is beautiful. I cannot give more stars & here is why.<br/>The book specifically instructs the user to use felt tipped pens for coloring. I did this. The bleed through is significant. This book either needs to have thicker paper or designs only on one side. Many of the designs are small & fairly intricate. I colored another page (of similar design size) using colored pencil. I found some of it just too small to use successfully with pencil.<br/>Such a shame to now have to choose which side of the page to sacrifice in order to use ink. Here is the page I "lost" because I used ink on the other side. Color me bummed!
I can't wait to color in it, I'm just waiting to get the right colored pencils. The first thing I did when my package arrived, I went to Kinko's and had them put a spiral binder on it. You lose about 1/2 inch in the middle and a little bit of the designs, especially when the design is on two pages, but it's really not bad. At least now it will be easier to color, don't know why the book doesn't come like that in the first place. The paper quality seems good and don't know yet if it will bleed thru to the other side as some reviewers have mentioned. But the designs are beautiful and I know I'm going to spend quite a number of hours with this book and get a lot of enjoyment!!:)
I love Johanna Basford and her art and I was so excited to get this book in my hands along with my pens, microns and copics.  But forget it. I was so very disappointed when I realized one half of this beautiful book would be completely ruined if I did what the writing encourages me to do! Why, oh why would you design a book of this nature on such a paper? What a shame. 3 stars because i adore Johanna Basford.
This book is providing hours of enjoyment for my whole family. I highly recommend using Fiskars gel pens for this book. We bought a pack of 48 Fiskars Gel Pens on Amaon and love them. This book has been therapeutic and enjoyable both. I have even sent it (along with gel pens) as  a gift to someone convalescing from a long illness - she was thrilled to have something to do while she is resting in bed. I intend to purchase more of these as awesome gifts.
Fantastic images put on horrible paper. Ink bleeds through no matter what pen you use.
I would give zero stars if possible!  Designs printed on BOTH sides of paper.  I have 6 adult coloring books & this is the only one that uses both sides.  Bleeds through & even if paper were heavier, the pressure of the colored pencils makes a million pressure marks on the other side.  There are sooooo many other books to choose from.
This is a high quality coloring book.  I'm giving it a 4-star rating primarily on the artwork and quality of the publishing.  First of all, the artwork in this book is stunning.  You almost don't want to chance ruining it with your coloring.  The paper is a nice heavy stock--almost like a light-weight watercolor paper.<br/><br/>My issues with the book are several.  According to the publisher, you can use felt-tipped pens on this.  However, since the paper itself is off-white, I found my watercolor pens came out muddied and there was some bleed-through.  You will also need fine-tipped pens.  The details in some drawings will require extricate handling.  What worked beautifully were metallic and opaque gel pens.  W-O-W.  Unfortunately, because of the fine detail in the drawings, you are actually limited in the type of medium you use.  Even the gel pens were not fine enough for many of the drawings.<br/><br/>I also didn't like that many of the pages encourage you to complete them with your drawings.  Sorry, but if I wanted to draw, I wouldn't have bought a coloring book!  Ya know?<br/><br/>But again, I don't regret getting the book.  It's pretty to look at.
I got this book only a few days ago, and I already love it so much it's hard to put it down. It's full of intricate details and beautiful patterns that aren't for the casual colorer. The images are beautiful and fanciful, and there are very few places in the book you can't color. The only problem I had was that it's too popular! I ordered it on April 1st, and received it on May 27th because I had to wait for another printing. It didn't make me want it any less, though I would've liked to receive it sooner!<br/><br/>I have been using Crayola Supertip markers (the 50 pack) and have had no bleed through problems. The pages are very thick. I've seen a few people comment that they've had bleed through problems, and I think that may be specific to the markers, for example I don't think permanent markers like Sharpies would be good to use, as they bleed through most things. I do want to find finer tip pens to use, because several of the designs are incredibly intricate with really fine lines.<br/><br/>I've also noticed it doesn't lie completely flat very easily, so getting the areas right at the binding has been difficult, but not impossible.
This is great fun and really gets the creative juices flowing. I've had other 'adult' coloring books and this is by far the best.
I sit out in the garden listening to the sounds of nature, enjoying the projects in this book, it soothes the soul.
I purchased this for my adult daughter who has a very stressful job. She has always loved to color so I purchased this for her along with some beautiful colored pencils. They make a great gift for those in need of quiet relaxation.
I wasn't sure at first if I was going to be able to get the full potential out of this book. I am sure now. I have colored some of the Enchanted Forest but was afraid to do the suggested drawing in Secret Garden. Last night I turned to the page with the butterflies and chrysalises and just went for it. I highly recommend it. Forget everything you were told about art and just go for it. You won't mess up the book I promise. Even if you get carbon paper and trace a picture to color. Do it. You won't be sorry.<br/>This book is the best investment I have made in a long time. There is a lot to be said for the wisdom of the inner child. If you ever loved to draw and color you will love this book.
I bought two of this book. One for me and one for a friend. While I think that the art is great and I love the book for that I am very disappointed that every kind of maker I have tried bleeds through the paper to the next page. If it would have been printed only on one side this might have been ok but it is of course printed on both sides. Top notch artist with cheap paper. I will only buy the next book if it is printed on better paper.
There is a large variety of black line art in this book and its worth the money to have the collection of wonderful detailed art. If you enjoy the art from the 1960s you will love this book as it has a psychedelic touch also in its illustrations.
I have to agree with other reviewers.  The designs are lovely but the quality of the paper is very poor....it's only slightly better than newsprint.
Thumb up!
I am so so so totally in love with this coloring book! The drawings are intricate and it takes time and patience, and mostly importantly, practices to perfect them. But it destresses me while I am doing so. Worth the time. With great help from my Prismacolor (I am using the set of 48, which is more than adequate for me) and my ipevo ziggi cam to zoom in on the details, I have a greater chance to stay in the lines.
I LOVE this book!!! I thought it was going to be mandala circles but it is so much more!!! The one star is for coloring purpose you need to take it to Office Depot and have it spiral bound!!! It is hard to get to the top part love the pictures. So I spent like $3.50 or so to get is spiral bound.now I can scan and color to my hearts content,over and over again.
UPDATE: Marker and Gel Pen lovers rejoice now printed on heavier paper! Yeah read more for details!<br/><br/>This is the most delightful, whimsical and imaginative coloring book that I own from my number one favorite artist. Every single charming, captivating illustration enchants children and mesmerizes adults. Plus this book is beautiful and well made with every single surface in this book created to color including the book cover. This book will inspire you!<br/><br/>This is one of the most beautiful coloring books that I own and it captivates and inspires all of my grown children and every grandchild, both boys and girls.<br/>This is truly a family book that creates quality time for both adults and children.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful gift for children, college students and adults.<br/><br/>1. I am so excited that this book is now published in heavy weight paper giving us the ability to color each magical image in Gel Pens, or Staedtler Triplus Fineliner markers and/or Staedtler Triplus Fibre tip pens. Of course with this heavier paper the pages are even more wonderful for colored pencils also.<br/><br/>2. Most other markers that I tested still bleed through the paper in this book and include: (Sharpies, Bic Mark-it, Stabilo 88 and Pentel:<br/><br/>3. This book is square (9 6/8” x 9 6/8”) with a cardboard cover, card stock pages and a lovely removable book with golden accents to color as well both front and back.<br/><br/>4. 63 magical illustrations that will spellbind you, and 19 are two pages perfect for quality coloring time with my grandchildren<br/><br/>Received a free sample for evaluation and unbiased review.
The content and paper of the book is great, but I cannot say the same about the overall quality since it fell apart after about only a week of coloring. I cannot replace the book because I like what I've colored so far, which just makes me extra sad :(
Did not purchase on Amazon (out of stock), but found a copy at a Barnes and Noble store.  They had just one copy.  Absolutely beautiful book.  It's not just about coloring, it has other activities as well.  I recommend using crayola colored pencils.  Also, go to Staples and get it spiral bound.  Much easier to use when it's flat, costs about 5 bucks to do it, totally worth it!  I just ordered a bunch on Amazon to give as Christmas gifts.
There are gorgeous details that are fascinating to view even in black and white.  The extra fun of searching for hidden items and having space and inspiration to add your own art is a huge plus.<br/><br/>This is a super book for coloring and being creative for anyone who is OCD, needs a stress relief, is developing fine motor skills, or using this as an aid to recover fine motor skills. It may also be helpful for those with ADD or ADHD to concentrate and be in the moment.<br/><br/>I am a college professor.  I teach in the health field.  I am going to integrate some small coloring exercises into a few lab portions of the program to aid with fine motor skills, paying attention to details, and concentration.  I use puzzles the same way.  It helps with critical thinking.<br/><br/>My only HUGE negative is that you cannot use felt-tipped pens as the big encourages.  You will want to use higher quality colored pencils.<br/><br/>Hours of fun and keeping your brain active and young.
BUY THIS BOOK! I just received this book today and I am totally blown away. I came back on to see if Ms Basford had any other books to order. I will definitely be ordering more copies to keep for future use. The pictures are amazingly beautiful and instantly spark so many coloring possibilities. I hope she comes out with more just like this one. II would definitely give this as a gift. That is, if I could get myself to let one go.
I used to color a lot when I was a child. As I got older, I sort of lost interest. However, I've been hearing so many people talking about adult coloring books. This is the first one that I've owned.<br/>I am so happy to have this book. It is filled with beautiful illustrations and activities. I've been using felt tip pens and gel pens to color all of the elaborate designs inside. The pages are thick enough so the ink doesn't bleed through to the other side. It is very therapeutic. I color when I'm stressed, in a bad mood, brainstorming, when I'm anxious, when I can't sleep, and even while I'm nursing my daughter. It amazes me how relaxing it really is. It has been putting me in an allover better mood since I've started using it. I recommend this for people of all ages. I love this book.<br/><br/>I received this book in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are solely based off of my own experience with the book and in no way influenced.
This is a beautiful adult coloring book but there are some major flaws for my purposes<br/>1. The pages are not perforated or easily removable making work close to binding difficult.<br/>2. The paper is not dense enough to withstand anything other than colored pencils (see bleed through from very light application of marker in photo).<br/>3. The pages are printed on both sides so the bleed through ruins the drawing on the other side of the page.<br/>4. Because the pages are not perforated, there is no way to share your work with someone else.<br/>5. Some of the drawings cover two pages which is lovely but limiting, especially if you have colored one side of the reverse side with an ink pen and had bleed through.<br/><br/>You may love this book (and I truly did love it for it's own beauty) but it does not work for me as a coloring book... YMMV.
I hate to give this book a low rating. The pictures are absolutely beautiful. BUT.... The paper quality is not the best. When using colored pencils, it rubs off onto the other page. When using markers, it bleeds through to the other side. I would love to buy this book again, when the paper is changed.
I purchased as a fun gift for adult family members. We have been known to drag out coloring books at Xmas time, and these are definitely the best!
I enjoy coloring for a number of reasons. First, I'm an artist who no longer does much art for my job... they outsourced our art department almost entirely at my job. Second, I keep working at art at home to help me survive in retirement - coloring is included (even with other people's art because my techniques still improve with this hobby). Third, coloring is very relaxing for me - almost as good as meditation.<br/><br/>Johanna Basford's Secret Garden coloring book is very beautiful even in black and white. Her love of nature comes through clearly for me... I am SO looking forward to coloring her beautiful pictures. I also like the fact that there is a creature (bee, butterfly, frog, etc.) hidden somewhere in each picture; and there are a couple of pretty mazes too. Thanks Johanna for a lovely book!
I LOVE this book! So much fun. HOURS of endless coloring, even the inside dust cover has entertained me for endless hours! (picture is of dust cover inside). You will not be disappointed. Buy this for every color enthusiast you know!!
Bought this and the gel pens for several pre teens and girl friends over fifty. I was amazed at the responses . They all took to coloring, found it fun and relaxing. The results pleased me more than most of the "little" fun gifts I have given over the years. I went back and bought the large set of pens and coloring book for myself. The quality of this book is well worth the money.. Make sure you get the fine point gel pens as they produce the best results in the small areas of the pictures/print. Not good for little children areas too tiny for under seven IMO<br/><br/>Blessings, Willow
the paper is like construction paper. it is only suitable for something dry like crayons or colored pencils despite it saying to use felt tip pens right in the book's intro. i tried several types of felt tip markers and even the lightest colors bleed right through.  i am actually going to attempt to return this. the designs are somewhat simplistic and repetitive and there are several incomplete designs so you can doodle and fill it in on your own.
This book is so beautiful. I was enchanted the moment I received it. The only problem I have is the same as most everyone else's -- I want to use pens or markers, but they bleed through and ruin the other side of the pages. I know I could use colored pencils, but I just don't like them. They are dull and lifeless compared to pens. I tried Stabilo pens and a very light hand to no avail. Next I will try gel pens as some reviews suggested they work. I definitely would have paid more for the book in order to have thicker pages so that I could use pens.
This is a disappointment because it's bound--will not lay flat to color. Someone should have thought this out!  "How will people actually use this book?"  But no... The patterns are beautiful but I can't get to the inside edge because of the binding and will not be able to remove any of the completed pages if I wanted to save/frame one.  I had planned to order several more for gifts, but after waiting way too long for this to arrive, I'm going to return it.
The art in this book is top notch, although if you were only to buy on Johanna Basford book I would recommend Enchanted Forrest. The stock in this book is not as heavy as I would like, it is also printed on both sides of the page with a sewn binding. It really is meant to be experienced as a book, unlike some other coloring books where the pages are meant to be torn out. You CAN NOT USE markers in this one, the paper is too thin and there will be bleed through.
This coloring book had everything that I was looking for. The intricate pictures allow for hours of coloring. I have found that gel pens have been the best medium to use for this book. The colors are vibrant enough to make the pictures "pop" and it won't bleed through to the other pictures. I agree with the other reviewers about wanting the sheets to be thicker. I would like to use felt pens since they are sometimes less costly than gel pens.
Gorgeous! Very fun and relaxing and definitely the nicest coloring book I've ever bought.<br/><br/>Those having problems with bleed through: use the felt tipped PENS (not markers) the artist suggests. I've been using the Staedtler Triplus Fineliners with absolutely no bleed at all.<br/><br/>Those having problems with pencils ripping paper: use actual, soft artist quality colored pencils like this book deserves or stop pressing so hard, simple
A friend posted this book on facebook and I immediately had to have one! I ordered it instantly along with some new colored pencils and gel pens and was more than impressed when I received it!  I hadn't colored since I was a small child and never even knew adult coloring books existed. I have spent hours admiring this book and coloring in it!  I can easily lose myself for hours, in the intricate beauty of these drawings. It gives me a great satisfaction, entertainment, stress relief and creative outlet!  I truly, truly am in love with this book. I just ordered a second one and had it sent to my sister who is older than me and I am 40, I knew she had to have one!  I am thankful for finding this simply beautiful book and I recommend it very, very highly!
I purchased this in June 2013 to color with my grand-daughter who is 6 years old. It's an amazing book. I usually set aside at least an hour as the pages have so much to color and we use colored pencils. I wouldn't recommend this for a child under 6. There's a lot of things to look for as well. We have basically colored not really hunted.
What a beautiful "coloring" book, this is going to take a long time to fill in and that's just what I need. The pages are beautiful, I purchased the IMA SCRIBBLER gel pens and they work perfectly, there is no bleeding through the pages and the pen colors are just gorgeous and will go perfectly with the book. Happy coloring!
I just received my copy of this book and it is everything the reviewers say it is, but the pages are an odd ecru color. Every image I have seen of this book on line the pages look white. I've colored a page and the colors look dull because of the background. Since I have already used it I will keep it but it's very disappointing.
we love these more adult coloring books. Moms and daughters and grandmothers call all color and have fun. Wish the pages were printed single sided because markers bleed through and ruin the picture on the reverse page. Best to use quality coloring pencils. in addition to great pages to color, there are Lots of neat activities too
Wow.  Who thought I would be sitting for hours with my children, colouring in?  Or that when they go to bed, I can continue colouring for hours more?  I’m not surprised my daughter will sit and colour.  She is my almost-10 year old artist.  My 8 year old son, however, is a total surprise.  He avoids colouring and any form of art.  However, he too, is colouring.<br/><br/>This book can make the least artistic person (me) feel like they are truly talented.  The intricate inky drawings are delightful for young and old, despite that the books are promoted as ADULT colouring books.  I can’t draw, so the author’s encouragement to add to her pictures is lost on me.  However, my daughter loves to draw and doodle so the book supplies her with the freedom to add her personalised touches.<br/><br/>We have discovered good quality pencils that allow you to blend one colour into another, and this has made our imaginations and passions for colouring soar.<br/><br/>For the images that span 2 pages, it is hard to colour in the middle unless you are prepared to crease the spine of the book (I am prepared to do so);<br/><br/>When you colour a picture behind another already coloured picture, the pressure of pencils (if that is your colouring tool) will transfer pencil marks downward.  Solution, lay plain paper between coloured pages to avoid pencil and other markings transferring to the neighbouring pages when applying pressure from above;<br/><br/>This is addictive, addictive, addictive (in a good way) – set a timer, or you may find yourself colouring your life away…<br/><br/>Feeling stressed?  Believe the hype about these books, my experience is that they calm you.  This one in particular is gorgeous with the garden and animal details.  The colouring results are breathtakingly beautiful and fill you with pride.
Beautiful illustration,,, but markers (even my expensive ones) and inks bleed through the pages... this is made more for pencils..Also very very finely detailed... had to use my reading glasses to color pages.  I still think the illustrations are spectacular.
The designs themselves are great. I don't have any issues with them. However, I received the Secret Garden coloring book as a gift from a friend who bought it in Korea, and that book had WHITE pages. The ones I bought on Amazon had an off-white, almost YELLOW-ish coloring to the pages. I make mention of this because this does change the colors based on which colors you use. I really liked having the white as the background so that when I leave certain parts uncolored, the white stands out. However, with these new batch of books that shipped out as recently as May (they had been out of stock for a while), the off-white, cream-colored pages are really off-putting. I wish I can return these or exchange them but unfortunately I cannot because by the time I checked them out thoroughly, I'd surpassed the time allotted for returning shipments.<br/><br/>I do not recommend these books. If you can physically locate a book that has white pages, maybe go for it. But other than that, as many reviewers had mentioned, color pencils are the only medium you can really use because felt tip pens will bleed through.
Advance review! . I WANT to buy this, but won't unless only 1 picture is printed on 1 page.<br/>Can the Publisher do that for us? NONE of us seem to like double printed pages!
There are a lot of really lovely pages to color in this book. The paper is quite nice, but only suitable for colored pencil, not felt tip pen like the intro suggests. Not markers either. The images are on both sides and anything except colored pencil will show through. The pages are also an unusual square size, which is really interesting for coloring in the book but makes copying pages for your own use for markers much harder than scanning and reprinting a page like from a Dover coloring book.<br/><br/>There are too many pages where the image continues into the crack of the book onto the next page, which is a bit frustrating for the completest and perfectionist in me.There are also too many pages with text making suggestions like "Draw a swarm of bees" or "Make your own inky details", which is not appealing at all for those just looking to color happily. Even for those who might want to draw in extra details and creatures, the printed text right in the picture seems odd and distracting.<br/><br/>That seems like a lot of negative for a four-star review, but there are a lot of beautiful pages with a single image on the page and no text, that are wonderful to color in with coloring pencil. I've tried a few kinds but I'm happiest with these Prang pencils - <br/> They color really smoothly and allow for lovely shading while also sharpening to a perfect point for all the little details in this book.<br/><br/>I really like the slightly off white shade of the paper as well. This book would make an awesome gift for any teen or adult who likes to color with colored pencils.
I haven't colored since I was a child, and did not enjoy it much even then. I was strangely attracted to this book, however, and am soooo glad I bought it.<br/>I can sit for hours with this book, on just a single page. This, coming from a person with major anxiety/mania issues, is saying something! It calms me when I would 'normally' be climbing the walls. I actually believe it works better than most of my meds (possibly ALL of them!).<br/>I do wish the designs were only on one side, blank on the back, so there would be no worries about bleeding through, but the paper seems to be of good quality (to be fair, i have nothing to compare it to). Perforated pages would be great as well, but I am still very satisfied with this book, the price is fantastic, an excellent value, and i would recommend it to anyone, without reservation.<br/>Buy it! If you find it is not for you, I guarantee someone you know will love it and be glad that you didn't!
With a few changes, this would be a 5 star book.  The drawings are high quality and very nice, even before you color them.  You can also color in the cover of this book, which is a nice plus.  But...I also would've preferred that only one side of the paper was printed instead of both.  On the pictures that span both pages, the drawings run into the spine of the book and seem impossible to color.  There is also a large amount of white space in this book where the author tells you to draw a bunch of flowers, vines, birds, bees, etc.  Not everyone is artistic enough to draw these things.  The last thing that I noticed is the HUGE amount of leaves in this book.  You'll be going through a ton of green ink by the time you're done.  There are some pages where you could use a fall color palette instead of the green, but when it comes to the regular leaves and vines, you'll want to stick with green.
Beautiful pages and fun to find hidden details. My one complaint is that the pages are double sided. The pages are thick and nice quality though.
Coloring and doodling has become one of my favorite forms of meditation. I've been wanting Secret Garden for a while, and I am so happy I got it. This book has so much to color in - it is almost overwhelming, and it also encourages doodling.<br/><br/>As many other reviewers have said, this book would be great if its pages were one-sided and thicker. Also, the binding makes it difficult to really complete some photos. I hope her others take these factors into account. I will have to check out Enchanted Forest, but this one will take quite a while to complete!<br/><br/>I am using:<br/>Stabilo 88 pens<br/>Prismacolor Premier Colored Pencils<br/>Sakura Gellyroll pens<br/><br/>I am looking for pens with a larger nib or markers that won't bleed. This would be helpful for the larger areas, but there are so many small details that the above materials are fine for now.
Absolutely beautiful book. Johanna has created wonderfully imaginative florals on every page! I also love how she suggests what you could add to the page, and how she gives you little tasks to complete.<br/><br/>However, like other reviews have pointed out the paper does not lend itself well to ink pens. Although the paper feels lovely, almost like recycled paper, it does hinder your colouring somewhat. I have been using artist quality Faber Castell Indian ink pens and fine line staedtler pens both which don't bleed through to the other side the page, but do bleed into each other somewhat. This then limits how much detail you can add, as what would normally be clean lines are fuzzy bled lines.<br/><br/>Overall fabulous book Johanna, but the next version needs a different quality paper.
There can be little doubt that the illustrations in this book are simply magnificent. They are as artful as they are complex, and the time it takes to colour them is certainly restorative and calming. What a pity the book itself is so cheaply put together.<br/><br/>The pages bleed if you use felt tip pens. Even if you take the time to track down a set of the Staedtler Fineliners Johanna Basford herself recommends on her blog; a post I might add that is dedicated solely to Staedtler products. Perhaps I am the fool for failing to recognise such blatant product placement or sponsorship.<br/><br/>Furthermore, far from the crisp white images you see in most photos of this books contents, the pages are decidedly yellowed. I would accept this if the pages were made from recycled paper, but this is not stated anywhere that I can find. At any rate, the thing is labelled as being printed in China, and it feels as cheap and nasty as a stereotypical Chinese product.<br/><br/>I simply could not recommend this product, unless you are willing to pull the book apart, scan the images, and print them on better quality paper yourself; something I may find myself doing to have a useable product.
This is my second coloring book.  I bought it based on its ratings but have to say as a relative novice I've been disappointed.  I can't draw to save my life and the suggestions throughout to finish the pictures with drawings bother me.  I wouldn't have bought this book had I realized that was the case.  I've been using pencils and it's hard to get the tips sharp enough for some of the small details.  I'm goign to try some gel pens and hope it doesn't bleed through but don't have high hopes reading other reviews about bleedthrough.  I don't consider myself in any way an artist and only have been coloring for relaxation and play with color some.  I don't think I"m the target audience for this book and more creative and artistic types will likely enjoy it.
This is the most fun I've had since I was a kid--let's me be a kid at heart.  I love to color; I can't draw a straight line, but you don't have to with this book.  It is so beautiful!  And the most thrilling thing for me is to see all these images come to life when the coloring starts.  The book is beautifully illustrated; and if you are an artist, you can even show off your talents in the book.  I love the thickness of the paper.  My colored pencils just seem to melt into the paper.  And it is just fun!  I use the following colored pencils:<br/><br/>1.  Prismacolor Premier 72<br/>2.  Faber-Castel Polychromos 12<br/><br/>Hopefully I've added some pictures of the pages that we haven't seen here yet.
Love this coloring book!  A few pages allow you to create some doodles on your own, which was a nice little feature.  The pages are a little thick, which is perfect if you use pens to color with.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I just wanted to make a quick update to this review to recommend some pens to go along with this coloring book.  Since this book does contain some very detailed artwork, I have found that the best pens to use are the Staedtler Color Pen Set, Set of 36 Assorted Colors (Triplus Fineliner Pens), which I purchased from Amazon.  They have a wide range of colors, and are fine tipped, so they are perfect for the little details.  These pens also do not bleed in this book!
This book is worth the wait. I ordered another book to use while waiting for this one to get back in stock and in comparison, the other is very poor quality even though it was priced about the same. I think if you are going to give coloring a try for relaxation it is important to have a good quality book. The other book had parts that were impossible to color due to their size and lack of definition even with the sharpest pencil and I wondered what all the hype was about relaxation because it was more frustrating than relaxing till I received this book and it is so much more engaging and pleasant! This IS relaxing! Love it!
I loved this book? A great book to get ideas for doing my favorite kind of art.  Shared with my class.
I have the magic forest book and my watercolor markers did not bleed through the pages but they are bleeding completely through the pages in the Secret Garden and it looks horrible! So I am getting half the book I paid for.
Beautiful coloring book.  The pages are heavy cardstock.  I have used pens and watercolor pencils without an issues of "bleed" through.  Markers, however, will "bleed" though.  I have chosen to color this book without copying the pages on to another cardstock because it will create such a beautiful finished product when completed.  The author has hidden images on pages throughout the book and has also left blank spaces for you to do your own creating.  There is a follow up book called Enchanted forest, too.  I highly recommend this beautiful coloring book.
A wonderful book that relaxes me for hours!  I use the Staedtler Triplus Fineliner markers (also bought on Amazon) and they do not bleed through.  The pages are very thick but allow for smooth coloring.  The pictures are so detailed and beautiful.  There is a good variety of subjects throughout the book, also.  I love that there is a list of things to find throughout the book's pictures!  And you can color on every part of this book!  If I don't feel like starting a new picture, I will just color a bunch on the cover or the title pages, etc!  Love it!!!
The paper used here is same paper as Enchanted Forest and it's better compared to the first version Secret Garden that I got a few years ago.  No bleeding through the next page if you use those Staedtler Fineliners that were recommended or any colored markers/pens.  It's a beautiful book and one worth buying again. Just wanted to say it here in the comment section to tell those who want to find out if the paper used has better quality in this new version and want to buy a new copy.  Paper quality is better than the older version and  it's awesome!!!! :)
I f***ing love coloring, and having an adult coloring book is amazing. This was on back-order when I first bought it, but it was well worth the wait. I have only finished the first 2 and a half images, and am in love this book. The detail is impeccable and it really takes a keen effort to complete to pictures. This serves as a meditative practice for me as I often have anxiety and I use this as a way to focus my attention and energy. I also love to be creative, so this book serves multiple purposes and functions for my brain.
My book just arrived in the mail today and flipping through the pages has impressed me already! I am having my 4th major back surgery next week, so I purchased this along with a tin of 48 Prismacolor coloring pencils to help me pass the time during my long recovery period. Just seeing the incredible blank pages in the book has me looking so forward to adding color and turning this into a Keepsake that I can work on in the months to come. I am so happy I decided to purchase this amazing work of art!<br/>It is now September, just want you all to know how beautiful my book is coming along. The cover looks incredible, all the tiny details just pop out and accent the fact this book is truly high quality. I did enjoy using the colored pencils, with a wonderful result, however a combination of pencil AND metallic gel pens give a spectacular result. I love the tiny little details in each picture, very easy to fill in and they give a professional looking picture when complete. VERY relaxing, and you have a lovely book to look at when completed. Final comment: I enjoyed this so much I have just purchased her latest book, and it is so fun experimenting with various markers, pens and pencils! Be warned, you will quickly become addicted to adult coloring, my spare change is now saved up to purchase all kinds of coloring choices!!
While I very much like the illustrations, although I agree with those that dislike the pages that suggest further doodles (I want to color, not draw!), it is so frustrating that the images go so close to the binding, particularly when it comes to two-page spreads. The paper is fairly thick on the edition that I have but I don't even know how to color some of the two-page spreads or mandalas that go right up to the seam given that the book does not fold flat.<br/><br/>I'm using Prismacolor colored pencils and have had no issues with the paper thickness/bleed-through but I am really unhappy about how difficult the book is to color because of the binding issue. I probably will not buy Enchanted Forest as a result.
Yes, this has pretty pictures.  All positives stop there.<br/><br/>What they don't show you in the photos from the book is that the pictures go to the border of the page, and are bound into the thread binding.  You can't even color in there.  You can't remove the pages either, because it destroys the flow of the pictures!  Also, many of the drawings are so tiny that if you're of "a certain age", you can't even see them without magnifying glasses.  They're also printed on both sides of the page, bad news in a coloring book this expensive.<br/><br/>You're much better off spending half or one third and buying one of Dover's coloring books from Creative Haven.  Heavy paper, printed on one side only, and perforated to remove the page.<br/><br/>I'd return this if it weren't more hassle than it's worth.<br/><br/>ETA:  Even though I have the new version on heavier paper, don't think you can use markers.  They still show through and damage the design on the reverse side of the page.  Stupid, stupid book.
Best coloring book ever! I felt like a second-grader at the Scholastic Book sale when I opened this book. Fantastic, detailed pictures. Sharpen your colored pencils! There are also pages to add drawings to, so I bought the Sakura 30062 6-Piece Pigma Micron Ink Pen Set, Black so I could get nice fine lines. The pages are double-sided and not perforated, so this a visual garden journal. I will have months of fun with this book. Thank you Johanna Basford!
Took forever to arrive due to the massive backorder (about 2 months) but I love it now that it's in my hands. The book is a large square shape so you can't really photocopy the pages--my little girl keeps wanting to color what I'm coloring. I might have to get her one, too, because this book is way fancier than your typical kids' coloring book. Would recommend fine point pencils or markers because crayons won't fit into the detailed lines.
This coloring art book is just beautiful! My daughter is into art and design and she just fell in love with this book. It is really beautiful and very detailed. She went through it and she said she cant wait to get started. I love how it is a coloring book and a puzzle type of thing. This book can and will draw anyone into its dimentions of creativity. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
I love the drawings in the book and I admit I've only paged through it, but am I the only one bothered by the typed suggestions on many pictures on what to finish/add to the drawing? I feel the words (printed in old typewriter font, size 14) detract from the pictures themselves. How do I frame a finished drawing with "Create more caterpillars and chrysalises...." typed along the vine?
These books are nice with neat designs and fun to color pages.  Like other people, I do with they weren't printed double sided.  And the two page designs are hard to get into the spine of the book (Maybe a better binding?).  I'm not using markers or anything that might bleed through the pages, so I can't comment on that.  I've mostly been sticking with gel pens and colored pencils.
My favorite way to spend time relaxing outside with a great cocktail (or two). My friends and I even planned a coloring party to show each other our masterpieces. Keep them coming! Oh, and if you're looking for a great way to help lose weight and to pass time this winter. This is a great way to relax and distract you from mindless eating! Fellow Weight Watchers members agree!
My second adult coloring book and lots of fun. Caution: There are so MANY images, I don't think I will ever finish. So I enjoy looking through the book on my way to going back to the single page I've been working on for quite a while! A great feature: the paper stock is heavy enough that my pens do not bleed through to the back. (I like to color with marking pens.)
I LOVE this book!!! I thought it was going to be mandala circles but it is so much more!!! The one star is for coloring purpose you need to take it to Office Depot and have it spiral bound!!! It is hard to get to the top part love the pictures. So I spent like $3.50 or so to get is spiral bound.now I can scan and color to my hearts content,over and over again.
I just received one of the new run of this book, with heavier paper, and let me say that it is a dream. Each page is almost like vellum, really heavy lovely paper with a satiny finish that makes it great for ink and pencils both. If anybody had reservations, the reprint of this book is 100% worth it.
I saw this book on a post by the Pioneer Woman and I decided to order it...It is wonderful!  I actually made reduced size copies of some of the pages and put it in my Malden...now during those long, boring meetings at work, I pull it out and occupy my time in a more colorful way!
Definitely the drawings need to be on thicker paper, tear out, and not double sided. Anyone recommending pens that don't bleed thru or nice colored pencils?  I may try to copy pages on the copier... won't be the same, but better than having ink bleed thru.  Beautifully detailed drawings.
Beautiful artwork, good quality paper, and activities to provide some extra interest -- what's not to love?<br/><br/>I'm an adult who loves to color -- I find it incredibly relaxing, and enjoy playing with color.  I've gone through most of the Dover "pattern"-type coloring books -- and I'm always looking for other books to try.  I also make handcrafted greeting cards, and enjoy coloring stamped images to use as "focals."  This showed up in my "recommendations" list, and I decided to give it a try.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice is that this high-quality paperback has a dust jacket printed on heavy weight paper.  It's covered with the same type of intricate designs you'll find in the book itself, with some of the small flowers highlighted with metallic gold foil.  The inside of the dust cover contains a large color-able drawing -- probably 10" x 30" or so.  The cover itself is printed on heavy kraft card stock, again with an intricate color-able design (I may try using Faber-Castell Gelatos (<br/>) for this).<br/><br/>The pages are filled with intricate designs all on the theme of a "secret garden" -- reminiscent of the children's story: flowers, butterflies, gates, keys, etc.  There are "search" activities (find the bird, butterfly, squirrel, etc.); there are "finish the pattern" activities ("continue the vine," etc.), and pages that give you the opportunity to "add more detail" to a relatively simple outline.  Most of the pages are filled with beautifully stylized flowers in various shapes and sizes to color.  I'm blown away by the intricacy of some of these drawings.<br/><br/>I use Prismacolor colored pencils (<br/>) for most of my coloring, and that's what I'm using with this book.  The paper lends itself well to this medium.  I would say that if you're planning to use markers (Spectrum Noir, Copic, etc.), you might want to photocopy the picture onto heavier card stock, as the paper, although decent quality for pencils, is probably too absorbent for markers.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  this would make a GREAT gift for anyone on your list who enjoys coloring.  I'm taking it on an upcoming holiday trip with my pencils.
I have been using adult coloring books for several years. I stopped purchasing them because they were all alike - mandela patterns, paisleys, etc. Boring. Then I found these. What a joy! I don't know where to start.<br/><br/>First, the book has a dust jacket which also can be colored. The book is about 10" square, making it symetrical for those artistic types.<br/>The drawings are intricate and wonderful. Real drawings, not just repetitive patterns. there is something for everyone here. Some pages are left partically blank so you can create your own art. Enough to please the artistic types who would like this type of thing and not so much that those of us who have no drawing skill would feel "cheated".<br/><br/>I ordered both of her books at the same time.  This one was back ordered.  I got an email from the artist with a downloadable file containing art for me to color while I was waiting for the book.  How awesome is that?<br/><br/>Lastly, in Barnes and Noble, these books sell for $15.99 as opposed to under $10.00 on Amazon.<br/><br/>there are objects throughout the book that you can search for so you have your own hidden object game. My 150 piece Prismacolor set loves this book and so do I!!!<br/><br/>I've preordered her next book and can't wait for it to arrive.<br/><br/>You won't be disappointed.
This is a beautiful coloring book, however the pictures are printed on ivory colored paper, so when you use color pencils, they are subdued.  Wish the paper was bright white, so colors would show up better.
I took this on Retreat! I am finding this book a treasure, both bringing me back to my love of coloring as a child and also keeping me in the present moment by calming my senses. I am taking it all around and making it a sharing experience with family and friends!
Not sure what to say about the other 1/3. While many people will love the style of the drawings and they are able to create a beautiful array of colors out of them, I find coloring them a tough challenge. Johanna's drawings are beautiful, but there's a certain quality that makes the flowers especially look hard and rigid. I have to say I'm not a mandala person. Those huge bunches of flowers intimidate me. I started coloring one page of one of those and quickly got quite lost as to how i should continue. It's a little hard for me to find a subject or theme out of one whole page of symmetrical looking round-petal flowers all laid out in the same way. It's actually more fun to look at them than to color them. Fortunately for me there are just a couple of pictures drawn this way. I love those with variations, like side view of flowers instead of top view, or long slender leaves. I absolutely love those two-page scenes that entail much more meaning and actually has something going on within the picture, instead of just a spread of flowers and leaves arranged in a circular fashion.<br/><br/>That said, this book has enough pages with a variety of drawings to please almost everyone. If I could choose just one book from Joanna, I'd probably go with Enchanted Forest, but I got both anyway.
Oh my word!! When I received this treasure hunt and coloring book, I had no idea what I was getting. I guess in the back of my mind I expected a Highlights style book with different seek and finds interspersed with some coloring pages. But that is not close at all to what I found in these pages!<br/><br/>The treasure hunt part includes little objects, insects, tools, etc being woven into the coloring pages. You have a picture of a well with vines and you might find two beetles hidden in there. At the beginning of the book they show you what the objects look like and how many are in the book. But it does not tell you how many are on each page or in each picture. So some pictures have several hidden objects while others only have one item. There is a key at the end of the book which tells you what is in each picture and where.<br/><br/>The coloring pages are for the hidden artist in us all. You will be delighted with the pictures and the ability to let your talents flow! Pages filled with birds and butterflies, vines and wells, etc. Amazing book that would make a great gift!<br/><br/>*Disclosure* I received a copy of this book free of charge for an honest and unbiased review. All thoughts are 100% mine.
This book is brilliant!<br/>Felt tip pens will bleed through, but Sakura Glaze pens work perfectly.  Allow 5-10 minutes drying time before you close the book or work on another page.
Absolutely fantastic.  I've been coloring for 5 years and FINALLY found a book that is as equally challenging as beautiful.  My pictures are fantastic!  Am purchasing another one!
Wow, I really loved getting this book. I get board a lot, and I can never find anything to pass the time. I came upon the Adult Coloring Book, which I have actually never heard of before. I quickly thought how cool and fun that it would be. Once I got it in, I was impressed that it was not bent in the process of being shipped. When I received this book I quickly started to color, I used color pencils, but I would like to try gel pens also. It will pass the time very quickly and keep me occupied. I think this would be great for long car rides, This is also great for high school students during testing weeks while waiting on others to finish. I thought they had some great images to color in this book. Very girly and fun! I was surprised at how long one picture would take to finish, since there is so much detail in each picture, But that is what makes them all so beautiful. I love how they have a game you can actually play in this book. "I spy" they have a couple animals for you to find thru out the book, which I thought was pretty cool.<br/><br/>*i received this at a discounted price for my honest opinion.
I love this coloring book. I have not put it down since I got it. It's full of beautifully drawn pages of flowers, plants, and animals. So worth the price and creative time.
I love this book, so much fun. Get yourself a bunch of different thickness gel pens, pointing cotton swabs for blending and you'll have a hundred hours of fun. Been working on the book with my 6 year old. Awesome.
If you are an embroiderer Mary Corbett is doing a year of projects using this book. Just check out her blog. If you are an artist or just love to color this is THE most interesting coloring book I've EVER seen. I can't say enough how wonderful it is. I'm probably going to buy one more just for coloring and the other to keep for patterns. Or I may buy the eBook to keep for patterns since it would be easier to print off pages for using to transfer patterns onto fabric. I can't wait to start coloring this and stitching the designs with the famous Mary Corbett. Best $13 I've spent in a long time. Also the pages are very thick. If you plan to color with markers Mary Corbett's blog tells which ones to use so they won't bleed through. She also suggests which kinds of colored pencils. Just Google the name of this book with her name and you can stitch along with her. She covers all sorts of stitches from beginner to advanced and even has videos to learn the stitches free. Teens would love this book as well because many designs have blank spots where you can finish where the artist left off
This adult coloring book is just amazing! The introduction recommends felt pens. It tells about mazes you solve. You have a secret garden list to find things throughout the book, I really loved this! I love doodling, I even printed off adult pages to color on but it is no where near the same as this. The quality of this paper is the best. I use gel pens to color with. They work so good. Between them and the quality of the paper, it just looks so god. I love all the different gardens throughout the book but there is also animals and lots of other stuff. This is so fun to do and really beats a word puzzle when you are bored, There is also space on pages to make your own doodles. The front cover, has a flap that I use as a book mark, so I can always go back to where I was.<br/><br/>If you like gardens or love to doodle, then this is definitely a book for you, there is so many pages and you will never get bored from the different illustrations. It is great for any age and the art is so gorgeous.<br/>I received this book free for my honest and unbiased review.
There are things that I love about this pretty book. The cover is one big coloring page, on both sides!  Those of us that compulsively doodle on everything will love that.  The paper quality is superior. I used paint markers on one page and was sure I was soaking through, but not at all!  The pictures are mostly delightful and whimsical, with some hidden pictures. Suitable for all ages.<br/><br/>I do have some issues, though. At this price point you would expect perforated pages for display or sharing. Also, I was dismayed to find that the images are printed on both sides of the page. I would rather have half of the coloring projects if it meant that I wouldn't have to discard them if I removed them from the book. Some of the images are a two page spread. This is not a good thing, as it is really difficult to color the images that slide into the center.<br/>There is a bit too much repetition of certain motifs. Lots of Ivy, leaves, and vines. Not enough cute stuff like snails, birds, ladybugs, etc.<br/>I probably would be less likely to find fault if the price was lower and the images were on only one side. I do plan to keep it and hope that the next book in this series will have addressed some of these issues. If not, this is the only one I want. I'll go back to Creative Haven and Pomegranate coloring books.
Beautiful Book. I could doodle myself but nothing like this. I could have downloaded images from the net but the paper I print on would not be this quality. I'm on a budget and his was well worth the money. A+++<br/><br/>Edit after a couple days of coloring :-)<br/><br/>I still adore this book, even to glance through and just imagine! I do have some issues with it and possibly some suggestions if there is another book being published.<br/><br/>I'm having the bleed-through problem with 3 different brands of markers. Pity. Using gel pens works for certain but they are priceystill I tend to think that's what this book was designed for.<br/><br/>I've used colored pencils but some pencils require a heavy hand and you can tear through the page to get any color. And when I use pointy sharp pencils I've torn the paper! Ugh!<br/><br/>I did scan a picture in and print it and I find that printer/copier paper is horrible stuff for colored pencils - just no texture to make the pencil sing. I've ordered some multi-use artists paper ... Read more
I purchased this on a whim, I like adult coloring books both for actually coloring and to see how different artist's see the shape of things. I was blown away! The pictures are lovely, which is good news, but the layout is stunning. This thing is in a dust jacket. I have never seen that on a coloring book before, but it works with this one.<br/><br/>The only downside is that I typically color with Prismacolor markers, and the pages are printed on both sides, and I have yet to find any paper anywhere that can stand up to those things without showing up on the other side, which in this case would be a crime :-( I have colored pencils, I'm just sort of spoiled by the clarity of the color when I use a marker/ink application, so I'm not sure if they'll be vivid enough to please me.<br/><br/>Seriously though, if I have to buy a second one and color every other page, it's a small price to pay! This is a beautiful book, with plenty of pages to work on, and a variety of activities you can do if straight coloring isn't enough for you to work on.
Purchased for my 20+ daughter...She loved this coloring book. Don't get the recommended gel pens she says they are not meant for the type of paper the book is printed on, rather get pencil crayons!
I had to wait two longs weeks to receive my copy of Secret Garden because it was out of stock when I purchased it, but it was well worth the wait - it's a book full of amazing and beautifully detailed pictures that are very fun to color.<br/><br/>Every picture is so detailed and unique - some are full scenes, while others are more pattern-like; all are very pretty and follow the same style of drawing and, of course, theme (I am absolutely in love, and possible obsessed, with Johanna's style of drawing). What I also love is that when I add color to the drawings, I really am making it my own; everyone has their own style of coloring - compare the same drawing that was colored in by two different people, and you would see that the drawings are almost like two different pictures.<br/><br/>Some of the details can be harder to color because of how small some of them are, but I've been using assorted gel pens, and it's been working out very well. I've only used gel pens, and so far, I love it - the colors... Read more
Over packaged in an oversized box so shook all around, marred up the cover a bit.<br/>I have the Enchanted Forest book, my first purchase, and LOVE it.  My kiddo saw my book and wanted one of her own and chose the Secret Garden.  Overall not as impressed with this book.  The pages are more of a yellow hue not more of an off white, so the colors of the pencils are not as vibrant on the page.  IMO smaller, intricate drawings, so a bit more difficult unless you have a very sharp pencil.  Overall my kiddo loves the book and will give her hours upon hours of creative fun - not camped in front of her tablet streaming videos!<br/><br/>Wish they would stop producing coloring pages that connect to each other when fully open to make one large space to color...the spine is always too tight to get into the crease and you simply can't color in these spots and quite distracting and frustrating.<br/><br/>If you are vacillating between the two books, IMO get the Enchanted Forest, I a quite pleased with the book.
Loved to color with my kids when they were  small; delighted to have grandkids to color with, but love having my own grown-up coloring book! It's just plain fun!<br/>Update July 28, 2015 - I am SO enjoying this beautiful coloring book! I just added gel pens <br/> to my coloring media and what a difference they make; even my husband noticed. I'm using mainly the metallic, glitter and basic pens; they give depth and interest to the pictures that I didn't expect. When this coloring book was on back order Joanna sent us a link to three free pages from Enchanted Forest and I finished one of them and used the gel pens along with twistable crayons and colored pencils. I think you'll be able to see the metallic and glitter in the photo. I haven't completed my first picture (double page) in Secret Garden using the gel pens yet, but will post a photo here when it's done. I highly recommend this very detailed and beautiful coloring book.
Even though I kept reading that the light emitted by a tablet or laptop screen was stimulating to the brain, my usual method for falling asleep was to watch a video -- usually of a TV series that I liked but had seen before (no surprises). When this stopped working recently, my daughter suggested I try a coloring book. I chose this one and it has worked like a charm.  It' is very absorbing (if not addicting) and it really does cause you to focus and … not think about sleep. I color for about half an hour before turning off the lights and then listen to an audiobook -- but I never get past the first paragraph.  I do sincerely believe that the coloring is a form of meditation, and it works better for me because I stay focused, making small decisions about whether to color all leaves green, or vary the shades of green, and how a particular small flower should look.  I'm not thinking about work, or about other things that stress me out.  Just flowers, and vines, and colors.  Zzzzzzzzz.  Love it!
I have always loved coloring.  BUT, the crayons and the children's coloring books were getting sort of boring. I needed to change it up b/c I like to color for the stress relieving benefits.  I did a lot of research, and looked at a lot of different adult coloring books, BY FAR, Johanna Basford has the best reviews, and the highest rating, so I absolutely knew I was going to go with one of her books.  I decided to go with Secret Garden after looking over the reviews, and I must say that I absolutely agree.  This is the BEST, most entertaining coloring book I could have picked.  It's absolutely fantastic, and I enjoy every minute I spend coloring this book. I also ordered a set of PRISMACOLOR colored pencils to color this book with. I am so happy I looked into it and spent the money on them, rather than color with crayola,  they are absolutely fantastic pencils that I adore coloring in this book with.  When I am done with this book, I will definitely purchase another Johanna Basford book.
This is a fabulous coloring book.  Lots of small, detailed, beautiful pictures to color.  I really enjoy those over the large coloring books that take less time and concentration to finish.  This is going to take me a long time to get through, I have been using gel pens and colored pencils and both work great.  I use coloring as a kind of meditative thing for when I am not feeling well.  When done right, it can be a great stress reliever.  I found that gel pens with a grip added work really nicely for those with hand arthritis.  The ones I got were the <br/> and since I am happy with them I recommend them for this, just give them time to dry on the page.  They don't bleed through the thick pages.<br/><br/>Also, I was surprised that the dust cover on the book folds out and becomes one giant coloring page.  Overall, I recommend this for people of all ages, adults and older kids (ones who can color in the lines, heh)
Beautiful book...great ideas...fun to color using colored pencils...great to use as ideas to stitch. I keep finding extra little things on each page!
I'ts no secret that Johanna Basford is a genius at knowing exactly what to draw to get you lost in her coloring books.  There are flowers and bugs and trees and animals....just an endless assortment of tiny little things to color.  I've so enjoyed both this and her Enchanted Forest coloring book that once they were nearly totally colored, I ordered another to start fresh.  Since you make the rules with color choices, the sky is the limit and there's no wrong way to color.  Stick to the green grass, blue sky, brown and green tree system or make things as crazy and whimsical as you want - I've seen them done both ways and they turn out just as beautiful using either concept.<br/><br/>This isn't  your kids Winnie the Pooh or Barbie coloring book for sure.  If you've never seen one up close, it's worth buying one just to see the gorgeous designs.  I'm a dedicated fan and will be buying whatever comes next.  I'm sure she's only getting better.
I bought this on a whim for the missus thinking she could use something to while her time away during her lunch break. Years with my wife and I still don't know what makes a great gift.... On some  occasions the simplest thing has been the greatest hit and this was one of those. She was VERY happy and frankly I'm pleasantly surprise.<br/><br/>The cover, the printing and the paper quality was amazing... They didn't make them this way when I was a kid. If you do buy this for a significant other, a good set of markers and coloured pencils should also be part of said gift. Ink doesn't seem to bleed through and the paper works great with coloured pencils. I like that they are off white... It cuts on the glare making it easy on her eyes. All in all this was a great buy and I plan on getting her the other books in the series.
Johanna is a wonderful artist. I have really enjoyed coloring in this book. It's very nature-oriented, which I love, but be aware that you will use brown & green a LOT if your goal is to make the prints look realisitc upon completion instead of eclectic. Each page is a new discovery and I love finding the little details she hides on each page.<br/><br/>I've been using decent quality colored pencils as I had read that certain pens leak through the paper. This leads me to my only true complaint: the pages are double sided, so if you apply a lot of pressure with colored pencils, it dimples the backside of the page you are working on. I respect the attempt to save paper and money, but if you're going to produce such a wonderful coloring book, you should do it the right way and ensure each print is on a page unto itself.
Well I got caught up in the "best selling" hysteria and bought this book. I couldn't believe that there was an adult coloring book category on amazon.com! For $12 I wanted to see what all the commotion was about. Well, first off, my book came with thicker quality paper and the artwork is only on the front page of each. On the back are the items that you are supposed to look for on each page, comically or endearingly, printed in reverse, da Vinci style. The hunt wasn't exactly hard to do, Where's Waldo poses a much greater challenge. As an older trained architect, I thought I'd brush up on my Prismacolor skills using this book, and to that extent, it works. I've forgotten how therapeutic hand rendering things can be (and without deadlines!). The only caveat is that the lines are a bit thick for my liking, but I guess, with ink pens as the book is intended, it wouldn't be a big problem. This book should last a while as the drawings are very intricate. Good luck!
This book is wonderful!!  As another person stated, the felt tip pens it says you can use, bleed through.  We have used colored pens (like scrapbooking pens) to color ours, and they look great!!!!<br/>The book is much larger than I expected.  Bigger than a normal kids book.  The pages are thick, and a good quality.  We've not had one tear.  The designs are pleasing, and keep your brain working.  All in all I love this book!!<br/>I had ordered two of the books at Christmas, and when someone else saw them, they wanted one.  I ordered 2 more.  One for them, and one for myself.  Then, someone else saw, and wanted one, then again it happened!!!  So, I can honestly say that everyone who has seen the book, loves it!  I've ordered 6 now.<br/>I really wish there were more books done by this woman.
* NOTE: I have only used colored pencils with this book. I can't vouch for any type of paint or marker used on it *<br/><br/>This is an incredibly charming book. There are so many intricate designs to color in, and there are several "Finish this drawing" type pages as well for those that are so inclined. Each page has small designs hidden in it as well, from keys to bees. You find the items as you color, some of them are hidden in surprising places.<br/><br/>Overall this is a lovely coloring book for anyone, the only thing I would have changed is that perhaps a hard cover would have been a bit more protective. As is, its cover is somewhat between a normal cover and a hard cover, with a dustjacket over it, which is good but may not protect it if carried in a backpack!
This is the most detail oriented book I've ever seen. The artist draws all of the designs by hand and they are the most meticulous lines I've ever seen. There are some drawings in here that are just too pretty to color in, which I know makes no sense at all but I can't get over how nice it is.<br/><br/>My only complaint, while I know this is meant to be a 'table book' kind of thing, it would have been nice if the pages weren't doubled.  There are a few in here that I was very happy with and would love to display in my house (my walls are lacking artwork), but being as the pages are front & back you have no ability to tear them out.  If a pocket version, or extended version (for the sake of physical artwork, and not just a coloring book) ever came out - I'd buy that for sure.
I LOVE this book.  I'm having so much fun with it.  I was a little hesitant after reading some of the other reviews that mentioned poor quality paper with bleed-throughs from markers, but I really don't know what they're talking about.  I've used colored pencils and Crayola markers so far, and I've had no problem with bleed-throughs or with sharp pencils ripping through the paper.  The paper in mine feels like a medium-weight card stock, and it stands up to both media, and takes the colors very well.<br/><br/>The drawings are very detailed, and take some time to color because there's so much on the page.  I like the shapes she draws - they have very graceful curves that I'm enjoying working along.  It's a relaxing pleasure to spend time with these drawings.
I hadn't really put much thought into coloring in a very long time, but then I ran across this book and I was hooked. The pictures are wonderful and I particularly like that some pages have blank space to either draw more yourself, write in, or leave as is. It gives each individual person a choice and since I don't have to follow any rules, I can be as creative as I like. It is almost like an art journal, even if I don't choose to write anything at all in it, for I have found that depending on how I am feelling, I use different colors to express myself. It is full of the most beautiful drawings and I don't feel like I am using a child's coloring book, but actually a piece of art. I am really glad I was open to this the day I saw it on a shelf in a bookstore.
I often spend time coloring with my daughter. However, it's mostly cute little cartoon kids coloring books. The Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt Coloring Book is a great book for teens and adults. The pages are amazing! The intricate designs are appealing to the eye and are fun to color. I have found that color pencils seem to work best to really get into the fine details and bring the page to life with color. It's a sophisticated coloring book for young adults and adults. I have really enjoyed coloring in my book while my daughter colors in her pony book.<br/><br/>I received the Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring book complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions expressed are 100% my own.
This is a beautiful book! It's almost too pretty to fill in. Even the cover is beautiful. I hope Ms.Basford creates many, many more books like this one!  I'm an adult color-er, but this would be a good book for ages 7+. Excellent floral designs, imaginative, whimsical scenery, cute hidden objects and creatures, even pages to fill in and doodle on your own! Would be a fun project for mother/daughter or grandmother/grandchild to do together.Quality, heavy weight paper that I really wish all coloring books used. I use ultra fine markers but colored pencils or gel pens would also work. Some of the lines are a bit too thin for ordinary crayons. I've even cut out some of the designs and used them to make my own greeting cards. Would make a lovely gift.
This is an amazing book - Johanna's line drawings are a terrific jumping off point to provide us with inspiration to create with color in stitchery, paint, watercolors, pencil, almost any medium you could think of.  Her designs can be copied onto various surfaces - you could paint her vines and flowers on your walls, embroider flowers onto your pillowcases or blouse collars, or just turn your kids loose on the pages.  In addition to plenty of designs that can be colored, Johanna invites you to add your own sections within the pages, to add to the drawing with your own images.  I can see anyone having fun with this book.
I loved the art work but the paper is too thin and my markers bleed through to the next page.
The book is gorgeous...and it made me realize just how impatient I am.  I think this is going to go a long way in helping me to slow down, become patient. Currently, I'm using color pencils, but they're slow going.  The paper stock is thick enough for felt-tip pens.  I think the combination of the two will create striking images, so my next purchase will be color pens.<br/>I'm starting to research all of these "Adult" coloring books to give as Christmas gifts.  They're a great way to get in touch with your inner child, your hidden artist...and unplug from all the electronics that have taken over your life.
I bought two of these at Christmas time for my Twins as it looked to be "right up their alley" as they are 12 and two old for traditional children's coloring books but still enjoy coloring. They both LOVE them so much that I have purchased one for my other daughter who is 25 - yep that's right,  she is very artsy and will enjoy this book even at  this age (I believe) as much as her sisters. The graphics are very well done, seems like a lot of time and thought was put into this book and the surprises in the book are great fun too!<br/><br/>A gift that stands out in the crowd!!<br/><br/>Thanks Amazon!!!
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 22 year old daughter, who is a college student.  To relieve stress, she loves to color, finds it very therapeutic.  We were on a Cruise when she opened it a and it was one of her favorite gifts. She had a box of colored pencils and began coloring at bedtime and during other down times. The book is amazing, so beautiful, like an English Garden. Since she studied abroad in London, she was reminded of the beautiful gardens in London. Also, her favorite movie was the Secret Garden when she was a child.  Just a exquisite, detailed gorgeous book.
I bought two for my children for Christmas, and when I opened the box and saw the great details to color and the quality of the books, I immediately ordered another one for myself.  I have spent hours coloring just the cover of the book. My children are using a mix of gel pens and a decent set of Fantasia colored pencils (with a colorless blender) while I'm using my trusty Prismacolor pencils, with great results.  Markers are definitely a no-no - any excess of thin ink will bleed through.<br/><br/> We will be coloring these images for months.<br/><br/>Brilliant coloring book!
When it arrived i put away to give as gifts. I just gifted one and the receiver pointed out that there are pictures on both front and back and the ink pencils if you use them go through to the other side and ruin the second picture. Also the paper is not perforated so you can tear out and color with out the rest of the book bothering you. Because of these two reasons i now have 3 books that is too late to return and I will not gift them to anyone. I am very sad about this and wish that I had inspected them upon arrival. Then same for Enchanted Forest that I also bought two of.
Love this book! The only stress for me when I'm coloring is staying on the lines! lol
When using Sharpie permanent pens (ultra fine point) the color ran on to the opposite page, making it unusable.
Had to wait a while for the next printing but I'm glad I stuck it out.  I have both of Basford's books and just adore them!  Lovely illustrations that provide HOURS of relaxing coloring time.  I started out using a combination of gel pens and colored pencils for the Enchanted Forest book but I intend to stick with colored pencil only for this one.  The only thing that could make these coloring books better is a spiral binding so they stay open.  I find I spend a lot of time fiddling with the book to keep it open and try to prevent damage to the pages as I color.
Let's face it. After years of coloring and doodling in school it just kind of sticks with you. I thought I was being immature wanting to color and it was hard to find something not aimed at 5 year olds.  I took a chance and searched for "adult coloring pages". Scared of what might pop up, I was delighted that I found this. The book is well put together and I won't have to feel childish if I take it out and about with me. It's printed on elegant paper with plenty of designs to color. Absolutely love it.
I have way too many hobbies now. This book will keep you busy and stress free for hours. I got this for our cabin but my 17 year old daughter and I started coloring in it as soon as it arrived ( shipping took nearly 5 weeks since it was back ordered ) . We eventually brought it to the cabin where it is now and I want another one for home! I have looked at other coloring books for adults and I like this one the best. Be warned though; each page takes hours to complete and is definitely habit forming!
I love all kinds of creative endeavors and this has  proven to be everything I expected and more. My eyesight and inflexibility of my hands make needlework too difficult right now.  I started on the simple postcards  but I am anxious to start working on the more complex drawings in the books.  I would suggest that a stiff card board be place beneath the page working on to protect the other pages.  I am using the Inkjoy pens recommended.  The colors are vibrant and the points are crisp even after repeated use.  I would like very much to find gold or silver pens.
Love this book!!  It is great stress relief!  Just be careful of the pens you use as markers will bleed through.  I'm personally using colored pencils at the moment, but there are some pages with really intricate, tiny details.  You definitely need to keep a sharpener around for those!<br/><br/>There are some objects to search for as you work through the book as well as instructions on how to finish the pages.  I will definitely be back for other titles by Johanna Basford once I finish this one!
I was delighted when my Secret Garden Coloring Book arrived. It is more than I expected. The artist did a beautiful job. The illustrations are detailed and intricate creating a world I love diving into. I can't wait to complete it because it will be a feast for the eyes.<br/>The book itself is light and thin making it easy to carry or travel with. Each page is different and there is so much on each page I don't think you could ever get bored. I definitely recommend it to anyone and everyone.
I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas, and immediately ordered one for myself when I got it! Now I'm ordering one for her Mom too.  It's a gorgeous book.Coloring in it is my Zen. It says to use markers, but this gorgeous toothy paper allows ink to spread so that takes a light touch. I use colored pencils, watercolor pencils, Derwent Inktense pencils, and gel pens, (yes, I may have a wee issue in the pencil junky department) and markers sparingly. It's relaxing to color when I don't feel like drawing first. I hope she publishes more like it.
I received  this book about a week ago and was so delighted! Color the cover the inside flap every page is a coloring world! Not only coloring there is a scavenger  hunt in it. Hidden in the drawings there are little things to find, like ladybugs, Frogs, and butterflies and so much more! I have been using prismacoĺor color pencils for fear of bleed through the pages as the pages are printed  on both sides. I highly  recommend  this for anyone who likes detailed drawings, yes very detailed .
This book is great. My daughter is 9 and she loves to color and draw but is a bit big (or so she feels) to color in a regular coloring book. This book is smaller designs which is great for color pencils,gel pens or fine tip markers. It is a treasure hunt as well but that is just a bonus and something I dont even think she will care to do.The picture are to nice to circle all up.  I might even do a bit of coloring in this book.  You would not be able to use crayon in this book.
Love This book! It gives beautiful pictures, but also allows creative.
I received the Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book Paperback from Johanna Basford in exchange for an honest review. This book is literally gorgeous. I love coloring and this adult coloring book has it all. I love everything I have colored so far. I love the beautiful attention to detail and I literally spend hours coloring it. I use colored pencils and I am very pleased with the results. I would highly recommend this adult coloring book to all adults!
Secret Garden is a fabulous book. I consider it an adult coloring book. Johanna Basford, the author, has created a world of "inky treasures". I have colored many of my pictures and the next step is to have them professionally framed. I used colored pencils on mine and I'm satisfied with how they look. I would highly recommend this book to someone with some skills but isn't ready to set off yet like VanGogh! The price was good and it arrived quickly. A Good Buy!
I got this coloring book for a long journey -- two overnight flights in a row plus a day of waiting around Heathrow in between. It was the perfect activity to do in the airport when my brain was too fried to read. I love the detailed drawings and the fact that there are so many to play with. Like other reviewers, I was a little bummed out that my felt-tip markers bled through to the drawings on the other side, but, oh well! Still a really great purchase regardless.
The pages are great. I like that they are thick and I have yet to have a marker bleed through. To be safe though I did check all the markers that  I've used on the title page inside and would recommend doing that if you are unsure if they will bleed. I bought some of the Staedtler Triplus Fineliner pens like others had mentioned but felt that regular thin Crayola markers work perfect too without the fear of running dry working on some of the larger areas.
Beautiful and fun!! I've just started to color again and this book adds other fun stuff that most of us loved as children. There are mazes, hide & seek, little critters & other things hidden to find. The book is very heavy paper. I am using colored pencils and could use Sharpies but mine aren't fine-tip enough. This is one book that won't bleed through. I'm looking forward to spending more time coloring and this one encourages me to get to it!
The book is made of thick paper so both sides can be used without bleeding thru. Some pictures span both pages and could easily come out so it could be framed. It has a loose book cover with the inside completely covered with designs to color. Turn it inside out and put it back on and it is ALL art. Really nicely done. The designs are charming with small critters sprinkled on each page.There is a reason the 130 ratings are all 4 or 5 stars.
I started coloring in my book last night and I just love it!! I have read reviews where some people complained that the colored markers bleed through to the other side,but I don't have that problem and I use Pentel Arts Colored Pens. It will take me awhile to finish this book,but as soon as I do, I am going to get The Enchanted  Forest. Best stress reliver ever. I am also going to get colored pencils for some different textures and color.
Not designed for young children, although I was amazed at how well my 6-year-old granddaughter did with some of the pages.  These 9" square designs are composed of small pieces.  VERY busy and intricate.  This is a great book for someone that likes to color, but that doesn't want a regular cartoon type coloring book.  A single page could take 3 - 4 hours to color.  Soft, sharp, colored pencils are really a must for this book.
I can't wait for this lady to come out with another book.  I am having trouble pacing myself.  The drawings are a wonder.  If you don't like small details, this is not the book for you.  I love the detail.  The paper is a soft white...not that glaring white of so many coloring books.  The paper is excellent....it takes my color pencils exceptionally well.  Highly recommended...not for little kids...best for us big kids.
Love the book- as someone who does a lot of different mediums,I found  that the Dewent watercolor pencils work beautifully with the book- you can use them as you would a colored pencil without having to really press down hard.They have a nice amount of pigment in them. I took a q-tip that was just Barely moistened and smeared it for the water on the waterlily/fish page. The shadowing  in the water was really fun.
I bought one for myself and one for my niece.  It is an absolute delight, beautifully drawn, whimsical and charming.  I leave my copy out, along with an array of colored pencils, and it is the rare visitor who isn't tempted to begin coloring in it.  It is a wonderful way to be creative, without necessarily having any artistic talent.  I find it very relaxing.  I'm going to buy a few more for my granddaughters.
I bought this and while I love the pictures.  I find the details in most of the pics really tiny and hard to see.  After about 20 mins of coloring my eyes are killing me and I must stop.  Maybe bigger pictures for us who do not have perfect vision.  I used just regular Crayola color pencils and have no issues with them in the book.
There are a lot of good designs in this book, but in order to work on some of them, you'd have to tear the book apart to get at them, and I don't want to do that. Many of the designs go all the way into the binding part of the book, inaccessible, to me anyway. I want a book, not a series of torn out pages. I wouldn't buy it again.
This has been a delightful and relaxing experience picking out the colors for the intricate designs in this coloring book.  So much in fact I purchased four more for my granddaughters and daughters.  Also, fun looking for interesting pens, color crayons to complete the work.  Looks like I will have many enjoyable hours coloring.
This is a great book to color in for adults! It's intricate and detailed giving you tons of time consuming fun with colors! I will definitely be buying another one when I'm finished with this one. The only bummer, the pages don't tear out and the designs are on both sides so if you use too heavy of a marker, the ink will bleed.
I didn't expect to love it as much as I do - I thought coloring in endless flowers and leaves would get boring and repetitive, but the designs are so intricate and allow for so many different results based on what you do with the colour. I wish the font on the written parts was in light grey ink so that it could disappear when the image was done.
I absolutely love the pictures in this book.  I have done about 4 pictures so far, and I find it really relaxing.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars rather than the full five is I wish the pages were 1 sided so the ink/pencils didn't pass through and also I found the 2 page illustrations hard to color because of the binding.
I love coloring and its a great stress reliever, I purchased this coloring book and a few others. The pages are a good quality and my gel pen ink doesn't run through to the other side. The illustrations are very nice and fun to color. When I am finished with this one I will be purchasing the other books in this collection.
This book is soooooooooooo beautiful!! I was mesmerized when I saw it on amazon, and pleased when it arrived. SO LOVELY!! I am writing this in hopes of helping people. I just want to say I use gel pens to color it, and it doesn't seep through! The best coloring book I ever bought bar NONE!! Will be buying more for friends.
This is such a great coloring book! I love coloring and I recommend using colored pencils for shading, specifically a box with several green shades. I have not tried using markers but it seems like they would bleed onto the next picture. I do believe felt timed would work but I still prefer colored pencils for the shading.
Got this as a gift for my mom.  Her review was "There is so much to color and it's so detailed... it might take me 80 years to finish!"  And with that said, she loved it.  Every time I've called for the last month or so she said she had it out and was coloring at the time.  I guess that's about as good as it gets.
The line drawings are irresistible.  The designs just make me crave pretty colored pencils.  Coloring is a soothing activity for all ages and this book gives you the satisfaction of filling in the spaces and "creating" your own rainbow world.  And the touches of gold on the cover just made me go "SQUeeee!"
Can't wait to start inking away at this treasure.  I bought one for myself & one for my granddaughters 13th birthday next month. I'm sure it will give me many hours of relaxing fun.  More fun then just doddling.  Now we can compare our masterpieces. Although I have not started, I'm sure the pages will not bleed through.
Bought from Target but still wanted to write a review. Very awesome book! Just started coloring today. Using a 24pk of prismacolor pencils. The crayola didn't work very well. Enjoying coloring but wish there were cheaper pencils than the prismacolor that worked just as well. After these I can't keep affording them.
Much sturdier than little kid style coloring books. The pages are more like cardstock. It has a cover jacket, but the actual covers are still cardboard stuff.  The front cover has cute little gold embellishments. I believe it is worth what I paid for it. I will be gifting it to my artsy friend who has bad anxiety.
I still love looking at the book. I use sharpie and bic markers and they bleed through the paper and ruin the next page. I try to copy the pages so I can color both sides without ruining one side but the pages are an ODD shape (square) and size. I have yet to find a copier that can make them without shrinking the page or cutting off something. I can still copy the smaller picture, like the heart and circle shape. I have to give this a bad rating because the book can only be used with colored pencils or gel pens. For me thats a no go.
coloring is so good for our soul.  I bought this book after reading the reviews as a Christmas present to myself.  I am so glad that I did.  This book will provide many happy hours of coloring for both the young and old (er) alike.  Nicely made.  However, I am content with using  colored pencils for this book.
I have to do an awful lot of technical reading - agriculture, economics, etc. - and sometimes my brain just turns to molten goo.  This arrived yesterday and for 30 minutes a day, there is NOTHING in my world except how to make that sea green on the dragonfly's tail segue into the plum I want in the wings.  I am transported
I'm pretty sure I bought out the stock!! I purchased one for myself and bought 3 more for gifts and told my best friend and she bought a few as well. This is the best therapy ''hands down'', lol...If you like to color as I do and I'm 59 years old, this book is the perfect adult coloring book by far...ENJOY
This has been so therapeutic for me.  The designs are gorgeous.  I've been enjoying using my prismacolor soft colored pencils to color.  Since the designs are small, these are easier to use with this book compared to the markers or other medium.  This is a great way for adults to escape for a while.
Posted this on another coloring book.  This is a great book for adults that want to sit back, drink wine, and color.  Guys, surprise your lady with this book, colored pencils and a bottle wine.  Play the  Sam Smith Radio channel on Pandora, maybe prepare a cheese platter.  Now you're in like Flint.
I am becoming very choosy about coloring books.  This is the coolest one I have purchased so far.  The detail is amazing.  the pages are whimsical and just plain fun.  Along with a brand new 132 piece set of Prismacolor Pencils, this is going to be a awesome winter.  Johanna Basford - more please!
I bought this for my sister who is recovering from surgery.  She has been a lifelong fan of coloring (and we are well into our 50's!!) She has enjoyed it thoroughly & it has been good therapy for her.  Recommend to anyone who still loves to color!!  Very detailed black&white; pictures to color.
This is a beautiful book!  Purchased as a gift for my mother, and she absolutely loves it.  Every time I visit, she shows me her coloring progress.  I love the level of detail in the drawings; they are works of art whether in black and white or in color.  Now I want a copy for myself!
Absolutely love this book, but I have to agree with some others here, I wish she would not put writing and suggestions in the book, such as "draw a swarm of butterflies". I can't draw to save my life so I wanted this simply for the coloring aspect. - posted by Lauren
Put a pen in my daughters hand and she is happy for hours... this book is a dream. The pages are so beautiful and detailed. I am going to keep my eye out for more like it. This will give hours of enjoyment and this makes a perfect gift with a set of pens or colored pencils.
Such beautifully detailed drawings!  (This book inspired a work-place drop-in coloring group once a week at noon!  It's a fun way to relax and chat with co-workers over a lunch break.)  After finishing a page, we are so dang proud of ourselves for our beautiful creations!
Out of all the Christmas gifts my 8-year old granddaughter got, this is the one that I noticed her going to the most.  She went and got some new markers just to use for this. (with some gift money she got)  I can see any child or adult enjoying passing time with this gem.
While I like the designs, they are very busy and often small for true appreciation when coloring. great layout, superb binding and covers, I;d recommend this book to those who enjoy working with intricate designs. Love the typewriter style type, as well. Thumbs up, here!
Really nice! the paper is thick and i can use dong a markers, again the downside are those pages which are half blank which  allow you to add more illustrations and if your not a creative artist, you will have difficulty constructing figures and objects into the pages.
I bought this has a birthday gift for a close friend.  When the book arrived I fell in love with it, I had to order a second one for myself. The art work is just beautifully created, when colored the pictures come to life.<br/>The delivery was prompt. Very pleased ( ;
This book is gorgeous and so much fun to color. I wish they would have used thicker paper like in the enchanted forest book so I could use my pens but I received some nice colored pencils and am switching to those. Stardtlers fine liners bleed right through the paper.
I received this as a present and I love it. It is soothing to add color to these beautiful images. I have been using color pencils to avoid bleeding through the pages. The Crayola brand color pencils seem to work the best. I've also used some crayons with ok results.
Love this coloring book. Bought because I was bed ridden for ten weeks. Pictures are on both sides of the page. I recommend for those that have a larger color collection. I had to get more colored pencils because my pictures started looking alike... good designs.
Johanna Basford is absolutely amazing! This adult coloring book is one of the best I have ever seen! There is so much detail and thought put into making this it really blows me away! I have already started coloring and I am in love with every page of this book!
I bought this for my sister and one for me too.  We both love using colored pencils and this is<br/>a beautiful and relaxing way to use them.<br/>I was so excited when I saw these...I also ordered the butterfly one for my sister.<br/>Very pleased with these.
Amazing just amazing design and fun to color.  I love coloring and this one is amazing. I used color pencils because it doesn't bleed through.  I hope she keeps bringing out more books.  If you are starting to color, this must be a part of your collection
BEAUTIFUL coloring book.  I am so excited to color every page!  Great for anyone who enjoys more detailed coloring pages.  Nice gift idea too!  Stress reliever.  Love it!<br/><br/>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
I have become completely obsessed with this coloring book for adults.  After posting my first completed picture on facebook, half a dozen of my friends went out and purchased the book and now we are thinking of starting a wine/cheese and adult coloring club!
This is by far the best and most gorgeous coloring book I have ever seen. It took over two weeks to get here but was well worth the wait, The drawings are absolutely beautiful. If you love coloring or just appreciate fine line art, you need this book!
Beautiful book, I was a bit disappointed in the paper used. I was expecting the paper to be a little more heavy duty. I used watercolor pens which have a tendency to bleed through to the other side. I think this paper would be okay for colored pencils.
I do not plan to make it a habit to review coloring books, but I just couldn't help myself with this one.  I love it that much!<br/><br/>When you look at the cover, you cannot help but notice the amount of detail on it.  It is filled to the brim with flowers, vines, leaves, etc.  However, you may find yourself wondering "are the pages on the inside like what I see on this cover?"  The answer is a very strong and profound YES!!<br/><br/>Inside you will find many pages to help you relax.  Each one is filled with a design consisting of flowers, leaves, animals, and other things one might expect to find in a garden.  There are a lot of small details to the items on the page which will keep you pretty busy.<br/><br/>Not only will you find things to color, but some of the pages have prompts for you.  These include, but are not limited to, adding your own small designs to preexisting flowers, adding on to Johanna Basford's designs with your own drawings, and mazes.<br/><br/>This coloring book has a lot for you to do.  You will find hours of entertainment within just this one coloring book alone.<br/><br/>It is sure to help you relax after a stressful day and help you feed your creative side.  However, from what I can tell it is not exactly easy to get your hands on this one, or her other titled Enchanted Forest, from what I can tell.  So, if you see one, I suggest you pick it up or you risk missing out!<br/><br/>This is easily a 5 out of 5 star item!<br/><br/>You can find more of my reviews here:<br/>http://readingwithcupcakes.blogspot.com/
Very high quality paper with wonderful drawings that the entire family is enjoying coloring. This has provided a great evening break from electronics and added to family time in a personal way that many of us miss in this over stimulated time.
This is a beautiful adult coloring book.  I bought one for my 90 year old mother.  She just loves it.  It calms her and gives her something to do.  The paper is a good weight and the colors do not bleed to the page behind.  Very good quality!
Beautiful pictures, but wish the images were not double sided... should be one image per page.  Perforations would be ideal as well so that you could easily take them out for framing if you wanted to, that is why I only gave them three stars.
I love to doodle and this book has a smorgasbord of adorable creatures, delightful flowers, and so much more.  When I want to unwind, I love to pull this book out and complete the pages or just examine the wondrous realm of the secret garden.
its ok, double sided however, unlike the other books i have gotten, and its tough to color some parts that are close to the binding, need to have the design end sooner or have the book able to open wider to get that area.  The designs are ok
LOVE this wonderful adult coloring book!  The pictures to color are so detailed and stunningly beautiful.  If you love to color and like to work with intricate details, you will love this wonderful book.  Get those colored pencils sharpened!
The pages in this coloring book are great for stitching. Using a variety if stitches, you can take little snippets of designs in this book and use them together or separately to make your own masterpiece interpretation in fiber!  Great fun!
As much as I love this illustrator I'm giving this an okay because nowhere did it mention it is more of an activity book.  I have zero drawing ability so many many many pages of complete this illustration is not why I purchased this book.
When I first ordered this, I almost felt a little silly being a grown woman ordering a coloring book, but I'm hooked!  The designs are absolutely beautiful.  So much so that I may actually frame some of the finished pages.  Very pretty!
This is a beautiful/high quality book. I purchased the Staedtler Triplus Fineliners in a convenient carry case, and am having a blast coloring these pictures.  They need to make some in 8X10 so that I could more easily frame them!
My children bought me these for Christmas, so I have something to take up my time at the Dr. And hospital for the next few months I have to say I concentrate on the coloring of the most beautiful pictures in this book. Thank you!
So when I had the opportunity to test and review this item for free I was super excited! I love coloring with my kids and an adult version? Even better. I read through others reviews as I waited for mine to be delivered. I had a few things I wanted to watch for specifically. First off, it came in the mail super quick and when I received it I was in awe of the amount of detail. It was absolutely amazing! And because everyones mind works different you could have the same book colored in side by side and they would look like 2 completely different books. I love that throughout the pages there is more to do than just coloring. Several of the pages she gives hints of how to complete the drawings and make them your own. There are also mazes and figured hidden in all the drawings. That was one of my favorite parts. Someone mentioned in a review that they felt the paper was too thin. I was expecting printer paper almost and was pleasantly surprised that it's more like cardstock paper. It's thick and durable. Someone else mentioned that colored pencils didn't work well at all. I was a little nervous about that part. I didn't have anything else to try this out with. But I had no problem using the colored pencils and really liked the look of them. I will be buying more pencils so I have more shades of the different colors and I also plan on getting gel pens to try out and see how they look. Overall I'm super excited to have something made for adults to color. It gives me something to do while my own kids are coloring and it looks AWESOME on my coffee table! I will be buying more in the future!
Excellent book for coloring, painting, creating!  Fun shapes and themes for anyone who yearns for a project to get lost in.  I did a bleed thru test for the pens I use to be sure I didn't lose the back page art work.  Lovely!
I bought this coloring book as gift for my girlfriend, and she absolutely loves it. It's very detailed and attractive to the eye. She actually bought a brand new set of color pencils specifically for this coloring book!
Nice pictures to draw....but why in the heck does it write instructions on some of the pages? You cannot draw over the printed suggestions/instructions on some of the pages....what a waste to otherwise pretty template.
Do not like the writing, and comments on each page. Quality is not high. Also coloring is a stress reliever, to let loose on the mind, these designs are small, and require more concentration than I want to put into it.
I bought adult coloring books for my Mom, who is a senior citizen.  She raves about them, and the Secret Garden has been her favorite so far.  It's a wonderful stress reliever.  Highly recommend this for older people.
I gave this as a gift to my sister and she loves it.  I am thinking of getting one for myself.<br/>My sister is excited about all the different pictures and likes just looking through it and eager to start coloring.
I didn't realize how heavy and thick the paper in this book would be - it's such amazing quality. The pictures are really gorgeous. It's such a treat, and a wonderful way to spend time coloring in the beautiful art.
simply a beautiful book however i agree with others in that the paper is thin enough for the color from one page to show through and thus ruin the next. a shame. pages in coloring books really  should be one sided.
I bought this for wifey for Christmas, with a pencil set.  She has ordered more pencils, and has<br/>enjoyed this coloring book everyday.  She gets excited when finding all the hidden things.<br/>Recommended!!
An intricate coloring book for girls. Keep several of these on hand for last minute birthday party gifts. Combined with a large set of markers, it makes the perfect inexpensive gift that everyone seems to like.
johanna"s coloring books are beautiful from the design of the cover and the presentation of subject matter on each  page. They are inspiring  and engaging !!! They are ART that invites participation.
Gave this along with some nice colored pencils to a colleague who likes to doodle during meetings. The designs are absolutely beautiful.  I find coloring relaxing, so hopefully she will enjoy this gift.
Bought as a gift. Delightfully surprised on the details and the potential for the coloring. I bought it for a person mourning the passing of a love one, it helps taking your thought away from the pain.
I found this on a sewing website.  So I thought it was for sewing like patterns wrong, wrong, wrong.  But I do like the pictures and I'm working with it like small stuff apart here and apart there.
I enjoyed this book so much that I bought one as a gift for an elderly friend. she was delighted! My only problem with th book is not being able to use markers as they bleed thru to the next page.
Not a children's coloring book, but with definite childlike qualities. Difficult to actually color in the book due to the heavy binding, removing the pages proves difficult. Designs are beautiful.
This is a great book that is perfect for adults and children alike. At first when I got this I thought it would be perfect for my kids but when it arrived it was so beautifully illustrated that I wanted to keep it for myself. So I took the first few pages with my multi color gel pens and started coloring the pages. The pictures were so beautiful that I was enjoying life coloring the pages. It satisfied my desire to doodle and dabble on pages to enticed and feed my need to draw on everything.<br/><br/>So you can imagine my surprise when I came home one day from work to find my 3 kids hovered around the book each taking a turn coloring on the page. I couldn't get mad because ultimately I bought it for them to color on. But to my surprise, my children were copying my coloring and staying within the lines based of the design and color scheme that I was using. My husband also brought out the gel pens for them to use (which they were even more excited about because mom doesn't let them use them often). First thing my husband did was warn me that they were using them. He stated they tried to use colored pencils but it didn't work. Which either way I didn't mind.<br/><br/>I was amazing to see them working together to make a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I am so grateful I was chosen to review this product for my honest and unbiased opinion at a reduced rate.
Wish the pages could be torn out to frame and some pictures go into the crease of the binding making it almost impossible to color. Love the pictures, just some pages not very user friendly.
I love the illustrations in this coloring book -- Johanna is a very talented artist-- however, I wish the pages were not double sided; it limits you to only certain markers that won't bleed.
The page stock is nice and heavy making the book ready for framing.  The pictures are wonderful---you can color as detailed as you like.  I plan to complete mine as a beautiful book!  Enjoy!
I love the designs in this book and it is a relaxing thing for me to do at the end of a long day when I am not in the mood to read. I have always loved to color and the designs are amazing.
Super cute and fun book! The details are very tiny so I would recommend a fine tip marker or colored pencil when coloring.  Many of the designs are suitable for framing and using as decor!
Very detailed coloring book. You can only use colored pencils in this coloring book which is ok i guess. Some of the designs are alot easier to color with marker but markers bleed though.
Beautiful illustrations, nice paper, clean lines and plenty of pages. The cover also has some gold leaf detail which is sort of hard to see pictured. Very sharp! A great gift for all ages
I have both books and keep them on my coffee table for everyone who visits. I ask them to color a picture and sign it. Makes for fun times, many recollections, and sharing of memories.
I love the beautiful artwork and details.<br/>I find i quite relaxing when I decide to color a page .<br/>I do not recommend markers...Colored pencils only.<br/>No other comparison.
Very whimsical and detailed coloring book.  I like it very much but don't expect to fly through coloring one of these pictures.  It is designed to take time and time is what you need.
So much fun! I'm so glad I gave in and jumped on the adult coloring train. A great way for me to relax in the evenings while watching TV, and a great stretch for my creative muscles.
As an adult I still enjoy coloring books.  Its very relaxing to me and I love seeing the colorful finished pieces that I can create through my imagination. I really feel it keeps me young at heart. I have a two year old who is just starting to enjoy coloring books, and I thought it would be a great idea to purchase an adult style coloring book, to color along side him.<br/><br/>I am in love with this artist. My breath was taken away when I received this Secret Garden coloring book and saw all the beautiful ink illustrations Johanna came up with. You don't need a single word to go on a journey through her creativity and meet the end of this book.  I am enjoying selecting my color schemes, and these illustrations are so detailed that it could easily take me several weeks to complete one page.  I wish the illustrations were not double sided. If I use a good colored pencil they do not leak through, however pen does, so I plan on photocopying on card stock for pen purpose.<br/><br/>Overall I am very happy with this purchase, and this coloring book will definitely take years for me to complete, just because of the small amount of time I have to work in it, and how detailed it actually is. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to express their creativity through color.<br/><br/>*"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."*
I have enjoyed this coloring book so much. It gives me enough detail, not toooooo much, the book lies flat, I enjoy the opportunities to add my own creative leaves and caterpillars!
This is a great stress reliever. Turn on some chill music and color away. I used Staedtler Marker Pens, $25 at Target for the 20 pack, no bleed! Nicer than colored pencils.
A really cute detailed book! I can't wait to color all of it. I like that it's a story and not just random pictures. Makes it different from the rest of the coloring books.
I really love this coloring book. It has beautiful pictures to color and its very detailed. You can be very creative in your coloring. I'm very happy I purchased this book!
Purchased for myself and like the art work but I would rather not have the parts that ask you to draw.  If I get another I will not get one with this.  Still a great book.
I love the details of the product. Coloring really calms me down so the fact that it had so many details helps. I also love the way you have to find the hidden pictures.
This is a fabulous book.  The artwork is stunning and simply spectacular once it has been colored.  I use colored gel pens when coloring the pages of this book and have had NO issue with the ink seeping onto the artwork on the reverse page.  Gel pens also bring an intensity of color that simply cannot be achieved with colored pencils.  I did not expect the level of care Johanna Basford clearly implemented while creating this wonderful book.  It is a soft bound book that includes a removable cover.  The pages are good quality stock paper that holds up well to the gel pen ink (I did not try to use markers, nor would I recommend it).  There are quite a few empty areas that invite your own creativity.<br/><br/>If I had to criticize something about the book, I would have preferred the reverse of each page be blank and the pages be perforated to allow them to be removed easily and cleanly.  Many pages deserve to be framed.<br/><br/>This is an excellent stress reliever and yields a book that when completed, will fill you with pride and a sense of accomplishment.<br/><br/>I look forward to new inky treasures offered by Ms. Basford.
The pages bleed. So you have to decide which color of the page you want to color the most becasue if you are using Copicmarkers they will bleed. This makes me very sad
A bit too fussy to be as much fun as it could be.  I very much dislike the fact that a coloring book this expensive has the pictures printed on both sides of the page.
Child or Adult this is a beautifully put together book with lots of wonderful drawings of flowers and such,  gave it to my 10 year old granddaughter and she loves it!
The paper quality wasn't as good as the Enchanted Forest book. My staedtler markers that the artist recommended bleed through. Enchanted forest had no bleed through.
Very nicedetailed illustrations, I got it for my granddaughter, for Christmas she loved it. I will watch for more. It was a great gift to go with the pens I got her
This book is lovely and very "grown up"!  I will be very proud to give these books as gifts with along with an elegant case of long slender colored pencils.
At first, I thought coloring books are for girls, but then I tried this one. It's actually nice, because coloring is actually a good exercise to  release stress.
I ordered this through Amazon Prime Now on November 3rd. Leaving reviews there is not an option yet and Amazon Prime now orders don't show up under regular Amazon so this might not show up as verified.<br/>My kid and I were excited to use the new pens we also ordered along with it.<br/>The pictures are beautiful. I was concerned that everything was double sided and the paper looked pretty thin. But seeing that in the description it specifically says "All editions of SECRET GARDEN now feature thicker and heavier paper stock, fighting bleed-through from ink pens." We decided to start on the first page. After coloring in a few flowers I flipped the page over and there is significant ink bleed through. There are also indents lines from the pens on the page behind the one we colored.<br/>If we use the book in the future we will put paper behind the page we are using to prevent indentations. But the bleed through renders half the book useless.<br/>If this is what the company considers a heavy paper stock then they have some pretty low standards.<br/>If this is an old version then shame on Amazon for sending out bad stock.<br/><br/>***UPDATE***<br/>Also of note, I had ordered the Enchanted Forest book.  That one is made with heavy paper stock and is of much better quality so I am pretty sure that I recieved old product leftover from before they improved the book.<br/>My warning to you is if you purchase through Amazon you risk getting the cheap version.<br/><br/>I did receive an immediate response from customer service. I am being refunded  $6.64, not the full purchase price and I am not sure what that is about. I also recieved a $10.00 credit for use only at Amazon Now.<br/><br/>Here is the response.<br/>"I'm sorry; I can't check on the specific physical details of Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book for you. The information on our website is all the information we have about a particular product.Our inventory is stored in multiple fulfillment centers, and we don't know ahead of time which fulfillment center your order will ship from. Our Customer Service centers are separate from our fulfillment centers; unfortunately don't have a way to check the item details for you."<br/><br/>So if you choose to order than good luck to you, I hope you get the new version of the book so you don't waste the beautiful pages. Or buy it in person at a store so you can make sure of the quality. Kudos to the illustrator, the pictures are lovely.
A bit difficult for my old eyes. Very nicely done. If using markers the ink fades through to the other side of the page making that picture to color worthless.
This beauty is a grownup's coloring book - it is full of inspiration for many art and crafting techniques.  I will probably use it for needlework inspiration.
Large format, thick, creamy pages with designs on both sides. Made in the Netherlands, it comes with a dust jacket - this is a premium book! Not perforated and the binding is so good that pages need to be cut out rather than carefully torn (though why would you want to? It's a great coffeetable book!)<br/><br/>I'm docking a star because the book itself smelled so strongly of either the ink or paper making process that I have been unable to color much in it. It effected my breathing and the forearm that rested on the page turned pink and scratchy. I talked to an archivist, asking what might be done, and he had a couple of suggestions, the easiest of which is to take it outside in the sun and wind, fan it open so as many pages get air to them as possible. Repeat until you're satisfied, though he said that could take some days.<br/><br/>The smell is definitely not mold, must, or mildew.<br/><br/>I would give this book SIX stars if I could, but would advise those with chemical sensitivities to maybe stay away from it for now. It's so popular that I bet some other book place will be printing the next batch.
My husband bought this for me for Christmas...I have had to force myself to stop coloring. I could spend all day with this beautiful book and some gel pens!
I am in no way an artist, but I do love to color and try to make things look nice. I have seen and tried many different books similar to this and either they are not very realistic and because I am not very good at deciding colors I have a hard time finishing them. Sure I do like to add extra color that may not be accurate, but it is hard for me to figure out colors of things when I don't know what they are to begin with. This book is pretty awesome because the pages have a lot of things that are accurate, but it also gives you room to add your own touch to the page. I do wish that you could take the pages out, but I do like how it is organized. I love that it also has hidden images throughout that you can look for while you color and that it also has a guide in the back so that you know if you have found them all or not. My girls love to help me find the hidden images and they get excited when they find one. This book will last a very long time and will provide hours of coloring! I am very glad that I got this book for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I can't wait to try out the other books!
I received this as a gift (via Amazon) and was surprised by how much I enjoy good old-fashioned coloring. As an outsider artist, it is nice to be able to zone out, be creative and not have to conceptualize, etc....That being said, other reviewers have listed the ("fine art quality") pencils that they use for good results, so I won't duplicate their excellent advice.  I will also add that, as I have enjoyed the Secret Garden SO MUCH, I wanted to give it and her other books as gifts, and even those "I'm not creative" people. There are SO many of these on the market now, and as a visual person......I like to flip through the pages so I know what I'm getting. Some are very intricate and some have quotes....more images on the books might be helpful. And it is a great gift, especially if you include a starter set for someone who might not have a zillion colored pencils like I do. I went from a hmm, not sure about this to a grown-up coloring book convert with this book as the gateway. Excellent way to put down the phone, turn away from the computer and just...color!
I love this coloring book!!  I use the Fiskar's gel pens which give precise control.  Fun to bring the book to life in color just a bit at a time.  Fun!
Great book with hidden pics - relaxing activity for those who need mindless downtime.  This product is for adults - Too complicated for anyone under 12.
If you enjoy coloring this is the book for you.  Sweet and whimsical drawings are fun to color.  I would buy a second book if the author publishes one.
This book is gorgeous.  The detail is vivid. Each page is a masterpiece. Great deal for the beauty of this book. Finally, a coloring book for adults.
I love this book!  Great drawings and so much fun to color.  It's very inspiring to color in.  Makes you want to put glitter all over the pictures!
Love the illustrations of this book. However, the image is going right up to spine so it's hard to scan to show my friend what i did on internet.
Cannot find ink pen that works with the smallness of the shapes that makes a picture. Disappointing. But we will make it!
This book is amazing and enthraling for grown up kids that never grew up. I'm addicted already and I'm only two pages in!!!
I am an adult though I am sure older kids would enjoy this book too. The designs are very pretty, garden type scenes. Some pages are just coloring pages and some pages have designs with blank areas and suggestions for further doodle designs. At the beginning of the book, you are given a list of things that are hidden in the pages for you to find and the key is a the back of the book. My only complaint and the reason I took off 1 star is the paper quality. For the price I would have expected thicker, smoother paper. This is slightly thicker and smoother than a typical coloring book but not by much. I wouldn't recommend using markers in this book as there is definitely bleed through. I used my Staedtler Triplus and my Stabilo fine point markers on a small section of a page to test for bleed through and they both bled through. This is otherwise a beautiful coloring book!
This book was larger than I expected it to be. It really has a lot of beautiful pictures in it. This book is positively for the more creative person. My favorite pages are just the regular pages that do not require and free hand doodling or drawing. I especially like the pages with owls or other birds on them. I have used colored pencils and gel pens on these. The colored pencils work best. A real downfall to this book is that pictures are printed on the front and back. I feel like I need to choose which side I want to color more. This is also an issue if you want to frame something because then the other side really goes to waste. Beside that this book is a lot of fun. I like that it has a nice mixture of pictures with larger coloring areas and pictures that really have a lot of small details. This book was provided for my evaluation and feedback.
I LOVE this book! The detail is so intricate and just plain fun! The ONLY drawback is that the paper quality is still not good for pens or markers. Even just using gel pens every now and then cause SOME bleed (and this is one of the newest books that is suppose to have the better quality paper). So, this book is forcing me to start using pencils. Regardless, I gave the book 5 stars because I just LOVE the detail in the book. Johanna has done a fabulous job - regardless of the paper. I DO wish that she would have the back side of the pages blank though. This would totally solve the bleeding problem which could cause only half of the book to be usable. The book is perfect if you are going to just use pencils though. :D<br/><br/>I am a coloring addict! If you also like coloring check us out on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/adultcoloringblog.
"Back in my day we didn't have fancy electronic video games..." Wait... Yes we did... BUT! I always played with Barbies, LEGOs, and coloring books too!<br/><br/>And now, as an adult, I can honestly say I miss the simplicity of stress-free days sitting at a table coloring. But these books give me that same joy and peace I had when I was a kid, without giving me a puppy in a bow-tie and party hat to color.<br/><br/>I choose to use colored pencils when I color because of how fine some of the details are and the variety of pictures to color are perfect. In the mood for something simple? You've got a whole page. Want something super intricate? Here's a two page spread! I've gotten a few other books in this "adult coloring book" genre and NONE compare!<br/><br/>For anyone, young or old, who loves to color - I strongly recommend!
Secret Garden is a treasure hunt and coloring book for adults. Inside you'll find fantastical pictures to color in, mazes to solve, and patterns to complete with your own inky drawings. The drawings have a very whimsical feel to them and they are very beautifully drawn and full of detail. Coloring can be somewhat time consuming but once you start you won't want to stop. It's a great way to spark your creativity and bring out your inner child. It would especially make a great book for someone who already has an artsy and/or creative side. I'm amazed by this lovely book and I definitely don't mind sitting aside some time to color. Also, I find it easiest to color using colored pencils.<br/><br/>*Disclosure:  I received this book for free in exchange for my honest review. No other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.
Gorgeous design and great excuse to color with your kid.  Get the gel pen pack on Amazon and I can color for hours :)
Ink bleeds through, but it's nice to shut off at the end of the day and color like a little kid with colored pencils.
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS BOOK, WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ADULT WHO LIKES TO COLOR, THE PICTURES ARE BEAUTIFUL
Pictures don't do this book justice. I ended up keeping it rather than gifting it. Fantastic & unique. Love love love
I bought one for all of the ladies in my family and every one of them love it! They say it is good stress relief.
bought this for my granddaughter and my daughter saw it and says it's fantastic and she wants a copy.  very nice!
I love the details of this book . I have used diffrent markers and pencils to color it  has been fun and relating
We got it yesterday and we love it!  I pre-ordered as a birthday gift for my 9yr old daughter.  She had been coloring in my adult coloring books.  Her Grandmother bought her two others from different publishers from Amazon & we like them also but THIS IS SO AMAZING!!! The outer covering feels like a real book, not a coloring book.  The pages - how to describe them - they feel so good.  Like just let me touch it - oh look there are designs on it - good.  No bleed through at all with this paper.  The artwork is so gorgeous.  My daughter keeps finding things hidden in the pages.  I'm looking at the whole thing and my Rainbow Girl is finding the most wonderful teeny tiny things within the artwork.  You have to get this book.  It makes all of the others hide their faces in shame.  The only con - I wish it were mine.
Amazing. I purchased these coloring books for relaxing time and the illustrations are detailed and fun to color.
This is, without a doubt, one of the best coloring books ever.  I will use it for embroidery ideas.  Super book.
This is an absolutely beautiful book and nice for any adult who still likes to color. The designs are beautiful.
I just received this item yesterday and I love it! I ordered pastel colored pencils to go along with it but they haven't come in yet, so I've been using regular colored pencils and they work well enough. I love the texture of the sheets; they are similar to those of a sketch pad. I was also surprised by the amount of drawings there were and the quality of each one. They are beautiful in black and white alone. I don't think my coloring can do them justice. I was kind of turned off by the sketch your own drawings part but I quickly began to like it. It's kind of fun doodling all over the pages and having some guidance in the process. I definitely recommend this purchase. I am going to get another one for my mother, she will love this book as much as I do. This book is really great for women of all ages.
I didn't expect the designs to be so tiny. They are a challenge to color, but the designs are clever.
Hours and hours of coloring ahead! Beautiful doodles printed on thick pages makes for a very high-quality book.
I got 'Enchanted Forest' for myself and 'Secret Garden' for my bff and we had a wonderful time coloring and visiting!  These are quality books--and the first time I have ever purchased adult coloring books.  So much fun and I love the detail.  Enchanted Forest has more of a 'woodsy' theme and a bit more 'manly' but still very detailed.  This book has more flowers and is more 'girly'.  The pair would be great for 'couples' coloring, I think.  These books are great because they are detailed enough to have to concentrate and therefore they take your mind off 'the real world' for awhile.  You can just color bits and pieces at a time too, so they are great for just taking a short 'time out'. Great stress relief and you can be artistic with colors and shading, etc., without having to think too hard :)
I love this book but I believe the artwork lacks in variety a little. The same flowers and leaves can be found over and over again throughout the entire book. Yes they are in different arrangements page by page but there is very little variety in the actual look of the flowers as I have found in other books. I personally get frustrated seeing/coloring the same design over and over again. Another issue I have is that I use colored pencils and they do tend to rub off on the previous page when coloring on the page behind it. I also wouldn't suggest using markers with this book, the nature of the paper will make it bleed through to the other side of the page and the pictures are printed back to back. Other than that, I do enjoy my time spent coloring in this "adult coloring book"
I just love it love it love it!!! I started painting and I'm having so much fun. Feeling like a child <3
What a fun coloring book! As a mom, I've had the chance to color for years with my kids, but this book is so perfect because it's made for older children and adults. Its full of so may wonderful pictures to choose from. There are pictures that are more detailed and also pages that are a little more simple to color, great for when I want something a little less time consuming. What a fun way to relax, and my older children can help me so we still get to color together. The only downside I can see is its front and back pictures, so if I use the wrong kind of markers, they bleed through. I've been using colored pencils and not had any problems at all. I can see many more relaxing days with the book!<br/>I received this book free for my honest review, all opinions are my own.
Yayyyy! It finally came! I've started coloring my first picture in it and absolutely love it! Before receiving it and reading all the reviews about the disappointment of the drawings being difficult because of the book spine I was expecting to have to use my pen knife to cut each page out of the book like I do with my other adult coloring books (I put all my finished pages in a binder). However, the pages actually lay flat enough to not be a problem and I will keep it in its book form which I'm very pleased about since it's such a pretty book. I can't sketch well enough so will be lending my book to an artistic friend who will fill in the art for me and I will buy her her own Secret Garden in thanks. I can't wait to get Ms Basford's other two books and will pre-order them!
High paper quality, fine detailed drawings and there is space for creating your own drawings and creations.
This book is awesome, it's almost emditative to color in all the small objects. I recommend using gel pens.
Waited months for this to arrive. Rather disappointed. Lots of leaves. Just not that engaging of drawings.
I am greatly enjoying this coloring book.  It is the first "adult" coloring book that I have used.  The drawings are beautiful and challenging.  In fact,  I stared at the drawings for days, a bit overwhelmed at the detail but once I put aside my fear I really find it relaxing.  The one thing that I would change (which would increase the price of the book) is that they the publisher not double side the pictures.  I have been using Prismacolor markers and they have bled through which makes it impossible to use have the book.  I would gladly pay double the price if the pictures were one side.  Oh, I might also make them be spiral bound so that I could remove only one picture when traveling instead of carrying the whole book.  But otherwise a joy to use.
This is a great book!  The only reason why it has 4 starts and not 5 is because I can't color without my glasses.  But if you want to relax after a long hard day, this is the way.  Spend half an hour or an hour coloring and all your thinking about is which gel pen to  use or what color would look good.  There is also areas on pages where you can put your own design or draw a little animal.  I am a senior and I read that this was good for the mind.  Doesn't seem to be hurting.  Sleeping better since doing this before going to bed.  I also bought the Fiskars Gel Pen 48-Set.  So much to choose from, but ereally works much better then pencils.  Colors are vibrant as they should be in a garden.  And I can have any color flower I want.  Certainly worth the buy.
As a person who loves coloring this treasure hunt and coloring book is perfect for teens and adults. If you love coloring but you want something a little bit more older than the children's coloring books out there , this is the perfect book for you. I find coloring to be quite therapeutic. I love searching for the different items listed and then coloring the beautiful pages in this book. There is something so soothing when you are picking up different colored pencils and coloring in different areas in the black and white pages in this book. I find this book appropriate for preteens all the way to adulthood. I highly recommend buying this book and coloring your heart out. This book was provided free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review
I am absolutely in love with this coloring book. It's a charming adventure that just is incredible to me. I'm not sure if I like the drawings better in black and white or in color. Coloring this book relaxes me and even helps me mentally I believe. The ink pens I'm using do not bleed through the thick paper at all, and the amount of details in these drawings is so beautiful.<br/><br/>I also LOVE the fact that the author made the cover, the back cover, the protective sleeve (both the outside and the inside), the inside covers, the title page, and the name page ALSO able to be colored in. You are getting more than what you're paying for, and that's rare. This book has instantly become one of my most prized possessions. Absolutely beautiful.
This coloring book is beautiful.<br/>Some months ago I had purchased another coloring book for adults from Amazon, only to be disappointed by it. Not by the drawings themselves, really, but by how poorly they were rendered into the book. The lines were often so thick that there was hardly but a tiny dot of white space to color in.<br/>I read a review about Johanna Basford's work on another website, and the drawings immediately captured my attention. So of course, I headed right to Amazon to seek out her work. After "flipping" through the pages, I selected to buy this book. Though it was out of stock so I had to wait a few weeks. It's gorgeous. The images are wonderful. They capture the imagination and allow the creativity to flow.<br/><br/>Something to note: I'm reading about bleed-through in some of the other reviews. I haven't used markers in mine, not sure if I'd chance it. But I'm using colored pencils (Prismacolor to be specific) and they are working beautifully in bringing the drawings to life. Because you can blend colors so much better with colored pencil, it allows for more creativity. And, the Prismacolor are my very first set of that brand, as they are quite expensive. However, it's like coloring with butter-they are the smoothest, richest colored pencils I've ever used. So if you're really wanting to get artistic with this book, I recommend investing in some Prismacolor if you can. This is the set I have-simple 12 colors but blending and layering makes more colors.<br/>http://www.amazon.com/Prismacolor-Premier-Colored-Woodcase-Assorted/dp/B00006IEET/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid;=1428460776&sr;=8-11&keywords;=Prismacolor
The Secret Garden: An Inky Treasure Hunt and Coloring Book” is absolutely delightful!  The drawings are so beautiful and intricate, it forces me to focus only on coloring – and all tension just melts away.  I love that the drawings are mixed styles, from geometric designs to quaint scenes, and the instructions on some pages offer inspiration for people to go further than the printed drawing.  So far, I have not had any issues with bleed-through like some of the other reviewers.  Since I only use colored pencils, and have a light touch, none of the pages have torn (so far).  I would highly recommend this book to adults everywhere!<br/><br/>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
I simply adore this book. It's pretty and so detailed and keeps me busy for hours. It's cool how meditative it can be to sit for a few hours and color in this awesome book. I use both fine point pens and colored pencils and haven't experienced any problems with bleeding through. In fact, my first thought when I received my copy, was how think and high quality the paper it's made with is. I like that there's a variety of things to draw- animals, insects, flowers, trees. Some are large, some are small, every page is entertaining.<br/><br/>My friends and family have seen me enjoy it so much, they're asking for their own as birthday presents!
I have given these for gifts and finally have one of my own. To have something this lovely to lay color down on is a wonderful way to spend time. Adults should color more. But we haven't had much choice in excellent material until now. Coloring is meditative, calming, relaxing, and actually promotes creative thinking. If you write - try it - get momentum and fresh ideas. Your brain takes flight while your hands are playing effortlessly with colors prompting thoughts and images. I've pre-ordered Johanna's next book - can't wait to get it. She is talentend and brings a childlike enchantment to us grownups and let's us go there with her. Indulge in a good quality set of fine tip colored markers and pencils. Enjoy.
This book with a glass of wine makes for a great relaxing evening after the kids are in bed. Love.
LOVELY Book! It's a shame that we are limited, because of bleed through, as to the choice of coloring implements. I've personally bought 3 copies, JUST so I can color each and every page. I had to get a 3 copies by chance, because Amazon never did send them to me. After the 3rd copy purchase, of each book, I cancelled the Amazon order. I think that in the interest of being fair and doing something for the people who bought these books, it would be wonderful if you could purchase a PDF file version of the book. It could be set up so that you have to verify that you actually OWN the books. It would go a long way to make up for the limit in coloring implements and the bleed through if you use the wrong things.
I'd heard that Secret Garden was the book that started the "adult coloring" trend and so, wanting to try it out myself, I figured I should start with the best. Each page of the book is full of the most intricately detailed illustrations, it's really beautiful. The designs are so tiny, working on coloring the book becomes a very engrossing, almost methodical process. As I work through each page, I find more and more tiny whimsical touches placed there by the illustrator - little mushrooms, snails, etc. It's so charming! I'm not sure I'll ever actually complete the whole book (there's just so much to color!) but I already can't wait to check out Johanna Basford's upcoming book, Lost Ocean.
Bought this for my wife. She will literally shut herself in a spare bedroom and color for hours.
I have found my new meditation!  I can get lost in this book for hours.  I do believe I have solved nearly all of the world's problems whilst coloring.  Now if I can just get the world to listen to me....  However, I must warn you that you will find a new obsession..... trying to find the BEST coloring pencils.  I started with a 12-pack of colored pencils and quickly graduated to the 24-pack... however, I have my eye on a set of pencils that will cost me more than this book did.  Sigh.  And so the web we weave gets more complicated.  I may have to meditate.  Oh wait, I'll color!  If you like coloring, but just can't wrap your head around princesses or warrior turtles, this is the book for you.
This is an absolutely beautiful book full of gorgeous pictures to color but................the pictures are very very small so even with reading glasses on, its a bit tough to work through.  I purchased the Verithin pencils to work with and they do work very well and I can't imagine using even a very fine tip marker/pen.  For those of you who are using Sharpies, more power to you!  I imagine the color is more vibrant with the markers but those of us at an age where reading glasses are a must, I can imagine a lot of coloring outside the lines with a marker.  All in all, it's a very enjoyable pass time - especially for those of us that loved to color when we were young (or adults with our kids).
I love this coloring book! The images are intricateand engrossing. Paper does not bleed and 98% of images lay completely flat. Unlike the "Color Therapy Coloring Book" series, they are also completely blank so you don't have to fit anyone's color scheme but your own or pay for a book someone rlse has colored half of before it arrives.<br/><br/>I use to focusand empty my mind of daily stressors. I recommend it to clients to help with anxiety, racing thoughts, or as a distraction during difficult phone or video chats. Sometimes I use the postcard sized ones to give people after a hard therapy session as  post session cool down. They are awesome and everyone gives grat feedback.
Recently I took up "doodling" and was running out of subject matter and ideas.  This book is a work of heartfelt art and absolutely gorgeous!  If you need ideas, want inspiration or have a need or want an outlet for artistic expression.  This book is for you.  The lines are simple yet powerful in it's delivery.  If you can't draw, if you can draw, this book will have you itching to find pen, pencil and paper to try your hand at the designs.  Any of these designs or combination of mixed designs can be used in almost any crafting project.  Cards, clothing, jewelry, quilting, embroidery, painting, decorating a home.....it goes on and on.  It will get your creative juices churning!
I recently bought a bunch of coloring books thanks to a recommendation by my therapist for anxiety and stress, and I have to say that this one is my favorite. Lots of complex designs that work well with colored pencils. All the designs are lovely and can keep you occupied for hours! There are even activities for you to complete if you're artistically inclined! The book has lots of pages, lots of different designs, and so much to keep you occupied. The quality of the book is quite substantial, too. I definitely would recommend this for anyone who loves or is interested in coloring! You won't be disappointed.
This is the most beautiful art work! I really love it.<br/><br/>You can color everything, including the cover, the back, and the inside and outside of the dust jacket.<br/><br/>The paper is a great quality. It is nice and thick. The pictures are on the front and back of each page. If you are careful, and use some of the pages in the back as test paper, you can see if your pens will bleed through or not. I have some pens that bleed and some that don't. Colored pencils are great! I have a blending pencil that works wonderfully on this paper.<br/><br/>I will purchase more color books from Johanna Basford. Her artwork is so lovely. It is exactly my style and what I was looking for.
This is a very interesting coloring book.  It will give you hours of entertainment.  Not only can you color the cover of the coloring book and the pages within, but the author also invites you to add finishing touches to some of the pages.  There are a few pages that have mazes on them.  The drawings are small and very intricate.  The paper is thick so you don't have to worry about the ink bleeding through the pages.  I used markers and gel pens to color with.  I had to watch to make sure that the gel pen items that I colored had time to dry or else I would end up with smudged designs.<br/>Disclaimer:  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
Pretty neat coloring book. Pretty expensive, too, since the market is now saturated with them.
This is an absolutely beautiful book! I CANNOT believe it's only $11! It's not like a cheap coloring book. It's something that can sit on your coffee table. It's so beautiful! You can't color in it with markers because it's double sided but colored pencils work perfectly. Even the cover page is exquisite. There's room to doodle around her drawings and fill in empty spots. I thought I was getting a nice coloring book but this is a keepsake! I will be ordering her Enchanted Forest TODAY! And both Erik sit on my coffee table for everyone to look at. It was with the wait whole out of stock (which really was only a couple weeks anyway). I totally love it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!
This is a very awesome coloring book that is great for older kids as well as adults. There are tons of different pages so you will never be coloring the same thing twice. Make sure to grab yourself a great set of color pencils! At least 48 different colors that way you can make each page pop. My wife has been coloring away and we plan to remove the best ones from the book and put them in picture frames to hang around the house. I feel the cost is pretty fair because these aren't just your basic shapes. The author took time to design each and every page. I can't wait for a second edition to come out. This would make a great gift for anyone who likes to color!
This book is absolutely gorgeous, way more beautiful than I expected it to be. Not only are there lovely doodles on every page, but the inside and outside of the dust jacket can be colored, as well as the cover of the book itself. The designs are crisply printed and clear. They're printed on both sides of the page, so I'm using colored pencils instead of markers or pens. The paper isn't overly thick so I'm using a few sheets of cardstock behind the page I'm coloring just so I don't get marks/indentations on the following page(s). And I like the idea of being able to add some doodles of my own. This is a very pretty book, and I would highly recommend it.
This review is for different types of these books, as I bought many.<br/>Mom is on hospice, and was very artistic most of her life.  She can no longer paint, but the creativity is still there.  Now she can let that out with these products.  I bought many types of these books and she loves loves them all.  I do not worry if in some of the books the pages do not tear out, that is not why I bought them.  All the pictures have excellent clear lines for her to color.  You can click my name and see the different ones I bought for her.  By the way the fiskar pens are excellent for all the books we bought, the pencils have not arrived yet, they come today.
I can't add anything to what has already been said about this book. Love the artists style, wish the pages were one sided because it limits what you can use to color with as markers bleed through and some of the pictures details are fine enough that a marker is really the best thing to use.  Just copy the other side you say?  Well, the paper is too wide for my printer at home.  That being said, the book is a great value. Heavy off white paper, lots to color. I've seen many other books out there that are more expensive and not nearly as well done or with as many pages as this one. Don't let the double sided printing stop you from getting this book.
Very nice & detailed designs. I took this book on vacation this week. I need to get better colored pencils. I have the Staedler ultra fine markers but didn't like the way they worked. I'm going to purchase the prismacolor pencils recommended by another poster. I also read where the designs on both sides were an issue. I didn't find that since I'm using pencils. One thing though (something annoying really) the pictures into the binding crease of the book. Other than using a marker to get into the detail, the pencil was tough to reach. I still enjoyed. When others look at the pictures they're not pushing the book open as much as I did to color it.
Why didn't I think of adult coloring books! (Wait, I did. Several years ago. Everyone laughed at me ;)<br/><br/>Anyway, this one is truly special. Such high quality you feel a little guilty drawing in it.  I use colored pencils, learning shading techniques and I also don't want to take the chance of messing up even a single page.  Several pages offer suggestions of expanding on picture by adding your own drawings of birds, flowers, etc. I get lost in the pages for hours. I have several coloring books because any subject that you have interest in, you can probably find a coloring book on but this one is my most treasured. Worth the price.
Beautiful book.  The quality of the paper is excellent....no leaks through to the back.
Coloring Book for adults ?? Who knew. I go into a trance when I'm coloring.  Go figure.
My grandmother had purchased this book from Barnes and Noble a while back and had it on her counter. I don't think she realized that it was a book to be colored, so she was somewhat bummed about it. I, however, found it quite grande after flipping through it. The price is low, the fun is high, and the pictures inside are wonderful! The things to be colored are a little bit on the small side, so I don't think I would recommend this for children, although it is a sort of puzzle book in the "Where's Waldo?" sort of way.I bought this for a friend and I intend to get myself one to practice my pencil work in the near future.
I am really enjoying this book. It was back ordered for so long and it made it even better when I finally received it I love how my markers and gel pens don't bleed through and the fact that you can open the book up and actually lay it flat. My only 2 complaints are that you can't easily tear the pages out (if you wanted to frame them or something) and I really wish that there weren't spaces for me to draw my own stuff. The main reason that I got this book is because I can't draw, but like to be creative. I would recommend this to anyone who likes detail oriented stuff. It really is a great time killer and is a lot of fun
Beautiful drawings.  We love it!  I got this for my youngest daughter who will be 11 soon.  She absolutely adores it!  She is taking her time and really coloring the pages beautifully.  She doesn't use markers, but colored pencils and gel pens (she was thrilled when I found a gold glitter gel pen and she uses that for the keys, garden gate handles, and locks).  She loves the book so much that when she is finally finished she wants another one so she can start all over.  My oldest daughter (age 21) likes it so much that she wants one now too.  We haven't had any problems with the paper...we think the quality if just fine.
I have had so much entertainment from this and I'm not even halfway through!<br/><br/>This was a personal item I felt would come in handy for my days of stress, anxiety, and sadness. Basically I play my iPod and sit down to color. The best part about this to me is the extra punch that let's the pages become a "search and find" which I happen to be a sucker for.<br/><br/>I don't know, it's just that having alone time with a cup of tea and the dog sleeping beside me I find myself very relaxed and content sitting down to create pretty pictures of a fantasy world even on the most dreadful of rainy days :]
This is a book of beautiful illustrations and printed on quality paper that is tinted an ecru color that sets off the coloring in a lovely fashion.  But I will unfortunately not be buying any more books by this artist because the illustrations are printed on both the front and back of each page.  For colorists that wish to frame their work, it means choosing between two illustrations.  Better to have fewer illustrations and only one illustration per page.  At least that is my feeling.  Hope the publishers will rethink their decision on how these books are printed as I wish I could purchase more from this artist.
Beautiful and fun to color in for hours! Can even use shiny gel pens too!
This book is exquisite!  I paid less for it than others with half the pages and no where close to the art that graces these pages. Perhaps the publisher has changed the paper that others have complained about, as I would never describe this as 'thin' paper. I've tested my Tombow markers on it and there is no bleed through at all. And I don't mind having it printed on both sides if that means more of Johanna's amazing art is included. The book itself has a thick cover that is beautifully illustrated - and there is also a gorgeous book jacket. I am thrilled with this purchase ... and just ordered a second copy.
This coloring book is incredible. The tiny details and patterns are mesmerizing. You almost hate to color it for fear of messing it up! I had hoped to use the book for relaxing, but I have found it to be a little tedious, simply because of the vast amount of things that need to be colored. (If you feel overwhelmed at the whole book, check out the companion postcard set... same design, but smaller scale and easier to tackle.) Four stars because most pens and markers will bleed through the page, which is a bummer because you really need the precision of a fine point marker over a pencil for the finer details.
This one asks  for  little artistic ability where you draw in parts of the picture.
This book is excellent quality. If you've looked through the sample images you know the illustrations are gorgeous, so I'm not going to talk about that, but what I do want to comment on is the overall quality of the book. The illustrations are printed on heavy paper, thick enough that you can use normal markers, (READ: NOT Sharpies), or even, perhaps, watercolors, and not bleed through or ruin the paper. The pages fold down so you can color easily all the way to the crease. I am very please. I have purchased other coloring books that were not printed on as high quality of paper so this was a nice change.
Excellent, intricate coloring book.  The pages are 10x10, so if you are like me and prefer to copy your pages to color them multiple times, or put them on card stock...it is not easy by any means.<br/><br/>Pages are double sided, and though they are thicker than average coloring book pages, they are NOT thick enough to color with markers like Sharpies. The book is excellent for gel pens (don't close the pages before they dry!), colored pencils, and fineliner pens!  Also, I received mine from Amazon within a month of ordering it, even though it was on backorder/out of stock. So don't let that deter you!
I wish I could give this more stars. I love this coloring book. It's great for adults that love to color. It is so hard to find something as an adult to color that doesn't have kid activities in the pages. This is great. I own both of her coloring books and don't regret it. However, you probably don't want to use markers. The pages are not thick enough to use ink based media without it bleeding. I used colored pencils and it works just as good. However I do sort of wish the pages were thicker so I could have used markers. In either case this is great for Adults or even children looking for a challenge.
SO much better than expected.  Very well thought out book.  The pages are thick so you do not indent even the other side.  The binding is sewn so that you can bend it harshly without losing papers or harming the book.  The cover has a dust jacket which has intricate coloring across the entire inside.  The actual cover is brown and also has coloring on it.  I was so pleased with the book itself.  I have had the book for a a couple months and still have not finished my first page working on it while watching tv and during lunch at work.  It will provide fun for a long time to come.  Relaxing themes.
Although the images are FANTASTIC, the paper this book is printed on is not good. The only way to color in this book is to use colored pencils or crayons. The paper has a feel of standard construction paper and any type of ink bleeds through to the other side and inside the image. Also, the images run into the binding. I love a good two-page picture, but a margin should be included so the whole thing can be colored. I wish this was printed on heavier paper and one-sided so I could remove the pages and hang them up.
Lovely pictures to color BUT should be in different format. Maybe a spiral bind!
After purchasing another book that was more abstract patterns and another vintage nature books of flora and fauna I was looking forward to this. Some of the designs are really cute and fun and some require more creativity than what I am looking for, so for that reason this seems to be more of an activity book.  The pages are double sided so I don't understand how you are meant to use ink, I use pencils so not a huge deal. Also the pages are perforated, all of the other books that I have seen or used have perforated edges. Finally the quality of the paper is a little flimsy.
This book is awesome! I love to color to relax and escape the stress of everyday life. It is very durable and you can also use makers or pens without the worry of bleeding through onto the next page. I cannot wait to order more from Johanna Basford. The pictures inside are very detailed and are based around garden life. There is also a hide and seek option within the book and has all the answers in the back! So if you're looking for a healthy alternative to escaping everyday life; Here is your route! I would recommend this to absolutely everyone 13+ years or older!
Better if  pictures was printed only on one to prevent markers from bleeding.
I started embroidering as a child and did very little as an adult until recently when I wanted to be with people in away from work. I joined a redwork embroidery class and found this book while looking for more information and thought it would be fun. It is all of that and more. While I have not allowed myself to color in it yet I think it would be great fun during conferences or meetings where one must pay attention and not distract the speaker as so many do with cell phones. I have used a few of the many designs in my embroidery and find this a fun resource.
I love it! An absolutely amazing book. Each page is a new world to discover!
Wish the pages were perforated so they could be easily torn out of the book.
Our community is embracing the adult coloring movement so I decided to join in. I looked around online for sample pages to try and was unimpressed by what I found (well, they were free, so. . .) I bought Secret Garden because a friend raved about it and the book was exactly what she said it would be. The pages are gorgeous, the detail just right size, there's a hidden surprise every now and then. . .and the paper looks like a good weight for markers and pens. Secret Garden will be my soothing retreat for the next six months. I'm VERY happy with it!
This book is so beautiful. I was enchanted the moment I received it. The only problem I have is the same as most everyone else's -- I want to use pens or markers, but they bleed through and ruin the other side of the pages. I know I could use colored pencils, but I just don't like them. They are dull and lifeless compared to pens. I tried Stabilo pens and a very light hand to no avail. Next I will try gel pens as some reviews suggested they work. I definitely would have paid more for the book in order to have thicker pages so that I could use pens.
Really beautiful designs. I use color pencils, but the paper feels thick enough to use markers as well. I do wish that there weren't those pages where she has written instructions for us to draw things in ourselves…but I knew about those pages before I bought it and there are only a few of those.<br/><br/>Took off one star because I wish that the pictures were printed on one side of the page, not both sides. Again, I knew this before I purchased it, but I didn't anticipate how much I'd want to tear out some of these designs and display them. :(
This book, uncolored, is beautiful. When I colored in some of the pages it was even more beautiful! I am thoroughly impressed with all of the designs and pictures inside. I find this book to be a great stress reliever. If I am ever upset, angry or super stressed out I can almost guarantee that I will feel better after coloring in this book for a bit. It's therapeutic, really. I plan on buying one for my sister because she is really in to this sort of thing.<br/><br/>I received it for free in exchange for my review, but all opinions are my own.
This is a great companion book if you have Enchanted Forest.  For me, there are too many pages that allow you to draw your own design to finish out the page.  I didn't enjoy this as much, but you might if you are very talented.  As always, there are creatures to find on each page, and that is fun.  Nice paper, but even fine markers can bleed through to the back side.  Every page has another drawing on the back side, so be careful, or you'll ruin it with the bleed through.  Overall, it's not as detailed as the Enchanted Forest, but I did like it.
great coloring book for killing time and keeping your minds off of things.
I truly hate to give this a 5 star rating because everyone will want one!!  ( I want to be the only one is town that has it)This is an adult coloring book.  Very detailed and beautiful pictures.  Do not use sharpie type markers, will bleed through.  Use gel pens or colored pencils or both!  This book is one you will want to leave out on the coffee table and everyone that see's it will page through it and think every page is a work of art.  LOVE IT.  There is one more from this artist that is just as good and her 3rd one will be out in October.
I really am enjoying this coloring book. Shipping took over a month but well worth it I think. Will probably buy as a gift. The only thing I personally don't care for is the amount of "green" things are in the book. A lot of pages are all leaves or green plants and I know you can color things whatever you want I'm just someone who wants to use the color on the flowers. There is also a few pages where you can draw in things and really make it your own. I probably won't be doing those pages since I can't draw but still a neat concept.
The book itself it's very nice, but unfortunately it looks old, in the middle of all the pages of the book looks yellow more yellow that the rest of the page, this was for a gift and I now can't send this to this person. I received 2 books with the same issue, could be the warehouse where you keep it or I don't know, but this kills the thrill of open book.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed with this, because I really like this books, but for now I won't buy any of your books for this reason. I attached an image that I took from the book.
Love this book! I actually bought both this one and the Enchanted Forest. I'm using colored pencils for this one and having no issues, but I will say that I also feel totally confident that I could use markers and have no issues either. (Due to the fact that I'm using quality brush-tip markers in the other book and nothing bleeds through.) This is a fabulously relaxing bookmto color but it definitely requires some fine motor skills. Younger children who lack well-developed fine motor skills are going to find this too detailed to color.
Great book for those who love to color, even though they may only be young at heart! :-) I received my book and was excited to find that it was even better than I was expecting. There are a lot of different themes within the pages, from fish and owls, to exotic flowers and nature scenes. The pictures and fun and detailed but not so much that it is overwhelming. I've been using the Fiskars Gel Pens, and they seem to work perfectly. Colored pencils would also work, but I'd stay away from markers of any kind. Hours of enjoyment ahead!
I found adult coloring books from a friend.  I have totally enjoyed this book. My daughter stole the Enchanted Forrest book, so I'm working my way through this book and having fun.  Not only are there beautiful drawings to color, there is a treasure hunt, on each page is bugs, birds, butterflies or keys, etc. to look for.  There are some blank spaces to add your own doodles, not that Icould come close to the talent of Johanna, but maybe I will try.  I use Crayola or Prang pencils while I save up for a set of Prismacolors.  Enjoy!
For the doodlers out there, this coloring book is great even for adults. Teens as well would enjoy this. I find it very relaxing and an easy way to pass time when I am fidgety and anxious. I read the other reviewers note about the pages being absorbent and mine were as well, so I went with the suggestion and bought verithin colored pencils and gel pens to color with. I do still sometimes just color with pencil if I am out without my coloring tools.
wonderful and fun pictures with lots of details. Love this to destress.
It is beautiful . When  I am doing this, I feel confutable and peaceful
This is a beautiful coloring book, full of little puzzles and tiny details. I bought one for myself to test out whether my nieces could handle it. I think it is a little too detailed for the 6yo, but the 8yo is probably careful enough for it. The pictures are interesting, with many kinds of plants and patterns. The paper is thick enough to handle light to medium marker use, but I did have a little marker bleed through. You would definitely want fine-tipped markers. It would work with pencil, for sure. Highly recommended.
I bought this book for my 18-year-old daughter at college.  She likes to color when she's relaxing.  She got a set of 48 gel pens with it.  The "drawings" she has created are spectacular.  Many of her friends have asked me where they can get this book too.  Even the artist in residence at her school was impressed.<br/>However, many of the spaces are VERY small, this is NOT a book for young children.  I wouldn't buy it for anyone under 13 or so.  It's just too small, and takes too much time to complete one page.
Really a good way to unwind, spend your time on something creative and personal on incredible floral designs. I would agree with other reviewers on the back-to-back illustrations which make mounting a difficult decision. I used the Prisma colored pencils so there isn't a bleeding problem. I looked extensively on what type of book to get and specifically on floral garden illustrations which have elegance,  detailed and traditional in style. Very happy with this purchase and look forward each time I begin to be creative.
What I have wanted for years, my only dissapointment is the author only has the one color book. The cover is remove able, colorable, including every inch of this book. Also you can add to some of the pages your own doodle. I'll be coloring this for a year or more. Absolutely gorgeous!!!  The best medium to color this with is colored pencils, if you can't afford the best, costwise Crayola is the best, smooth, deep , clean blend able! I have tried the 4 other brands in the affordable price range and crayola is...TheBEST
Love this book one of my favorites =D I would recommend it to everyone
This is MOMMY's COLORING BOOK!! I keep it on a high shelf and really only pull it down when I feel myself needing some mind-clearing time. I can get lost for an hour coloring the many beautiul designs in this book. I picked one up at Barns & Nobel in the summer of 2014 and have since bought several for gifts for loved ones. Highly recommend.<br/><br/>I usually give a box of ultra fine-tip pens along with the book. At home my daugher allows me to use her giant wheel of paint pens that we purchased from Costco :)
So wonderful. This is a gorgeous book. It will take months to color it all and it is so wonderful. I plan on using prismacolor colored pencils because that is what the majority of people seemed to use, but I may pick up a few of the fine point sharpies and just try and see if I like the look. It really is a lovely book and I plan on purchasing the others by this author. Every inch is blank and waiting for creativity to blossom and it requires a lot of detail and attention. I look forward to hours of coloring fun!
Amazon shows that when you click on 5 stars that indicates that you "love" it.  Well, I tried to click on 6 stars because this has been one of my most favorite thing that I have purchased in a LONG time!  I am an "adult" but I love to color for relaxation and this book is perfect for this purpose!  I can't wait to get it finished so I can put it up as a memory~I'll need to do one more for a memory for the other daughter!!  Love it!  If you love to color this Secret Garden is the garden for you!
All I can say is amazing. I bought this along with two other adult coloring books for my mother's birthday. After looking at it I decided to get my mother some better coloring pencils too (I had bought her the Crayola 152 set so added 100 coloring pencils to it also) and decided I might pick up a copy of this book myself. The ink work is incredible and each page will probably take hours, maybe even days, to complete. Definitely not a book you'd give to a young child unless he/she is a coloring prodigy.
Thrilled with the many many pages and the beautiful cover, wasn't expecting either to be so grand, so that was a nice surprise! I have only used colored pencils thus far but was wondering if anyone had found or used a marker they liked that didn't bleed through the pages or if there is such a thing? I'd love to find out just for another means of coloring. It's totally relaxing to zone out and color in those details and the finished results are Beautiful!! You feel like you accomplished something :).
I really liked this book. It is great to have a nice task to do as an adult to relax. Coloring is a relaxing activity and allows you to relax your mind.  I wasn't as interested in searching for the objects as just enjoying coloring the pictures.  I don't get much free time with kids running around but even having five minutes to color in this book was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I received this product in exchange for an honest review.  I was given no instruction and all opinions stated are my own.
LOVE this coloring book. It's very pretty and super relaxing. I work in an office and I color it every day for 1 hour on my lunch break. I look forward to coloring it all day, it keeps me going when my job is busy and stressful, then in the afternoon after I come back inside from the breakroom and coloring, I feel mentally refreshed and ready to concentrate on my work again. It's like a form of active meditation for me. Love  this book and the pictures and can't wait for the new one to come out!
Beautiful pictures to color. Worth the time and money for the book.
Disclosure: I did receive a free copy for review purposes. This does not impact my review as it is my honest opinion.<br/>I really loved this coloring book. I had heard that coloring for adults is therapeutic and found out that it really is. It is so relaxing taking time to myself and doing something that I enjoy. The book has some beautiful picture to color and get imaginative with. I definitely recommend it because it is a wonderful book. I did not even know I could be so creative until now.
Love this book! I have an emotionally challenging job and was looking for a way to unwind mindlessly! This is a great way to pass the time and clear your mind while still being creative! I'm no artist so I just use a simple Crayola 24 pack of colored pencils. I'm sure a better quality pencil or pen would go a long way. My only complaint is that some of the images are so small that I can hardly stay in the lines! Maybe my fine motor skills need some work! I think this would make a great gift!
I purchased this for my adult daughter as a stress reliever.  She is the mother of 3 beautiful young children and is also battling a severe autoimmune disease that she was struck with 1 1/2 years ago.  This has been absolutely wonderful for her.  She sometimes colors alone and at other times, she gathers her children and they all color together.<br/><br/>She loves the pictures and the detail found in this book.<br/><br/>I will purchase more of these types of books for her in the future.
SAY WHATTTT. this book started it all. I saw this book after looking through other coloring books and HAD to have it. Once I received it I was so excited about it that I haven't really put it down. There are so many pages and detail. I love this artist. She takes her time and makes beautiful and intricate masterpieces. I bought "Enchanted Forest" and will be getting that today. Cant wait to play with that one. My friends and family want these  now and I am buying more as presents.
I waited and waited and waited AND WAITED for this to arrive. After several backorders and delayed shipments, it finally arrived! I marveled over each page. There was a small part of me that didn't even want to color any of it because it is absolutely perfect as is. The details are intricate and beautiful, and there are even spaces for you to add your own designs. Just looking at the cover makes me ridiculously happy, and I am 40 years old. Needless to say, it was well worth the wait.
Although I'm tempted by it, this purchase will be a gift for a special someone this holiday season and it is fun to anticipate their delight.  Because this one IS delightful.  I first purchased The Time Chamber which I think is similar in overall packaging, storytelling element, colorable covers, etc. and while that one is a pleasure, this one looks even better.  Both have thicker paper and just a nice sturdiness to them.  Full of whimsy.  Maybe I'll find one under the tree myself...
The paper is a good quality, but the pages are printed on both sides so if you would like to display one you have to give up whatever is on the back. I don't see the need for the pages at the back showing which insects or animals are in the pictures or for the mazes. Coloring the masses of leaves on the mazes doesn't appeal.  If I wanted to solve mazes ( and these were easy), I would have bought a puzzle book.  That said, because of the quality of the paper, this is a good choice.
Love this. I've down a coup pages and am now experimenting with colors. Like all dark "night" feel, all pastels, rainbow effect going across the page. I want to attempt striping colors. I just like playing with it.  Each page is HOURS and HOURS of relaxation time and just being alone with my thoughts or listening to music, audio book, radio, a Bible reading... Good therapy. I've given this with a pack of gel pens as gifts too to my creative friends and it is well received.
I received this yesterday, and went out and bought some colored pencils. I colored my first page today, and it turned out really nice. I love the pictures. I will definitely need to invest in some nicer pencils now. :-)<br/>The paper seems nice weight to me. Not too thin. The book is PACKED with things to color. Even the cover/flaps/inside of flaps could be colored. Today, I colored the "This book belongs to..." page.<br/>I think it will keep me busy for awhile!
This truly is a beautiful book. What an incredible artist! I wish I would have read more of the reviews though...I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why pictures were printed on both sides of the paper!!! I like to color with markers and gel pens, not just pencils, and there is bleed through. Even if it doesn't bleed all the way through, you can still see it through the paper. It doesn't make sense to me. I wish I could give it more stars because it's a lovely book.
This a beautiful drawn and inked book, full of lovely designs to color. But, like many others, I was disappointed with the practicality of the book. While it will be nice to have an anthology of my coloring, I was hoping to copy the pages to color for easy display. This is tricky with a bound book. I would prefer a spiral bound book or perforated pages. However, Ms. Basford has created postcards and notecards to color, and I will be enjoying those soon once they arrive.
This book is formatted similarly to The Time Garden, the dust jacket and covers are all colorable. There are intricate images and beautifully delicate pictures. This one even has little blurbs suggesting how to fill in blank areas or cute ideas to add to the pictures beyond coloring. Although I liked the ideas, part of me wishes the suggestions were somehow removable or weren't in the middle of some of the images because they are absolutely gorgeous pictures to color.
Waiting for 2 months for shipment. But it is worth of the wait!
We purchased this for our 6 year old daughter's birthday. It's definitely an advanced coloring book for that age, but she loves it. She works on a section of one page, then moves onto another page, etc... Eventually I imagine she will complete a few pages but in the mean time she really enjoys slowly chipping away at this book. She uses Staedtler fine tipped markers and loves them for this book.  The pages are thick enough that you don't really get any bleed-through.
I love this book. Received it as a gift for my 50th birthday. I also love to use prismacolor premier pencils with it. They are a little pricey, but are soft enough to blend, yet firm enough to sharpen to a tiny point that is needed for this book. My only complaint is I wish the designs were one sided. I would gladly pay another $5 to have the designs only be on one side of each page. I gave it 5 stars because I would only take a way half a star for my one complaint.
I stumbled upon this book at an upscale book shop and HAD to have it. I am so enjoying coloring in Basford's gorgeous drawings of whimsical gardens, but I realize now I need to invest in a good set of pens with lots of colors! As I color, I'm thinking of the people in my life who would love this just as much as I do and I'm making my Christmas list! Love it, it's absolutely beautiful and much cheaper here than what I paid (but I would have again, it's that lovely).
I love this book! I got mine in 2014 and I've noticed people complaining about the paper quality... The copy I have is more "colouring book" page where the pages have little fibres... I've noticed though when I look at the copies they have in the stores now the pages are thicker and white and smooth.. So this could be the difference why some people are getting the bleeding. I use coloured pencils anyways. But just thought this might help the confusions :o)
This book is amazing! I do wish that the pages weren't back to back like others said but I disagree on those who are upset about the paper quality. The pages are nice and thick and I have no worries about it tearing under color pencils. I understand a lot of people wanted to use colored pens and markers with this book and those could cause bleeding issues, but I guess I've never liked ink in any of my coloring books so not being able to use them doesn't bother me.
So excited to get started, the drawings are absolutely amazing! I was very worried about the thickness of the pages due to some previous reviews, but I think they are a bit thicker than standard coloring books and won't bleed through unless you are using markers. Some of the drawings do go all the way up to the spine, but for anyone actually planning on framing some of these, if you take a razor blade you can split the spine and have the whole picture accessible.
In love with this book! Hours and hours of fun!!!!! Only wish is that paper was thicker so inks/ markers could be used. Have purchased x4 copies for family and friends and they love it too!<br/>It is fun with hidden objects to find throughout the book. Scenes vary enough that they don't get boring and are interesting enough that you are excited to go I to the next page!<br/>Am sure once you buy one copy you will want a second or third for yourself or a friend!
This book is beautiful!! I can't fault anything about it. However, something I didn't realize is that you are expected to draw in part of some of the pictures. I can't draw, which is why I wanted a coloring book. If you are drawing impaired like me, I would recommend one of her other books like the Enchanted Forest. I am not returning this though because it is lovely and I will color what I can :) Who knows?? Maybe I will find some drawing skills along the way!
Love the attention to detail...you can either make almost every picture easy or hard, depending on your skill.  My only complaint (and it is petty) is that there are too many leaves on every page....I go through 4x as many green pencils as everything else.  There is a nice mixture of complex and simple pages and one really elaborate one at the end (which I haven't attempted yet).  Very relaxing and fun hobby...never thought I'd love coloring like a kid again!
Great publishing quality! The lines are crisp and clean and paper is well weighted. The contents will be great for hand embroidery and other crafts. The art work subject mattter is not quite as appealing to me as its 2015 counterpart. But it DOES have garden in the title.  So, if your looking for a lot of different styles and sizes of flowers, butterflies and bugs, this is the book for you. They also did some fun things like a maze and frame border designs.
Super fine details but loving the challenge.  Beautiful book!
Very intricate, but easy to color designs and even encourages you to make your own design doodles. I use a 64 count colored pencil set from Crayola and that seems like enough colors, but I did just order a set of 20 Staedtler Triplus Fineliner Pens to see if I like them better. As per many of the reviews, if you use a light hand, they won't bleed through. I love this book so much I pre-ordered the Lost Ocean! Recommended for a fun, relaxing past time.
I have loved coloring ever since I was a young girl in elementary school. As an adult now, I still love to color. This book is absolutely amazing! The sketches are beautiful and are printed on thick durable paper. No more torn pages from coloring on thin flimsy paper! Whenever I am stressed, I whip out my coloring book and color away. It's very therapeutic and stress relieving. I would definitely recommend this book to my fellow coloring enthusiasts!
Love it!  I'm a huge baseball fan, but not so much with the football.  While we are 'watching' football games on tv, I'll be coloring in this puppy.  One whole page is approximately one game.  :D  I also use this on the pretty relaxing days - I like to sit outside, but don't really want to read out there.  This gives me a much better activity in case of interruption by the neighbors and other passersby.  I use prismacolor pencils and so far, so good.
I saw this book on the pioneer woman's site, and just had to get one for myself. This book is so enticing and fun to color. It's just beautiful. My one and only complaint is that the author suggests felt tip markers, but the pages are too thin for this. Felt tip markers do make the pages look great, but sadly they bleed through the thin pages. I even thought my markers weren't the heaviest of felt tipped markers. But I still love this gorgeous book!
Love this book. The spaces to color in are small on most pages. You would be well served to have new markers or very sharp pencils to color with so you can neatly get in the small areas. The designs are beautiful and provoke relaxing thought if you love gardens and nature. The pages are thick so marker does not bleed through. Very good quality paper and beautifully bound book. Once it's all colored I can see myself leaving it out on a coffee table.
Simply love this book, but after purchasing many brands and types of pens and using them on the title page, I haven't found any that do not show through.  This books should be advertised with colored pencils as I see other comments regarding this issue.  It save the frustration of purchasing an item you can't use until you buy the coloring medium it's designed for.  If they meant you to use pens the paper would be thicker and the price much higher.
This book is wonderful. I bought for my senior mother to keep her busy other then watching tv all day. Now she sits at the table in the sun and works with this book and others with colored pencils.<br/>Markers shoudl not be used they bleen thru. But with a great assortment of pencils, markers are missed.<br/>She loves looking for the creatures. It is fun.<br/>Thank  you
Coloring in this book, with all of its intricate details- swirling vines, fluttering butterflies, and delicate flowers- allows me to relax and flex a little creativity without having to stare at a blank page. I will also be purchasing the Lost Ocean when it comes out.<br/>My only complaint, and it is a tiny one, is the 2 page scenes are difficult to color due to the seam where the page meets. However, that doesn't stop me from enjoying this book.
I bought the Author's other book first and loved it so I got this one and it's beautiful too but it does have some pages that are only half drawn so you can draw the other half yourself. I can not draw anything except stick people so it was not something I liked so I gave it away to someone who can draw. If you are like me you will like the other one better. It does have some wonderful pictures in it and you won't be disappointed in the quality.
Love love love this! I have spent the past two months waiting for my order and all I can say is that it was well worth the wait!!<br/><br/>I was worried with all the comments about bleeding onto other pages, but i have just spent the last 40mins colouring in using felt tip markers and have not had any problems at all! Can't wait to spend cold winter nights indoors colouring in these gorgeous books. ♡♡<br/><br/>Johanna - an incredible talent!
This is a very high quality coloring book. I had to wait a while to get my copy, but it was worth the wait. I think in the more recent reprinting of this book improvements have been made. The paper quality is of a high grade and thickness. I have colored pages using fine point markers as well as gel ink pens. I have not had any issues with bleed through to the pictures on the other side. I highly recommend this book the pictures are beautiful.
Books become best sellers for a reason. This one is the best in the adult coloring book world. No bleed through with gel pens because pages are thick. The artwork is gold standard. Then for added fun you can add your own drawings into pictures. Plus hidden in pictures are different things that the book tells you to look for. Wonderful book. I have to hide them when friends and children visit because I am protective of my creations. Lol......
Adult coloring is becoming trendy as a stress relieving, relaxing entertainment. A friend on facebook actually got me interested in buying some books and the designs are beautiful and intricate in this book. It's not your kindergarten coloring book!! Husband couldn't believe how ornate and intricate the designs are. I use colored pencils or gel pens with the book and will sit and color while I watch tv. It IS relaxing!! I think I'm hooked!!
loved this so much ordered another one for my granddaughter
Totally worth the wait!!!  I have been waiting months to get Secret Garden and it was so worth the weight.  I love all the details that Johanna Basford has put into her book.  Everything from the little snails that might be climbing up the side of the flower pot or the little apples hanging in the trees to the butterflies flitting around the pages.  Secret Garden is such a HAPPY book and I can't wait to dig in and color my troubles away!!
This book is so beautiful I almost didn't want to color it. The areas to color range from large to small and there is a variety of subject matter to fit everyone's preference. There are hidden items and mazes to occupy your mind. I got it for the coloring. Its challenging to make it as beautiful in color as the drawings are in black and white but really rewarding when you finish a page. I find this book a relaxing and beautiful activity
This is a beautiful and detailed book that helps older kids and adults access their creative side.  The author provides beautiful pictures to color (research has shown that coloring is beneficial for adults as well as children).  She also provides partial pictures for the reader to embellish.  If you want to spend time coloring something beautiful, this is for you.  If you want to start accessing your own creativity, this is for you.
This is a wonderful adult coloring book with nice thick pages that you can display on your coffee table.  It will give your hours and hours of stress reducing coloring and I cannot wait to buy her other books.  The pages are printed on both sides just so you know and do not think it would be easy to remove them just so you know.  I have only used pencils and crayons so I cannot really say about bleed through but the pages are thick.
I love this book. I love the drawings and the texture of the paper. It is frustrating that there are images on both sides of the paper because if you choose to use markers, they will bleed through. I am still giving this book a 5 because I can use colored pencils. The little comments the author put on some of the pages about adding my own drawings are silly. They shouldn't be there and I won't be coloring those pages.  Such a shame.
Nice book. THick pages. Will order from this artist again.
Goes well beyond children's coloring book.  Picked this up as Christmas present for my granddaughter but decided she is too young for it even with her Mom's help.  Decided to put it back for a few years and let her try it when she is maybe 8 or 9 when her finger dexterity is good enough to let her color this and have as a nice colored book when she is finished.  Should make for hours of fun for her and her parents working with her.
I find it wonderfully intoxicating! It just takes me to another world! And I really like that it calms me down ! I can sit down and just lose myself in it. I love the size of the book and the feel of the paper. A friend of mine gave me "The Enchanted Garden" by the same author and it is just as wonderful!  I can't wait to see the next one. I would love for her to do one on angels! Thanks again for such a wonderful book!
Amazing! I think everyone should own a copy of this book! It is so much more than a colouring & treasure hunt book! It's just brilliant and it's the perfect thing to do when you are unsure how to spend your spare time or when you're in that kind of mood where you're not sure what to do. This books brightens your mood and lets you escape into an inky world!I've already started buying this book for friends, it's the perfect gift!
If you're thinking about buying this, because you know you're gonna love it, just buy it already! It's an amazing book, and everyone I've shown it to wants one.<br/>Markers do bleed through the pages. So I've been using colored pencils and I think it looks better than the marker anyway. All in all, amazingly beautiful book, and I hope Joanna Basford comes out with another book like this, just different from the garden theme.
This book has some very intriguing pictures.  All ages would enjoy it.  I especially enjoyed searching for the different items in the pictures (bugs, worms, butterflies, and even a hedgehog?).  The paper had a great texture to it for coloring.  My only complaint (and it's a small one) is that the pages were 10 x 10 instead of the standard page size.
If you like detailed coloring books, this one's for you.
I find this  coloring book beaitful! The drawings and the pictures are lovely!  I find coloring a  very relaxing thing to do, because all's you need to do is just sit and color, then the pages bloom and are beautiful when you are done, and I always feel better when I can get my mind off of a hards days work and on to other thoughts when I am at home. Even my mother who is in asissted living will sit and color with me.
I bought this for my wife, who loves to color. The quality is more than I expected. The pages are large and thick, the binding is solid. The cover is a nice reassuring thick paper stock. The illustrations are just beautiful and well thought out and my wife was tickled pink by the gift. Whether as a gift or personal, I would highly recommend this book. The author has absolutely outdone themselves. This is a treasure.
Absolutely beautiful and inspiring.  This book is published on good paper, the design is such that it is not taking you into the binding to try and complete your work.  Additionally to encourage your own creativity there are some designs that allow you to personalize your design by adding some additional artistic details to this book that tells a story of its own.  I think you will truly enjoy it, I certainly have.
I love to draw and doodle and this book is full of inspiration.  It is one of the most beautiful books I've purchased (or come across) to date, and because of the versatile nature of the drawings am purchasing 2 more, one for a young niece to crayon color and another for my best friend to pencil color..or simply enjoy the art.  Very impressed because it was so much more than what I expected after previewing online.
I am an avid needle artist and am always looking for great images to use in my embroidery projects. The pages in this book provide a wealth of designs, very suitable for needlework (as well as coloring).<br/><br/>The lines are clear and clean, which makes it easy to transfer the motif to the background fabric.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves pretty designs, no matter what their medium!
This is a great stress reliever! Right now I'm using regular Crayola coloring pencils and they work fine, but you have to keep them sharp to get into the little detailed areas. There are also "hidden" things, such as different animals and bugs, that you can search for throughout the book. Some pages allow you to use a pen to add in details yourself. Overall a great purchase and a lot of book for the price.
For those of you who might have difficulty coloring the pages near the binding, I took my book to Office Max and they spiral bound it for me for only $2.99.  Someone else mentioned this as well, but thought I'd let buyers know that it can be done very professionally and inexpensively.  I will do this with a couple more of the books that I've bought.  The spiral binding will make it so much easier for me to color.
Very lovely book for adults who love to create beautiful things.  Long winter days won't seem so long with this book and a pack of colored pencils.  It may sound silly for an adult to sit and color, but a lot of us love to and I am loving this book.  It's just as entertaining as books full of word puzzles, just much prettier.  One of my daughters said she wants it as a coffee table book when I'm finished with it.
I adore this book.  It is so peaceful and entrancing! I have been colouring as an adult for 22 years now.  This brings all the intricate zen of geometric colouring with all the beauty of nature colouring and whimsy of fantasy colouring into one lovely volume.<br/><br/>I find it works best with coloured pencils, as the felt tips do cause bleed and the pages are double-sided.  But that's truly no drawback at all.
Brain Candy! I love to mindlessly color in the pages and when I'm finished I usually have a beautiful picture to look at. Great stress reliever for me. The detail in the line drawings makes this book stand out from others. Yes, it is a Grown Up Coloring Book. And I'm not sharing!
Great drawings - just wish the drawings were one sided.
These books are just beautiful.  There is a wonderful spread of illustrations with some fun items to discover along the way.  The paper is a great thickness and I love the way that pencils and pens show up on the paper.  These are such wonderful books and you feel like you are working on something special when you use them<br/><br/>I have bough this personally and as a gift and will do so again in the future
Just purchased a copy today!<br/>After taking an introductory Zentangle class, this was a natural segue  Here the relaxation is in the coloring rather than the drawing.  Focusing quietly and slowly on just the tiny space in front of you is in it's own way, meditative..  AND bonus...the dust jacket has a drawing on the flip side.  It's heavier paper and a good 12 x 18 inches...Might even look good on a wall.
This is one of my most favorite coloring books. This book truly inspired me to start coloring adult coloring books. I especially enjoy the more complex illustrations with the tree houses and mazes and wishing wells and gardening areas. I have enjoyed this book so much that I also purchased the single sided artist version prints. I have been a fan of Johanna Basfords illustrations ever since I got this book.
This book is so incredibly beautiful.  The quality is superb and the pictures are very charming.  This is a coloring book meant for older children or adults.  I actually bought it for myself and couldn't be happier with it.  I would highly recommend using colored pencils as the markers will bleed through.  The pages are thicker than regular coloring books and have a very nice feel to them.  Love this book!!
This book is beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice!  I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and I am having second thoughts about giving it away!  Johanna Basford is an amazing artist!  The pages are really good quality thick paper and the book is much longer than it looks in pictures as well - around 50 pages.  This is a perfect gift for anyone who likes to doodle or color to unwind.
I love the designs. The only thing I don't love is the pages are thin newsprint and almost all markers bleed through to the other side of the page.  I have some Sharpie pens and some pens made for vellum that don't bleed through but they only come in limited colors. Colored pencils or fine point crayons would probably work well.
The pictures are all amazing, but they are printed back-to-back on every page, instead of leaving what would be the reverse blank in case of bleed-through with the coloring agent used.  Some of mine did that, not much but it's like one gray hair on your head.  No one else can see it, but your eyes go to every time you look in a mirror:-)  So it's 5-star for the artwork, but 4-star for the printing.
This coloring book is so much fun. I got a pack of colored pencils to go with it, and I really enjoy just choosing a page and having fun with it. I like having something fun and tactile to do that doesn't involve technology. I loved art as a kid and have been getting back into photography, but this kind of art just takes me back and I love playing with colors and pages and all sorts of fun things.
A beautiful, detailed adult coloring book. I find sitting down with these pages and my Prismacolors extremely relaxing, and have lost myself for hours in Basford's stunning illustrations, and have many, many hours of coloring left to go before I even get near finishing this book! In her cleverness, Basford has even included a puzzle hidden within her drawings. Great way to spend a sunny afternoon.
friend loves it even though I don't quite understand.
I've bought a dozen coloring books in the last couple of months. This is my very favorite one! The pages are thicker than most. The prints are beautiful and delicate. My only complaint is that many of the pages have the prints going deep into the crease of the page, where it is impossible to color. It's too bad they don't make it easier for us. Still, it's a beautiful book and I'm glad I have it!
I love it! It's a great meditative tool. I'm so happy I picked this one. I love this book in particular because of all the different types of pages to color-- from mandalas, forest scenary, partly drawn pages for you to continue to fill in. Most of the drawings are big yet still intricate to color in. I didn't like some of the other books online because I saw that there wasn't much to color in.
It's beautiful. I'd like it a lot more if the pages were single sided because my markers and color pencils are all making appearances on the other side- in the middle of other designs. I was really hoping not to have to copy these before coloring them, especially since the paper is so nice. Why have coloring book designers not figured out that using both sides of the page is counter-productive?
This was recommended to us from a friend.  I really like what I saw online so we ordered.  I was blown away when it arrived. It is seriously an adult coloring book. But almost like an artists or doodler activity book as well.  Personally I would prefer a spiral on something like this instead of a regular style book binding.  Just for ease of use.  However this is bound beautifully.  Great job!
Great book, quality of pictures and paper wonderful.
Stunning in every way, the only bummer is that most markers bleed through to the next page, i prefer markers to colored pencils but i have started one page with colored pencils so far. I think i will try gel pens next as i feel they may not bleed through to other page.<br/>But the book itself is so gorgeous i can flip through the images here all day, i absolutely love this coloring book
I know there were some complaints about the pages being too thin, but I didn't find that problem. I don't know if I would be brave enough to use ink, but my colored pencils were just fine. The artwork is just challenging enough to keep things interesting, but for the most part, easy and not so intricate that I get frustrated. Overall, especially for the price, this book is well worth it!
This is a beautiful book!  Such a joy to color when I want something detailed. I use water-based inks so I don't have to worry about bleed through. I am not a fan of the two page scenes though, since the binding gets in the way. I think the pages where she left room for you to add your own embellishments are pretty neat, but I'm not sure I will do that, since drawing is not my strength.
Woohoo, what great drawings to use for embroidery designs.!  Please publsih another set of designs. (sorry, "colouring book for children)  From this one I have picked three - the hummingbirds, the peacock, and the owl - the latter I cut out the form of the owl and put it in the open wreath circle you designed.  These will form the centrepiece of the table cloth I am embroidering.
This is a wonderful coloring and activity book for young adults and older- you certainly need concentration skills.  A word of caution though- it might be best to have a small piece of cardboard or even 24lb paper cut to fit the pages to give you a better surface for coloring in these thin sheets.  Not a good choice if you are wanting to use watercolor, but perfect for map pencils.
Amazing coloring experience. This book is for adults, or very talented children. The pictures are extremely definitive, and precise. Very detailed, and beautifully drawn. Most pages are full of leaves, plants and the like. Not for young children. The paper is wonderfully thick, and thirsty. Two sided, and not sure how gel pens would work, as I use pencil crayons. I'm very happy.
I heard about this first absolutely amazing 'coloring book for adults' and how it was unlike any other. I finally received mine (she has sold millions) and in person the beauty is truly something else. The detail!  Beautiful!  The paper is thick and anyone would think this book would cost 3 - 4 times what it sells for. Now I am waiting for her third one! I feel like a kid again.
This is really nice.  I understand attracted many people all of the world.  Reacently here in Japan, TV program focuse on this coloring book and made a mega hit!  It said it is good for stimulating brain and to helpful to prevent cognitive deseases.<br/><br/>A quality of paper is not so good, easy to bleed and transparent if I use color pen.  So rating post is minus one star.
I love this coloring book.  It is detailed and I like coloring small things; + some pgs allow drawing of your own desire.  I generally use gel pens for these types of pictures, best for small spaces; control; & doesn't bleed thru.  I am basking in the delight of this book.  If you like adding color to detailed pictures and you like flowers and gardens, this is the book for you.
Meditation makes me anxious, but I find I like coloring (OK, knitting, too!).<br/><br/>This is an elaborate, intricate coloring book for adults. I see I need to sharpen up my Prismacolor pencils! (You WILL need some precise colored pencils, markers, or the like to take advantage).<br/><br/>The art is lovely, and the process of coloring it is meditative and relaxing for me.
very disappointed. I ordered one book two weeks ago. Liked it. Very good quality. Printed in the  Netherlands. so I ordered more as gifts to my friends. This time the paper was cheap, thiner. Printed in China. Why can't you printed with good paper?
I love this coloring book keeps me busy for hours.
This is the best adult coloring book!  I ordered it after reading about they hype and so glad that I did.  So much detail and hidden surprises await you in this huge book.  I used crayola's pro-tip markers (I think thats what theyre called).  THey don't bleed through and provide a ton of vibrance.  I also use Prismacolor pencils.  Beautiful illustrations and so much fun!
Beautiful illustrations. I like the layout of the book. The pages ARE NOT perforated, therefore the book is more of a volume of your artwork and I like that. The paper is of good quality, however DO NOT USE SHARPIES OR ROLLERBALL INK PENS they bleed no matter what paper is available. It is best to use pencils, gel pens, regular ink pens, crayola washables work well too.
This is a beautiful book! Every drawing has so much interest and complexity but yet simplicity too. I can see numerous ways to use these...colored pencil, gel inks, etc. the drawings definitely have a Zen feel to them. it is fun to find the "hidden" items although in truth they really aren't hard to find. I recommend this book, one of the best I have purchased!
I recently bought this and it's my favorite coloring book. My Prismacolor premier pencils work wonderful on the paper. The art is beautiful! It has many many many hours of coloring enjoyment to explore. My only complaint is the binding because it's difficult to open the pages far enough. But I would still buy it again.<br/>I plan on buying more of her coloring books!
This coloring book is delightful. Like, I opened it, and that was all that I could say. This is delightful. I don't think I knew what delightful meant until I got this book. The only problem with it is that it's really too beautiful to color, so I'm thinking about ordering a second copy so that I can ruin it, while the first copy remains pristine. Just a lovely book!
I am disappointed in quality of paper. I looked over reviews for markers that would not bleed through. Some brand should have been suggested. I bought excellent rated sharpies. Thet do show through on back, which interfers with picture. There is no way to contact seller for suggestion of markers.
You will be on this FOREVER! If you want to do it right, it takes a long time to color everything. Just one little illustration could take hours, days. And the best part about it? You will not freak out while coloring. You will not think about the things that upset you. You will forget you're angry, or hot, or distraught. Best at-home therapy I've tried.
I absolutely love this book!  I bought it to give me something to use when my daughter wants to color with me.  The artwork is beautiful, the pages are thick and markers don't bleed through.  The quality is perfect.  There is so much detail and it's addicting once you get started.  You can color every single page, including the cover.  Beautiful book!
Very detailed and lovely graphics for an adult coloring book. The pictures are so lovely you don't want to use it. Has a nice nostalgic look. I think it would make a great gift for someone who can appreciate art in black and white and bring color to the page. Overall I love it and would recommend.<br/>Product received for testing and review purposes.
I got the Enchanted Forest before I got this one, and like it so much better. But, as I am me, I had to have this one as well.  The one thing I love most about her books are the search and find aspect.  The books are so well made and the paper thick and well constructed. I would not hesitate to purchase anything published by Johanna Basford.  THANKS!
I love this coloring book every picture is so beautiful. This is definitely something an adult would color and not a small child. The paper is thick and I don't mind that pictures are printed on both sides of the paper. Does anyone have a recommendation on the best pens to use in this book? I've been using color pencils but wanted something brighter.
Bought this for my adult sister who loves to color, along with a giant set of colored pencils. She's in heaven, and, after looking through this book, I'm thinking I may have to buy one for myself! Different levels of intricacy and detail mean you can finish a picture more quickly, or spend hours (days) on one special page. Would- and will- buy again.
I like the designs of this book more than the others I've seen.  So intricate that you really need specialized coloring tools, though.  I bought super fine tip markers .5m and still was challenging.  On the other hand, the fine tip is too little to use for larger spaces.  So I'm ending up using mixed mediums.  Once all that's solved, very enjoyable.
Great coloring book!
Received this book as a gift and I couldn't be more pleased! Beautiful pictures I can't wait to color and has a search and find game within the book.
Really enjoying this book. And it arrived faster then expected. Thank you!
Oh, my gosh! I love this book. The details are incredible. And everything can be colored. The cover, the title page, inside the cover and more. I love the balance of work as well. Some pages are simple while others are more work. The search and find is a fantastic touch. I am having a blast working on it. I am 31 so very appropriate for an adult.
I previewed the books when I bought them; I felt that the two young ladies would enjoy spending time together as they bond for the first time.  Their dads are brothers.  As their aunt, I was pleased to provide this quiet time activity and witness their styles and techniques.  For myself, I would buy this and use it as a way to relax and meditate.
My teenager loves coloring and had asked for this book. Several people had mentioned it to her and she couldn't wait to try it out. So many great reviews and priced reasonably I couldn't pass it up. The pages are full of great designs and quality paper to prevent bleeding from markers. I would definitely recommend for teenagers and adults alike.
This book is AWESOME....I gave it as a gift to a very good friend and, after knowing her for over 40 years, learned that she LOVES to color!  She went right out and purchased markers and has been posting the finished product on Facebook!  The pages are very detailed and are literally a WORK OF ART when completed.  Coloring can be habit forming!
Yes, I succumbed to the coloring book bandwagon, but now I'm a fan.  How could we as adults have forgotten how relaxing it is to just sit and color?  I wish that these pages were not printed on both sides as I would like to use markers on some of the pages, but that would be my only complaint.  Otherwise, very creative and interesting designs.
Bought this book at Michael's. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! the quality of the book it's self, binding, and paper are very high. The quality of the hand drawn art is indescribable! I was very intimidated to start it because of the detail and needing to use pencils rather than marker but, I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be getting her other books soon.
This coloring is very beautifully done. I know it will provide me with hours of coloring fun. I have showed it to lots of my friends who enjoy coloring and would recommend it. My only problem was I ordered it in July and didn't receive it till Sept 8th because it was on back order. I almost canceled it but I am glad I didn't. Thank you again.
Anyone who loves to color will absolutely fall in love with this masterfully designed coloring book for all ages. Well, quite frankly it is too beautiful to let a toddler color it but other than that everyone will enjoy spending time with this book. Robust graphics, complex designs on some pages and simple lines on others. You will love it!
This is an amazing coloring book that just fills me with delight! Yes the paper does have issues with bleeding through, (even with Prismacolor pencils) and it does get annoying that the pictures are printed on two sides. However, I love coloring pictures to give as gifts, I want to use a bunch of images for embroidery patterns, I love this.
This is the greatest coloring book for those of us who love gardening.  I'm an adult and I ordered this for myself.  I color as a form of meditation and have been looking for something that appeals to me for a long time.  This coloring book is perfect.  It reminds me of my own doodling.  Nice paper, nice size.  Try colored pencils with it.
Page after page of beautiful images recreated on thick gorgeous paper. I cannot wait to use my Derwent Water Colour pencils and am looking forward to many happy relaxing hours immersed in my own Secret Garden.  Even my husband is impressed and wants to, "colour" with me. Thank you Johanna! I can't wait to receive your other books.
What a fun book this is.  Just looking through it and trying to find the hidden critters is fun.  However, my minds spins as I think about enlarging parts of the pictures and embroidering them.  Then there are the tiny designs that would be great for tangles.  Then, again, I could just have a great time coloring the patterns.  Great book!
I absolutely love these coloring books! The paper quality is great and the markers don't bleed through. The artist's style is fun, beautiful, and whimsical.  The pages are so detailed that it will take you a while just to do one page and every inch of the book is designed to color, even the cover. I recommend them one hundred percent.
Really love these designs.  Fun to add your own drawings to some of the pages.  Can't wait to get more in to it.  The only negative is that I wish the pages were one sided.  I like to add marker and am afraid it will bleed through. I also don't like having to deal with a 12x24 open book when I'm working on a page. It gets cumbersome.
Bliss. I use my awesome set of PrismaColor pencils, which are divine, creamy colors that you can actually blend on the paper, plus sharpen to a fine pin point for the intricate shapes. My big set of 100 ish colors comes with around 8-12 shades of green, which is wonderful for this book since there are so many leaves. Can't get bored.
This coloring book has very lovely garden designs.  I need two of these if I want to color every page though, as I prefer using markers and that cannot be done with designs printed double-sided as they are in this book.  The spine of this book is also not ideal - it is difficult to color to the edge of the design with a tight spine.
This book not only has many beautiful pages to color but suggests adding your own ink drawing to some of the pages to complete as you wish. Lots of fun. The paper is good quality and works well with colored pencils as well as gel pens. I enjoy the variety of drawings in this book. I tend to reach for it first of the 6 books I have.
This book is beautiful, but definitely for older kids and adults.  I bought them for a 5 year old and a 7 year old and it was a challenge for them to stay in the lines which causes some frustation.  They quickly lost interest due to this, but I could sit around all day coloring in this book, and I imagine older kids would love it.
I just love this coloring book. The illustrations are just beautiful, the pages are nice and thick, and the overall quality is so much better than any "coloring book" out there. There are guided pages for when you need a little inspiration to get going, too! I will definitely be giving a few copies as gifts in the future!
Very beautiful and intricate.  I bought Prismacolor Verithin pencils that are marvelous to use, easy to control and essential for the tiny details.  The only complaint is that the spine  interrupts the pages that are two page designs. Paper quality is superb. The Secret Garden will make a lovely and interesting coffee table book.
Arrived in perfect condition. Book is beautifully created and designed. My only regret is that I didnt order an extra for myself! Really fun little hunt throughout the book.<br/><br/>The drawings are amazingly done. Plus there are some pages that tell you what to do "Add butterflies..." etc. Which is fun.
This was a perfect bday gift for my 8-year-old niece. She's very artistic and creative. All the pretty swirly garden designs will make for hours of fun coloring. I also love that there are prompts to draw your own pieces of the garden, and there are challenges to find hidden objects throughout the book. Great find!
I bought this for my teen daughter and she absolutely loves this book. It has so many fabulous coloring pages that would please all ages. My daughter finds this book so relaxing and loves to color in it.  I would definitely buy these again in the future as the designs are so nicely done and really intriguing too.
This is a coloring book for people who can color in tiny details. And who have time on their hands--or who need an excuse to shut the world out for awhile and focus on one task. I bought the 12-Sharpie package of thin line markers in rainbow colors, and they don't bleed through. I find it relaxing and absorbing.
I absolutely think this is the best adult coloring book on the market. Unfortunately I'm not really able to use it with the gel pens that I bought because they don't work,  the ones that do work though do not go through the page. right now I'm using this with colored pencils and it is a wonderful coloring book.
I bought this for myself and it is a great coloring book for the older child or an adult.  The art work is amazing and coloring one page can take several days.  There are also activities to do.  I would not buy for anyone under ten.  Also, I was disappointed you could not use markers.  The colors bleed through.
Got this for my 14 year old daughter. It is an awesome book. The pages are heavy, crisp white paper.  The designs are beautiful.  She absolutely loves it!  Has already spent a lot of time coloring and drawing in it.  I would NOT recommend this for young artist (under age 12) as the designs are very detailed.
This coloring book is so beautiful. Johanna Basford's art is awesome and so much more fun and interesting than other adult coloring books I've seen. The fanciful, intricate, and whimsical drawings are just what I was hoping for. Can't wait to get out my colored pencils and have a relaxing coloring session!
This is my first "adult coloring" book.  It's fun to pick-up and just take a little break.  There are a lot of fine details that you can drill down and focus on.  She has some other books that have caught my eye too (particularly Lost Ocean), but it may be a few years before I finish this one!  :)
This coloring book is amazing - I hate to call it "adult" because that feels inappropriate.  But this is a great coloring book for folks who are looking for higher level, "frameworthy" type of coloring book.  It also has some hidden items, so it has childlike element and is just plain fun.
One of the best coloring book's I have ever seen. I think I have to give this to most of my family!!<br/>This is beautiful, and well drawn, yet it allows you to be totally creative.<br/>It is your own personal interpretation of how each page should be colored.<br/>So relaxing, in times of stress, too!
Love this book!! The pictures are great to color! And if you use markers it doesn't bleed thru. I will be purchasing her books again because of the paper the pictures are printed on. The paper is thick and I love the no bleed thru. And hunting for the little secrets in each garden in fun when you color.
I bought this for my sister for her birthday. She loves coloring as an adult, so this seemed appropriate. I can see why this is always sold out. The quality is OUTSTANDING. They did not go cheap when making this book. The paper quality is amazing and the designs inside are beautiful. I HIGHLY recommend.
This book is so pretty and relaxing! I have been using it in place of TV to wind down at night so I don't stare at a bright TV screen so late. We constantly take in information from work and TV and books, etc, so t's nice to "create" something and have that output. I highly recommend this book.
This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful adult coloring books out there, yet it is two sided - meaning colors will bleed and you must choose only one side to work with if using markers. Also, the paper quality is only average. Could be so much nicer! Still one of my favorites, but disappointed
I don't love how much of it is just flowers and butterflies, was expecting a little more variety (birds, cottages, etc.) but I will accept that that's on me given the title lol.  Great artwork and thick pages.  If you like to color flowers then this is definitely the adult coloring book for you!
What an awesome book! I'm so addicted! It was worth the 5 week wait to recieve ! Now I know what all the hype is about! Johanna is an excellent artist. The paper in this book is so smooth making using Prismacolor pencils or Straedtler Triplus Fineliners a dream to use. So relaxing and beautiful.
I bought this Secret Garden Coloring Book for myself and then I bought one for my sister.  You can spend hours getting lost in the art of coloring with these detailed designs.  I recommend these pens: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S161FO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_163<br/>for the pages.
It is more interesting than I though it would be! I spent 3-4 hours to just color the first page, which is the smallest task in here... so if every week I can color 1 page, it will take me over a year to finish it...Before you buy it, make sure you are patient enough and really committed to it.
Bought this for a friend who teaches math and art, and just had to order a copy for myself.  Beautiful drawings, "Secret Garden" has already given me hours of relaxation, and reminded me how much fun it is to color like a child again.  My creative juices are flowing thanks to this book.
Not one of my favorite books. The author seems to love their designs and has made little effort to see that I had enjoyable pages to color. I would not purchase this book again. Too much open space or space that I wouldn't care to color. I have many others in this genre that I enjoy much more.
I have been coloring these pictures with gel pens and like the results. An edition is coming out in September that reproduces some of the drawings on heavier stock. I'd love to try watercolor pencils on those and have preordered the book. I can feel the stress rolling off me when I'm coloring.
The new adults coloring books are trendy and since my wife wanted one we opted for the Secret Garden.<br/><br/>She loves the book and she already spent several fun hours coloring the book and discovering its secrets.<br/><br/>In conclusion: fun for adults and a recommended gift for women.
The item was out of stock and I had to wait two months to get it. But Amazon kept sending me updates and even sample pages. Kudos to Amazon!<br/><br/>The book itself is amazing. Very pretty drawings. You can either make a photocopy of it and add color to that, or do it on the book directly.
Markers bleed right through the pages.
Can't wait to start on this new hobby.
Clever coloring book for adults.  Intricate patterns to color and as an added bonus some of the patterns have hidden items to find.  Like Where's Waldo or those Hidden Object games.  Very clever.  I think if you like jigsaw puzzles you will probably enjoy coloring these thoughtful patterns.
I'm so happy to have a real coloring book for grown-ups! Such fanciful, fun designs! And the paper is nice and thick - allowing you to use markers or pencils. I know I'll have hours of enjoyment with this book because it took me about 7 total hours to color the first two-page-spread design!
This book is so detailed, and I love it! For teens or adults who find coloring soothing, this is the perfect book. I first thought about buying markers, but I am glad that I chose colored pencils. The pages are heavy, but I would hate to bleed through and ruin one of the wonderful pictures.
While marketed as a coloring book, I bought this as an embroidery pattern book. I love the intricate designs!  As others have said, the paper is indeed more fit for pencils than markers--I would be fearful of bleed-through. However, the richness of markers would bring these designs to life!
I enjoyed it so much, the drawings are just great.  As a artist I can add to it and color the drawings.  Very relaxing and my zen tangles drawings fit right in.  I brought the book for my self and one for my friend.  Johanna Basford is a wonderful artist and I hope she will make more books.
Johanna Basford coloring books are the Cadillac of coloring books. The paper is substantial, so the markers I use do not soak through (Sharpie's do show through, so don't use Sharpies). The designs are suitable for framing and are detailed enough to keep you busy and happy for a long time.
I prefer her other book, Enchanted Forest, to this one only because the paper is thicker in that book. In this book, I cannot use markers or they bleed through the pages, so have to use colored pencils. The pictures are great, but I wish this was in the same thick paper as her second book.
I bought both the forest and garden books this author put out.<br/>Fun designs to color.  Nice thick pages so markers/pens won't leak through.  High quality binding.  I was going to cut out the pages to hang on the fridge, but the book is of such high quality, I kind of don't want to now!
I LOVE this book. I had head good things about it, but was still surprised by the quality of the pages. I know this book will keep me busy for a long time. I like that there are activities as well as coloring pages. Now I just can't wait to get my good colored pencils so I can get to work!
Lovely pages and images. I am excited to start coloring away to de stress at night before bed. A more sophisticated version of a childhood past time. I will be purchasing more as birthday and Christmas gifts for my friends. This item arrived quickly and much nicer quality then I excepted.
I have three of her books and they are very detailed .  Heavy paper set in black and white to make your own colors and personality.  I bought pencil sharpener and big box of pencils for coloring.  It does take time to do and it is fun, Amazon is great to have her books and supplies ....
I love this book! I've heard about this artist through a few other people and this is the first book of hers I've colored. The pages are nice and thick and the designs are intricate, yet not too repetitive. I also like the hidden object challenge piece of it. I will buy her books again.
I don't have this one yet unfortunately it's on back order & I can see why. What I do with the other books I have, I photo copy the page I want to color, so I can use it again if it doesn't quite turn out the way I thought. I will try the prismacolor crayons. I love it, it's so relaxing
My daughter loves this book that I got for her at Christmas so much so that she won't color in it. She just makes copies of the pages and colors them so she can save it to copy later and color again. The family passed it around at Christmas and everyone said they wanted to color in it.
Beautiful pictures and quality paper.
Very relaxing to do, it's the best one I've seen out of all the adult coloring books with a lot of detail to color and add your own drawing and fun to it.. I've recommended this to everyone I know. I love the detail, and the option to add your own art work to the pages. I've decided to let my grandkids add the drawings tho so we can do it together.
It's no surprise, it's a lot of nature pictures.  You're going to go through a lot of green.  Would have liked some more variety, and less pages that require you draw your own picture.  Picture quality is good, though.  And paper is thick.  The markers I used did not bleed through.
My wife loves to color, but it's hard to find something that is as engaging as Johanna's art. The pages are really high quality and absorb colors very nicely. It's so much fun watching the artwork pop as color is added. I would definitely recommend this to any coloring enthusiast.
Ever want to have fun as an adult with colors? This beautiful rendition around the story of THE SECRET GARDEN allows the everyday home artist an opportunity to explore colors, contrasts, and blending. Best of all, it is relaxing and the finished product is beautifully your own.
Such a beautiful book...too pretty to color. I'd previously seen this at a Micheal's craft store for several dollars more & when I found it on Amazon, I couldn't resist. The illustrations with their hidden pictures are mezmorizing. Johanna Basford has created a beautiful world!
So wonderful!  I have really gotten into this "adult coloring "stuff...and this particular artists books are very fun to me.the paper is very nice and thick. There are different levels of details and loads of interesting designs...with room to embellish things yourself
Amazing and beautiful pictures,  very high quality.  However, I was sad to see the pictures are double sided,  so don't even dream of using markers to color them because it ruins the picture on the back; bought really good markers just for this purpose, sucks I can't use them.
Love the book. I just wanted to warn those of you who use gel pens etc. not to color the inside of the dust cover with them. The inside of the dust cover is coated with something & the gel pens etc. will not dry. I have ruined the inside of my dust cover & I'm so disappointed!
I absolutely LOVE this coloring book. Her books are my absolute favorite. The paper is high quality giving colors more brilliance.  My only complaint is that there are pictures on both sides so if you want to color and frame or give away you lose the beautiful one on the back.
Beautiful book, designs are wonderful-charming.  This is a delight to just look at, but for anyone that loves to express themselves thru color this is the best option.  I love this book, have bought two more copies for gifts, as far as I am concerned this is a number 1 winner.
Fantastic Adult Coloring Book.....pages of Leaves but that only makes me want to experiment with my greens. This is one of the Books that you can't use your Markers in because will bleed through, other than that great book to take up hours of time.and bring You some Peace!!!
I was gifted this book in its previous or original version with the thin highly absorbant paper. I just received one of the newer printed versions to give as a gift, and the paper has been upgraded significantly. It's much thicker with a much finer tooth. A vast improvement!
Beautiful art work. I have no trouble using felt tip pen and the pages are thick so no seepage. My only complaint is is that there must have been a sticker that was removed from the front cover and I attempted to color a flower on the front and it messed up 2 of my markers.
Great for a older artist in the family. Needs someone who has attention to detail due to the intricate designs. Definitely use fine tip markers and NOT colored pencils. Love this book! It keeps me focused when I'm in the hospital having infusion treatments & need to escape.
The designs are very pretty and fun to color in. Some designs ask the user to "finish" drawing in the butterflies, leaves, etc. Since I can't draw, that's a negative for me, but others might love it. A few of the designs are so large that the edge is in the binding.
I love this coloring book. Not only does it relax me when I color, but it so reminds me of my sweet little Grandma. She always took the time to color with me when I was little. She loved to color flowers & the patterns in this book are ones that she would've truly enjoyed!
I found tho in a local bookstore when it was first released!!! It started the craze for adult coloring books. Superb paper quality, intricate stylish designs and a real game changer for the genre! Excellent! It will change your coloring world. Well done Johanna Basford!!
I bought this as a gift for my Step Mom for her birthday and when it got to my house, I really wanted to keep it. It is so lovely with shimmery details on the cover. The book is well made and the images are simply beautiful.<br/>I definitely need to get one for myself.
Looking forward to her new coloring book that comes out in March 'Enchanted Forest'.  This coloring book is very beautiful and fun to color.  It also makes a nice presentation and conversation piece on a coffee table.  Coloring pencils is best with this coloring book.
I didn't want to color the pages at first because the lines are so beautiful am thinking of getting another Secret Garden book just to display in black and white. I love the story Secret Garden and this is relaxing and enjoyable for me. at age 54 i still like to color
I was super stoked to get these two books for coloring. They are beautiful. Only downfall is they take a ton of time with the detail (as expected) and the paper may not be thick enough depending on what you use to color with, it may mess up the back side of the page.
When my kids are coloring or doing homework at the table, I just get out my adult coloring book and color away! The pages are thick enough to use markers, which is awesome. The designs are gorgeous and really fun to color. You can even color the cover on both sides!
My adult daughter and I love to color--it's very relaxing.  This is a great book, and I've given friends pages to color.  The paper is good, thick quality.  I would have given it 5 stars had the pages been perforated, and the designs not go across 2 pages sometimes.
i have always loved to color and find the hidden item.This has the best of both.  I ran out and bought coloring pencils and keep my book tucked away for those rare moments i can do nothing.  i will be taking this on my next airplane ride for relaxing moments. thanks
I love my "Secret Garden" coloring book, whether it is for 5 minutes or 30 minutes!  I am also a stamper and can't draw, so my stamps have come in very handy in completing the pages where drawing is involved.  One of my best Mother Day gifts by far!!!  Mary
Beautiful book, great paper, I had used different kind of inks and coloring pencils and I haven't had troubles with the ink going through the other side of the paper. Awesome designs, is very relaxing for me spending time coloring this book. I really reccomend it.
I bought this for my nephew and wanted one for myself. It is amazingly detailed and there are actually little things that you can find throughout the whole book, I would recommend this for anyone who loves to just sit and relax while coloring in beautiful artwork.
Beautiful coloring book! Gave as a gift to a tween and she loved it. I even bought a copy for myself. The paper is the quality of a thick newspaper, and i would not recommend markers as they will bleed. I use coloring pencils or gel pens and they work really well.
LOVE this book! So fun and intricate. Shipped extremely quickly. My only complaint is that the copy I received has a slit cut across the front cover - like it was the top one in the box and had an unfortunate run-in with a box cutter. Other than that, very happy!
Would like it better if the printed pages were blank on the reverse. This limits you to use only coloring pencils unless you wish to spoil the picture on back when using pens (felt-tip & gel) due to bleed-through. On the other hand, these pictures are delightful!
I love this book and all the creative pages but I really don't care for the written suggestions on most of the pages. I think that it detracts from the beauty of the drawings and it isn't necessary to tell us what we should add, other than that the book is great!
My 9 year old daughter loves this book, and so do all her friends and many of the adults in her life! We bought gel pens to go with it, and coloring in all the tiny details is a very zen-like experience. It's neat to see the pages come alive with bursts of color.
The pictures are beautiful with intricate details. Perfect for losing yourself as you meditatively color your stress away. The images in Secret Garden are less abstract then other adult color books, no mandalas here, just patterns of swirls with a woodsey theme.
This book is gorgeous. And for the price on Amazon, you can't beat it. Admittedly, I do love Enchanted Forest the most, but this one is really close to being as fabulous. I was surprised that there were 70+ images in this book. Buy the book, you won't regret it.
This is the best adult coloring book.  Beautiful designs and games.  With good colored pencils  you can make lovely blends .  This is not rocket science just time fillers to get a beautiful result.  Be sure you u have a clipboard as the pages are easy to remove.
very pretty and intricate, some things are very VERY small, so  some people like me may need a magnifying glass,  use pencils or gels, felt tip bleeds thru,, that's why I gave 4 stars and not 5,  I have yet to find a book where you can use felt markers that wont
I rarely write reviews but I'm really impressed with this coloring book. The pages are SO thick, I'm using fine tipped markers and they do not bleed through. The illustrations are so pretty, you will have so much fun with this book, I can't wait to get another.
Enjoying this book immensely. Heavy-duty paper, plenty of pictures on both sides of the page, and some spread out over two pages.  Easy to hard pics, very detailed.  Not for children or the faint-fo-heart. Invest in good colored pencils for this intricate work,
I bought this for my daughter (16yrs old) because she likes to draw, but this is more for coloring. I colored a page myself and it took a week. Its like sewing, it takes time to make it look good. Its great for a long car ride or a flight a crossed the country.
The only reason I cannot give this book 5 stars is that they used newpaper print for the pages. This book would've been so much nicer had they used heavy cardstock. I cannot color with markers as they bleed through to the other side. The pictures are gorgeous.
I bought 2 of these. One for me and one for my adult daughter!  She was thrilled and we each colored a page and then decided we would save the rest for our vacation. The drawings are lovely and every page holds a surprise!<br/>Highly recommend for all ages!
Excellent Adult coloring book. Need to take your time. Some stuff is small so you will need sharp colored pencils. I found a box of 100 colored pencils at Walmart. Maybe Amazon sells them too. Worth the wait for this coloring book to be in stock. Great buy!
What a great stress reliever. I finally decided yo join this craze after reading that coloring has the same stress relieving effect as meditation. This book has complexity and the only complaint i have is i need more pencils. 72 colors is just not enough!!!
Love this coloring book and this is the best price out there.  Michael's is where I usually buy things like this, but they will not let you use your coupon so I was thrilled Amazon had it for much less.  Just wish my sharpie markers wouldn't bleed through.
I love the artwork in these books... the only reason I gave this one four stars is because I really think she got a lot more creative with her "Enchanted Forest" Otherwise... very happy!! Make sure to get very fine tipped markers/colored pencils!!!
I just started coloring in this last night. I'm using gel pens & the pages are so nice to color on with the pens. I think this is going to be a fun book to color. It's not like the other coloring books where I tear out the pages. It's like a heirloom book.
It finally arrived.  My daughter is just too too excited.  She anticipates hours and hours of relaxation as she attempts to do justice to these wonderful illustrations.  She says she'll take a pass on drawing in those areas encouraged in the book, however.
My six year old likes it, but it is a little complicated for her. She just gets a little tired of it and goes back later. It is so beautiful though! I think it would be best for age 8 and up depending on the interest of the child in coloring small spaces.
It's beautiful!!! the hidden objects are fun, the pictures are great, and the paper is perfect. The images are printed on both sides of the page, so I am nervous about the idea of using felt pens as suggested, but I am having fun with my colored pencils.
I have  enjoyed this Coloring book  with a lot of smiles, no only did it relieve stress but I smiled  so often  with the wonderful scenes and double page  wonderlands, I have had a terrific time with this book.  Hoping to find another  just as much fun!
What a fun coloring book!  Puzzles (I'm always interested), great designs to color, and plenty of opportunity to add my own squiggles.  If you doodle, and like treasure hunts, and enjoy well made and beautifully designed books -- You will like this one!
Getting into zentangle and this book though not zentangle is a great exercise for pushing you to fill in the white spaces with either their suggestions or creating on your own.  Not necessary to color but imagine some, esp kids, would find it to be fun.
This book maybe listed as a colouring in book but its just too good to for that. If you love doodle art I would recommend this book to everybody .... each page you discover a different image and they inspire me to start drawing again. Just delightful !
What a beautiful collection of drawings.  I haven't had it long but I look forward to coloring in this book.  The book also contains places to add drawings and I'm not much of an artist when it comes to line drawings but look forward to the challenge.
The book is beautiful but the one thing that I don't like is that my favorite pictures and the ones that are 2 pages and you can't get to the middle to color them!!<br/>It will take a lifetime to color the whole book and I will enjoy every minute of it.
This is a beautiful book for kids and adults alike. Its whimsical illustrations on an off white background are a nice change from other coloring books for adults that resemble nothing more than boring worksheets. This is defiantly my favorite so far!
I love these coloring books. I have a very stressful job and at the end of the day I just want to unwind and not even think. I'm using the Prisma color pencils which allow me to color in the more intricate designs. I own all the Inky coloring books.
If you want to use pens that don't bleed thru, try gel pens. So far I have had any issues.  Gorgeous book. Great way to 'unwind'. Lovely designs and plenty of them.<br/>Shame that the Post Office felt the need to bend the book and now it's creased.
I purchased this for my 11 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  It is really intricately drawn and kept her busy for days.  A good buy especially of you have girls of different ages...this is a "coloring book" for the middle school child.
This was a gift for my mom.  She had heard about adult coloring books and asked if I could find one for her.  She asked for something relating to gardening.  She was not aware of how intricate the coloring books were, but will give it a try anyway.
My 14 year old daughter loved it
I bought this as a Christmas present for my 8 year old daughter. She loves it and will last a long time and is a beautiful keepsake. She uses gwl pens and especially likes the way the glitter gel pens look. Would make a great birthdsy present too!
It is a beautiful book.  The pages are nice and thick, warning sharpies cause bleeding.  Be prepared to buy plenty of greens for this book - lots of leaves, vines, shrubs to color in. After only three days I am a little sick of coloring in green.
GREAT book.  The pages are thick (won't hold up to sharpies, but will to gel pens and papermate brand markers) and the designs are stunning.  This book will take my lifetime to finish (which is a good thing).  LOVE it.  I'm buying her other ones!
So fun!!! I never really liked to color when I was young but have started trying it again and love it. The book has all kinds of great shapes to color and some hidden pictures too, that are fun to find. I'm giving these for some Christmas gifts.
Great quality! I really enjoy my time spent with these Adult coloring books. Thick pages, so you can use many different types of pencils, makers or crayons. The pages are perforated, so you can even frame or share some of these beautiful prints!
Nice thick pages that marker does not bleed through.  Lots of variety, lots of intricate designs. Index in the back is nice. Going to take a long time to finish coloring, and that is a positive. Not a children's coloring book, that is for sure.
Adult coloring book - I love it! I bought this with a 100-pack of felt pens but after starting on the first picture, found that the pens bled thru. So I switched over to colored pencils and am happy as a bug....(no pun intended...well, sort of)
I bought this for my mom for Christmas and it exceeded all expectations!  She loves to color and the ink drawings in this book are amazing! A truly beautiful book, made more beautiful by adding your own color! I might just get one for myself :)
My sister-in-law loves to color, so I bought this book for her birthday. It is a lovely book! I liked it so much, I<br/>purchased a numbered print for myself and am having it framed to hang in my living room. This artist is truly<br/>gifted.
This is a great adult coloring book! The detail work is insane which makes it pretty labor intensive but the end result is beautiful. My fine tip felt markers bleed through so I switched to gel pens. Colored pencils might be the best option.
In love with my new book! Excited and look forward to every page! I have Prismacolor pencils but I am looking to see if water pencils will also work. I am now checking FB and other sites for tips from other people also in love with the book.
The designs are absolutely gorgeous and incredibly intricate. This is my first adult coloring book, and i couldn't be happier! I can go for hours, and not even notice the time. It distracts me from day to day stresses, and keeps me focused.
I love this book.  Nice quality paper for pencils or pens. My new favorite.  This would be a perfect gift for any person in need of some time to relax. A simply beautiful collection. I will definately purchase books from this artist again.
This is a great coloring book.  When you get to then end and think you're done, they have a list of things for you to find that you have colored.  This book has kept me entertained for quite a while now.  All in all a great coloring book.
I didn't realize there were so many pages to this book. It is definitely well worth the price! I cannot wait to start coloring. I am just starting to get into the adult coloring books and I look forward to buying similar ones now as well.
This is such a great book for coloring. The only feedback that I would change about this book is to have only front of page with design instead of double sided. The pictures are absolutely stunning! I am having so much fun with this book.
Book is great, bigger than I expected, lots of doodling areas & fun treasures to find. We went with other suggestions & provided colored pencils vs markers for this gift.  The pencils/color looks great & my daughter loves to color in it.
I love this book.  The level of detail makes each page a bit challenging, and the details are not so small that they are difficult to color.  A great adult coloring book.  It will take me a while to complete which is just what I needed.
Nice and intricate, detailed, true "adult" coloring book. Nice paper, but if using markers (I use sharpie ultra fine), it bleeds to other side, making opposite image unusable. Blank pages in between and perforated are preferred.
As an adult, I've commandeered this coloring book all for myself.  I've been using gel pens to color, and it's so much fun!  Would recommend for both adults and children.  The drawings are whimsical and every page is a joy to look at.
I recently bought a copy of Secret Garden for my older sister, along with a big box of Prismacolor colored pencils, and a staedtler sharpener as a thank you gift.  (She had admired/coveted MY set)<br/><br/>The pages of Secret Garden are beautiful and detailed, yet the lines are simple. There are tiny leaves and itty bitty flowers, and they are so pretty and delicate, it is fun to fill them with a freshly sharpened Prismacolor pencil....  (strong suggestion:  do NOT scrimp on the quality of colored pencils, it makes all the difference to get Prismacolors soft core pencils, not the scholar)<br/><br/>I cannot tell you how much pleasure my sister and I have gotten out of this book.  We are both in our 50s, and it is hard to find 'down time' together.  We recently went away for a busy weekend and any free time was spent coloring our books.  It is so therapeutic!  We even sent copies to our harried college age daughters, who wanted copies as well...<br/><br/>In addition, my sister has also gotten several of her friends into coloring as well ~ what a fun excuse for a get-together....  I hope the author/artist Johanna Basford reads these reviews, as I want to thank her for bringing the simple pleasure of coloring back into our lives.<br/><br/>ps. I bought my 4th copy of this book this week ~ for ME, so I have a back up copy.  (not kidding)
Excellent quality  paper, didn't like the graphics. Will select a different  book by same company. This is the best quality  coloring book I've come across. Can use color pencils, water color paint  and markers and no bleeding  thru.
This coloring book is beautiful! My only complaint is that the pages are yellowish instead of white, which seem to be effecting my green pencils a bit. I still love coloring in it though, and I plan to buy more from this illustrator!
This is an incredible book.  It is the first of its kind I have seen.  I shared my find with a very creative friend and she too sent for it.  It is appealing to all levels of artie types!  And pure pleasure to anyone who has seen it.
This book is full of drawings with great details.<br/>This is not a coloring book for little ones.<br/>But for us bigger people, it is full of fun things to find, color and do.<br/>If you like coloring books, don't miss this one.
Wonderful artwork to color! I love it!! Perforated pages would be nice to make it easier to remove and frame. There are a number of pages that are interactive. These allow you to add to the drawing space. There are also some mazes.
Bought one for me and another for my grandbaby in a faraway state...included a set of pens and stamped them. they are detailed but she can fill in as many as she likes and leave the rest blank - will still be a very pretty picture.
This book is very interesting, I have another coloring book of only mandalas but this one is also very entertaining. Has lots of nice things to color and some of them are so little that I have to sharpen my colors very thing haha.
This coloring book is so amazing.  The pictures a beautiful in any medium, I'm using colored pencils, but also tried paints and inks.  Even the grandkids are surprised that Grandma can make pretty pictures with so little work.
I love the imagination and exploratory nature of this book.  What a fantastic job the author did.  I actually gave this book to an artist friend as a gift and plan to purchase another book for myself.  I really love this book!
LOVE it!  Not sure why people are complaining about the paper, it doesn't seem cheap at all to me.  I love this book so much, the details in it are superb and it's so fun to color, such a great way to chill out and pass time!
I am having a lot of fun with Ms. Basford's coloring book.  Flowers, flowers and more flowers to color.  It has a sense of whimsy and beauty; and while coloring I feel relaxed and like I've helped to create a beautiful scene.
best series ever published.  this author really hits home runs time after time.  the pictures do go all the way to the binding, so be aware.  printed on both sides, nice heavy weight paper.  fun to find the hidden treasures!
Got tired of coloring leaves in a pretty short period of time. Great book though. Very intricate details and heavy paper. Some designs span both pages. There are also some pages where you can add additional drawings/details.
Beautiful pictures. Not fond of pages where they want you to continue drawing on your own, so those seem just unfinished. I've had it over a week and completed three pages. This will take me ages to complete if I ever do. :)
I received this coloring book about 5 days ago and absolutely love it! From intricate coloring pages to puzzles and make your own pages, so far, there's a page for any of my moods! Good shipping, good price, amazing product!
This book is a dream of a coloring book . . . though not for the timid. It is going on my Christmas list for my older granddaughters. It will keep anyone coloring for a long, long time. Johanna's pen & ink work is beautiful.
Beautiful book. I only wish the pages were single sided. The pens and markers I like to use bleed through. I changed to using pencil only.  This is a really lovely book visually and to hold in your hand. Nice quality paper.
Nice artwork.  Not just a`"coloring book" in that it leaves room for creative self expression by doodling.  More advanced than the Color Me series.  I like the "secrets" hidden within this product.
This book is beautiful. The paper is rich and thick. It feels wonderful to touch. The art and creativity prompts are inspiring. I cannot WAIT to put my colors to these pages. I want to buy all Johanna's books now.
Love the concept but with not-so-great eyesight the tiny details are not manageable for me.  Failed at coloring in the lines at ages 7 and 47 now. :)  Papermate Flair markers haven't bled through the paper so far.
This is pretty enough and has lots to color, however, the pages are not single sided nor are they perforated for easy removal when coloring.  It is difficult to color within the book because it does not lay flat.
What a lovely book!  I was truly disappointed to discover as others did that although they say to use markers, you can't without destroying the back up page.  What a shame they didn't use a better grade of paper!
For adults maybe, but I got this for my granddaughter's 10th birthday  and she loves it.  She has used drawing, doodling to destress for Long time!  I have 7 grandchildren and now they all want one for Hannukah
This book is well bound and the designs are really interesting. The illustrations are well done. The shipping was phenominal. I purchased it for my mother in law and I'm confident she will enjoy coloring in it.
The most beautiful coloring book I've ever seen! I plan to get all the ones by this illustrator. The cover is actually a slip cover that comes off and is one really long illustrated coloring page on the inside.
Coloring is a relaxing, simple meditative happy place.  When I can't focus for reading or handwork, this is my go-to.  This particular one is my favorite, and opening it made the wait after ordering worthwhile.
WOnderful "adult" coloring book. I say "adult" because the drawings are too small for grade school kids to really do well with. The drawings are whimsical and fun and a delight to interact with.
This is truly a treasure! We bought with the Fiskar pens and making this a special book I'm coloring with my 6-yr-old. Every page is a delight to re-imagine. Just the most special coloring book I've ever owned.
This is a great book.  Paper quality is outstanding. the Drawings are remarkable.  I hate to even color in the book.  I purchased this book to use the illustrations for embroidery and my piece is looking great.
This coloring book is beautiful. There are many fun pictures to color. The pages are thick and my markers does not bleed through to the other side. I also tried with colored pencils and the pictures are great!
This book is great. I love to doodle and this book is "doodle inspiration." I like the drawings so much I almost don't want to color them in, and might even photocopy the pages instead of coloring in the book!
It is just so fun and relaxing to color this book! I used my Prisma colored pencils. I've heard other people have used inked pens to color as well. If you need an adult coloring book, this is the one to get!!
I have spent many a happy hour trawling through this quirky and beautiful book and adding a riot of colour to the pages. Peaceful and relaxing I find it a meditative experience to colour these gorgeous pages.
I gave this as a birthday gift for my 14 year old niece and she was jazzed.  I think the concept of an Adult Coloring Book is great.<br/>I have a picture of my niece and her dad laying on the floor coloring.
I got this for my mom who suffered a stroke last year.  She recovered quite well without any side effects.  I got this for her to be creative daily!! Adult coloring shows to increase creativity and patience!
Really lovely coloring book. In my top five. (I have a lot of coloring books.)<br/><br/>I really like that it lays very flat, and I don't feel the need to extract the pages with an exacto knife. Very nice.
GORGEOUS book, great quality pages.  I use gel pens and the color does NOT bleed through.  I highly recommend this book to everyone, I am really happy with it and plan to purchase more for gifts for others.
What a gorgeous book!  The drawings are beautiful.  They have added some gold coloring to a few of the pages and it is beautiful.  These are so pretty they'd be great hung on a wall or given as gifts.  Wow!
This is too pretty to use! I am saving it for those long winter days coming up. The paper is thick and there is a fold out cover with extra coloring space. This is a must buy for anyone who loves to color.
love this book...its my favorite....except for the printing being on backs and fronts. these are so pretty i want to save them all and cannot if it bleeds through or if i want to use both sides in a frame
I anticipated getting this book, but after looking through it, it's not what I expected.  Doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it, but for me, I don't like it as much as the other coloring books I've bought.
Amazing pictures, get lost colouring in. Pages not too thick though. Felt tip pens no good as they bleed into the page behind. Gels are the way to go.
What a beautiful coloring book! I am very please with my purchase and have already started on my coloring adventure. I love the added element of the treasure hunt in the book. This is a very unique book.
Great little Art book...these designs are made of dozens of teeny, tiny little designs.  You must use a very narrow pen...the pages are not real heavy so use ones with a light touch...or colored pencils.
Great!  I have always doodled while on the phone and now I reach for this, its is perfect for me. I bought as a gift for a tween but ended up keeping it! : ) I am so happy I stumbled upon this on Amazon.
I got this for a pass time while recovering from a total knee replacement. It is very relaxing to color all the pretty things in this book. The pages are thick and big. I use colored pencils. I love it.
Everybody needs to release their inner child.  Here's the perfect medium to do that with.  I use Crayola colored pencils, the pages are sturdy, the designs wonderful.  This is a marvelous coloring book.
I dont have enough words ... It is late for delivery ..had to wait almost for 3 weeks but it is fabulous. amazing. best for oneself and great as gift. You will not get disappointed ... I BET !!!
Great ideas for drawing and adult coloring. Mostly flowers and animals, but very entertaining. The pictures inspired me to make a separate list of designs I wish to on my own. Worth every cent!
Very high quality adult coloring book. Phenomenal patterns to color. Made very well, very thick, many pages to color. This is the nicest adult coloring book I have seen. Love, love, love it!!!
I really enjoy this coloring book as it gives me hours of relaxation.  I used various mediums with it from colored pencils, markers to water colors.  Once a page is completed it looks amazing.
This was a gift for my 35 year old daughter and she loves to color.  The drawings are all beautiful and it will take time for her to color so many pages but she has all the time in the world.
I really love this book. The illustrations are beautiful and intricate. I can spend an hour coloring in one page and still have plenty to do. It's a great way to unwind at the end of the day.
i requested a refund on this book because it arrived too late to use as a gift. it is a wonderful book, however, and i knew it was back-ordered. it is justifiably popular and i love the book.
Tiny, tiny designs, much variety to choose from. Much detail & gives the choice to also add to some of the designs. Developes attention to detail by finding small articles within the designs.
Fantastic book!  I bought this for my daughter, she absolutely loves this.  The graphics are beautiful and very detailed.  Definitely, a nice coloring book. Would buy from this company again.
Secret Garden is my secret to relieving the stress of my day. I love to color with my grandkids so this was perfect for me. I can also channel my creativity with the pages I get to draw on.
I loved this coloring book.  So much to color.  I wasn't really interested in adding your own ideas to the pictures that suggested you do this but other than that I truly enjoyed this book.
Such beautiful, intricate images on good quality paper.  I can spend hours with this and my Prismacolors.  It's nice to have my own coloring book for when my daughter wants to color too :)
great pictures for color
A wonderful way to be creative using colored pencils or markers. A detailed coloring book that inspires the imagination. It provides me hours of fun as an adult who still likes to color.
I love this creative book. I've gave a couple as a gift with a set of color pencils and my friends love, love, love the creative doodling. If you like coloring mandalas, this is for you.
just - WOW! I love this book! Classy, detailed, really beautiful. I'm adding my own poems and family sayings, and it's a wonderful book for my children and grandchildren! AAA++++++++++++
Absolutely breath taking!!! Make sure you have lots of colors because every picture is very detailed and you will want to do it justice! I pre ordered tge Lost Ocean as well! Cant wait!
Great book.  The drawings are beautiful with great detail.  If you love to doodle and color then you will love this book.  The pages are thick and crisp.  You won't want to put it down.
Best coloring book ever!<br/>I absolutely love the flowers in this book.<br/>It works better if you use felt tip markers, some colored pencils look like you're coloring with crayons.
This is definitely a secret worth sharing! Beautiful pen and ink drawings on their own. Add color and they become whatever your imagination visualized. Fun and relaxing, for all ages.
This book is very presentable, makes a lovely gift for the artist in your life. The kind of coloring book you will keep instead of tossing when you are done coloring all pages.
I would like the printed pictures to be blank on the other side when using Gel Pens they tend to bleed on the other side then this ruins the other picture on the opposite page.
Nice quality paper  and good artwork. But I don't like all the authors little comments all over the pages. What am I supposed to do with those right in the middle of the page?
This was a present for my wife, who immediately fell in love with it.  If you are an adult who is still a kid at heart for coloring than this may be the coloring book for you.
This is a beautiful book. In addition to a great layout, it also contains a treasure hunt aspect that I really enjoy. This book is a great way to unwind after a stressful day.
So much fun. Keeps you busy with so many fun designs. I use them to practices with my Copic markers. Most designs are floral and is more for girls, wish they had one for boys.
I saw this artist on the TV show 60 minutes and absolutely felt the need to purchase the coloring book. I love it. Thank you so much for prompt delivery and care of delivery.
This is the most amazing Adult coloring book I have found.  I has many twists, and turns, mazes, hidden objects, and lots of room for you to add your own doodling.  AMAZING!!
It's hard to resist all the fabulous drawings crying for color. Great adult coloring book. I've already recommended to another adult colorer, who bought it and loves it, too.
Love the detailed illustrations. My only complaint is that the book is printed on both sides of the page. I can only color half of the pages, due to the ink bleeding through.
this book is so nice you find yourself looking for any spare time, even to color one object in the picture. totally beautiful art work.i think every age would enjoy this book
This is the first time I have sat down and colored in years.  It is relaxing and fun.<br/><br/>The book has beautiful pictures to color.  I would recommend it to a friend.
I purchased this for my daughter who loves to color at 17 years old :) she loves this book and so do I. I purchased a second one for my other daughter. Very very pretty book
We're coloring this using colored pencils and its provided hours and hours of entertainment. We love the whimsical designs and there's even the entire inside cover to color!
This book is so different in the most charming way.  I'm keeping it for a birthday gift and I have no doubt it will be well received.  I'm most enthusiastic about this book.
Great meditation time!
I bought 2 coloring books at the same time but always go for this one over the other because the pages are nice and thick. Love the scenes, too, they're super cute and fun!
This is a great piece of art and it feels like artwork as you color in it. You get to make it your own while also destressing after a long day. It's been truly a great buy.
Simply lovely! Definitely not for little children, these are very intricate and have some very tiny spaces to color in. I love every single page and enjoy coloring them in.
I bought this last spring and I guess I have the thinner paper- but I use colored pencils and I am thoroughly enjoying this! I never realized how much I missed coloring :)
Love this book. Much higher quality than I expected for a coloring book when it arrived and I picked it up out of the box. The other knock off books don't even compare.
I am following a stitching blog, and they are using this book as a source for a pattern.  I bought the book on their recommendation, and can't wait to get mine started.
I enjoyed this book, I really did. The only thing I really didn't like about it is it didn't have the removable lines, like other adult coloring books I have received!
I've been buying tons of adult coloring books lately. It's extremely relaxing and enjoyable. This one was a gift for my girlfriend that shes been dying to get forever!
This is supposed to be a popular adult coloring book. I like it just as much as my 13 year old boy. It is great distraction from the ever so attractive TV or computer!
I am in love with this book, I rated it as 4 stars because I cannot use my ink pens to color with, only pencils because the designs are on boths sides of the paper. :(
This was purchased for a Christmas present.  I'm sure the recipient is going to enjoy it.  Delivery was fast and all items arrived in great shape.  No complaints here!
I sent this as a gift and it was very well received. She really enjoyed how intricate the pictures were in this coloring book. I will probably buy one for myself now!
Some of parts could not be colored because they are hidden inside the edge of the binder. Really hope it can be removed as single page to have a better view to color.
Love this book, once I figured out which kind of markers/pens to use to avoid bleeding through to the back of the page. I'm slightly obsessed with finishing the book!
I wish my gardens could be as lovely as Johanna draws them. I love the whimsical nature of her gardens and love colouring them in ways that I'm sure are not the norm.
I received this book today, It's so amazing! I love this book. I hope this book can help me calm down. I hope coloring this book can make me happy, and less pressure.
I am a watercolor artist and was looking for something different for inspiration.  I found it here.  Beautiful pen and ink drawings along with activities to complete.
I am 34 years old and I still love to color! This book is amazing, it has so many details. There are even some "complete the drawing" pages to add your own touch to the page if you are a skilled artist unlike me! My sister can draw amazing pictures, so I am looking forward to giving her her copy of the book! I know she will love it just as much as I do! You can use a variety of Pens, Gel Pens, Markers, & colored pencils to color with. I haven't had any issues with any of them bleeding through the pages and I have used them all. I was surprised at the quality of the pages and how well the book itself is made, it even comes with a book cover! I have bought 2 of this book and 2 of The Enchanted Forest book also by her, I plan on buying 2 more of each to give as gifts to more of my friends who are big kids like me that love to color. The best coloring book I have ever come across by far. You wont be disappointed!
This  is a beautiful book but MUCH more ornate that I wanted.  I'm sure the pictures were awesome when finished but not for me.  I gave the book to my granddaughter.
I absolutely love this book, as an adult who loves to color it's nice to have something so detailed and whimsical, something that I want to hang on my own fridge. ;)
This is really well drawn...huge, lovely pictures to color in. I'm thoroughly enjoying this! Recommended for a little stress free coloring - almost like a kid again!
My niece loves it, an easy way to buy the love of a 6 year old.  (It does seem a little advanced for a 6 year old but she seems to be having fun with it regardless).
Very pretty! I love working on this. As many reviewers have said this is a great coloring book! Really interesting designs and it will take me forever to finish it.
I have many adult coloring books and this one is among my very favorite. I would imagine anything by this artist is a delight to own and color in. Highly recommend.
This book is cute and fun. Good variation of intricate and simple pages. There are even pages to add to. I just wish the pages were thick enough to handle markers.
I absolutely LOVE this coloring book. I use it as a self-care after a long week at work. I also use some of the pages with my teenage in therapy. Highly recommend!
Perfect for satisfying my creative desires in a simple manner. Reminds me of the Highlights magazine search for hidden<br/>objects that I love so much as a child!
My friend loves hers. Can't wait for Johanna Basford  makes some more...hope fully with faries in the forest...That would be neat.  A excellent seller I believe...
I am in love with this book. The details are fantastic, and every page has something new and interesting. It was on back order for weeks, but it was 100% worth it.
The illustrations are beautiful and intricate and so much fun to color.  You can photocopy and make invitations or photo mats, alot of possibilites with this book.
This book is going to be the basis for a standalone needlework project - which at the same time, encourages my artistic teenagers to stretch their creative juices.
Love her coloring books.  Love.  Love.  Love.  So much fun!  Definitely not for young kids though...teens through adults could be captivated by these for hours...
The pictures are beautiful and fun to color. Expect to spend a lot of time coloring each picture because of the small details in the pictures. Great way to relax.
Beautiful pictures, fun to color! The only thing that's not perfect is that the finish on the paper is hard to color with crayons. Fine tipped markers work great!
I got this coloring book and just love it.  I love to color and when I get started I can not stop.  It is a great pass time project.  I also got the forest book .
Very cute!! I am so excited to find all the critters in the book and see what beautiful pages I can create. I hear this is a great stress reliever!!! I hope so!!!
Got it today after it being back order for over a month. Worth the wait! I absolutely love the illustrations. Color pencils worked great. Beautiful coloring book.
I ordered two of these books after my grand-daughters visited a flower show in Chicago.<br/>Ages are 6 & 11 and they both have really enjoyed it. Shipped quickly
I learned not tp buy so quickly...for the money it is lacking in material. Has substance and good design. This was purchased for an 8 year old with special needs.
I am in love with this coloring book. I have used my colored pencils on a few pages but really think I will enjoy it more once my ultra fine tiped pens arrive...
So relaxing to sit down with this book and my adult colored pencils (Faber Castel) and just color away to my heart's content. Every page is different and unique.

One of the best coloring books made for adults. Use colored pencils and place cardboard under the page you are working on since there are drawings on both sides.
I love, love, love this adult coloring book.  Gorgeous pics to paint or color. I'm going to frame all<br/>of them and give as gifts.  Thank you Johanna Basford!
This is a beautiful book full of very detailed flowers. Hours upon hours will be spent on this coloring book. Worth the wait and most definitely worth the price.
Lots and lots of detail. Really is calming because it gives me a chance to think about what colors to use and what type of marker, pen, or pencil I want to use.
Absolutely Gorgeous coloring book. Beautiful detailed illustrations on thick quality paper. Also, loved that the book is a square shape. A pleasure to color in.
Just got it and I have to say I'm pleased with the amount of creativity that this book provides. I can see why it's rated so high, I will be buying the others.
This book is beautiful. I am using fine tip Sharpie pens to color the cover and so far the ink staying put. I'll probably switch to pencil on the inside page.
I am a psychotherapist and we recommend that adults have something like this for self-soothe. These are lovely pictures to color with pens or colored pencils.
Love my color book☀️
Works perfectly fine
BEAUTIFUL artwork! As another reviewer noted there are LOTS of leaves in Johanna's books. Of course they are the Secret Garden and the Enchanted Forest so...
Buy it now!!! It's AWESOME!!!  This morning, my three daughters, husband, and I were all working on one page of the book. Very cool!!!  I highly recommend!!!
Beautifully illustrated coloring book.  So many fun and surprising things hidden on each page, and best of all, in the back it shows you where everything is.
My wife spends many hours reveling in the magical garden.  It is a beautiful thing.  The designs are mesmerizing and once the color is added it is stunning.
the secret garden coloring book is fantastic, beautiful ... i bought it for my mother!  she loves it! she colors in it almost every day.  beautiful designs.
The pictures are beautiful and very intracate. I'm still working on the first page but I'm in no rush. Very relaxing! I can't wait to frame some of my work.
Love my coloring book! And watching and hearing Johanna's video only made me love it more. Just ordered Enchanted Forest. Can't wait to get it, for variety.
Bought this coloring book for myself and I love it! The illustrations are gorgeous. I plan on getting my girlfriend's this coloring book for their birthdays
Very beautiful book, purchased as a child's gift. Make sure your child is mature enough and has the motor skills and the patience to color a complex drawing
I find this book very relaxing because the prints are small, detailed and I have to concentrate.  I recommend it, but you may need your "readers"!
Beautiful book - it is a Christmas gift but I will have a hard time not coloring in it.  I had better wrap it soon.  Got the pencils too....they are great
It's not what you think it is. it's not for kids. it's made for stress-plagued adults like us. helped me recover from too much depression. thanks Johanna!
bought this for a gift for my best friend, and I am very pleased! The illustrations are stunning, and so intricate and delicate. beautiful coloring book!
Lots to color I like the gel pen but it uses a lot of ink. I also use colored pencils. The only thing I would change ,would be more flowers ,less leaves.
This book is beautiful! I have not colored any of the pages and honestly probably never will--but I love the beauty of this book and am happy to own it.
Really happy with this book.  Every illustration is nice.  The only thing I would like better is if the illustrations were only on one side of the page.
Bought one as a gift and one for myself because of how pretty it is.  Only warning is pictures are very intricate probably not the book for a beginner.
I love the pictures in this book! Beautiful illustrations. My only complaint It's not one side or perforated pages. Other than that, it's a great book!
Spectacular coloring book both for adults and children (ages 8 and up).<br/>Ordered three but only received two and have not yet sorted out my refund.
I currently have this coloring book myself and my daughter liked it so I bought her one for Christmas.  We love coloring and its a great stress relief.
This book is beautiful and has wonderful detail. I also like the hidden objects to find as I color. I use Crayola colored pencils and they work great/
This is an entertaining and beautiful coloring book for all ages; makes an excellent calming or meditative diversion from hecticness of everyday life.
Cool coloring book. The only reason it only got four stars is dues to it having a picture on both sides, so no markers unless you photocopy the pages.
This book is well made and has beautiful illustrations.  Paper quality is thick enough to allow for coloring with crayons, markers or colored pencils.
Such a fun book! I have difficulty putting it down! What a great coloring book for adults! Each picture has so much detail and encourages creativity.
Nice drawings but cannot take pages and markers leak to underneath. Drawing should only be on one side. This info should be addressed before purchase
The illustrations are wonderful, very intricate and fancy full. Look forward to seating down to de stress with it.<br/>It would be a wonderful gift!
A great colouring book, I find it very relaxing.Have also the Enchanted Forest,saving for later, when the days get shorter and more time on my hands.
Great coloring book. I use it when I have some downtime. I listen to relaxing music, and it's so calming to do nothing but color. It relieves stress!
So very pretty I am having a hard time bringing myself to color. I try and back away. If you don't appreciate the art, it's a fabulous coloring book.
I just recently started coloring in the adult coloring books. I really love the secret garden and all of its hidden critters you find in every page.
I love the details of this coloring book and that it is as big as a dinner plate. The book price relative to what you're getting is a steal. Really.
I work at a desk all day on the phones.  I bought this to help pass the time, and it works.  Beautiful illustrations, and very good quality paper.
Fabulous book and pictures. There were so many beautiful pictures I wasn't sure where to start. Make a wonderful gift as well. Good for all ages!
I have not received my book yet........but my sister recommended it to me as being the greatest........am so anxious to get it and start coloring
This was a great gift for my 7-year-old granddaughter and my 35-year-old daughter! They both love to color and this was a new idea for them both.
Do you need to de-stress?  Wow, this is a great way to do that!  I get caught up in coloring and lose all sense of time and find it so peaceful!
IT WAS BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND THE PICTURES ARE VERY SMALL AREAS TO COLOR. BUT ALOT OF SMALL  PICTURES. JUST WASN'T WHAT I THOUGHT
Delightful fun for children and adults. Stunning pictures and a stress relieving activity that results in beautiful keepsakes. A fantastic book.
Good book with the lovely details. After coloring this, i feel so refresh and the world around was changed a little bit with more bright color.
Another beautiful book full of complex drawings for "adult" coloring - a zen-like activity that, for me, lessens the stress of the day.
Absolutely beautiful!  Having fun coloring in these beautiful pages, it's very relaxing!  I highly recommend it for anyone who is stressed out!
It exceeded my expectations! It's beautiful and worth every cent. It will take you plenty of time to complete, so you won't finish it too soon.
Awesome coloring book! There's a lot of detail so this will definitely keep me busy for a long time. Getting more for gifts when back in stock!
This book is nothing short of amazing! My daughter got this along with a set of fiskars gel pens and she has loved it so much highly recommend!
This book was recommended for a needlework project which I am happily doing now.  It is also a lovely was to pass the time with colored pencils
This is a fabulously gorgeous book!! Its well worth the price! I wish this author would come out with more of these books with different themes
What a wonderful coloring book for adults.  The pictures are delightful and I can easily spend hours coloring in this with my colored pencils.
It's a fun book to color. I bought it because it was a bestseller.  I'm happy I did.There is so much to color. I even colored the front cover.
The best coloring book that I have used. I like to use felt pens and not pencils.  This book  looks great and I would recommend. It to anyone.
It's beautifully graphic, such detail. good quality paper. I plan on buying more. Yes I would recommend it to anyone young or "older".
This is great entertainment while sitting and relaxing,is beautifully designed pictures look like great art hen finished highly recommend it !
Another stunning collection of illustrations.  Beautiful to look at and soothing to color.  I have two of her books and a third on pre-order.
I waited for a long time for this book to print and ship. I am so happy and pleased with it. I'm using colored pencils and it looks awesome.
I bought this for my mom and the wait was worth it!  She loves it and enjoys getting lost in the simplicity of coloring (like a child does).
Beautiful drawings, exquisite detailed coloring book for the not so young.  Probably best for colored pencils and be at least ten years old.
beautiful drawings. Very soothing. Recommend you splurge on a BIG box of colored pencils... The 24 pack isn't enough to do this justice. :)
Great drawings, fun to color. Can get very detailed. Looks great when used with gel pens. Some of the designs would make awesome tattoos =)
Love this book for inspiration when drawing flowers, petals, leaves, vines, etc. Simple packed with lovely little illustrations and beauty.
I love this!  It was seriously worth the wait while it was out of stock for months on end.  The illustrations are beautiful and intricate.
The perfect hobby. This is one the most beautiful coloring books I've had. Please use the recommended pencils and pens you wont regret it.
This book is full of intricate and detailed pictures. Flowers and animals that would make great pictures to frame if you feel so inclined.
Love this product too. Offering hours of instant pleasure it stimulates the mind and allows you to become your own master colour creator.
This book is so much fun!!! You find different objects as you are coloring that you didn't see prior to starting!! Fun and challenging!!!
Love this - a great way to pass the time. I do wish the pages weren't double sided - this makes it difficult to use markers for coloring.
This coloring book is absolutely amazing ~ the detail is beautiful ~ so much fun to color, I plan on buying another once this one is done
LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  I like to work on small drawings so this is perfect for me.  So if you have bad eyesight may not be good for you...lol
LOOKING FOREWARD TO SPENDING MANY PLEASURABLE HOURS GETTING LOST IN IT<br/>QUALITY MATERIAL AND AN ITEM WORTH GIVING AS A GIFT TO ANYONE
the best book among the other coloring books that i'v purchased!<br/>i would seriously recommend anyone to buy it! diffidently worth it
For the price I think there should be more coloring pages. I do not like that the pages are 2 sided, I would like to frame some of them.
Such pretty drawings! It will take a while to complete the book as it is very detailed, but it's a great calming activity for any adult!
Fun adult coloring book.  I use gel pens with no bleed through issues.  It relaxes and center my mind.  My 5 year old likes to help too!
This book is beautiful, and such nice quality. I use colored pencils, so no issues with bleeding through the paper that others have had,
This is a beautiful book!  I ordered it for my artistic daughter who does drawings very similar to the ones in this book.  She loves it!
Really incredible pictures to color. So intricate and beautiful. If you use markers they do bleed they the pages. I use colored pencils.
I love this book because it has so many great designs and pictures!  Beautiful designs and many new ideas that I haven't thought of yet.
This coloring book is nice, but too detailed at times.  I like that it has a scavenger hunt, but I wish the designs were less detailed.
It's not the kind of book that would make sense copying the pages so you could try coloring them differently.  Still attractive, though
my wife loves it. help her calm down and relax. The charming part is you can choose whatever color you choose, the picture looks great.
This book is the prettiest coloring book I 've ever seen. It is so different than any coloring book I have seen before.  Very creative.
Interesting and very detailed pictures. Good quality and makes a unique gift with a set of good colored pencils. If you can give it up!
I LOVE this book. I've been wanting this book for a while and it does not disappoint. It's sold out everywhere locally. Hooray Amazon!
I bought two of these for granddaughters.  I wish I had purchased one for me too.  What great detail!  Fun to do with colored pencils
Wonderful coloring book for adults to children...pages do not tear out and the pages are double sided! Other than that a great book!
It is a 5 star. I have enjoyed hours of<br/>creating beautiful colors in these<br/>awesome pictures.  It is so calming to do this.
Very beauiful.  My 15 yr old daughter loves this.  She saw a friend's and had to have it.  She has spent hours working on this book.
It's all what I was expecting, thank you very much to the designer and the seller. The order arrives even before the delivery date.
I'm looking forward to using many of the designs for embroidery patterns. Love the designs and book size.  Nice book for the value.
There aren't words for how much I adore this book.  I've been spending my time with each picture and I just love coloring in this.
I have looking for a coloring book for adults and this is the best and my favorite that I have found. The pictures are so pretty!!
Wonderful way to spend time with my 6 year old. Capable of holding both of our attention! Recommend this for adults and kids alike
These are by far the best coloring pages I have seen.  They are very detailed and do take some time, but they come out beautiful.
Nice! Packaged well,to protect during shipping! Beautiful pics to color and enjoy. Nice bookcovering too. Bigger than I expected.
One of my favorite relaxation activities. This book is full of so many pages you can color. I prefer color pencils for this book.
Bought for my niece, she loves it. She's finding her artistic side. Would recommend to everyone learning to draw outside the box.
Not for children, but I love this book.  Can be used for mandala like concentration.  Very beautiful, and very detailed designs!
I live in the interior of Alaska where it is harder to garden, so this help my green thumb and my artist side ant the same time!
my new addiction
One of my favorites! I just love all the tiny hidden treasures. It adds an element of fun to a relaxing and enjoyable activity.
so pretty! bigger that i thought, every page is more beautiful that the last one, you really look forward to put color on it :)
fantastic!!! colouring for both my husband and I is a time to let all our stress and worries subside for a time while colouring
This is a great outlet for me - I get to feel creative and be quiet and peaceful at the same time. I recommend this for anyone!
Magical coloring. Gave it a 4 -star as I the coloring area of many of the pages are very tiny and require good eyes or glasses.
This book is great!  My two grandsons love coloring on the pages and finding the pictures!  Really entertaining time consuming!
It's a very cool book, but I personally would have liked larger pictures and maybe a less busy.  But her artwork is so pretty.
This was done really well nice art work.one suggestion<br/>Should be one sided printing...some pens bleed through other side
Great for winding down, and stress relief.  The artwork is beautiful with a good variety. I would recommend this to everyone.
I would give this 5 stars except the paper sucks and markers bleed through it. I even copied it into other paper to color it.
In my 60 years I have never seen more beautiful illustrations. You won't be dissapointed! I bought another one for my friend.
book is great but the printing, the paper 3 pages has holes in it. and an oil stain. made when it was published and printed.
Love this book. It is such a stress reliever and so relaxing on a Sunday afternoon when you just want to chill on the couch.
Some pages seemed a bit plain, but overall the photos are wondering and I have a great relaxing time coloring everything in.
Beautiful and mesmerizing to color. For adults or children that love color, art, finding balance and it's meditative to too.
Love all the pictures in this book. It was in high demand when I got mine, so it took a little longer than normal to arrive.
Gorgeous - I wish I would have purchased one for all my adult friends who color - but I still have time before Christmas....
the pictures are wonderful and coloring them has brought me peace I took it on the airplane and it was a perfect distraction
We love this book! it is a perfect stress-buster.  Great for all ages, and easy to throw in a bag with some colored pencils.
Okay this book is such a good idea for adults who love coloring books and the artist has talent. The only thing that I do not like about it is that the pages are mostly LEAVES. I try and color a page but there are SO many leaves to color in that I start getting bored of it and have to continue it later. It takes me about 3-4 days just to finish a page because it gets tiring. I understand it is a GARDEN book and of course there are going to be a lot of leaves but I wish there was more to it, like maybe add something different like fairies, animals in a garden, etc... very cool book though and i do plan on buying the ocean one, that one seems like it would be more fun.
The paper is a good, heavy quality. The book has a good mix of tiny detailed work & larger pictures to balance it. Love it!
My daughter loves this book.  Very creative and fun.<br/><br/>Only downside is most markers will bleed through the pages.
i love all of her work and continue to color. I could be coloring these magical drawings for days!!!! Love love love these
What a wonderfully done coloring book for an adult.  And the search and find was fun.  The paper and binding were so nice.
Beautiful ,bought one for myself and loved it so much went back and ordered 4 more to give as Christmas/ Birthday gifts !
Really like the book - lots of little "gems" to find. I use gel pens so the colors don't bleed through the pages.
This is a beautiful book, but be aware that the details are very tiny in some of the designs, and are difficult to color.
Beautiful and mesmerizing to color. For adults or children that love color, art, finding balance and it's meditative too!
I bought this for my daughter but am keeping it for myself, love it, endless hours of creativity.  Will be ordering more.
Beautiful book.
Beautiful, intricate pictures and thick paper that you can use pens on without worrying about bleeding onto other pages.
Beautiful book! Great for relaxing and coloring. I was given this as a gift, and I ordered it to give to another friend!
My seven year old daughter loved this book as a Christmas present.  Why do they require so many characters for a review?
A wonderful way to de-compress. I found that I need to lay a paper between pages so that gel pens do not bleed through.
Yay! I am absolutely in love with this book! Beautiful Illustrations! Can not wait to pick up the others in the series.
BEAUTIFUL. Good page thickness. I think the only thing that will bleed through the pages would be pretty heavy sharpie.
This is a great book. Although I have yet to do so, you can color this and do a word search. I am very excited here!!!!
very detailed i use colored pencils the paper is thick but i didnt want to take the chance of bleed thru with felt pens
This was a beautiful birthday present for my daughter. High quality, much nicer than I expected. What a happy surprise!
There is so much to color. I keep discovering more places to color (inside the slip cover). And the designs are great!
There is something so peaceful about coloring. I love Johanna's books. If you are thinking about ordering this, DO IT!
LOVED MINE SO MUCH I GOT THIS ONE AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND.  SHE LOVES IT JUST AS MUCH AS ME!  COLORING IS THE NEW YOGA!
Great coloring book. The paper is beautiful, kind of yellow. I have both of johanna Basford book and I like them both.
Such pretty pictures! And having a little something extra to look for makes it a little like a puzzle, too.  Fun book!
One of my favorite go-to art therapy books for young adults. Cannot speak highly enough of paper and quality printing.
The most entertaining, best 'color' books I've ever seen.  Will be ordering more as soon as someone has them in stock.
Love it.  The drawings are beautiful.  The act of coloring does really allow you to clear your mind and is relaxing.
Arrived on time.  Love the book, can't wait to use it. Just need to go buy my specials colored pencils for the book.
There is a lot of small space to color in this book. The details are gorgeous. I enjoy using gel pens with this one.
Beautiful designs.  Thick paper.  A gift for my teenage niece - she loves it.  Would be appropriate for adults too.
Love this book and envision many pleasant hours spent coloring! I plan on purchasing several more to give as gifts.
The drawings in this coloring book are amazing! So many details....so fun to pick out which colors to use! Love it!
Loving this coloring books.. Highly recommended.. I used staedler fine liner pens on this cover.. They work great!
This book is beautiful! The paper is fantastic quality and the drawings are just amazing. It is such fun to color!
Beautiful and very relaxing. I love the feel of the paper and the drawings are so intricate they are breathtaking.
this is really a beautiful book. I got it for Mia who was turning 8 but her mom and aunt also like to color in it.
Gave it as a gift and she loved it. The drawings are beautiful and you can get as creative as you'd like with it.
Helps me kill time and enhances my creativity side. Just make sure to use the right type of coloring pens though.
Had to order this item because of the fabulous reviews and i haven't been disappointed in the quality of design!!
A lot of the designs are very tiny and hard to color without going outside the lines. It kind of stresses me out.
Beautiful, high quality coloring book. I'm so glad I ordered it and will definitely order more from this series.
This book was thick and was had more picture than I had expected.  This is probably the best book on the market.
this was totally worth the money I spent.  I have loved every minute of it and can't wait to buy her other books
Very much enjoyed the intricate design work...and the pages were a nice thick stock able to handle the gel pens!
It met all of my expectations.  Although, it is so lovely in its original form it's hard to imagine coloring it.
One of my most favorite coloring books for adults! So much detail and humor. A very fresh approach to coloring.
The designs are fabulous as soon as you open it you will  want to start coloring!  Love!  Doodling on steroids!
Better than expected. I will buy a couple more as Christmas presents. Beautiful presentation, great materials.
I purchased one for a gift, but had to keep one for myself and will save it for the harsh New England winters!
So pretty, I don't ever want a crayon/marker/pencil to touch it! I'll use it as a coffee table book instead :)
Just a nice adult coloring book. I find it relaxing. Pages don't hold up to felt pens though. Wish they would.
I have not used this. It was a Christmas gift for our granddaughter. She loved it and her mother liked it too.
A really beautiful book. Intricate, fascinating illustrations with hidden objects interspersed through the pages. Its like getting two books in one! The paper is heavy enough to withstand markers without bleed through. This really isn't a coloring book for young children ~ the illustrations are much to complex and intricate for a young child. A perfect option for someone with patience, a steady hand and good eyesight and a set of fine tip coloring markers. I also purchased the matching set of Secret Garden Note Cards; Secret Garden Postcards and the set of 3 Secret Garden Mini-Journals.
This is an amazing coloring book for all of us who are young at heart.  The flowers are absolutely beautiful.
Perfect for colored pencil. Small areas aid in helping me strengthen my eye muscles. Paper is nice and thick.
Finally I realize why all my friends are crazy for the Secret Garden. I can't help myself not to coloring it!
Wonderful book with hours of patterns to color!  Have recommended it to all my friends!  So relaxing and fun!
fun to color - don't like suggestions typed on pages to draw other stuff - I can't draw that's why I color :)
I bought this for a ten year old and I love it so much I almost couldn't send it. It is absolutely Beautiful!
This book is fun for both of my daughters!  They each have one and spend lots of time coloring the pictures!
I wanted something to color to dr stress and this book does a nice job with that. I love how detailed it is.
I love this book because it gives me so many ideas for my embroidery, the pictures are nice and yet complex.
It is a wonderful book! I love the simplicity and the fun it gives the reader.  I would highly recommend it!
I'm not sure why people are complaining about paper quality... My pens do not go through this paper at all.
Soooo much fun ! Love to color while I sit with<br/>husband watching bad tv !!!! (Hers are the best ones!)
Gorgeous designs, so many images. Fun activities - but ask you to be very creative. A good and fun stretch.
Have waited for the book for so long. It's super popular among my friends! I can calm down after paining^_^
My first coloring book! I am now addicted to coloring to find calm and tranquility. You will enjoy the book
I LOVE this book! Every page is absolutely gorgeous, and coloring in it so relaxing. Hours of coloring fun!
Love this book! Filled with flowers and butterflies my fav! My tween granddaughter loves coloring with me!!
Challenging.  Haven't had much time to use it lately.  If you like to doodle with colors.  This is for you.
It would be nice if the pages would lie completely flat. Part of the coloring area is lost in the binding.
Absolutely love this coloring book. I have spent many hours coloring with my kids over the last few weeks.
The best out of the few I ordered, my go to when I have a few minutes to spare for a little stress relief.
Beautiful illustrations, interesting and intricate! For mature teens or adults - great stress reliever!
Beautiful book with hours of coloring.  Great for my art loving ten year old and I to work on together!
Ahh what a sweet, beautiful book. If you haven't tried adult coloring, don't wait, just do it already!
These books are amazing! Lots of pages to color, awesome pictures Great product and price!! Thank you!
Had to wait a while to get this but well worth the wait. I gifted it to my daughter who just loves it.
I love this coloring book especially with all the details. It helped me with focus and being creative.
This is a very pretty book and I love it. It takes a long time to color and there are so many details.
Fun and relaxing.... I just wish I had more time to take advantage of the different drawings to color
MY FAVORITE of all the coloring books I have gotten. EXTREME FUN and relaxing. Some I plan to frame!!
Love these!  Have used as gifts -- for adults - with colored pencils.  Very beautiful and fun to draw
Basford's books are the very best.  Quality of paper is amazing and her artistic talent is inspiring.
I bought this for my neice at Christmas. She loves it! It's great for adults or kids! Such a delight!
This book is great! It's a great time filler and very fun. You don't have to be artistic to enjoy it.
Very disappointed! Some pages of the book are broken! Cannot color!
Love this book!! It was delivered in time and came in perfect conditions!! I totally recommend it!!!
This was actually a birthday gift. The pictures are very intricate but pretty. Lots of coloring fun!
This was my first adult coloring book.  I wish that I can tear out the pages to frame after I color.
Great designs! Turn out beatiful with color penciles, but Bic mark it ultra fine marks come through.
Exciting to color and create colorful pictures and images.  Look forward to working on all the pages
The secret garden is wonderful thank you so much it's a lovely thing to do in the winter by the fire
I am very very dissatisfied with this book because of the quality of it.  It was shipped from china ..<br/>II am familiar with this book because I have viewed in other stores.  The ink in the pictures in this book is transferring from one page to another which  makes it impossible to color in.  The paper quality is suitable for coloring because it is the quality of thin copy paper and, he book is not as sturdy as others that I have seen..<br/><br/>It seems to be a cheap knock off.  And I had to wait a long time to get it.
The quality of the paper is fantastic. I am super pleased with this coloring book. I just love it.
Great stress reliever.  But I do suggest colored pencils over pens which I think are too heavy....
I got one for me then ordered one for a friend.  We are really enjoying being kids again coloring!
The cover page is a little worn and two pages inside are wrinkled , but overall in fair condition.
Very nice book, the feel is like a 30$ book. Great pictures to dive into to start making colorful.
Saw this at the store and had to rush home to buy it! Great price and I can't wait to get started!
I bought this book as a gift and I'm going to order another one for myself. It's really beautiful.
Very neat book, with lots of details. Great gift for a teenager or adult. Fun to use with gel pens
good quality
The only coloring books I will use are by Johanna. She is so talented. Amazing, amazing, amazing.
I'm in love with this coloring book! The details are amazing and I'm so pleased with the quality!
I am an adult and I color a lot just to relax...it's so fun. This coloring book made me so happy.
All the images are so detailed. I enjoy doing this, it really takes my mind off stressful things.
Like this coloring book very much! Paper quality is good. Started coloring the day I received it.
Didn't disappoint, have ordered the other one and one coming out in the Fall.  I love the detail.
Other than it taking a few months to receive it is a great item.  I can't wait to start using it.
Found this to be challangeing and fun to do. A good book for adults to get lost in coloring. Fun.
This is so fun. She's a talented artist. Only complaint is that markers bleed through the pages.
My wife loves this, but I am giving it 4 stars cause I think its a rip off for a coloring book.
Perfect as described<br/>
Such an amazing book! Won't buy any othe coloring book from now on unless it's by this artist.
If you want to get lost in coloring and forget everything, then this coloring book is for you.
I'm having so much fun. Have only used glitter gel pens so far and no bleed through the paper.
Waited for this book to be printed again and I'm glad I did...it is absolutely worth the wait.
Shortcoming is that drawings are too intricate and too small for me and my wife's shaky hands.
Beautiful coloring book, I just need to purchase some good pens. This is a pen coloring book.
So in love with this. I just use regular color pencils. Going to try pens. But it's wonderful
I love it!  My friends have seen mine and now want to order their own. It's the perfect size!
will work on during the winter while I am waiting for my Spring and Summer garden to work in.
i love it but it was on back order for like months but its cool<br/>they kept me in the loop
Pretty much the best coloring book for adults, ever. Such a great "waste of time". :D
I ordered these for my 5 year old and 7 year old daughters and they love them!  A great gift!
I love it.I have a lot of anxiety and depression and I have found that coloring relaxing me.
I wonder how long it may take me to color this book from front to back.  Very nice doodling.
A lovely coloring book! Our kiddos have really enjoyed this not-your-average, coloring book!
this might be my favorite! I love that you can add your own doddles to the pictures as well.
Great quality book and beautiful drawings! Bought one each for my step-daughter and myself!
It's a beautiful book, but the print is so small. I find it more frustrating than relaxing.
My desire to draw, color, paint is still being satisfied (as a child) with the lovely book.
Wonderful book. Love it
Love this book full of lovely gardens and flowers. The perfect outlet for my creative urge.
I love this book! Though it was on back order for a few months, it was well worth the wait!
Beautiful book, but much more intricate than I expected. None the less will enjoy using it.
gorgeous black & white pages ready for sparking creativity - high quality images and paper.
This is a gorgeous, good quality book. A gift for my granddaughter who absolutely loves it!
Great adult coloring book.  Lots of detailed designs to color and complete.  Very charming.
The paper is of a quality suitable for felt tip pens and there are even pages with gentle spaces to encourage the user to pen a few designs in black fine point. Along the way there are also hidden images to find on every page. What I didn't expect was how much I would be inspired by the designs. These would make beautiful needlework conversions into cross stitch or embroidery works of art. The layout and dust jacket are small but important features and make giving this a joy.
As advertised. Beautiful drawings. Kept me occupied from my hospital bed. Prompt delivery.
All my friends and coworkers want this book now!  I can't wait to start using it to relax!
Great book!
This coloring book has. Lot of detail and is fun to color.  I would definitely recommend.
AMAZING!  The print quality is beautiful!  I got lost in coloring for hours in this book.
Just purchased this and can't wait to try it. The pages are so detailed and look so fun!
Some of the designs repeat with leaves and flowers, but it's lovely and fun to color in!
Really have to  push hard to get colored pencils to work on page. Pretty designs though!
So gorgeous! And the pages are nice and thick so you can use almost any medium to color!
Lovely designs ~ almost too pretty to color. For now, I'm just enjoying looking at them!
Bought for my two girls, and am buying two more for me and my mother! These are awesome!
Poor choice to have pictures printed on both sides of page. Markers will blead through.
Excellent!
Good, but lots of tiny, tiny, tiny things to color.  Sometimes simpler is better.
I find myself unwinding as I color in this book.  It is a stress reliever for me.
Love this book! Great pass time activity. Fun to watch the pictures come to life!
Part of a gift. The recipient is really enjoying the book and the beautiful art.
Love Love Love! I love this drawing or painting book. It's fun! and beautiful!!!
Really love Johanna's artwork. This is one of the best coloring books out there.
Don't recommend markers- the colors bleed through to the image on the back page.
Really nice coloring book... a must for the adult ...ehhm... coloring person :O)
Great for meditation tool. Bought for a sick friend with gel pens. She loves it!
I gave this lovely coloring book to a nine year old guest who I hadn't met, a little girl, with some nice gel pens.  I figured it might amuse her during a stay with our family, and when it arrived I was entranced by the wonderful drawings and format.  Our guest Sage loved it and my only regret was that I could not find a few moments to sit with her and color.  So after the holidays, I purchased another for myself!
Beautiful illustrations, and of an extremely high quality.  Makes a lovely gift
I love this book!! It has been so relaxing and fun adding color to these pages!
This is a wonderful and fun coloring book.  Makes me happy every time I use it!
there are a few extra tiny bits to color where you will need a magnifying glass
I love this coloring book. It was the best price I could find and it came fast!
the picture are very nicely done. it just took a very long time to get the book
This book is so over rated. Not happy with it at all. Going back to the store.
Beautifully designed. Helped me de-stress. Author is so talented and creative!
I have learned some much from this color book and I'm only on the second page!
It's a wonderful book with lots of pages begging to be colored in.  I love it.
A beautiful book. I just took up coloring as an adult and am loving this book.
This book is beautiful! Even without color the nature just jumps off the page.
Gorgeous and fun coloring book.  Now I can stay entertained during church.  :)
I enjoy every minute that I spend colouring in the beautiful, unique drawings.
The mist beautiful little book . Amazing ink drawings . Fun games entertaining
Love Love Love this book. If you are looking for a gift, this one is perfect!
love it, Ordered it for my sister whos going through alot and shes loving it.
Beautiful and relaxing.  I have this and enchanted forest and love them both.
I love this coloring book! It will probably take me many years to fill it up!
I received it in good condition and sent it on to my Aunt Inky. She loves it!
I've spent more on markers then I have the book. Going to treasure this hunt!
what a beautiful book, worth the wait, can't wait to use it more on vacation.
This is a very beautiful coloring book. I bought it for myself and I love it.
So much fun! Haven't used it a bunch yet because it is just so pretty as is!
Wonderful book.  Very detailed pictures that give you hours of coloring fun.
Such an adorable coloring book! Well made, thick pages, and clever drawings.
Christmas present for my wife.  She was ecstatic when she looked through it.
Perfect coloring book for adults.  Framing after you are done would be cute.
I can choose to either color these pictures with paint or embroidery thread.
Absolutely beautiful coloring and activity book that encourage creativity.
Very good coloring book, time killer during the summer! Highly recommend!
I really liked the book: Good illustration, good print, good thick paper.
This book has a lot of leaves to color, other than that its a lot of fun.
The book came very quickly and I'm satisfied with the product. Thank you!
I ordered and paid for a gift wrapped, and the book did not come with it.
Great drawings. I bought the suggested pens and they work great. Love it.
It's even better in person! I love it. It's my first adult coloring book.
This is a beautiful coloring book. Great gift for adults as well as teens
love This book! It is very detailed and the thick crisp pages are a dream
Many relaxing hours with lots of intricate details, excellent purchase.
Love this coloring book. I bought a few of them for friends and family!
Great coloring book, will keep you busy of countless hours (literally).
I really like it the pictures are so nice and coloring is very relaxing
Looking forward to many hours of pleasure with these beautiful designs.
Took a while to get but I love it! Beautiful pictures to get lost in!!!
Beautiful drawings! Great for doodling or creating a beautiful picture.
So cute.  I will order more as gifts.  I wish she would do another one.
This is such a nice book! The paper and binding are very high quality, and it's definitely something you can display on a shelf. The gold foil on the cover is also really nice. The only improvement they could've made is lay flat pages. That's kindof important for a coloring book. The illustrations are gorgeous though.Every page has a new unique intricate design.
I bought several coloring books and Johanna Basford's art is superior.
Very lovely art work, but not too happy that the illustrations are printed back to back.
I bought this second one for my teenage granddaughters.  They LOVE IT.
A beautiful coloring book that will easily consume hours of your time.
Its pretty, surprisingly good quality, the paper is thick.. I love it!
Absolutely beautiful!  So many wonderful images to color and discover.
Love this coloring book. The pages have beautiful drawings and detail!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, the pictures.  Can't wait to get started coloring !!
I can't really speak for my wife but she seems to be thrilled with it.
Beautiful and time consuming.  Just the right project for a vacation.
Great book! Lots of hours of coloring and lots of hours of nostslgia!
Was worth the wait for this book never lost interest in her creations
Except the not-friendly smells, all the other aspects are pretty good
have not started to color  have thump thru and very pleased with book
Love the intricate designs, but the quality of the paper is terrible. It easily shreds using blending solutions like gamsol. Also, its double sides making it IMPOSSIBLE not to ruin pictures when using felt tip markers. Its very hard to have an "inky" adventure when its constantly bleeding on the paper and ruining the pictures on the other side.
My mom loves coloring in this book. So relaxing & meditative. <3
Excellent way to spend your leisure time rather than glued to the TV
Love this so much. I'm learning to unleash my creativity once again.
Saw this at Hastings in the books area. It was cheaper priced & new.
This came finally after a long wait, and it's exactly what I wanted.
great book, pages are thick enough that markers don't bleed through.
Love my Secret Garden coloring book.  Fun also to find the secrets.
Came in when expected!  Slight damage on corner but not a big deal.
love the book<br/>but the gift packing was damaged during shipping
Loved it! Great way to kill the time and find your innovation back!
Love it!
Such a beautiful book. The paper is heavy and gorgeous. Well done!
A fun coloring book with great illustrations on nice weight paper.
I really liked this coloring book, great to have and  easy to use.
Love this book. Beautiful artwork! Recommended it to many friends.
Thick pages, beautiful art, relaxing, buy it! You won't regret it.
This book is full of great art work to color. Great way to relax.
I love it and its going to take me forever to color all the pages
This is such a neat book. Very intricate, but still fun to color.
I love the coloring book. I am looking forward to all the others.
Coloring is fun, even at my age! This coloring book zones me out!
THis book is really beautiful, great use for colored pencil user.
Love this book - fun to color in and really nice feminine designs
I love these coloring books, very meditative. Beautifully drawn.
Nice intricate designs.  Ideal for an adult attentive to detail.
Beautifully done. I bought 3 for my co workers !! We are hooked!
This is great for adults to have fun and relieve some stress. :)
Awesome! !  SO GREAT I ORDERED ONE FOR MY NIECE FOR CHRISTMAS 🎄
I was excited to get the book.  I bought colored pencils and am loving "coloring".  I have also copied a couple of pages so I could use markers.  My daughter-in-law is excited for her month to have the book, as we are all going to share.  Since National Coloring Day was recent, I saw the book on Facebook posts also.
Its was gift to my sister she loved it.
You simply can't go wrong with Joanna Basford's coloring books.
With all of the detail in this book, my creative side loves it!
Only complaint is designs go to the center where book is bound.
The coloring book is beautifully done, its a art work of pages.
This is lovely.  I will order another for my sister's birthday.
Beautiful book, lovely quality, great price and quick service.
Wife loves it. Seems to calm her down and keeps the mind busy.
Same thing double-sided pages do not work very disappointing .
Same thing double-sided pages do not work very disappointing .
I find the drawings great to colour in and they are wonderful.
The pictures are beautiful and I can't wait to start coloring!
Don't know, didn't have a chance to get to it, but looks good.
great book. will be for my niece. lots to color. fast delivery
It is even more beautiful than it appears online.  Great gift!
Got this for my 13yr old niece. She was all wide eyed over it.
Disappointed. Item was not plastic wrapped and the surface of the book was slightly stained. The paper used is of quite thick, however, it's more to the recycled paper quality which is more yellowish and harder for the colouring to be shown. I would much prefer the pure white paper. Will be returning this item.
I love it! It's gonna be my stress reliever!  I've been looking for something like this since forever. Not long ago I was wondering if there was such things like these Like coloring books but for adults (and I just found out that its always been there) , but I never tried to look for it. This book is beautiful!
Such awesome pages! Highly recommend!<br/>Arrived on time!:)
Not as fun for me as the other inky color books; but it's ok.
My second buy. I give it away to my friends and they love it!
Love this book.  Can't wait for the Lost Ocean to come out!!!
So much love- beautiful drawings, hours of peaceful coloring.
Awesome pictures and detail on each page! Makes a great gift!
I loved coloring when I was much younger and I still like it.
just like enchanted forest, i am going to have fun with this.
Great drawings; lots of ideas to use for my quilting projects
I haven't actually colored in the book but love the pictures.
It is a beautiful book and something you will enjoy forever.
Grandma loved it something for her to do with the grandkids.
Beautiful line drawings just waiting for you to add coloring
I got this for myself and I love it. Fantastic pictures.....
Love this book. Plan to buy more of hers in the near future.
This is a lovely book. My 12 year old is really enjoying it.
Wow!  What a pretty coloring book. Definitely for grown ups!
I loved to color as a child and received this for my 44th birthday. As an artist, this book let's me explore different techniques for using colored pencils while enjoying a favorite childhood activity. This is a book that can be enjoyed by all ages. It's beautiful, fun, challenging, and highly enjoyable.
This is my second copy of the great coloring book. Love it.
So wonderfully relaxing to color when you are in your 60's.
This keeps me busy for hours- and is a great stress relief!
Love it! Nice detail. This is my third book....so relaxing.
fun whimsical pages to color with hidden creatures to find.
Retiring Oct 31st then when the snow flies.I will be ready!
Colored pencils needed rather than crayons. Beautiful book!
Great for hours of entertainment while listening to NPR :-)
so much fun.  The pictures are beautiful and very detailed.
My kids loved this book - I bought 4 to give away as gifts!
this is an amazing book, i love it and i got it very quick.
A beautiful coloring book. It is very pleasant to color in.
Love this book! Need fine point markers or pencils though.
I have one and have several for gifts. They are so pretty!
I love these types of coloring books! They're so relaxing!
I really love it, beautiful designs and good paper quality
Absolutely beautiful.  Good stress reliever for every one.
I love this book. It is beautiful. Like other reviewers I would have happily paid an extra few days dollars for it to be spiral bound (lays flat), single sided on paper appropriate for markers. I will use colored pencils but the spaces are very small and would be more suited to ink. Thank you!
These were an out of state gift, the receiver loves it!!!
Absolutely terrific coloring book.  Purchased for myself.
I love the pictures and the little treasures you can find
Well packaged.  Exactly as described.  I am well pleased.
Love it....found a new way to keep myself creatuvely busy
When i'm stressed or frustrated or just want to doodle it's my go to. It is amazing I seen it actually posted by an actress named Kirsten Storm who posted on Instagram she was the one that kind of had me look into it and it's actually a really really good book of coloring it's awesome
Excellent quality...the best of the best...quality paper
Many interesting pages to choose from.  A great variety.
A beauitiful, detailed, thick book with heavy-duty paper
Another beautiful coloring that is so much fun to color!
I'm so impressed by the quality of this book. Love it ~
Lovely lovely drawings-wish they were not double-sided.
BEAUTIFUL! Great for adults....the art work is amazing.
Anything with that title will draw in all girls, women.
great purchase, fast shipping, and love the book itself
Love this coloring book as do friends who received it!!
Very intricate! It's great for a fun, but quiet and peaceful afternoon! And it has some beautiful pictures and prompts on blank (or nearly blank) pages to use also! I used gel pens and colored pencils in this book, and the pages are thick enough that nothing bleeds through.
Bought this along with Enchanted Forest for my wife and she adores them! Thirty something mother of three and she hums happily while carefully coloring each page. Great fun if you love coloring. If you don't, stop your pretentiousness and just enjoy the simple things a bit.
HAD TO ORDER THIS ONE AFTER I GOT THE ENCHANTED FOREST
I love these illustrations! Now I'm hooked on coloring
Quality product. Nice paper and binding. Fun to color!
I  really like this book  I actually gave it as a gift
Wonderful, whimsical pages to color.  I have LOVED it.
Good for kids and good for adults, too !!<br/>Love it
Beautiful book, almost afraid to begin coloring in it!
Sent this to a friend who is an artist.  She loves it.
I bought this for my daughter who is in college. She loved it and so I got one for myself. It's something very fun for us to do together when catching up on some TV. The quality of the paper is great and supports both pencils and gel pens. This book really is a treasure!
I love this book!  Everyone that has seen it wants me to give them pages but no way am I taking pages out!!  (go buy your own lol)  The designs are so intricate that even skinny pointed crayons are too fat for some sections in the drawings but colored pencils work great.
Just love it, but when you fold it damage the sheets.
My 8 year old and I really enjoy doing this together!
Love this book! It's brought many hours of enjoyment.
I am enjoying doing all of the one's I have received.
Best adult and child color book.  I love the detail!!
This provides hours of entertainment and relaxation!
Brought this for my adult Daughter and she loves it.
I got tired of coloring green...  too many leaves...
Enjoyed this with both gel pens and colored pencils!
Very nice adult coloring book for us overgrown kids!
awesome color book the wife can't get enough of it.
Love it! Can't wait to receive the other two books!
Many beautiful flowers and other subjects to paint!
love these!! got my daughter hooked on them too lol
Very nice, great quality paper!  Fun coloring book!
The pictures are great although the pages really need to be perforated.  It's hard to tear out the pages without ripping the picture and it's hard to color the picture still in the book.  I took the whole book apart and cut the pages for easier coloring.
This coloring book is simply amazing! The pages are so beautiful  and captivating! Only a couple pages im not  absolutely in love with.  As an adult colorer, I've already spent hours on this book. Works great with Sharpie pend and Prismscolor pencils.
Love the variety of coloring pages! Fast shipping!
The kids and I both love it! Absolutely beautiful!
Love this!  I get compliments on this in my office
beautiful! arrived perfect and in a timely manner.
Shipped ahead of schedule...It's terrific. Thanks.
I love this book and can't wait to start coloring!
Very cool doodle pictures to mellow the mind with!
Really nice coloring book...beautiful, fun designs
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She loves it
such detail in the pictures.. and a very fun book
Most of the pages are too busy to enjoy coloring.
I like the intricate details of the illustrations
Great fun, a gift for my friend and she loves it.
This was a gift for a friend. She really liked it
LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! help me relax a lot!!!!
This is just as beautiful as I imagined it to be!
took quite awhile to get this book but I love it.
Very lovely surprise and every page is different!
If you like leaves,then this is the book for you.
Pretty much every page in the book has something to add color to. I'll be working on this book for many moons to come.<br/><br/>I am very pleased with this book for the beautiful drawings as well as the quality paper, printing, and binding.
Grand nieces-ages 20 yrs and 8 yrs old and grand-nephew 13 yrs old spent one whole afternoon coloring and sharing conversation... This was a big hit! Sent them the LolliZ gel pens which they love! No technology needed! Just relax and enjoy!
I have enjoyed coloring in this book. I like it.
Fun prints, can't wait for my coloring projects.
really pretty！ good way to concentrate and relax
I love the details in this book.  Very creative.
this book is my wife's favorite of all her books

Was everything is promised to be!  Love it!
Really cute adult coloring book.  Relaxing!

Great product! More than I've expected! =)
Beautiful! I can't wait to add some color.
Beautiful and enchanting imagery to color.
Gave some great ideas for my granddaughter
I have wanted this book for years. But, could not justify the cost to my husband.  Then my daughter's friend said coloring relieved more stress than  yoga.  I enjoy my quiet time, it helps keeps me offline.
I love the images; however, I just wish that the paper could be torn out so that markers do not bleed through onto the back.  I have to make some hard choices as to what to color because all are so lovely.
Very nice.  Am enjoying every page of it.
it's a coloring book what more can I say!
very nice book thick paper pretty designs
great book!  Received on time.  Thank you
Love it. A very good gift for my friends.
This one is the best cover and everything

Completely worth the wait.  Beautiful.
we ended up buying two more for gifts
I remember doing these type of colorings as a child.This is the perfect size with a good quality of paper to work on. Great for a Sunday afternoon of quite time. Highly recommend!
I should have read the reviews first. The images to color are such small spaces~too many in one design and on one page. Very stressful; just the opposite of what it should be!
Beautiful artwork and sooo much fun!
Very cute. Best acb series for sure.
Love the paper quality, the pattern.
Very interesting and relaxing book !
most beautiful coloring book around!
So much fun with this coloring book!
Gave this away, not what I expected. This is a beautiful book but I'm not an artist who would appreciate it more. I gave it to an artist friend who was thrilled to receive it.
An original way for a coloring book.
A wonderful work of art. Great gift.
can't wait to get started with this!

Almost too beautiful to color in ;)
Love love love this coloring book!
Beatifule drawings. Very detailed.
Book arrived in perfect condition.
Lovely and will make a great gift!
I like the book and the different designs keeps it interesting. The only 'bad' thing is that a lot of the designs end in the fold of the binder so you can't color them in.
It was everything that I expected.
Definately an adult coloring book.
Beautiful and makes free the soul.
Great book. Love it. Fast shipping
Very intricate and beautiful pics.
Exactly what I wanted.  Great book

Sorry too small I gave it away. Pretty but if you don't have great eye sight choose an other. Not easy to tear out pages.
paper quality is not good! dont buy this product!
The designs are beautiful but there on the paper back to back if you wanted to frame them you lose a picture pick it up.

A treasure - buy it....
The books are wonderful! The only downfall is that if you use a marker it goes through to the other side.
Beautiful book! Almost a pity to color in it. Have to go out and buy a new set of felt pens or gel pens.

Beautiful book.
LOVE THE DETAIL
Beautiful book!
Calming to use.
LOVE IT! Someone i know had found this at a random store in another country and I just had to find one! I bought some felt tipped markers to leave on my coffee table along with this book. Great for people to color in while sitting on the couch. I will say I feel colored pencils are a much better option as the marker seems to bleed a bit through the pages so I grabbed a pack of those too.<br/><br/>My favorite part has to be the artwork. The designs are very intricate and definitely too small for most children to color in. I love it and I love the price.
I absolutely love this book. It is the most creative piece of heaven I have ever sat down with. There are so many things to look at and "build out" with color. I wish the pages were thicker, so I could use a sharpie, and it wouldn't bleed, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. There are a ton of different pages - so I can color different things according to my mood. Some of the designs have large gaps and don't take too much concentration and some of them have very tiny details that turn out amazing with the right coloring utensil!
meets my needs
beautiful book
Beautiful fun.
Nice coloring.
Love the book!
great pictures
I am enjoy it!
Beautiful book
Lots to color!
beautiful book
Worth the wait
So much fun!
Amazing art!
Very calming
interesteing
Great fun!!!
I love this book and anything from Johanna Basford.
The only problem is the paper is not thick enough.
I ordered mine awhile ago knowing it was back ordered. No biggie, but I still need something to color. The "Animal Kingdom" coloring book is a similar style and beautiful, too. Good quality, thick pages, variety. I found mine at Michaels. I'm in no way affiliated with it, just wanted to offer up another choice for colorists who waiting for their Secret Garden to arrive. http://www.amazon.com/Animal-Kingdom-Color-Me-Draw/dp/1454709103/
I've been enjoying this for hours and have many weeks worth of coloring left in it. It is a beautiful and fun book. It works best with colored pencils. the ink pens bleed through, which is too bad as certain places beg for ink pens. I do it anyway but you have to be careful about what is on the other side of the page. A lot of repetitive leaves throughout, but I would buy it again or give a s a gift in a heartbeat, it's a fantastic book.

I would give this a 5 but even with extra thick pages most markers bleed through, so I gave it a 4. The markers that worked best for me are the washable ones in the kids coloring section at the store.  The permanent markers that I like because they come in extra fine sizes bleed right through (they are sold in the regular stationary area of the store .)  Except for the bleed through I love this book and use it often to relieve stress.
The detail in this coloring book are amazing, I had never thought of an adult coloring  book, but with the detail in this I can see how enjoyable  it would  be and not as quick and boring. There are so many wonderful  pages with an assortment  of designs that this will be fun and relaxing  for a good bit. I am using gel pens for mine and it is working well.<br/><br/>I received this product in exchange for an honest unbiased review
The best!!!
SO fun !!!!
as expected
i am hooked
great book.
gf loves it
This book looks like so much fun, I want to keep it for myself.  Alas, I purchased it for another retired friend of mine for Christmas who loves to keep busy.  This is laid out in such a lovely fashion, you can't help but smile and want to jump in and start coloring. I purchased a set of Sharpie Ultra-Fine-Point Permanent Markers, 24-Pack Colored Markers from Amazon.com to complete the gift.  I hope she likes it!
Awesome! I purchased this color book when I purchased the Enchanted Forest one. It is an amazing color book, though I'll admit my favorite out of the two is the Enchanted Forest one. Both books have stunning artwork, and are perfect for fans of all ages who love art, and coloring. Both my daughter and I love these books. I love that each page is thicker than your average color book. Definitely worth purchasing.
The drawings are so fun and beautiful to color.<br/>The only drawback is when a picture is divided<br/>into two parts because of the spine of the book. (i.e.<br/>part of a tree will be on one page and the other half<br/>on the page next to it.  I guess I understand why<br/>they have to split it in two but it can be a bit<br/>of a bummer when your trying to color.  I just<br/>leave ones like this blank.
Beautiful black and white renderings of intricate floral, woodland and free form patterns. I bought this book for my teenage daughter, she very creative and I can't wait to see how she chooses to color in the pages using vividly colored gel ink pens. Pretty enough to frame and hang on the wall! This book was sold out and on back order, we waited several weeks and Amazon finally came through with the delivery.
I love to color but I don't draw well. Many parts of the book are for drawing in, great if you can draw and want to add your own touches to the pages. The drawings are very detailed and creative with a nice variety.  My main complaint is the book is so thick it doesn't lay flat. When the drawing fills two pages it would be nice to be able to clearly fill in the center but impossible with the way it is bound.
I would have given this between 3 and 4 stars but since that wasn't an option I went with 3.<br/><br/>I'll start with what I do like:  I like the details of the pictures and how many pages you get for the price.<br/><br/>Now for the reasons for my rating:<br/><br/>1.  There are pictures on both sides of the paper, so I wouldn't trust it enough to use ink of any type, and it would have been nice to have the option.  Past reviews mentioned ink goes through, and the product now says that's been taken care of, but I don't want test marks on these nice pictures to test it out so I can't take the chance.  I would try ink if it wasn't double sided and I could put something in between the pages.<br/><br/>2.  Some pictures go the length of the two facing pages, and while it's nice to have detailed pictures like that, some of the things we're supposed to be able to color in are too close to the binding to color well or at all.  That will look weird to leave part of something colored and the center of it all white.  I'm not sure if it's even worth doing those pictures when it's going to look bad when it's done.<br/><br/>3.  There's a lot of blank space where the book asks you to add details to the picture, like continue the vine (and half the page is blank for you to do that) or they'll have a row of pots with topiaries on one page and the page next to it will be of just pots with most of the page blank for you to add your own.  I bought this as a coloring book, not a drawing book, and blank pages are a waste of paper for me.<br/><br/>All in all, it has some nice pictures but there are other books that do as well and don't have the problems I've mentioned.  I've been told that this is one of the first adult coloring books to come out to pave the way for other ones, but I'm going to look for one of those other ones that seem to do it better.

I LOVE this book. The pictures are so beautifully drawn. I love nothing more than to sit down at the end of a busy day, take out the book and my box of colored pencils and color, even if just for a few minutes. It really helps me wind down for the rest of the evening. I skip all over instead of doing one at a time. I want to order the other one, but I'll wait a bit.
Ms. Johanna must not realize she has so much talent. That someone would love every picture. That if you picked any other book. You could maybe skip a picture. Not in her book. So yes I am upset, that there is a picture on each page. The 5 stars are for all her hard work. I am just going to buy another book. Then I will be able to frame the one's I finish.
I received this yesterday & I was stunned at the graphics & whimsical pages. It is like a black & white book just waiting for you to color it in. There are even pages where they have left space for you to put in your own art work. I have to say I will be purchasing more of there coloring books. If you enjoy coloring I highly recommend to purchase this.
The drawings are super cute!  I would've liked to hang some of my pictures up though, and there's no way to cleanly tear off pages.  Also, the coloring pages are printed out on both sides so you can't pull out one page without losing another page :( Also, you' can't use markers for this coloring book without the marker bleeding through the pages.
This is an absolutely beautiful adult coloring book!  I'm planning on giving it to my ten year old grandchild who says she's like to do this type of thing with her Mom.  The pictures are gorgeous, and the paper its printed on is sturdy and of a high quality.  Pair this with a brand new set of crayons, and it's a great gift for an adult or child!

These books by Johanna Basford are gorgeous.  Nice thick paper, beautiful designs, and drawing challenges (if you're inclined, which I am not but they seem fun).  The only downside is that the pictures are all double-sided.  Would've preferred one-sided pictures to color and easier to remove.  But gorgeous and great for therapeutic coloring.
Love this book. It is one of the best design books I have ever happened upon. The book encourages you to draw in the same style. I made an owl and circled to with vines and leaves including bees and snails then used a wood burner to transfer to a gourd and turned it into a purse! Love this book. I can't say enough about the artist.
BEST PRESENT IVE EVER BOUGHT MYSELF!
This book is absolutely beautiful, and it even arrived in just ONE DAY! Amazing! However, when it did arrive 1/2 of the pages were stuck together at the top and the pages ripped when I tried to open them! this wouldn't be a big deal if I happened on one page, but it happened on HALF of them. I'm super bummed :(
It's ok. Cheap paper, cheap print.

I bought this as a gift for my adult daughter who loves it.  She sent me a photo of the first page after coloring in with pencil.  Beautiful.  I asked her about the paper quality since I saw some reviews saying it was poor.  She said she didn't know what they were talking about it, the quality is great.
It is a coloring book... for adults. Thought my wife would like it when she asked for one, turns out I was dead wrong going with the top reviewed one on Amazon. I ended up having to get another coloring book to tame her desires. Not sure yet, but this one might go to the hands of the children.
Beautiful drawings but too busy.
I have adoration for every talented aspect of this book. The ideas, searches and feel for this book are exceptional.  Can a coloring book be any more beautiful?  Not sure this is possible.  Oh wait, Basford's other book is just as lovely and I am highly anticipating her Under The Sea book!
Very nice product. I purchased a forest book for my girls (which is not here yet, but on the way) and I'm glad I did! When my daughter saw this she freaked! Thought it was the nicest coloring book ever and wanted one. I look forward to when hers arrives so we can enjoy these together.
This is such a pretty book! Much bigger than I anticipated. I will be coloring in this for months. I almost hated putting colored pencil to the paper, because I didn't want to ruin it. I would recommend to a friend.<br/><br/>This is really great for just de-stressing/relaxing.
My niece is obsessed with this book - both the 9 year old and the 7 year old. Only down side is that I didn't buy two.<br/><br/>I bought the Fiskars Gel Pens with this book and they are the perfect size to stay within the lines of the drawings.<br/><br/>AWESOME book.
I love this book. Adult coloring is wonderful. I do find it meditative and stress relieving. I sit with my pencils and pick out a place to start. The colors I should use and the shading just come. This is helping with my sleep too. I'm more relaxed after I have colored.
This is such a neat idea. The drawings are really pretty, and there are even little activities you can do. The book and pages are heavy duty, which I was surprised at because it was relatively inexpensive. Just need to find the write markers/pencils to use with it! :)

This is the coloring book I was left with. I am not in the least disappointed, except by my own generosity. My biggest struggle is to decide which pencils to color with. Not a bad quandary to be in. I love discovering the hidden treasures in this paper garden.
This is beautiful. The print is on both sides of the paper so markers might bleed through, but the pages are a thicker paper. It is bound like an actual book. The pages take a little time and some are intricate. Almost like I Spy for adults who like to color.
I bought this for one of my 3rd grade students who likes to color. He loves it! It has provided hours of coloring enjoyment for him. There are so many different things to color in this book -- it keeps the child engaged  -- no computer games with this book!
This book is absolutely beautiful. The artwork in it is so intricate and magical. I love coloring in it but I almost don't want to because the drawings are so beautiful already!  I love adult coloring books and this is one of my favorites.
This is a beautiful book.
thanks

Beautiful and intricate.
I bought Enchanted Forest first, so I was hoping for something along that style, I was disappointed. I suppose I was hoping for something fanciful, not so much wells, buckets, ivy, and archways. I'm thinking I'll return it.
My 13 year old daughter spends hours of down time coloring these beautiful pictures!  What a great option for a teen instead of instagram and youtube videos! I bought her fun pens too and it has become a passion for her!
This coloring book is so beautifully done.  I can't wait to get my colored pencils and go to town on it.  Also, I showed it to my mother-in-law (who is an artist) and she loved it so much that I ordered one for her.
Absolutely beautiful! Going to color this book for my little girl so she can have it for a keepsake. She loves to tell stories from pictures. I can't wait to hear her stories from these. I can't wait for more books.
Very beautiful book.  LOVED the clean lines and the variety.  I almost didn't want to desecrate it with color, but it called to me and I just went for it.  Really helps with stress and brings me a sense of calm.
I'm totally a girl, so I think this is the best coloring book I have ever seen.  This is very flowery and frilly stuff, very detailed and delightful to color with colored pencils or fine line markers.
It was well received.
My niece, who is 11 years old, saw this book and immediately wanted it. So I'm waiting for my second purchase to be delivered. Can't wait! I have her postcards and notecards, too. Just thrilled :)
Wonderful coloring book! I received this for my birthday at the end of February, and I just can't get enough of it! I an a HUGE fan of coloring books, especially intricate ones. I love this book!

Fantastic book! I think the quality of paper is like none other. You can use markets and they don't bleed through. It was a gift for a friends birthday along with watercolor pencils!!
The inside graphics are pretty, but the cover is damaged and not clean. I planned to buy this item as birthday gift for my friend. Now I have to buy other stuff as gift. Disappointed.
I've so enjoyed colouring in this book, but what a pity the quality of the paper is so poor! Sharp pencils tear the paper,  any gel pens  and intense colouring bleed through the page
I'm a little disappointed.  I was hoping each page would be different, but they are all very similar.<br/>There are not too many directions.  All pages are very similar.  Too bad.

Bought this as a gift for my wife and she really enjoys it. No longer is she stealing the kid's Minnie Mouse coloring books after they go to bed!
This is a great way to relax for me.  It is fun to make up your own garden colors!!! I can't wait to get Johanna Basford's other Inky Treasure.
Great Book. Awesome designs. This was the perfect gift. It shipped faster than I thought and came to my house in perfect condition. Love it.
An inspiration of beautiful page after page coloring designs. The gel markers do not bleed through the pages. An intermission before Spring.
The images in this book are so fun to color. Lots of inspiration and chances for variety. I am totally addicted and have bought others now!
Unbelievably wonderful book.  Even the presentation is beautiful.  Would make a great gift paired with a set of gel pens or felt markers
This book turned out to be so much more then I was expecting! The book is such great quality. The book is huge, lots of pages to color!
Best adult coloring book ever.  I bought one more for myself and one as a gift!  The subsequent book is just as good, just different.
This book is awesome. I've never seen a book so beautiful. I've starting coloring in it and it's a good time :)  the quality is A+  I deducted a star because I wish the pages weren't double sided because I would like to frame some of these.  The paper in this book is awesome quality.
My mom is OBSESSED. I wish the paper was better quality, but the designs are wonderful! I will be getting her the forest one soon!
Such a magnificent coloring book. It allows you to sketch and color beyond your imagination! It will last me for a very long time!
This book is just beautiful!  There are all different types of pages, and it's fun for both myself and my 11 year old daughter.
Beautiful book! Having a great wvening of some therapeutic coloring with a glass od wine...can't wait to try another book soon!
Just perfect !!! All pages are beautifull !!! Thanks to Johanna Basford<br/>See my colorings on Instagram  #maevastyle1
Can't wait to give this to my grown-up daughter...she is a graphic designer and I am thinking she will really like it.
Not as great as I thought.. I thought there would be more to color, it's more of an activity book with some coloring.
I love this adult coloring book. I spotted it on line and I just love it. It works well with good colored pencils.
I love this book! It has amazing designes and You can practically color the whole book including the book jacket!
A great way to color oneself out of anxiety.  Forces one to concentrate and leave all of ones troubles behind.
Fun

Gorgeous adult coloring book! Beautiful illustrations, great pictures. I highly recommend this coloring book!
I love this book so much that I didn't want to color in it.  I've also given it as a gift to my Secret Pal.
Beautiful!!
Very fun adult coloring book--the latest fad.  Book arrived quickly and was brand new, wrapped in plastic.
The wait was truly long but worth it. My daughter really enjoys both books. Her smiles make my heart melt.
My wife is loving these as a way to relax and focus on something meaningless after a day of work and kids.
This is such a great coloring book for adults and children alike. I enjoy it just as much as my nieces do.
This book is beautiful!  One of a kind in style.  The newer copies have a better quality paper, too.  :)
Gorgeous illustrations and fun treasure hunt!  I'll buy all of Johanna Basford's books, most definitely.
Have gifted many of these. I will now get all I can from here. Perfect gift and perfect way to give it
Coloring for adults is apparently a new trend and this certainly fits the bill.  Coloring is relaxing.
My daughter and I have enjoyed coloring in this together.  Nice, relaxing time to sit still and talk.
I wish the paper was thicker so I could use markers, but works great with pencils. Beautiful images!
Gorgeous. Got a couple for crafty friends, the pictures they are coloring blow me away.
The quality of the illustrations and paper is top notch. You will not be disappointed!
Received as stated; have not used yet but have ordered other items and they are great!
My doughter loves this book we bought gel pens to go with it and she colors eveary day
I was looking for an adult coloring book as I find coloring to be relaxing. This is a pretty cool book. Only thing is pen bleeds through the pages and some of the pages prompt you to freehand draw stuff, which I'm not great at drawing so I have a lot of blank space in my book. Overall, it was what I was looking for.
Love both her books. I get lost into coloring her designs for a relaxing hour or two.
Cover on upside down.  I'm not happy and have to figure out how to get a refund now.
My granddaughter and her mother love these.  Great for those "tween girls"!
I have only read it at the moment, but looking forward to have time to enjoy myself
It's the best we can get. The paper and the drawings are perfect. My gf loved it!
Quality is superb​!!! Looking forward to more books from this publisher/ author.
A beautiful adult coloring book! This will get you hooked on coloring for sure!
Love this book..I'm only on the title page and it's got me hooked. So relaxing!
Great detail... Relaxation! I find myself daydreaming as I doodle.  Great tool
Love the book and people stop and ask about it. Amazing story from the author.
I absolutely love this book. I would recommend to anyone that loves to color.
Beautifully illustrated!  I bought one for my daughter and myself.  Love it!!
This is a particularly whimsical coloring book that is very creatively done.
Adorable book. Great quality. Shipped quickly. Came as expected. Thank you.
Beautiful drawings, almost too beautiful to color in (but I am, of course).

She is clearly the best thing to happen to coloring books in decades!
LOTS OF FUN PAGES TO COLOR.  BUY SOME COLORED PENCILS AND GO TO TOWN.
Very nice book, just started using it, but the pictures look awesome.
Love all Johanna Basford books.  She has great imagination and depth.
Beautiful designs and the feel of the paper is a delight to work on.
Awesome book for a chronic doodler. Love the illustrations. So fun!!
I bought this as a gift for a doodler and it went over really well.
What a fun way to relax.  My Granddaughters love to work on it too.
I want one of these too! This one was for my daughter. It's amaing!
I recommend her first book! This one is not near as good. First, why would you add text to the pages and suggest we draw more. If we could draw we wouldn't have to buy these books! She needs to also draw more than leaves! So many leaves!
Don't use sharpies they run thru. Gel pens and color pencils work
Beautiful and detailed coloring book. Definitely worth the money!
Great book-beautiful art work!  Got to me on time-great service!!
This was actually even more beautiful than expected.  I keep glasses of colored pencils on my kitchen table and a collection of adult coloring books like these.  They are always a huge hit, but this one is fought after!
I love it!!! I'm 73yrs. Young and I still color. Thank you .
Beautifully done. Excellent detailed pages. Creative layout.
This is our second book, we gave our first away to friends!
Love it! So beautiful and very intricate!!! A def must buy!
Thank you.  Love the book and having a great time coloring
My first adult coloring book,,,so I am having so much fun.
Everybody is getting one of these for birthdays this year!
Very relaxing and great to have some beauty at fingertips.

Well this is a gift for someone's gf. I look to it  inside and the paper is like a cardstock. Im not so into coloring books... but I do like some of the pages, not all.
♡♡♡♡♡
GRATE
I've been enjoying this for hours and have many weeks worth of coloring left in it. It is a beautiful and fun book. It works best with colored pencils. the ink pens bleed through, which is too bad as certain places beg for ink pens. I do it anyway but you have to be careful about what is on the other side of the page. A lot of repetitive leaves throughout, but I would buy it again or give a s a gift in a heartbeat, it's a fantastic book.
I ordered this and those postcards about a year ago. I became very bored with this book and the paper quailty is not great. Markers and some pens bleed right through. I don't understand why they would print on both sides of the pages if the quality is a bit low.<br/>I ordered the Enchanting Gardens (something like that) by a different artist but it looks more interesting to color. I'll see how it compares when it gets here.

My 3 son love this book. I always read this book and they always listen when I'm going to start reading this book.
Wow, Nice book I ever read. I can read it clearly because all the letter are good design. Nice one!!!
Great book cant wait for new one i get hours of enjoyment from this one
ok
I returned this. You need really fine markers to even color in the lines. All I had were colored pencils, not about to buy expensive markers too.
Not bad. I drew 1 page and then threw it somewhere.
Some pictures take up 2 pages. Don't like that.
Loved it. Read this book when young
Amazing !  Beautiful Art work !
The book is great, but I wish they'd release it on Kindle.
the kids like it
Good product!
don't guess ill be getting mine anytime soon? it has been a month
a dirty one.
This is really boring, not relaxing, and bad for your eyes

does not have tear out pages, and the pages do not lay flat, so makes it hard to color.
Book came completely destroyed. All bent and holes in it. So bummed.
:)
I expected that paper color is white. However, paper color looks beige. That's okay.
If you're using gel pens you can only color half the picture. What were you thinking!!
Disappointed, not what I expected.
good
A cute coloring book. I got it for one page in there to use as a basis for an embroidery project, and it has sat on my bookshelf ever snack. It's too expensive to let any little children, or even middling aged children, to use it for coloring in, and I haven't found it useful ever since I got the one basic design.
Still waiting on back order.  Can't wait to get it
Gift for grandchild
