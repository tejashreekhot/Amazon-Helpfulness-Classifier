I just bought my nephew who is going to college an HP Stream 13 for $230. Beautiful and powerful computer, but it took me 90 minutes to remove all the stickers and all the crapware & adware.  I still need to offload the recovery partition to a flash disk to recover the SSD storage. It has a total of 32 GB SSD storage so every bit counts.  I'm also waiting for a 64 GB MicroSD card http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVPU7AO so I can expand the storage.<br/><br/>Removing the crapware and adware took 2 hours plus another hour to install Windows update.  I removed all the browser extensions and add-ons in IE and then installed Chrome. Then I installed CCleaner and removed McAfee anti-virus so that I can just use the free Microsoft AV. Also removed a bunch of bloatware like Cisco wireless networking utilities like LEAP and Apple Bonjour. Removed the Realtek card reader software since it slows the card reader down. Then downloaded fresh Realtek card reader driver and manually installed the driver without using their setup program.<br/><br/>UPDATE - I had to remove all the HP tools (support and registration) as well.  They were intermittently hammering the CPU to 100% and other people in HP forums were complaining about this problem.  Once uninstalled, the CPU usage problems went away.  Something else that caused some mildly high CPU usage during media playback was the Realtek DTS audio processing service and I've disabled that and the system performs better.  It was not needed for playback quality and it was actually detrimental to audio recording quality.<br/><br/>The thing that slowed me down was that I had to gather my nephew's personal info to create a Microsoft account for him. It was mandatory since this is the free version of MS Windows 8.1 (with Bing). But the MS Account allows him to use MS Office online for free so it's worth setting up.  I also had to carefully remove 3 stickers on the keyboard rest. Intel sticker was tilted. Now it's a beautiful clean system and it boots very fast and loads everything fast. It handles most computing tasks just fine and now I'm loathed to give this away.<br/><br/>Some people will complain about the 2GB of RAM which is not expandable, but I never have any problems with 2GB RAM because I don't leave a 20 browser tabs open.  You're not going to use this laptop for 3D intensive gaming or 3D rendering so the RAM shouldn't be an issue.  I have a desktop computer with 8 GB of RAM for running games and virtual machines and content production and no one should expect the HP Stream 13 to perform this role.  It runs fewer than 10 web browser tabs just fine and it's extremely snappy running Microsoft Office Online or Google apps.<br/><br/>I ran a Youtube 1080P on Chrome browser. Google is screwing all of us now by forcing their VP9 codec on us which forces this computer to use software video decoding. This dual-core CPU is pegged at 100% utilization and forced to overclock to 2.58 GHz and it will still hiccup if a youtube ad shows up.  Of course this is just chewing up the battery.  By comparison, I tested a 1080P H.264 .MP4 video downloaded from Google and the CPU hovered around 8% during smooth playback. Google needs to shove their VP8 & VP9 codec where the sun don't shine.  But thank goodness for "Magic Actions for YouTube" (a Chrome plugin) letting me disable Google's VP9 HTML5 crap.  Now Chrome runs Youtube in flash mode with H.264 hardware decoding and the CPU hovers around 20%.  Here's a screenshot of the CPU pegged at 100% with VP9 software decode [...].  Here's the CPU hovering at 20% using Flash mode with H.264 hardware decode [...].<br/><br/>I've been hammering on this system with tests for over two hours. The Intel N2840 2.16 GHz processor is being forced to burst to 2.58 GHz from all the work I'm throwing at it. Windows Update is hammering the IO and CPU. The brightness level is even set to 60% and the battery level still reads 79% with 4 hours 24 minutes remaining.<br/><br/>After all the tweaks and cleanup I've done, the slim HP Stream 13 3.42 lb laptop is running smooth as butter. The 13.3" 1366x768 non-glare matte screen is the perfect compromise between viewabiliy and compactness.  Would be even nicer if HP could sell us a 1920x1080 13.3" screen but probably not at the $230 price point.  Another small gripe is that the bezel is a little bigger than I'd like.<br/><br/>The Stream 13 has a 720P webcam, but I wouldn't even call it 360P quality. It's incredibly grainy using indoor lighting, but what were you expecting for a $230 laptop?  It's certainly not going to look like the camera on the MacBook Pro. Get yourself a $66 Logitech C920 which has awesome image quality and 1080P hardware encoding if you want a nice webcam.  Even a $29 720P webcam will look leaps and bounds better.<br/><br/>On the audio output side, the HP Stream 13 has good sound output from the TRRS jack.  It can drive my large 808 headphones with authority.  By comparison, my Lenovo ThinkPad T430 business laptop couldn't push my 808s at all!  The audio recording on the other hand stinks in the default setting.  The integrated microphone sucks like most integrated microphones on laptops. It is very laggy because of all the noise cancellation algorithms they apply to it. The recorded sound (using Audacity) is noise free but it is extremely unnatural due to excessive noise reduction.  I don't like the recorded sound at all.<br/><br/>UPDATE - After disabling the DTS Realtek audio processing, the playback quality was still just as good.  Recording with the internal microphone actually improved a lot.  The internal microphone in the HP Stream 13 actually isn't too shabby.  It is surprisingly usable quality for VoIP or Video Calling.<br/><br/>The Stream 13 also has a 3.5mm TRRS phone connector port for headphones and earbuds with microphones. That means you can use the same earbuds with mic that you use with your smartphone. The problem is that while it sounds a lot more natural than the integrated microphone, it's a faint yet noisy signal. The input volume was set to 100% with a 10 dB (fake software preamp) boost and it's still only reaching 20% peak sound levels in Audacity.  My Nexus 4 and Samsung S4 on the other hand produce extremely good quality recordings with the same earbuds or headphones with microphones.  To put this in context, my Lenovo ThinkPad T430 from work has the same audio recording quality problems with the integrated mic and TRRS port.<br/><br/>If you want to work around these sound recording issues, buy yourself a $34 Samson GoMic.  It's the best money you'll ever spend on a USB microphone.  The other option is that you can get a bluetooth headphone with microphone since the HP Stream 13 has bluetooth capability.<br/><br/>The trackpad on the HP Stream 13 is large and usable.  It supports gestures like two-finger scrolling.  But if you really want a good experience, buy a bluetooth mouse and use the integrated bluetooth in the Stream 13.<br/><br/>Lastly, here are the disk performance results for the internal 32 GB SSD storage. It's one of the slowest SSDs on the market, but it's still around 15 times faster than a normal hard drive when it comes to small file transfers.<br/>[...]<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>This is a superb mobility laptop for the money, but only if you remove all the crapware and apply all the optimizations I performed above.<br/><br/>Summary of crapware removed and optimizations performed.<br/><br/>* Apple Bonjour.<br/>* Cisco LEAP and EAPFAST<br/>* McAfee AV<br/>* Realtek cardreader software (note that you need to download just the new drivers and then just install drivers manually without software.  Don't remove if you don't know how to install new drivers because you'll lose the card reader)<br/>* HP Tools registration<br/>* HP Tools support<br/>* Disable Realtek DTS audio effects.  Just type DTS at start screen and the program will pop up.<br/>* Install Chrome<br/>* If you use Chrome, install "Magic Actions for YouTube" plugin for Chrome to disable ads, pick the default resolution, and force Flash mode instead of HTML5 mode.  Flash mode uses H.264 MPEG AVC video which supports hardware acceleration for very low CPU usage.
Alright, I am going to get right to it. You get what you pay for here AND some more!<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Price, great quality for the price.<br/>Colors, I like the odd colors and the "gradient" blue on the interior looks really cool accented with white keys.<br/>Webcam, has an OK integrated webcam. Just $15 I don't have to spend for a different crappy one.<br/>Microsoft Office, there's an entire year of Microsoft 365 included in this deal (at least when I bought it).<br/>Microsoft Gift Card, there's a $25 gift card to use on the Microsoft Store.<br/>Lightweight, this laptop weighs 2 something pounds and is easy to pick up and hold in one hand.<br/>Keyboard, the keys are great and feel a lot like a Mac keyboard they are also easy to type on. It took me probably less than 5 minutes to get accustomed to the size of the keyboard and where the keys are.<br/>Size, I like that it is the same size as a Notebook, but it's totally a laptop.<br/>Processor speed, okay, this processor isn't great in comparison to a lot of laptops. But given it's only a $200 laptop and a lot of those other laptops with amazing processors are over $1000. It loads web pages fast and plays videos. One review I watched said that youtube videos lagged a tiny bit in fullscreen, but I haven't noticed that at all.<br/>Fanless design (SSD), I love the solid state drive and that there's no fan. This laptop stays cool as a breeze. The charger on the other hand, does not.<br/>OS, Windows 8.1 is fairly easy to operate on this laptop. I had to adjust the settings on the shortcuts for the trackpad because it made it really difficult to navigate the start menu, but it's great now and easy to navigate.<br/>Battery, this battery lasts a heck of a long time. I was browsing the web and typing on word for a total of at least 5 hours before the battery reached "low" at 15%.<br/><br/>It's like a better Chromebook, I got to say, HP outdid themselves with this laptop. It's a great quality for only $200 and it's only rivals price-wise are Chromebooks which have a joke for an OS. This laptop has Windows 8.1! Perfect for a student or a teen for web browsing. Great for a portable notebook for work too if the colors don't bother you. It's also just as fast as the Chromebook. It doesn't start up as fast, but browses awesome and it has Microsoft Office and is compatible with ALL the downloadable and online games like Minecraft, League of Legends and Runescape, unlike the Chromebook.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Screen, the screen is not very bright and there's not a ton of contrast in it.<br/>Processor, okay, this is a pro and a con for me. It's AMAZING for the price you're paying and GREAT for web browsing and videos, but not for gaming. I really like the Sims, and I don't know if I'll be able to play it on this laptop. But I didn't really expect to be able to at the price. Still makes it a con for me though.<br/>Trackpad, the trackpad is really unresponsive to clicks. Every review told me this was a con and so I expected it, there's got to be some downfall to such a cheap computer! It's not so horrible that it makes me want to punch the laptop, just a tiny irritating at times. Plus, you can always use a wireless mouse!<br/>CD Drive, there is no CD drive. Alas, I cannot watch DVD's or even try to play my Sims. I'll have to buy an external CD drive.<br/><br/>I've had it about a week, and I'll hopefully post an update in a few months to see how it's holding up!
I ordered the 13,3 inch laptop fpr school. This laptop is perfect such great quality nice color great apps.its big and has alot of great things about it. A must buy for the price. It came with Office 365 and a $25 Microsoft gift card. It also has a 1 year warranty. Great purchase.
<br/><br/>
This is an amazing laptop as long as it is bought for the right person. I am currently a full time student who really needs a laptop on the go. On this laptop I have Microsoft Office 2013 (not Office365), Adobe Acrobat XI Pro, McAfee Internet Security Suite and some other light applications. The first time I did updates, I was really scared because I saw that toward the end there was only 224MBs remaining. However, after the update was completed, it shows approximately 2.26GB remaining. In order to combat, the low storage space remaining, I went ahead and bought a Sony 64GB SD card for only $25 on Amazon. That was a great buy! As of now, I only have my applications on the SSD. All of my documents, photos, and videos are kept on the memory stick. I have no complaints about the keyboard, in fact, I really like it. The keys actually go in, and is pretty responsive. As far as the trackpad is concerned, it definitely could use some improvements. At first, using it was a hassle, after 3-4 days, it became second nature. The performance for this laptop is okay as long as you're not planning on using Photoshop. I use Adobe Acrobat Pro XI, which can be a very demanding software, a lot on this machine. So far, I have not had any issues. Video playback seems to be very good. One problem I did notice was when I was running Chrome. Having 2 or 3 tabs, along with iHeart Radio, seemed to create a distortion for the audio. The audio would just stop and then restart. The battery on this laptop is pretty amazing. The battery seems to be on for around 6 hours and 30 minutes, at low brightness, no audio, and only mild surfing and word processing. The laptop color scheme is a lot better person when you actually hold it rather than looking at it in front of a computer screen. The $25 Microsoft.com voucher and free Office365 membership for 1 year is a total steal. I think that this will help out a lot of students that are going off to college this year, or someone with a tight budget. The screen is usual. You will not be able to see the pixels on the display, unless you are staring at it close. The laptop is fanless, so there isn't noise being generated by the laptop. Also, there isn't any heat. I had a HP Pavilion laptop before that generated so much heat that it became unbearable to use unless I had a pillow underneath it. This laptop does produce some heat, but hardly any. You won't be able to feel it unless you're wearing short, and it comes into direct contact with your skin.  As a student who uses this laptop daily, I can gladly recommend this laptop to the majority.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I have created two backups of the recovery partition, and will be calling HP soon to ask if the recovery partition can be deleted, as that will free up around 7.30GB.<br/><br/>[UPDATE 2/18/15]: So I have been using this laptop for about 4 months now, and have to say how amazed I continue to be with this laptop. The keyboard is great, and I have not been having any problems using it.<br/>The trackpad also hasn't caused me any problems yet.<br/>My only problem would be in regards to the RAM and SSD. I constantly get error messages notifying me that I am running out of space. Windows has also closed all of my running programs to increase RAM. This is quite frustrating. Also, the SSD is a major problem as well. Before, I had Adobe Acrobat XI and Microsoft Office 2013 installed, but could not install any updates due to the lack of space. I deleted Acrobat XI, and got back around 1.2GB, but it eventually got reduced to 900MB due to more updates. The recovery partition is approximately 7.2 GB, and CANNOT BE DELETED.<br/>Trying to delete it tampers with the security feature on board, and it will disable you from accessing the Windows operating system. In order to bypass this, I will try to install Windows 7 Ultimate on this laptop by disabling UEFI Secure Boot, and if it successful, then I will try to delete the recovery partition.<br/>The battery life is excellent, however the laptop does get somewhat heated after 2-3 hours of use, not unbearable by any means.<br/>The display is average, nothing to really admire about.<br/>Playing YouTube videos can be a frustrating experience. Playing in 720P does not start any problems, however, if you decide to play in 1080P, be prepared to see a lot of stuttering. I have installed the Magic Actions for YouTube, and have seen all the issues that I was experiencing go away.<br/>The following are my settings for this addon:<br/>- Enable Auto HD [It will be selected at 480p by default, change this to HD720p or HD1080p. If you do not have fast internet, I would recommend that you keep it at 480p.]<br/>- Hide Ads [Enable this as it will prevents any ads from appearing. If you are looking for an ad-free experience in Chrome, I would highly recommend that you install Adblock from https://www.getadblock.com/]<br/>- Speed Booster [I also choose this option as it loaded 720p videos much faster, I didn't see a significant difference with 1080p.]<br/>- Use MP4/AVC video stream when available [This is going to change the video file format. Using MP4/AVC will reduce the CPU usage, which will aid in a stutter free video watching experience.]<br/><br/>*** I will update this video in another two months.*** ***If you have any questions, feel free to ask below.*** ***I spend a lot of time writing reviews. If this review has helped you make a decision or improved your use of the laptop, please give the review a thumbs up! :D ***
This tiny, shiny, dayglo mini laptop is worth every penny. As other reviwers have said, it comes with a lot of crappy apps and bloatware which is commonplace for Windows laptops. Easy fix? Download CCleaner and PC Decrapifier (honestly what it's called). CCleaner will clean up all the unused empty space you have created from removing all the useless programs and apps and the decrapifier will remove those apps for you if you are not versed in what bloatware looks like. Anywhoo, after doing all that and removing apps (search remove apps and it will pop up the page where you go to uninstall apps). I do this, and remove the apps from the start menu. This way, it runs more like Windows 7.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop as my primary work machine. I am a telecommute administrator. My needs are few. I need an AIM based chat client and a SIP server phone agent to be able to work, and they need to run simultaneously. This machine does that beautifully. I use a wireless headset and wireless numberpad. No lag issues, no choppy phone calls. Clear sound on my end and theirs. This is something I wasn't getting with a brand new ASUS.<br/><br/>I believe this little bargain laptop is totally worth the money. No, you are not going to be able to run Steam on it with any sort of quality for gaming. No, Diablo III nor Minecraft will run on it well. However, for working, school stuff, browsing, streaming.. It is a perfect budget friendly machine to do what needs to be done. If you need more, buy more. I feel that this machine alone renders the chromebook obsolete. I sold my chromebook when I purchased this because it had rendered it pretty much useless.<br/><br/>This is a solid, well built and steady laptop. The horizon blue is a little cartoony, but I have warmed up to it. Included photo of work setup.
Im a college student and I absolutely love it - the color, the size, just everything! Truly amazing how good of a laptop this is and it was only 200 bucks!
Just over a year ago, I got my first Chromebook, the Acer C720. Since that time, except for gaming, it has been my most used computer for everyday web consumption: Ebay, Amazon, Facebook, Google+, Wordpress, Netflix, Youtube, etc.  I even figured out how to use Crouton to install Linux (Ubuntu) on it, so that I could install Steam for local gaming and Steam Streaming.  While the Acer doesn't have a great screen, or even a good screen, and it feels kind of, well, cheap overall, for the price it was a fantastic value.<br/><br/>With the release of the HP Stream 11, I think Windows has a device that hits a similar value/performance intersection. I've only owned it one day but based on initial impressions, this is a fantastic value and an easy recommendation for a LOT of use cases.<br/><br/>SPECS<br/><br/>The HP Stream 11 is an 11.6" Windows 8.1 Laptop, powered by an Intel Celeron N2840 processor at 2.16 GHz. It has 2 GB of RAM and a 32 GB SSD, neither of which can be upgraded. It is rated for 8.5 hours of battery life, depending on performance and brightness settings of course.<br/><br/>The screen is a 1366x768 high definition LCD screen, which has a matte coating for anti-glare. This is basically the same screen as the Acer C720. Which is to say, the screen is pretty bad. The matte coating takes a relatively low-resolution affair and makes it that much more dull and muted. That said, it is serviceable enough and has decent brightness considering the price point. Just know going in that your tradeoff for choosing this over a similarly priced $200 Windows Tablet is that the screen on a tablet will likely be IPS and significantly better in terms of clarity and viewing angles. However, this matte coating does help very much with glare in overhead and outdoor lighting situations.<br/><br/>As far as ports, the Stream 11 has 2 USB ports (one 3.0 and one 2.0), a full-size SD slot, and HDMI. It has a single combo headphone/mic port.<br/><br/>It also has two down-firing speakers that put out decent sound for the price point.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>Setting up this device wasn't too bad. Windows 8 has come a long way over the past 12 months. In December 2013 my wife's HP required several hours of updates, and updating my Surface Pro (1st Gen) from Windows 8.0 to 8.1 was very difficult; there was a point where the update hung, and I had to do quite a bit of research to get past it.<br/><br/>Contrast this to the HP Stream 11:  It took 10 minutes to get from unboxing to a functional Windows desktop.  Once there I removed Norton, installed Avast, installed Chrome, and installed Steam, and then installed 35 Windows updates (33 required and 2 optional). This took 22 minutes, plus another 12 minutes of processing after I rebooted, for a total time of 34 minutes. The system handled them all with no crashes, hangs, or issues.<br/><br/>Drivers for accessories like my USB Logitech Mouse and Dell Printer were plug and play with no issues.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE<br/><br/>This processor/RAM setup powers a lot of 2014's Chromebooks, and thus it has Octane benchmarks similar to devices like the Asus C200 Chromebook and Toshiba Chromebook 2.  My personal Octane scores were in the 7,500-8,000 range. As a point of comparison, the Acer C720 and HP Chromebook 11, with 2 GB of RAM and an Intel Celeron 2955 processor with Haswell architecture have benchmarks in Octane of around 11,000.  You're looking at about 20% decrease in performance.<br/><br/>In general, most websites load quickly, but more intensive sites like The Verge hang a bit while various images and videos load. Once pages are loaded, everything scrolls smoothly. I read some people complaining about Chrome being an issue on this device but it ran fine for me. I had IE with one tab, Chrome with three tabs, and Steam open and the web pages were running fine. I also tested Google Docs and that ran smoothly.<br/><br/>Boot time to the log-in screen is about 10 seconds, plus another 5-7 seconds of loading after you enter your log-in credentials.  Unlike Chrome OS, when you hit the desktop a Windows device is still processing and loading in the background, so the full boot takes a bit longer - but I'd still say the whole process is under 30 seconds and to hit the log-in in 10 seconds is impressive.<br/><br/>I had no problems installing Avast, Chrome, and Steam on the device. I tested Steam Streaming on my local network from my desktop computer and was able to play Wolfenstein: The New Order at an excellent FPS. I also tried a few games running locally including Pacman DX, Luftrausers, and Towerfall Ascension. These ran without issue. I would think that many indie games should run on this, especially those of the 2D variety, but 3D gaming performance will probably be terrible. You don't have much space to store modern games, anyway.  As a Steam Streaming device though, it works fine. And, it should be able to handle most emulation of systems up through the PS1 / Sega Saturn / N64 generation as well as a lot of good retro games on GOG.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the wireless speed I got using tests on this device were about 10-15% slower than the same tests on my Moto X or Acer C720 connected to the same network, from the same location. That said, the connection didn't drop at all for the four hours I had the computer running.  (If interested:  I have 50 Mb down and up via FiOS. My first speed test showed this was only getting 28 up and 25 down, but a re-test after rebooting later showed 37 up and 36 down)<br/><br/>I haven't had the device long enough to test the battery but I would expect 8 hours is pretty reasonable, keeping in mind that brightness and what you're doing for that time play a major role.<br/><br/>BUILD QUALITY<br/><br/>This is a mixed bag. As noted the screen is the low point of the device. It isn't so terrible that the device isn't usable, but it is pretty bad. If you can live with the C720, you can live with this, but you won't like it.<br/><br/>The Stream 11 comes in at under 3 lbs of weight (2.8 lbs), feeling just a bit heavier than my C720. Heavy compared to modern 10" tablets, but still relatively light.<br/><br/>One complaint I have is that this device only comes in two color options, Blue or Magenta. While I like the blue - it looks better in person than it does in pictures - the absence of a neutral color like white, black, or grey is strange. The diminutive size and blue color does make this look more like a young adult toy than a full-fledged Windows 8.1 device.  That said, it is reasonably sturdy in the hand, feeling and looking mostly like a shrunken version of the HP14 Chromebook.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the trackpad on the HP Stream 11 is NOT on par with the HP14 Chromebook. While the HP14 is a $300-$380 device (depending on specs), I don't think it is unreasonable to expect the touchpad to be on the same level of quality as the HP14 or C720. It isn't. I've used worse, but I definitely will prefer a mouse with this, whereas on my Chromebooks I think of a mouse as totally optional.  Through use, I've gotten better with it, but at first I was having a very hard time just dragging and dropping files into folders, for instance.<br/><br/>The keyboard pretty much feels like a shrunken HP14 Chromebook keyboard. Keys are a bit squishy and don't have a ton of travel, but it is stated as 97% full sizes and my WPM was about the same as usual.<br/><br/>EXTRAS<br/><br/>On its own, this is a pretty compelling device for $200, but HP throws in some goodies.<br/><br/>You get a one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal (one computer + one tablet). This does not come installed on the device; you get a redemption key that must be used by the end of 2016. I actually love this, as you can redeem the subscription on another device if you choose to do so. This is a $70 value. I'm still debating whether to redeem this key for my Stream 11, so I did not test MS Office, but based on how it runs Google Docs and Sheets, I would expect they'll run just fine provided you don't have a ton of other applications going at the same time.<br/><br/>You also get a $25 Windows App Store gift-card.<br/><br/>Finally, you supposedly get 1 TB of MS Cloud storage for a year, which is pretty crazy if accurate. As I have no need for that yet - I have 150 GB of Drive storage from my Moto X and Chromebooks - I haven't tested it, but it is a very nice add-on.<br/><br/>These offers compare pretty well to those Google gives you with Chromebooks (12 GoGo In-flight passes, 60 days Google All Access Music passes, and 100 GB Cloud Storage for two years).<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS<br/><br/>I'll need to spend some more time with this device before I know for sure how I feel about it, but first impressions have been pretty favorable. I didn't expect it to run Windows 8 so well, or have such a short boot time. The Chrome performance was much better than I'd expected based on what I read elsewhere, and Steam Streaming worked perfectly.<br/><br/>While I still wish there was a neutral color option like Black or Grey on the market, which would make me feel much better about suggesting to grown adults that this is a serious computing device, this is a decent-looking device with build quality and Windows 8 performance above expectations for this price point. For students or those seeking an ultraportable back-up computer, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with this computer.<br/><br/>If you're thinking about getting an Office 365 Personal subscription anyway, this computer is basically $130, which is an absurd value.
it's amazing !! I bought it because I wanted a lighter yet effective laptop , HP is a great brand . I'm a sophomore in college and I have online clases , I get my stuff done efficiently ! super great laptop , I enjoy it to the fullest . I'm very pleased with its functions .
It's OK. Just that.<br/>I have a Chromebook I am in love with, but needed something to run an app for work, and I fell in love with the colors of this cute laptop.<br/>But it's just OK. The track pad is very low quality and keeps reading gestures wrong, and the memory available is just 21 GB.<br/>The screen is very good, and the overall impression from this cutie is very nice. Remember to add a wireless mouse and SD card to your purchase.
SECOND PURCHASE ... Have one Blue (for myself) and one Orchid (as a gift). Unpacked my new HP Stream 13 yesterday and spent about 5 or 6 hours configuring, loading up, accessorizing and enjoying the HECK out of this little marvel. Put it through the paces, and got a grasp on it's abilities & limitations.<br/><br/>First things first ... this looks ... FANTASTIC. The photos do not do it justice, it is absolutely beautiful to the eye and to the touch. I've read a few reviews complaining about the "toy colors", most of whom are not verified owners (many of whom are technical "experts" who own nothing but review everything). I brought this to a Coffee Shop this morning, fired it up and had several people come by my table to ask "Wow! what is that" ... "Where do you get a laptop like that" ... "Who makes it" ... "Wow!".<br/><br/>It only took 5 minutes to KNOW, it would be my permanent chromebook replacement (have put the chromebook on craigslist). The complimentary year of Office 365, being able to PRINT something without going through all the complicated google work-around hoops and (most importantly), being able to Install Programs of my choosing.<br/><br/>Here are the worst things I can say about this:<br/><br/>1. Display ... it does not have the sharpest display in the world. At 1366 X 768 pixels on a 13-inch screen, it will not look as sharp as your primary laptop or desktop monitor. In my view, when weighed against the price and benefits, I can easily live with this.<br/><br/>2. Hard Drive Storage ... at 32 GB onboard storage, you'll have to use your space wisely. The OS will gobble up some of that of course. After installing a slew of my favorite Apps and Paint Shop Pro 7 (the original one), Antivirus program and a few others, I've got about 15 GB left.<br/><br/>It does have a Micro SD slot, and I've added 64 GB card to mine. I also bought an External Hard Drive, which I'll plug in and use when downloading movies, photos, music, etc. A beautiful, inexpensive WD drive ... and its BLUE! I've attached a photo of the external drive with this review.<br/><br/>3. Two GB or System RAM ... this means you probably won't be running some of the more system-hungry programs, as you do on your primary PC. In my case, this means not having PSP X7 photo editing, limited movie editing.<br/><br/>If you can live with those limitations, and use this as it was intended (secondary laptop, Student use, chromebook replacement, etc.), you've got it made.<br/><br/>I'm using a very nice Logitech (blue) mouse with this, rather than the touchpad, so I'm not able to provide useful information as to the touchpad's usefulness ... only that my limited experience with it has not shown any of the great deficiencies I've been reading about in various online reviews. Keyboard is GREAT. I love the feel, the level of tactile response, comfort and spacing (also love the white color). I have attached a photo of the keyboard to this review,<br/><br/>Here's the bottom line: You get a fully-functional Laptop computer with 32GB onboard storage, 2GB of RAM, MS Office 365, a $25 voucher to the Windows Store ... all of this in a Beautiful, compact package ... and at what I consider to be "Tablet Money" - about what you'd expect to pay for a nice 7 or 8-inch tablet. How in the WORLD can you go wrong on this? Fantastic. Thank you HP, thank you Amazon!<br/><br/>.....
Okay I have received this machine couple of days ago and installed the latest Ubuntu 14.0.4.2 LTS version. I can confirm that the wifi is working perfectly as well as the trackpad, mouse and all other special keys on the keyboards. In order to have the external mouse works 100% you will need to disable the trackpad on settings. The trackpad does not recognise clicks like windows, it's a one finger single tap for left click and a two fingers single tap for right click. It's 100% working. I love this little machine as my development machine because it's fanless which mean silent, secure, wallet friendly, and you can get all the free apps from the ubuntu software centre as well as the Internet. The battery last for 7-8 hours after a full charge depends on the screen brightness and how you use it. The standby time is very long too. The 32GB internal storage seems a limitation but if you use the cloud storage for saving your files then it shouldn't be an issue at all, and it's actually better that way because if you lost your laptop, you know your data is on the cloud, and of course you can save your stuff on a SD card too. So this is why it's my first choice as a development machine. It's also prefect for home user, student, office workers and business people too, it come with Linux office softwares which is the same as Word, Excel and PowerPoint. they work the same way as Microspft Office or Apple iWorks but more importantly they are free for lifetime with no subscription needed. I see no reason to carry around an expensive Macbook pro/air or a windows based laptop around anymore. Once you installed Ubuntu 14.0.4.2 LTS on this little machine, it's better than the latest gold Macbook in terms of the anti-thief feature. Unless you wanna grab attentions then you may wanna opt for the latest gold Macbook.
I don't understand why some reviewers don't like this computer. My other laptop broke, would not turn on, it was done. I am on a tight budget, so I began looking for a PC to do what I need to do (as a writer, my main uses are word processing, web browsing, videos and photos) and found these. When they first came out, they intrigued me. I decided to read up on them, after a bit of reading, I knew this was the computer I needed. I love it, and I honestly can't find one con. So, here's a list of everything I love about this computer.<br/><br/>- The size, I was expecting it to be super tiny, but it's actually a pretty good size, no complaints here.<br/>- The graphics are just as good as my last computer I spent $500 on, really, if you have an issue with the resolution, you're too picky, this is perfect. If you want an ultra HD display, then you're gonna have to spend the money for that, this screen is clear and perfect for the price tag.<br/>- The track pad has no issues for me, it moves where I want, how I want and you just click down bottom on the pad as your buttons, works perfect, no issues at all.<br/>- I LOVE THE COLOR. I've always wanted a computer with a crazy color, and now I have one, a beautiful bright pink.<br/>- It feels really well made and fancy, it's strangely satisfying to feel this computer, it has a nice finish, that's for sure.<br/>- It's super quiet, because of no fan, I love that.<br/>- It DOES NOT get hot, seriously, it gets slightly luke warm, but that's it.<br/>- The keys feel fine and work fine, I like how they're white to set with the pink, looks nice. It's also a full keyboard, just minus the extra number pad you'd have on larger computers to the right.<br/>- It's super thin, and very light weight, I honestly feel like I could easily carry this around with me anywhere with no issues at all.<br/>- Amazing battery life, hours upon hours.<br/>- YOU GET FREEBIES! What computer for under $200 gives you a free $25 Microsoft gift card AND  free year subscription of Office 365 AND 1TB of cloud storage for a year? Apparently, the HP Stream does.<br/><br/>I have found that everything some people complained about in the comments have been wrong for me, maybe people are too picky, but for me, this does exactly what I need it to do, with no issues, at fast speeds for an amazing price with free stuff too. I'm SO GLAD I chose this and not something else. I could not be more happier. Sure, you don't have much memory, and after installing everything I need to use, I only have 2gb left, but guess what? The computer is still pretty damn fast, just as fast as when I first turned it on, now that's amazing if you ask me. I just added an SD card tonight just to give me peace of mind, but even with little memory left, it performed like a beast. Audio is pretty good too for under 200 bucks, I'm not an audiophile, so I don't care how crisp my episode of Little House On The Prairie sounds, as long as I can hear it, and let me tell you, this computer can get pretty loud, so it's good in that aspect too.<br/><br/>Really, if you need a computer for pretty much anything but heavy editing programs or games, then this is the best choice. It's better than some computers I've paid $500 and over for. I am very pleased with my purchase. My shipment came the next day, less than 24 hours after ordering it, and everything was exactly as is. I've already used 15 of my 25 dollar gift card on "Hearts Of Fire" (a 1980s Bob Dylan movie) and a Little House On The Prairie Christmas special haha. I've activated my Office subscription, and am one happy camper. Definitely get this computer, ignore the nay sayers, this machine is amazing, nice feeling, cute, the color is amazing and it works way better than even some more expensive computers. I'm amazed at how much I adore this computer, this was meant to be just until income tax comes, but even after I upgrade at income tax time, I can still see myself using this computer daily haha.<br/><br/>Don't delay, ignore the picky people who expect million dollar features for under 200 bucks and get one, you won't regret it, it's a kickass machine.
Speed<br/><br/>This is a Celeron processor, but running on flash/ssd hardware makes it pretty zipping. It's definitely not a workhorse but if you just need a kick-around laptop to bring with you to work/starbucks/wherever else, it can do the basics and then some. Wireless AGN speeds can handle just about as much as you can throw at it.<br/><br/>Display<br/><br/>You get a pretty decent and vibrant 1366x768, which can play 720p content easily (720p is 1280x720). On this small a screen and the distance you'll likely be sitting from it, it would be extremely unlikely you could noticed the difference from 1080p. Viewing angles are pretty decent vs similar sized laptops I've seen. If you'd complaing about not having 1080p or 4k, why are you looking at this laptop?<br/><br/>Quality / Price<br/><br/>Quality is pretty decent for a tiny $200 laptop - probably more than I would have expected. I'm disappointed that the touchpad can only be button-pressed in the bottom half (rather than anywhere on the touchpad).  Still better than the old-fashioned 2 separate buttons that plague most Windows machines, but definitely not as good as the apple-esque full touchpad. But a reasonable trade-off for a $200 laptop. Battery life is fantastic.<br/><br/>Software<br/><br/>It comes with Windows 8.1 (non-RT), which is great. The flash-based storage lends to a pretty slick interface. Unfortunately it's also plagued by a ton of included bloatware, such as:<br/>Various HP junkware<br/>Apple Bonjour (spyware in my opinion)<br/>Dropbox<br/>TripAdvisor<br/>Amazon<br/>McAfee LiveSafe<br/>Weather Channel<br/>"Snapfish"<br/>"MySMS"<br/><br/>Privacy<br/><br/>If you read the HP Terms-of-Service (which you wouldn't get if you bought an Apple or direct-from-Microsoft product), it collects "anonymous technical information related to HP Software and your HP Product". HP and included third-party software will also collect personal information including your IP address and anything you include in the registration. You can't opt-out of it, so this is a nice middle-finger to the buyer. You can't re-install the OS thinking you'll get a clean slate; you just get a refresh of Win8.1 with all the bloatware back. So you can either uninstall the junk, app by app, or try to extract the serial number and re-install from a fresh 8.1 key. It's not listed on any product information or a sticker on the back, so it's a hassle.<br/><br/>Overall a decent product, decent battery life, with some significant trade-offs.
I got this laptop at 01 march, and after 17 days it stopped working at all! Simply it didn't turn on anymore!<br/>As I live out of USA I didn't get the support from hp, so I had to open the laptop and try to identify the problem.<br/>For my surprise in the motherboard there was a "burned" component nearest the battery connector!<br/>I will try to get in touch with hp and send the pictures so that they may try to exchange the board.<br/>In a nutshel, a terrible experience with hp stream model.<br/>Don't buy it! Possibly many others will get the same problem.
I got this laptop for school and will almost exclusively be using it for internet, Microsoft office and kindle.  Everything from my old computer (a Lenovo with Windows 8) transferred automatically when I signed in.  So easy!  My printer, which is an HP internet printer also transferred automatically.  The office 365 code that came with it was easy to redeem.  Since I already had this on my old computer, it extended my subscription.  I thought that was nice because now I don't have to worry about misplacing the code.  Additionally, the code said it needed to be redeemed by Dec 2016 and I think my previous subscription would have been until 2017, so it was nice to have the ability to just extend the subscription.<br/><br/>I like the color too. It's more blue than I thought it would be.  It's lightweight but still feels sturdy.  It has two USB  ports on the right and one on the left.
Hi everyone, I received the blue Steam 11 directly from HP today. I have only spent a few hours with it but I thought I would post a quick review.  It seems like a lot of computer for the money, it has a very solid feel. The only complaint I have is my touchpad has a slight rattle, when you tap it lightly you can hear and feel a rattle.  It is hard to explain but it does not have the same tight, spring-loaded feel of other laptop touchpads I have used. I usually use an external mouse so it should not be an issue.<br/><br/>I did not test performance other than playing some YouTube videos at 720p and the performance seemed good. I plugged in a 23 inch LCD TV to the HDMI port and that looked very good and the audio played through the TV speakers automatically and sounded good. I checked the disk with the Windows Disk Management Utility and it shows it has a 29 GB Hynix HBG4e with a 260 MB EFI partition, 21.54 GB NTFS C: drive (4.3 GB used, 17.2 GB free) and a 7.20 GB Recovery partition.<br/><br/>Changing the BIOS to legacy boot mode, I attempted to boot Mint Linux 17 from a USB stick (and also an external DVD drive) and it booted very slowly, I never got it fully booted.  It kept displaying "Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0rpmb" errors which I googled and found is a known issue with the latter Linux kernels and newer eMMC flash devices.  There is apparently a kernel patch for it. I also got these same errors attempting Mint 16 but when I dropped back to Mint 15 with the 3.8.0-19-generic kernel, it booted fine.  Unfortunately the Realtek RTL8723BE Wifi card was not recognized and the touchpad did not work.  I will continue to work on these issues and report back my progress.<br/><br/>UPDATE 11/2/14:<br/><br/>After some experimentation, the best Linux distro I have found so far for the Stream 11 seems to be the newly released Ubuntu 14.10 with its 3.16 kernel which recognizes the Stream's Wifi and touchpad.  It does still have the problem with the slow boot up (about 8 minutes compared to over 2 hours for Mint 17) where it displays "Buffer I/O error on device mmcblk0rpmb" and "stdin: I/O error" errors.  After boot up, other operations trying to read the disk are also slow.<br/><br/>The problem appears to be the Hynix HBG4e drive's 4 MB Replay Protected Memory Block (RPMB) partition which mounts as /dev/mmcblk0rpmb. It uses different commands and the Linux kernel is unable to access it. There are some kernel patches available that prevent the kernel from attempting access but I have not tried that yet. The partition is apparently used to store DRM and/or OEM licensing keys.<br/><br/>UPDATE 11/5/14:<br/><br/>I installed Ubuntu Mate 14.10 64-bit to the hard drive as a dual boot with Windows 8.1 and it seems to be working well. It has solved (or at least greatly reduced) the problem with the RPMB partition delaying booting and disk operations.  I wrote up the procedure I used:<br/><br/> Dual Boot Ubuntu 14.10/Windows 8.1 Install Procedure for the HP Stream 11 laptop:<br/><br/> - Download the Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit ISO image and burn it to a USB drive, (the 32-bit images cause issues with UEFI and the grub boot loader). I used Ubuntu Mate but other flavors such as Kubuntu and Xubuntu should work fine also.<br/><br/> - In Windows, use the Disk Management utility to shrink the C: drive to make room for Ubuntu, I shrank mine by 10 GB.<br/><br/> - In the BIOS, leave the legacy support boot option set to the default "Disabled".<br/><br/> - Turn the computer on and when you see the backlight, press the F9 key to display boot options and select the USB drive. Select "Install Ubuntu", there is a 2-3 minute delay due to the RPMB partition issue, (press ESC if you want to see the errors).<br/><br/> - When the Install screen appears, select language and add a Wifi connection if you have it. I selected both options presented here: "Download Updates while Installing" and "Install this third-party software".<br/><br/> - There was a 8 minute delay here while it read the disk configuration due to the RPMB partition issue.<br/><br/> - For Installation Type, pick "Something else".  It should now show the free disk space you created in Windows, I created a 8 GB ext4 partition mounted on root "/" and a 2 GB swap area partition.<br/><br/> - Highlight the ext4 partition and click "Install Now", it will confirm that it will write changes to the disk configuration.<br/><br/> - If you want to only run Ubuntu and not Windows, you can wipe the entire eMMC drive clean (including the 7 GB recovery partition) by selecting the default "Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu" option. It will do the partitioning for you if you want by creating a 512 MB EFIboot, 26.73 GB ext4, and a 1.89 GB swap partition.  (You might want to first create recovery media in Windows using the Recovery Manager utility and a 8 GB USB drive so you can restore back to the factory configuration if needed.)<br/><br/> - While the installation runs, it will prompt for time zone, keyboard, user credentials and computer name.<br/><br/> - When it finishes, reboot and you should see the GRUB Boot Menu allowing you to boot into either Ubuntu or Windows (if you left Windows in place on the drive).<br/><br/>When Ubuntu runs for the first time, the touchpad clicks may be disabled depending on the Ubuntu flavor installed so you need an external mouse to navigate to System => Control Center => Mouse and select "Enable Mouse Clicks With Touchpad". There may be a way to do this from the keyboard also.<br/><br/>There may also be an issue with the touchpad and mouse freezing so you need to run the Software Updater to get the latest updates and then reboot and it should hopefully fix this.  (It was fixed on Ubunbu Mate but not on Ubuntu Gnome when I tried it.)  The RPMB partition issue also seems fixed at this point, I installed GParted and it came up quickly without any delay.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.
Lots to like -- the beautiful blue color, the reasonably zippy performance, decent keyboard, well-built, & light.<br/><br/>But HP made some blunders.<br/><br/>First, the SSD is only 32 GB. Windows alone takes 24 GB, and they add shovel-ware, and lots of it. So the amount of usable space before you do ANYTHING is less than 8 BG. This is close to zero, and so the machine can only function as a "net book," meaning apps and storage have to be in the cloud. They should really ship with a 64 SSD, which provide five times (8 --> 40G) the usable space. Sure, you can add an SD card, but then your slot is gone, and if need to swap cards to get to the slot -- there goes all your dat ! Advertising it as a "32 GB" machine is seriously misleading.<br/><br/>Second, the machine is FULL of unwanted shovel-ware. No normal person has any idea what they can and cannot safely uninstall. Many of the apps are misnamed to make them look important and to confuse the user. Note that these apps NOT ONLY use up the tiny remaining disk space, BUT ALSO slow the machine down, because they nearly all run background threads and precesses. I looked at the task manager, and there were over 60 tasks running, before I opened a single app or single browser window. Deceptive shovel-ware like this is a serious problem.<br/><br/>Third, it comes with McAfee. This "virus protection" app is worse than most viruses. It uses up 99% of the CPU time (really!). It runs a minimum of four threads in the background. And generates constant annoying pop-ups to get up to buy an upgrade. McAfee is not needed at all, because Windows 8.1 comes with Windows Defender. It took Microsoft over 30 minutes to delete McAfee -- it is neither trivial nor fast to get rid of.<br/><br/>Fourth, the machine crashes every 10 minutes. Blue screen of death, not a browser crash. This while running ONLY a browser. Microsoft thinks that with McAfee gone it won't crash any more. So far, at least it is faster and hasn't crashed again, yet. Do you want to spend 2 hours in the Microsoft Store getting a brand-new computer fixed?<br/><br/>Fifth, the trackpad has a problem. Mostly, it works smoothly. However, some clicks are just plain ignored. A bigger problem is that often the trackpad just stops working completely for 5 to 10 seconds. We know this is the trackpad and not Windows because when using an external mouse there were no problems with either clicks or cursor movement. Microsoft has a great little external mouse. My Apple mouse also works beautifully. Don't the people who make these machines test them before the release them ??!<br/><br/>Finally, IE is "locked in," and can't be uninstalled or even turned off. Microsoft says, "this is a feature of 'Windows 8.1 with Bing.' Apparently, 'with Bing,' means you are stuck with IE taking up space and processor power forever.<br/><br/>One more plus -- the WiFi is fast and can see lots and lots of (other people's) networks.<br/><br/>On a highly mature and competitive product like Windows laptops, there is no excuse for problems at this level.
I bought the HP Stream 13 Signature Edition from the Microsoft store.<br/><br/>Let me start with the why of the purchase:<br/><br/>My oldest daughter is in 1st grade and has websites she needs to access to practice math and other things on the internet. I have gone back and forth between getting a Chromebook or not. I liked that it was fast, lightweight, and a pick up and go type of thing.<br/><br/>However, I wanted something that would be able to access things I do on my regular computers as well as any website that requires Flash, Java, Silverlight, etc.... I knew getting a standard 8.1 version of Windows that there wouldn't be any software limitations holding me back (or my daughter) from accomplishing the tasks we wanted to do.<br/><br/>So I found this, saw it was a non-moving part hard drive (eMMC 32gb) and that it boots fast and has great battery life.<br/><br/>So I bought it.<br/><br/>It works great, you just have to use it for what it is made for. It isn't a heavy duty multi-tasker, the CPU and RAM will get fully used with too much open.<br/><br/>However, its great for browing the web, word processing, and even playing games from the Windows store (Angry Birds, Wheel of Fortune ,etc...) all work great.<br/><br/>I sat on it for 3 hours while my wife was teaching a class at our home and still had tons of battery life left.<br/><br/>If you have too many browser windows open, it may get a little laggy, but I've noticed browsers being laggy on my more powerhouse computers, web browsers are just memory hogs nowadays.<br/><br/>I am an PC/Networking IT professional and like having the top of the line processing power, so I am usually quite skeptical of lower-spec'd hardware (Celeron processor, 2 gigs of ram, etc...) but I love this.<br/><br/>I am going to be purchasing a USB 3.0 to gigabit ethernet with a usb 3.0 hub so I can work on configuring wireless routers for work and also getting a USB to Serial for the times I need to view/change configs on switches/routers.<br/><br/>I'm excited about having this, its a great on the go laptop that works in a very zippy fashion and is fun to use.<br/><br/>I sold my iPad and bought this, I am happy with that decision.<br/><br/>Update 12/31/2014: I have had this for a couple months almost now and I am very happy with the purchase. I bought a USB 3.0 hub with a gigabit Ethernet connection on it and a USB to serial cable. This covers a wide spectrum of things I can work on in IT. It handles itself well with the hardware it has inside.<br/><br/>I ran a network tool on it to increase the RWIN and other TCP settings to optimize the speed of the internet and it helped and I am happy with the computer.
Don't be deterred by some other reviews. But also be aware of what you're getting. I am starting school in a few weeks and I needed something basic. I intend to fully utilize the free year of Office 365 and terabyte of storage. I don't plan on installing any unnecessary programs or saving documents directly onto this laptop. So far I've done some web browsing and streamed movies from Netflix with no issues. I uninstalled a few unnecessary programs but the average user will be just fine using this laptop as-is as long as they understand the limited space available.<br/><br/>It boots up in about 10 seconds and is super lightweight. No heat, no fan, super quiet. In fact it's absolutely silent.  And let's face it, the color options are adorable. The display is beautiful. You really can't ask for more for the money. I looked at some other basic laptops with larger storage options but for me, it wasn't worth spending a couple hundred extra dollars. Considering that this laptop has a built in webcam and Bluetooth (others I looked at didn't) and I can simply buy a memory card if necessary, this was an excellent investment.
"Netbooks are over."<br/>Seems to me they're coming back now, with the power and comfort they should have had the first time around. Windows compatibility in a cheap fanless design is really compelling. It's not Linux on the desktop, but it's a cheap, lightweight OS on hardware suited to the task. Microsoft's cloud services for documents, mail, and storage are equal to anything offered by Google.<br/><br/>"Forget about gaming."<br/>While it's true you're not going to be breaking any speed records with this, you will do fine with indie games from Steam and good old games from GOG. The latter is particularly good on this hardware if you remember how noisy and hot PCs used to be. (disclaimer: I'm old, and I like old games)<br/><br/>"It's loaded with crapware."<br/>Be sure to buy the "Signature Edition" straight from Microsoft. That's what I did, and found it to be very clean and streamlined, with nothing extra that you don't need. None of the junk that others are complaining about was on my machine. It should cost the same or less than the mainstream version.<br/><br/>"The screen, ugh."<br/>The screen doesn't show well when you first power on the machine, but after a brief adjustment period, it's OK. Remember the price of this thing. It's like Chromebook screens in this price range. Something like the ASUS t100 has a nice, shiny IPS touchscreen, but at a higher price and without the size and comfort of this machine.<br/><br/>"Windows isn't optimized for battery life."<br/>This simply isn't true anymore. This thing can do 8 hours without a charger, easily. I'm really impressed. It's like a tablet that can run Windows software.<br/><br/>"Windows 8 is the worst thing in the world."<br/>It's a small adjustment (some, but not all, of the system functions have been moved), but if you live in the Desktop environment, it's not very different from Windows 7. This device does not have a touch screen, so you won't be in the tile screen very much anyway.<br/><br/>There's also an HP Stream 7 tablet with lower specs but decent touch features. Since it costs next to nothing, I'm tempted by that after this nice Windows experience.<br/><br/>"Atom and Celeron processors are garbage."<br/>Again, see "forget about gaming." If you want to spend 4x as much for an i5, the option is there. Today's low end is the mid-range from a few years ago, only with reduced power usage.<br/><br/>"What's up with that blue plastic? It looks like a toy."<br/>That's true, but it doesn't bother me ... especially since I expect my kid to use this a lot. The blue is bright and vivid, and I think it looks nice in person. The matte exterior finish doesn't collect fingerprints, and the faux metallic keyboard deck is cheerful and attractive. The whole package reminds me of the early, inexpensive Apple iBook clamshell laptops in vivid colors, except with a lot more power. I'm in search of a decal to hide the shiny HP logo on the front. A Superman logo would fit right in.<br/><br/>There's a pink one, too. If you don't want pink or blue plastic laptops, this isn't for you.<br/><br/>"2GB of RAM? 32GB of storage? And I can't remove the battery or upgrade the innards? Get out."<br/>OK, this might not be for you. But with the option to for a cheap and large microSD card, you can load a bunch of media on this machine. It's probably possible to delete the system recovery partition if you really really want to get that 8GB of onboard storage back. The downside of doing that would be losing the easy rollback/erasing options included in Windows 8.<br/><br/>"Windows 8? I want Windows 10."<br/>Settle down and wait until Windows 10 is actually released, and for sanity's sake, don't complain that the beta preview doesn't have every driver in the universe.<br/><br/>"The keyboard is a MacBook ripoff."<br/>This is true, but it's not a bad thing. Some system functions are easy to reach in the top row (brightness, volume, media controls, airplane mode), and they put Home, PageUp, PageDown, and End keys in a column down the right side. The key motion and feeling is fine. I'm a little bit worried about long-term reliability of the switches and will update this review if the keys fail before my warranty is up.<br/><br/>"I hate the trackpads on cheap laptops."<br/>Me too. This one is not bad, though. It's large and responsive.<br/><br/>"There's no way a $200 laptop can be any good."<br/>Depending on your needs and expectations, this one might surprise you. I'm pleased with mine thus far.
Love it! Lightweight, much more appealing than your average gray or black notebook. More attractive in real life than in the photo. As others said, the drawback is, it comes loaded to the hilt with crapware, so be ready to delete out many programs you don't need or want. Some reviewers are pretty advanced, and recommend deleting even the HP support-ware and Realtek card reader etc. Do NOT do this unless you really know what you're doing! IF you delete the cardreader, for example, and haven't pre-installed a driver that will work, you will not be able to connect with the internet at all, and will have to do an entire reinstall from scratch. That said, it's pretty easy to go to "uninstall programs" through your Control Panel, and pick anything that's clearly 3rd party not-wanted, and uninstall it. On your list of pre-installed apps on the desktop, you can also right-click on anything you don't want, and pick "uninstall" as an option (on most anyway). Don't worry about deleting anything essential doing that. If you try to delete something protected, you'll be transferred to the main Control Panel and you can bail from there. I don't even want the free one-year Microsoft Office, as after you're hooked on Office-crack, you'll be paying for it monthly forever. Some might need it for college or work, but we don't need spreadsheets or power point, or most other things. We only want a simple word processor. For that, there are a lot of good apps, many free, that will read (and write) Microsoft-Word-compatible docs.<br/><br/>Also, Microsoft is notorious for aggressive updates to your comes-with Windows 8-1 operating system. You can be in the middle of something, and suddenly find your computer in their control. It slows everything down for hours on end, then arbitrarily shuts down, and can take 15 minutes or more to restart and update. Grrrrrrr! I go into preferences, and turn off ALL auto update features from Microsoft. Once a month, I manually check for updates, and then let them install while I don't need the computer.<br/><br/>Another thing: I don't like Microsoft making me use Internet Explorer and therefore, Bing as a search engine. The only time I used IE was to download Firefox. It that browser, under preferences, you can make up your own mind which search engine(s) you will use. I like Google for that, I use Yahoo for mail, and I do a lot of research on Wikipedia -- and I like to make my own choices, not have Microsoft ram theirs down my throat. It takes a little time to customize, but worth it in the end. Also, while I have one of my choices running, it's icon is in the taskbar: if you right-click the icon, you have the option to pin it to the taskbar so it's easy to find again (and unpin anything that was pre-loaded).<br/><br/>Oh yeah: I turned of the trial "cloud" program as well. Things are uncertain enough on the internet, without giving all your files to some 3rd party, who might just turn out to be some government or other! No thank you. By the way, the anti-virus "Windows Defender" comes free with your HP, so you don't need to buy anything else. You will have to uninstall the "trial" version of -- Mcafee I think it was -- that came with. It asked several times if I was sure, yes I was, and it's gone.<br/><br/>Back to the HP Stream13 itself: the keyboard is small, but easy to use. The screen provides excellent resolution. For such a small notebook, the pad is large and responsive.<br/><br/>I set this up and gave it to my wife: she mostly just does email, goes shopping online, checks the bank, and writes the odd letter, so the cleaned-up harddrive is plenty big enough. She loves it!
Unpacked my new HP Stream 13 yesterday and spent about 5 or 6 hours configuring, loading up, accessorizing and enjoying the HECK out of this little marvel. Put it through the paces, and got a grasp on it's abilities & limitations.<br/><br/>First things first ... this looks ... FANTASTIC. The photos do not do it justice, it is absolutely beautiful to the eye and to the touch. I've read a few reviews complaining about the "toy colors", most of whom are not verified owners (many of whom are technical "experts" who own nothing but review everything). I brought this to a Coffee Shop this morning, fired it up and had several people come by my table to ask "Wow! what is that" ... "Where do you get a laptop like that" ... "Who makes it" ... "Wow!".<br/><br/>It only took 5 minutes to KNOW, it would be my permanent chromebook replacement (have put the chromebook on craigslist). The complimentary year of Office 365, being able to PRINT something without going through all the complicated google work-around hoops and (most importantly), being able to Install Programs of my choosing.<br/><br/>Here are the worst things I can say about this:<br/><br/>1. Display ... it does not have the sharpest display in the world. At 1366 X 768 pixels on a 13-inch screen, it will not look as sharp as your primary laptop or desktop monitor. In my view, when weighed against the price and benefits, I can easily live with this.<br/><br/>2. Hard Drive Storage ... at 32 GB onboard storage, you'll have to use your space wisely. The OS will gobble up some of that of course. After installing a slew of my favorite Apps and Paint Shop Pro 7 (the original one), Antivirus program and a few others, I've got about 15 GB left.<br/><br/>It does have a Micro SD slot, and I've added 64 GB card to mine. I also bought an External Hard Drive, which I'll plug in and use when downloading movies, photos, music, etc. A beautiful, inexpensive WD drive ... and its BLUE! I've attached a photo of the external drive with this review.<br/><br/>3. Two GB or System RAM ... this means you probably won't be running some of the more system-hungry programs, as you do on your primary PC. In my case, this means not having PSP X7 photo editing, limited movie editing.<br/><br/>If you can live with those limitations, and use this as it was intended (secondary laptop, Student use, chromebook replacement, etc.), you've got it made.<br/><br/>I'm using a very nice Logitech (blue) mouse with this, rather than the touchpad, so I'm not able to provide useful information as to the touchpad's usefulness ... only that my limited experience with it has not shown any of the great deficiencies I've been reading about in various online reviews. Keyboard is GREAT. I love the feel, the level of tactile response, comfort and spacing (also love the white color). I have attached a photo of the keyboard to this review,<br/><br/>Here's the bottom line:  You get a fully-functional Laptop computer with 32GB onboard storage, 2GB of RAM, MS Office 365, a $25 voucher to the Windows Store ... all of this in a Beautiful, compact package ... and at what I consider to be "Tablet Money" - about what you'd expect to pay for a nice 7 or 8-inch tablet. How in the WORLD can you go wrong on this? Fantastic. Thank you HP, thank you Amazon!<br/><br/>.....
It's pretty good but freezes up sometimes
The Stream 11 and 13 are great deals for those knowing what they're getting.<br/><br/>I purchased both the Stream 11 and 13, not knowing which would be best for my situation.  For those without a primary computer, it'd be tough to recommend as there are some significant drawbacks, but at this price point, that is to be expected.<br/>These computers could no way replace my primary source of computing, however they're a substantially investment and good value for light/every day computing tasks.  If you're planning on surfing the web, emailing, watching videos/listening to music or even playing light gaming, this is a wonderful value.<br/><br/>If you are planning to do some substantial gaming, look elsewhere.  I fired up Starcraft 2 just for kicks and it couldn't keep up.  Likewise with Marvel Heroes, even streaming from my desktop via Steam, I was surprised at how laggy it was, even with my desktop doing all the heavy lifting.  This just reinforces that these machines weren't designed for this task.  But if you're playing Facebook games or even Flash games elsewhere, they're capable.<br/><br/>I should mention that I will be using this system primarily for programming as I follow along with my video courses and ebooks on my main desktop.  It is a nice way of obtaining a Windows 8 license/system for developing.  One year of Office on top of that?  Heck yeah!<br/><br/>These systems weren't really built for multitasking and you're going to have significant issues if you intend to do so.  I tried running Windows 8 built-in Netflix app while installing a program.  It took about 3 minutes to launch Netflix and stream West Wing, crashing twice in the process.  Once it did launch, it ran smoothly full screen at 720p, but the subtitles hung and didn't keep up with the content.  I ended up switching them off.  This goes to illustrate that the processor and RAM can't keep up with too many tasks concurrently.<br/><br/>Stream 11/13 Model Differences:<br/><br/>The Stream 11's screen was noticably sharper to me.  The viewing angle was better and the colors were more vibrant and didn't feel as 'washed out' compared to the 13.<br/><br/>The trackpad also seemed more responsive on the 11, it wasn't as loud when clicking or as stiff to the 13's.  I did have a bit more trouble registering clicks on the touchpad center versus the 13's, which did result with me going back and using the button instead of the touchpad's center.  Additionally, the swiping was easier on the 13's touchpad and didn't register the charm's bar as much as the 11's.<br/><br/>Interesting as well, the power connector is located on the left side for the 11" and on the right side for the 13".  Personally, I preferred it on the left.<br/><br/>The specs were the exact same on my models except the SSDs, but the capacity was the same.  The keyboard was a little more cramped on the 11" and didn't have the Home/End and Page Up/Down buttons that the 13" does.  The enter key feels a bit strange on the 11" and I ended up hitting the comma button more than I'd like as opposed to the enter key.  I wound up making more typing errors on the 11".<br/><br/>I ended up chosing the 13" despite the differences above.  The weight difference is less than half a lb and the keyboard/screen were larger.  I couldn't pass that up, despite wishing that I could swap some components out between the two models.  I was surprised by the subtle differences and glad that I ordered both to try them out.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend either system, provided you understand some of the nuances of these machines.  They are competing with Chromebooks and are a welcome addition to my daily routine.  It really is a marvel how far we've come along with technology.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd want a 13" computer, or even an 11" for that matter, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I'm sure you will as well.
Upon unboxing it such a beautiful little thing the weight is amazing the set up was very easy. the keys feel nice. as most people have already wrote in their reviews not the brightest screen by a long shot, it bugs my eyes a little. I have not adjusted the screen on this new computer so im not sure how bright it gets. I have also heard complaints about the memory but there is the sd slot on the left, I also wanted to add I only bought this computer to surf the web and maybe watch movies, I do not require any computer to have an expanded memory. however this computer comes with the drop box and hp drive to store those kinds of things. you could also uninstall a number of programs to make it faster and free up some space.<br/><br/>YouTube videos play no lag, I also have a Netflix account didn't have a problem there either. There is a web cam for skype and such it is not super clear but it works.<br/>The sound is louder than I expected I find no fault with the speaker/volume<br/>It automatically connected to my wireless CANON printer I did not have to do anything but push print (I guess because it was on the same network) but that was a big worry of mine before I made this purchase.<br/><br/>One month later and I can add a couple more thoughts on this product and really I would add it is not for gamers & anyone needing lots of memory. I have recently been noticing it's been loosing connection while surfing the web nothing wrong with my router it just stops connecting like a phone would drop a call I usually use the back or refresh button to get it going again but I wanted to point that out I do not know why it happens I am far from an expert on computers so sorry no explanation. it can only do one function at a time it will freeze up if you try and do too much.<br/><br/>I know my review is all over the place I should have listed pros and cons but im really just reporting as I go, I am also not a fan of windows 8 this is 8.1 I still don't like it I use the desktop thank god it has the option to do that. it is also very easy to customize the color the background etc<br/><br/>before this I had a Toshiba satellite 15in I can honestly say paying $400 for that computer vs this one was a big mistake and it wasn't worth it this one does the same job with the exception that there is no cd/dvd included and that doesn't even matter because you can purchase the cd drive separately . I honestly do love this computer and the price is next to the best thing about it because after my Toshiba went down I was never going to pay for any laptop/computer for that price ever again so when I saw this for $200 it was like a sign saying here you go buy me and I did and im glad. I have had such back luck with computers this will def be my last purchase<br/><br/>This is great for students it's got the gift card and 1 yr office (I have not used any of the two yet) like I said I just surf the web and let my daughter play abc mouse
I'm a student and needed something relatively inexpensive, and this has everything I need! The Microsoft Office set up easily. Thanks so much!
First negative review of mine on Amazon. Upon opening the laptop's track pad was lifted at the corner like it was going to fall out. I tried to just push it in and get over it. I've never returned anything in my life and I don't get swayed easily. I'm pretty easy to please. It's been about two weeks and this computer sucks. It feels defective. The sound that they speak so well of, only works when I'm listening exclusively to mp3 files and sometimes it lags which makes no sense if it's my own files and not the internet. If I'm on youtube, even on a 2 minute video it doesn't buffer and pause, it actually lags, and the sound lags but also starts cracking and making weird sounds. Netflix isn't working for me much either. Now I've used about 3 computers in the house I'm in, a desktop pc, a chromebook, and now this. None of the other computers had those weird issues. I'm in finals month at college and am graduating. I don't have time to figure out how to return this stupid thing, I have to use it for papers but I hate it and will never by something so important on amazon again.
I've had my Stream 13 for a couple of weeks....<br/>I use it to write on, surf the net and more I've even watched part of a movie...just to see if it could and it did fine...<br/>I use 365 word... I write at work and sync it so I can write at home... It works great for this...<br/>I prefer to use a wireless mouse over the pad but to be honest this pad works better then my wifes HP laptop<br/>I've installed Ywriter5, CCleaner, MaxThon and IceDragon the reason for these browsers are they are light weight but stable<br/>Ice Dragon works great...<br/>I've still got 10gb left on the hardrive..<br/>I've order a Scandisk 64gb microcard.. got it for $18 off ebay..<br/><br/>I've played angry birds and it worked fine...<br/><br/>Booting is almost instant..like 60 sec<br/>Shut down like 30 sec.<br/><br/>My point to this post..is this is what it is...Use it for what it is.. And what it does it does great...and remember it is only $230<br/><br/>One last thing...DO NOT SUBMIT A REVIEW UNLESS YOU OWN IT OR AT LEAST HAVE USED IT FOR DAYS...Jezzzzz People how can you submit a review on color alone ?  or give it a one star because the HD is too small.. It is what it is...and you read the spec before you bought it...And Don't submit a review of why you wouldn't buy it... Submit something if you have something to say that relates to your usage of it...A helpful review...<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>11/26/2014<br/>I've had this for a few days....<br/>I also bought three other laptops/2-1's knowing I'm sending everything back once I pick the one that works for me...<br/>OK I also got<br/>HP Pavilion 13-a010dx x360 Convertible PC  Intel i3 4 gb ram  500 GB HD Beat Audio  $550 plus tax<br/>Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Series 2-in-1  Intel i3 4gb ram 500gb hd $599 plus tax<br/>Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Series 2-in-1  Intel Pentium N3530  4gb ram  500gb hd  SCRATCH & DENT  $255<br/>And of Course the Stream 13<br/><br/>First off I'm not a gamer..I'm surfer and writer, also listen to YOUtube music video's<br/>I use various writer software..Scrivener, Ywriter5, Libre, etc..,<br/><br/>First thing I noticed with the Stream 13... The Display has a good Colors...but you need to tilt it just right or it washes out.. It is very touchy to angles..<br/><br/>Ok up against the HP Pavilion..<br/>Sound... Whats up with the Beat audio ???  The stream kicks it to the curb..yes the beat is basser but misses out with the highs and the Stream is louder and has more highs which cut through<br/>Display... For a $200 dollar laptop the Stream is great..I would be embarrassed if I was the Pavilion at $550<br/>Touch Screen... Who cares! who wants to be cleaning your screen all the time and those finger prints would drive me nuts..I'm ok with no touch screen<br/>Key board....Well I guess the Pavilion feels more expensive ...But $350 dollars more...NOPE<br/>Lets talk about Speed... Stream 13-This thing boots in less then 10 sec and even less to shut down... and moving around opening and shutting down programs.. The Stream is faster..<br/>If they would put a 128-256gb SSHD in this thing is would be the the best in it's class for sure... Whats a matter HP scared this $229 laptop would out class your other stuff ..well too late...<br/>Now add a larger HD keep it under $300 and watch your stocks go up...<br/>Most likely the reason it's fast is because of the small SSHD but I would pay $299 for the Stream 13 w/256gb SSHD<br/><br/>OK NEXT<br/>Dell Inspiron 13 7000 Series 2-in-1  Intel i3 4gb ram 500gb hd $599 plus tax<br/>First off I like the glow in the dark keys..COOL..<br/>What I don't like is the display... It's color is off compared to the HP's  it's darker..Greener...gloomier and I've tried everything to make it brighter and prettier but no dice...I changed the power option on all 4 laptops to Performance... tried to increase brightness but it was already maxed..<br/>TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR DISPLAY  and this is the same for the other DELL Inspiron 11 3000 Series<br/>Audio it is louder then the Stream and sounds good<br/>Speed...Still slower then the Stream... This is not worth $600 compared too the Stream 13<br/><br/>Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Series  $255 plus tax.. (Scratch and Dent)  Looks new and says refurbished on back..<br/>Ok  I talked about the displayes on these Dell's already<br/>Speed is still slower then the Stream 13<br/>Sound is louder and good..<br/><br/>But I will have to tell you...Since it is only about $30 more then the Stream 13 and it has the Pent N3530 Quad Core, 4gb ram and a 500 gb HD it is very tempting to take this over the stream 13..<br/>I've got a couple more weeks to try both more..before sending something back..  the other are going back next week Just not worth the $300-350 difference over the Stream 13 or the Dell Inspiron 11 3000 Series<br/>If I had to pay the normal cost on the Dell I would stick wit the Stream 13 for sure...But since it's a scratch & Dent that looks new...Well we'll see...
I've only had this laptop for about a week, so this is what I think so far. I needed a quick replacement for my college laptop after my more expensive touch screen ultrabook's screen crashed. This computer fits the bill for a cheaper alternative to a touch screen but still allows me to complete my school work. I'm able to watch lectures, surf the web, type documents, and use OneNote. I do notice a bit more lagging with this laptop than my previous one, especially with multiple windows open and music playing. However, for the price, I'm willing to work with that. My only other complaint thus far is the placement of the "home" key. It is right next to the backspace key, so I find I'm hitting it on accident (hit it once just while typing this sentence), but that may take getting used to. I love the look, very sleek (I purchased the blue). I also love that it is lightweight to allow me to carry it in my backpack with books. I'm not very tech savvy, so I can't speak to the RAM or anything of that sort. But for me, this was a great computer for a good price and fits what I need.
My review:<br/> I love this laptop! It's my first laptop, (I have a desktop computer) and it's great. I bought it for being an underpowered mobile version of my computer, for basic browsing, browsing while watching a movie, etc. It's pretty great! It's only a tad bit slow loading webpages, but I'm pretty sure it's just because I"m so used to having a high powered gaming pc. Watching videos are normally really smooth, but just don't try to load another webpage while having it on, it'll stutter. Playing games wise, I can't run Minecraft very well, even having the settings low and stuff, but I can play less demanding games like The Escapists, DeadLight, etc. Music and sound wise, it's really good compared to other laptops I've had in the past. It's not super loud, but it's good enough for me. The only downside to it that I've seen/noticed after having it for a few weeks, is the trackpad. It gets confused as to which button you're trying to click (left/right) and it does get really aggrevating. I got a little wireless mouse and problem solved. There's alot of apps/programs that are preloaded onto the laptop, but it's simple to get rid of most of them. The screen is in like a matte style, which I LOVE, except it came with a smudge on it somehow and It's rather difficult to get off. But it's not a big deal<br/><br/>Final thought: For a basic laptop for general use, I love this.<br/><br/>*The stickers do not come with the laptop, i got those separate*
Let me first say that this is less of a review and more about my first few days with the HP Stream 13. The main thing I wanted to do was post a few gotchas just to make any prospective and/or new owners aware, as well as submit my initial impressions. I should also caveat that I have been a heavy ChromeBook user (I've owned three as well as a ChromeBox), and ordered this as an alternative to those platforms.<br/><br/>Hardware Notes - I owned two versions of HP's ChromeBook 14, which is based on the same chassis as the Stream 13, and the keyboard is similar, but a skosh better. There seems to be a few additional mm of travel in the keys and that is a big help. It is nothing like a MacBook Pro or Lenovo AccuType keyboard, but is above where I would place Acer and Asus keyboards, in general.<br/><br/>I missed that this has a microSD card slot before I ordered it. I assumed it had a full SD Card slot because the HP ChromeBook 14 did. It is not a big deal; I only mention it because I reckon that the average user has a few SD cards around from a digital camera, but may not have a higher capacity microSD (32GB or larger I'm thinking) lying around. I ordered a 128 GB microSD card to handle my music collection and anything else I need.<br/><br/>It's a minor plus, but the HP Stream's power cable is designed properly; it is a side-mounted power supply port with a 90-degree connector. I only mention this because I hate 90-degree connectors that go to rear-mounted ports, or straight power connectors that go to side-mounted ports, and so many laptops goon this up.<br/><br/>Bonus Goodies - ok, maybe it was just me (maybe), but I had a heck of a time claiming all of the extras that come with the HP Stream 13. First off, it includes 25GB of extra DropBox storage (albeit for 6 months, I think). I am not sure it is mentioned anywhere on the product page; maybe I missed it, but it's a nice plus at any rate, so no problem's there. The $25 gift card to the Windows App Store - you can only claim this through Internet Explorer, and as you go through the process, you are constantly asked to make security and privacy exceptions to IE's default settings. It's a pain and it did not work the first few times. Office 365 - while trying to claim this code through IE, I was never able to get the code to take. Maybe I fat-fingered the claim code...like 12 times?? Maybe. Once I had Mozilla installed, it worked fine. I will say that I uninstalled the stock Office pre-install and was trying to do a fresh install. I figure that if you leave Office installed and launch it and activate in that manner, you might not have a problem. Of course, you might need to do a fresh install of Office anyway (see below). Once you get Office activated, your 1TB of OneDrive space should show up.<br/><br/>OS and Storage - Here's the biggie. Out of the box, I think there was about 14GB or so of hard-drive space; I'm not entirely certain. Let's call it somewhere between 14 and 17GB. There are 8GB of the 32GB hard drive allocated to a Recovery Partition. You can copy this partition to external memory. I copied it to an 8GB microSD. With some work-arounds, you can even delete it from the HD once you have made your backup. But after that, the device will not boot. You can edit the registry to make it work again, if you are comfortable doing so. That was a bit too much for me to deal with, so I installed a spare license of Windows 8.1 Pro that I had lying around. That worked like a charm, with one exception that infuriated me. At the time that I checked, the drivers for the HP Stream 13 were not available on HP's site for free as you would expect. The only help they offered was to let you buy a recovery drive for $40. I found the drivers via another site and got the Stream 13 up and running again. Let me also say that HP's Support site appears to be a byzantine, convoluted mess designed specifically to prevent you from simply sending them an email for a product under warranty and asking for assistance. I got a hold of them via Twitter. I will also say that there is a toll-free number provided for initial setup support that I could have called, but I was working on this during the wee hours of the night and skipped that option.<br/><br/>This seems to have been rectified, so maybe there was a support site update going on this weekend or something. The options I see now are more the norm I have seen on HP's site, and are starkly different from the limited support options I found while trying to work through this over the Thanksgiving holiday. There are several different pages that are being presented, so maybe something was amiss this past weekend. So it is fine now, but my out-of-the-box experience was pretty horrible.<br/><br/>With a fresh full install of Windows 8.1, I have just over 5GB of storage left on the native drive, no HP bloatware, and plenty of space on the 32GB card I am using while I am waiting on the 128. The system is performing well with regards to speed. Again, this is a low-power workstation and should not be expected to do much heavy lifting. HP could have done better with how they configured the system (for Pete's sake, put the recovery on an 8GB microSD card and include it in the box) and really needs to work on their support site (or say something if they are updating the support site). I do not think I would recommend this laptop for an unsupervised user unless you plan on being a certain level of tech support for them to get them going.<br/><br/>Pros - 0.77 inches thick, 3.4 pounds, small in-the-bag footprint, good island-style keyboard, very inexpensive<br/><br/>Cons- some horrible operating system configuration choices, no option to remove the Recovery Partition after creating a Recovery Disk, paltry hard drive space left (run disk cleanup out of the box to ensure that there is not a ton of leftover cruft from Windows Updates taking up hard dive space), non-removable battery, a TON of bloatware
Good so far but I can't connected to my house wifi and this little window it's annoying I want to take it off but I can't the switch btw apps it's annoying and I can't what I write
STAY AWAY! I thought this computer was everything I wanted - I WAS WRONG! The sound keeps making weird noises during videos, and all the keys keep getting stuck! This is a NIGHTMARE! I am not one to rate a 5 star product 1 star for no reason - this is seriously a waste of money. I have to press the "n" key 39 times before it works!
I received this item as a gift and would likely not have chosen it on my own based on the reviews as there were numerous complaints about it's speed and the touchpad, so I received it with measured expectations. While the lack of internal memory is still a limit, otherwise, this laptop has far exceeded my expectations. The touchpad, while it was an adjustment, is no where near as bad as described. After two weeks of using it, I really have no problems with it at all. I often have multiple applications open and have yet to find that it freezes up on me. The screen isn't the best I've ever seen, however, it is definitely clear and easy to read.<br/><br/>(If you are having issues with the contrast, I recommend opening the Intel Graphics Control Panel by chosing Graphics Properties when right clicking on the desktop. Using these settings instead of just the main brightness/display settings in Control Panel allowed me to get a much better image, including better contrast and brightness, as well as color improvment.)<br/><br/>I primarily use this computer for watching streaming/downloaded videos, writing documents, and browsing the internet and would definitely recommend it for others with similar needs. Previously, I had an Acer Aspire S-7 with a touch screen, and to be honest, this laptop has outperformed that one by  leaps and bounds, despite the fact that it cost nearly $500 more. While it likely had capabilities for more intensive applications that this laptop lacks, this laptop (for my purposes) has already proven to be more useful. Even out of the box, my previous laptop had trouble handling multiple applications, the touch screen glitched out within a few weeks, and touchpad itself was far more glitchy than this one. This one is also much lighter weight (lighter than most text books), holds charge for nearly 8 hours of constant use (as opposed to tops 4 hours on the other one), and charges much faster.<br/><br/>Because of it's lack of internal memory, I do recommend getting the card to expand the memory, especially if you are not constantly connected to the internet as you will obviously will not be able to use cloud storage if you're not online. I do take a lot of photographs, however, I utilize cloud storage to save them and don't do a lot of heavy editing. However, this computer is capable of handling GIMP (a free photo editing program with capabilities similar to Photoshop) far better than my previous computer. I was also very easily able to connect to a wireless home network that utilizes an external hard drive, despite the fact that the other computers on the system are running on older versions of Windows, which has allowed me to barely use my memory card.<br/><br/>I do also advise weeding through the preloaded software for programs you won't use to declutter this laptop to expand what internal memory is actually available. I did also make adjustments to the touchpad sensitivity and turned off Chrome's ability to run in the background (this has always been an issue for me with laptops in the past). If you are a compulsive downloader of new programs/apps you could very easily clutter this machine up with it's limited storage capacity and in re-reading other reviews, I have to say that many of the people who were running into issues were likely not taking this machine's abilities into account, not using good virus software, or simply lacked an understanding of WIndows 8 overall. The specifications on this laptop tell you that you're not going to be running graphics heavy software or be able to have a lot of capacity for running many things at once. I'm currently running Chrome (two windows with a total of 8 tabs), two different instant messenger programs, Last.fm streaming music, and  in the process of uploading a large batch of pictures  on top of the standard background processes (virus software, bluetooth speaker, firewall, etc) and am having no slow-down. While I'm sure it's possible to achieve that effect if I push it, my general level of use is never going to hit that capacity.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that if you're not going to be using intensive applications and will mostly be watching videos, uploading pictures, browsing the web, and using social media, this is an amazing deal. To someone not comfortable with cloud storage, removable storage cards, or without constant internet access, this laptop could be limiting  and completely frustrating. If you are not familiar with Windows 8, how to remove unwanted programs, connect to wifi connections, or how to adjust the settings through your control panel, you may also run into difficulty getting this machine set up and may want to enlist a computer-savvy friend to get going. Once you get things adjusted to your liking however, I think that most users will find this machine is quite handy and definitely a great alternative to a full priced laptop where you pay for many features that you will just never fully utilize.
I just received my laptop today. I love it! I bought this computer strictly for school use. Lugging my big heavy one around starts to take it's toll on me. I use my laptop daily for class and notes and homework so I have to have it on me. This computer is so light, so easy to use, and is super quiet so I will not be disrupting students while I'm in class. This computer is super fast, and is a beautiful blue. The picture does not do this computer justice. The keyboard is white and the blue color fades as it goes down from the screen to the edge. I am absolutely in love with this computer. It is a perfect computer for high school and college students. The touchpad is easy to use, although I am old school with a mouse, but this is the best touchpad I have ever had on a laptop. The packaging was wonderful and I know Amazon took care of my purchase. The space worried me because it is only a 2gb hard drive. It comes with 1TB of cloud storage which would be hard for a person like me to use all of. I did go to Wal-mart and buy a 64GB micro SD card and it wasn't that much at all. 44 dollars and I have all the space I would ever need!
I work with a MacBook Air daily - and share it with my son for his school needs.  That arrangement was driving me crazy.  I needed an inexpensive computer he could use for school and knock around with.  I looked at a few different versions; tried a touch screen laptop (hated it), looked at some of the cheaper laptops out there (they were really clunky) and finally settled on this.  I've only had the laptop for a few days, but so far, so good.  While this certainly isn't a Mac, it does do the job.  The resolution is okay, but for the price, it's passable.  I love the blue color and the touchpad works well.  No backlit keys, but that really isn't an issue for him.  The ergonomics of the keypad are great and the feel of the keys is very good.  It is made of plastic and does have a bit of a cheap feel vs. the Mac, but if this had to be my only computer, I could use it just fine.  My son can use this for all of his needs and we have watched Netflix on this without a problem.  Very glad it also comes with a free year of Microsoft.  My son is happy as a clam and I got my MacBook back!  I would HIGHLY recommend this computer for a student or anyone that needs a workable, reliable laptop on a budget.
Worked great for the first week, after which the webcam stopped working completely. Very very slow. Waste of money.  The only thing nice about this computer is the design and color.
Here we go: This is the 4th laptop I've ordered on Amazon and finally I will keep one. The previous ones were Toshiba, Dell and Asus. Here is what I learned: There isn't much of a difference between a $500 laptop and this $229 dollar one. Ok, the other ones had touch screens, but the quality of the color, sharpness, and brightness weren't any better than this one. For $229 it will serve it's purpose to help me through grad school writing papers and doing research on the go. The first thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was how slippery the plastic was. It has a matte finish that has literally no grip to it. One nice thing is the weight. Even though the plastic isn't the highest quality, the laptop has a pretty solid feel to it. However, the palm rests are not very solid and have a cheap hollow feel to them. Don't expect to play any games on this laptop or do much multimedia activities. It could barely keep up with streaming video from Hulu Plus. My internet connection speed is fast, but the video capabilities aren't that great. I bought it for research and writing and it will serve it's purpose as well as a $500 laptop. I have to give HP credit for making a pretty good budget laptop that is very affordable. If you read some reviews, study the specs, and have realistic expectations, then this may be a good choice. If you want something fast for gaming and multimedia functions then I'd stay away. Web browsing and office apps are what it's suitable for. Update--don't bother trying to have multiple tabs open in your web browser. This laptop doesn't have the processing power or memory to handle multitasking like that. I ended up getting a Windows blue screen of death as it crashed the laptop. *Let me stress this again: It is only suitable for office apps, checking email, and basic computing needs. If you want to watch Youtube videos & play games, get something else. **Update: The keyboard is actually the best part of this laptop. I do quite a bit of writing, so I'm actually impressed with the keyboard. There is just enough feedback from the keys and not over excessive travel up/down when you press the keys. I'm not so crazy about the touch pad--it's a little bit "all over the place." I just don't like the feel of the touch pad and the left/right click buttons feel cheap when you press them.
I loved this computer HP, is fast, good size and very light. blue color is beautiful.
I really do like this thing a lot. I put it head-to-head with a Chromebook. Most of you know a Chromebook is a laptop with simply a browser as its OS. It is very responsive--starts up practically immediately, transitions are fast. The Stream and the Chromebook share stats, 2GB RAM and 32GB SSD.<br/><br/>One thing that is very important when you look at the Stream (or a Chromebook) is what your expectations are. I do not expect to play games, use Photoshop, save a ton of documents and photos on the machine, use a DVD player, edit movies. I really wanted a sort of modern typewriter that can use the internet. If your expectations are not limited by these inexpensive machines' lack of a wide range of capabilities, you will probably be happy.<br/><br/>On the Chromebook, I opened 20 tabs. I had Play Music running. Other notable sources of strain were using Word Online and a solitaire app (which was the only thing I saw on the Chromebook that was not strictly running in Chrome. I had ESPN, The Verge, Facebook, Twitter, Evernote, and Gmail tabs open, stuff I would normally be running. I don't really know anyway of measuring the performance stats on a Chromebook, but for these tasks, it passed the test. The only thing it was slow at was restarting.<br/><br/>On the Stream, I used Firefox (having read it has the lowest mainstream browser footprint) and opened the same tabs. I also had Bing Sports, OneNote, Evernote, Skype, Bing Weather, OneDrive, Microsoft Word (the actual program) and Klondike going.  I also tried the Metro versions of Facebook and Twitter. At a certain point, Play Music began to stutter and choke. Aha! But I wasn't so sure it was the machine, and I realized I wasn't doing a true comparison without also using Chrome. I started Chrome, loaded everything back up, and it handled Play Music without a hiccup. In fact, the Stream with Chrome handled everything I could think of that I would want it to do, and without any more lag than it naturally has (which is not too much).<br/><br/>I'm not an IT guy, but I can open Task Manager. First I looked at the Memory column. It was at 84%, which kind of alarmed me. I compared the memory usage of the three browers: Chrome (113.9 MB), Firefox (35 MB), IE11 (15.8 MB). So if you took these stats as absolute, it doesn't explain why Firefox choked. And no matter how much I load the computer with tasks, the total memory stays in the 80s.<br/><br/>CPU usage varies a lot. I can be at 10-20% at rest, then move up as you open programs, which you might expect. One problem, which I think was mentioned in the review by "formortals," which is voted the most helpful review at the moment, is that the CPU spiked to 100% every 15 seconds. Along with deleting bloatware, I deleted the HP Registration service and one or two other HP programs. The spikes went away. I think it was the HP Registration Service. (Disclaimer: I am not responsible for anything that breaks on your computer if you delete the things I mentioned. I was taking chances.)<br/><br/>So, I can tell that the computer is managing its CPU usage and memory usage in an efficient way. That's all can infer technically.<br/><br/>I kept the Stream and returned the Chromebook.<br/>Stream Pros:<br/>*To me, I was assuaged that the Stream was not going to get bogged down and laggy doing the things I wanted it to do. I was, and still am, to be honest, waiting for a Windows computer to start slowing down. That has not happened so far.<br/>*I would much rather use the MS Word Windows app than Windows Online or Google Docs. This was a big one for me. The Windows Word app is simply more full-featured than the other options. It's fast, and it's integrated nicely with your online storage.<br/>*There are, or may be, certain things I need Windows for--maybe converting a file or some such thing. I wanted to remain open that way.<br/><br/>Stream Cons:<br/>* I don't like Windows, even though Windows is also necessarily a Pro above<br/>*It's blue (my opinion)<br/>*Can be complicated--look at just the stuff I had to mention in my review above.<br/>*And the BIG Con: the trackpad is totally lame. On my Stream the left click is a really firm click. I mean really firm. Try it if you can. But on my trackpad, there's a sweet spot in the lower middle where I just have to tap. I mostly use a wireless mouse anyway, and this trackpad is not going to convince me otherwise.<br/><br/>Why not the Chromebook? I didn't like the look of always being in a browser. I want to write in a separate app that doesn't have three browser bars at the top. I decided I liked using the Stream despite my wariness of Windows. It grew on me, while the Chromebook started feeling limiting.<br/><br/>I would again urge you to really write down everything you want to do on a laptop, and make sure this price point is OK for your needs. There's no room for error, or you'll be unhappy with your Chromebook or Stream.<br/><br/>That's enough from me--there are thousands of reviews here and everywhere. You should be able to nail down your decision.
I bought it as second laptop while I already have a thinkpad t440. The design is nice and battery is impressive. Only one problem is the small storage but I solve it by set a 32 GB as  vitural disk and attach it automatically when pc start. So now I can install large programs such as Matlab games  office and almost everything I want
This computer seems really nice at first, but since it has so little memory as it receives updates the memory fills up. I have all documents on a flash card, I have not added any programs to it and I am receiving errors that my memory is almost full.  I contacted HP support who informed me that since there is only 2 GB memory, it is taken up by the system. He said the updates I taken the left memory.  So I can no longer receive updates and the computer is not able to have anything of my own in the memory. I would say that it is worth the money to invest in something with more memory. This is not my first issue with this item.  I received it with a defective keyboard. Some of the letters did not work as well as the mouse. HP was great about repairing it but now I have memory issues. I would not recommend this item to anyone.<br/>Follow up,  my keyboard is out again. It will take 3 to 5 days for them to ship a box and 9 to 10 days to repair.  If you decided to purchase this I highly recommend purchasing the extended warranty
Setup only took about 7 or 8 minutes, very fast, smooth keyboard, long battery life, easy to use and easy to download apps, overall fantastic
Before I purchased the HP Stream 11, I checked a bunch of reviews from different places.  Some said it was good, some said it was under powered.  Well, I decided to purchase one anyway because I was going to give it to my mother and she only needed a computer for playing card games.  When it first arrived, it was very slow.  Internet explorer could not handle the multiple windows I opened up and my streaming was choppy.  There was so much bloatware that the computer felt very sluggish.  The 2gb of RAM felt more like 512 and the atom, excuse me, the celeron processor seemed slow.  (The celeron basically is the old atom processor.)  So the first thing I did was to uninstall every piece of "extra software" that came with the computer.  I took out McAfee (Windows defender is good enough for me), all the HP software, and the extra programs that were not necessary for windows to run.  (Including bonjor which I consider bloatware)  I even took out the office software as I had a copy of office 2011 that I was going to install.  After all the programs were removed, I proceeded to remove every non essential app from the metro interface.  Apps ranging from netflix to skype, I removed them all.  After I was done, I went to ninite and installed only essential software like vlc, chrome, firefox, acrobat, and runtimes like silverlight, flash, and java.  After installing only the programs I wanted, I created a refresh image and I proceeded to refresh my windows 8.1 installation from my custom image.  After about 2 hours of work, I can now say that this computer is wonderful.  It plays my HD movies and I am able to stream netflix, hulu, and youtube in HD without any interruptions.  I was able to keep the laptop on for about 6 hours+ on battery and startup and shutdown seem very fast.  The only hiccup I had was when I plugged in the HDMI to my Samsung 60 inch tv.  There was a noticeable lag when I was playing full HD movies.  Lower resolutions were fine but HD had problems.  On the laptop screen itself, there was no lag.  Overall, I am thinking twice about sending this laptop to my mother.  This computer needs work out of the box, but it is great for a student.  The only thing is the size of the hard drive.  I only have 7gb of space left after installing all my stuff.  But with an external storage, or if you decide to use Microsoft's online storage, you should be fine as long as you do not save movies on your computer.  I highly recommend this computer  but you will need to put some work into it.  I would actually suggest that you purchase it from the Microsoft website instead of amazon.  Microsoft sells a signature version without any extra software from HP or amazon.  It would be a better starting point if you do not know how to clean up your computer.  I love this little thing so much that I wrote this review on it.  Highly recommend this computer, if you don't have the budget for anything better.  Worth every penny of the 200 dollars I spent.
I was looking for an everyday notebook to replace my tablet with a keyboarded computer.  I picked up the <br/> from the 'mart and it has been a disaster ever since.  Out of the box, the computer looks very sleek, ultra-portable.  During setup, the system froze 3 times.  No big deal, computers freeze up sometimes so I kept going.  After getting to the desktop the system ran incredibly slow.  There was so much crap-ware on this computer it was unbelievable, it took me hours to uninstall it all.  Afterwards, I noticed the system would go to 100% usage with out any provoking.  After looking at the task manager menu, I found it was the HP tools that was causing it.  I don't think it was Windows 8.1 that was the problem, but the way HP 'customized' this computer.  Even after removing those, the system still runs slow and eventually I just returned it to the 'mart for credit.  I didn't bother with support or a replacement, this portable laptop is just not ready for primetime.
Who I am: - A student<br/>  - I dont game<br/>  - I don't need a million programs (I have: Skype, Chrome, Rainmeter, Adobe, about it)<br/>  - I basically just need the internet<br/><br/>This Computer: - The only computer I haven't wanted to throw across the room (I've bought 10-12 laptops thru-out my life ranging from this price, the lowest, to around $600) (I'VE BOUGHT 3 OF THESE CUZ THEY'RE SO GOOD...ONE BROKE DUE TO MY OWN CLUMSINESS)<br/>  - A bit slow, but I'm patient<br/>  - Only a little bit of space, always tells me that I only have a little bit of space, then it closes my chrome :,( (I cri erryday)<br/>  - Looks fab, especially with rainmeter (look at picture)...blue one is sick too<br/>  - Dim display, terrible-ish color (another reason not to game on it)<br/>  - 10/10 Battery, one of the main reasons why I love it...aroud 10-11 hours sometimes more if you're lucky<br/>  - Okay Keyboard, not very clicky. Lowkey. One of my laptop's spacebar<br/>  - Sound is 10/10 :) Very crisp and loud<br/><br/>Extra Comments: - Don't Buy this if you are some music producer who needs audacity+gimp+photoshop+inkscape don't buy this...don't game on this either<br/>  - I highly suggest this for students who don't want to get frustrated with their computer, it's very stable and not weird<br/>  - Also for students who drop their laptops a lot...I drop it all the time, nothing have ever happened<br/>  - On this note: It's pretty light, it does scratch easily but looks fine...it doesn't get ugly oilmarks<br/>  - 10/10 price...100%100%100%<br/>  - If space is a problem, you still have to download programs on the internal hardrive, but either buy an external one or use Google Drive (<< 10/10) for your files...Also remove HP Documentation or any other programs that take up a ton of space even though you don't use them: If unsure if you can remove program you can ask in the comments :)<br/>  - $25 giftcard for aps<br/>  - Any other problems are just Microsoft's fault, so it'll be on any Windows computer you buy. Windows 10 is great on here<br/>  - Seeting this is competing with Chrombooks, which I have bought, this is much better. I've thrown my chrombook across the room before. The computer is fine but the battery does not charge, or is hard to charge. I do not suggest the cheap chrombooks (Chrombook 11 0/10)
Updated 12/14/2014 - changed from 3 to 4 stars - see UPDATE section at bottom of review.<br/><br/>I actually purchased the Signature Edition of this HP Stream 13, which does not contain the HP bloatware. But I believe the review also applies to version sold on Amazon.<br/><br/>The laptop seems fine for undemanding tasks such as web browsing and Office applications. The screen is acceptable, the speed is acceptable, the keyboard is rather good, and the trackpad seems fine as well.<br/><br/>I believe that when some people claim the trackpad to be glitchy, it could be due to the fact that when loading web pages, the vertical scrollbars appear well before the browser is able to scroll. It needs to load more content before scrolling becomes possible. This leads to the impression that the trackpad is unresponsive. But if you try the Page Down key, you can see that the page is simply not ready to scroll.<br/><br/>On the subject of scrolling: I find that scrolling down long photo-filled web pages isn't quite as smooth as I'd like. The action is "jerky" and therefore distracting, I tend to use the Page Up/Down keys, which seems to hide this stuttering.<br/><br/>My main complaint about this laptop is the disk space. Now, now, now, don't get ahead of me. I purchased it knowing full well that there was limited space. But, at the same time, I figured I could reclaim the space consumed (7GB) by the recovery partition. So far, I have been unsuccessful in doing so.<br/><br/>I've backed up the hard drive 3 ways:<br/>* Using Macrium Reflect to create a whole disk image<br/>* Using Windows Backup to create a whole disk image<br/>* Using HP Recovery Manager to create a bootable recovery USB thumb drive<br/><br/>Then, using Macrium Reflect, I deleted the recovery partition, and ran its "Fix Windows Boot Problems" procedure. No dice. Upon booting the system complains that my PC needs repairing. Looking through other online reviews, I haven't found anyone who has claimed to have successfully deleted the recovery partition. Lots of people say that they plan to, or that you can do so, but nobody has actually said that they've done it.<br/><br/>This is especially maddening since the space will probably be consumed by Windows Updates. All I have on the laptop is Microsoft Office (2010, not 365), Kaspersky, and Firefox. I disabled hibernation to reclaim that space. That left me with 12.2GB. Then I ran Windows Updates (for the first time since getting the laptop), and am now down to 10GB, even after running the process that removes unneeded Windows Updates files. So my first foray with Windows Updates (admittedly, a lot of updates) took about 2GB. Not an auspicious start.<br/><br/>It seems likely that Windows Updates and the ever-growing WinSXS folder will, within a year or two (hopefully at least three), completely fill up the SSD. At that point, I will probably uninstall MS Office and all its updates, and try OpenOffice or LibreOffice to breathe some life back into it. Then when that fills up, I'll install Linux.<br/><br/>Not having an easy way to get that 7GB Recovery Partition back is a mistake on HP's part. If you search the Internet, you will see that on previous HP machines that, after you create external recovery media, you are given the option to delete the recovery partition. Not so on the HP Stream 13. Perhaps HP figures that only novices would buy a $200 laptop, so it's better to make the recovery partition permanent. Yet that wouldn't make a lot of sense, since novices wouldn't know how to delete the recovery partition in the first place.<br/><br/>Hopefully someone will read this and post a method for getting that 7GB back. Then I'll happily eat my words. And if HP provides a way to do it, I'll even raise my rating!<br/><br/>================<br/><br/>UPDATE 12/14/2014: Two things have prompted me to upgrade my rating from 3 to 4 stars.<br/><br/>I believe I figured out the issue with the Recovery Partition. Rather than duplicate all the read-only Windows files required for restoring the laptop, it appears that these critical files are only stored on the disk in one place (the recovery partition), and Windows is using some kind of hard links to avoid multiple copies. While this save considerable space, it does mean that if those files get corrupted for whatever reason, the recovery partition won't be any help, because there are no viable duplicate copies to restore from.<br/><br/>You can see the space savings by doing a Properties on the Windows folder. On my laptop, it reports that C:\WINDOWS is 14.8GB in size, but consumes only 9.9GB on the disk. I presume the missing ~5GB comprise Recovery Partition files. So to remove the Recovery Partition would require some fancy footwork (booting outside Windows, copying files, deleting links), and would save a few gigabytes at most. Not worth it.<br/><br/>It would have been nice for HP to have chimed in on Amazon and other sites to explain this, and mentioned it in their documentation (or the Recovery Manager), rather than leave the question hanging.<br/><br/>The other action I took is to uninstall my Office Home and Student 2010 and its installation files. My free space went from 8.6GB to 13.5GB. It's mind-boggling how Office could consume 5GB, but there you have it. So I am more optimistic now that the laptop will last more than a few years.<br/><br/>I ended up installing LibreOffice, which took about 1GB. If I ever need space in the future, I can always look to Adobe Reader next (explain to me why Adobe says that Reader XI requires 350MB, and yet it is consuming over 600MB?).
Bought this for a birthday present. Three weeks later, it is dead. It does not even try to charge and the little plugged-in indicator is dark. Tried it with another charger, different plugs...nothing. Very disappointed.
Please note:  this laptop cannot easily update to Windows 10 due to the lack of storage space after the initial setup process / downloading of Windows 8.1 updates.  After all Windows 8.1 updates have been downloaded, you will only have roughly 4 GB storage space remaining for documents, pictures, and music on the internal storage.<br/><br/>Pro:<br/>+ Build quality is excellent and lightweight (excellent for a student)<br/>+ Unique & Colorful design<br/>+ Flash based storage helps make this sub $300 Windows laptop comparable in speed to most Chromebooks<br/>+ Regular sized HDMI port included<br/>+ Excellent speakers<br/>+ Processor and memory specs are sufficient for most users interested in light gaming, web browsing, and email.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- The recovery partition takes up half of the 32GB storage space (Difficult process is required if interested in updating to Windows 10)<br/>- Bloated with junk software which requires manual removal<br/><br/>**Disclaimer - If this laptop updated to the free Windows 10 as advertised, I would have given it 5 stars.  In my opinion, I think most users who use this product for a few months with Windows 8.1 and then later decide to update to Windows 10...would be frustrated with having to backup all their files and then resort to a manual / grueling process for updating to Windows 10 by manually deleting the recovery partition.
Love it. easily switch back and forth from windows start menu to conventional desktop interface. Very fast browser which was my main objective. Good deal for price. Touchpad is super sensitive and takes some getting used to. Not for those wanting a dvd drive or a lot of internal storage, but there are usb ports for drives, flash drives, etc.
small and light but freezes constantly freezes and can't have more than one program running at a time.
I saw so many good reviews for this laptop so I purchased one thru amazon.<br/>When I received this I was so surprised by the poor quality of the touchpad.<br/>The touchpad does not work smoothly.  I've owned a lot of laptops, and I bought this one<br/>mainly as low-cost, lightweight laptop to use when traveling.<br/><br/>The touchpad works poorly and scrolling thru web pages was intolerable.  I was constantly<br/>retrying my swipe gestures repeatedly.  Swiping along the outer edges of the touchpad<br/>hardly worked at all.<br/><br/>Then to finally seal the deal, the laptop was 70% charged before I went to bed.<br/>The next morning the battery was completely dead.  This battery is supposed to be good<br/>for 7 hours.  So why did this die overnight?<br/><br/>I left the lid open, but I would expect the laptop to go into sleep mode since it was NOT plugged into<br/>an outlet.  However the next day the battery was drained.  I read quite a few reviews on Amazon<br/>and nobody mentioned the touchpad or battery, so perhaps I got a lemon, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Good: lightweight, good-looking design, quiet operation.<br/><br/>Bad: Display could be better, Touchpad worked very poorly, battery drained overnight ,<br/>  Scrolling was extremely choppy on some heavy web pages and touchpad made<br/>  navigating web pages almost intolerable.
EDIT: I've had this computer for about 6 months now. I rarely use it, because it's a terrible machine. Even with its minimal use, it has slowed significantly. I am still baffled as to how to remove some of the crapware. The touchpad is awful. I have owned several $200 or less computers. This is by far the worst. I highly discourage anyone from buying it.<br/><br/>Just bought it, so I may come back to edit this review after some use. But my immediate reaction is, what's with all the crap that's automatically loaded? I feel like I just purchased an advertisement, and now I have hours worth of uninstalling ahead of me. Not a good first impression. Also, not a concern to me personally, but the design makes it look like it belongs in a second grade classroom. Just a heads up.<br/><br/>So day 2 now, and liking this laptop less and less. The keyboard is funky. Might just take getting used to, but I'm having a heck of a time typing. One problem is I keep hitting this "home" button when I stretch for the backspace and it takes cursor to the beginning of the line. That alone wouldn't be a problem, but it seems to be impossible to disable the key, which is frustrating. In general the keyboard and touchpad are very sensitive. This is my 3rd HP and so far my least favorite.<br/><br/>Day 3. It's a brand new computer, and it takes 4-6 seconds to open a web browser. I don't even want to think about its speed in 6 months.
As a final semester of college--main computer and spare crashed--(thanks age and a power surge), had to get a new computer--this was an early graduation gift.  I don't know that I would have picked this without doing a bit more homework....<br/>Pros: Its super light and fast!  Long, long battery life! Lots of ports.  Keyboard buttons are  large.<br/>Cons: Not a lot of computer based memory--must use an external hard drive or cloud service for document storage.  Keyboard is QWERTY with large keys (yay!) however, the large mouse pad makes typing an ergonomic issue after long periods. Depending on your perspective the large mouse pad can be a help or hindrance when typing...<br/><br/>Overall, I love it--it's exactly what I need right now!<br/>~hope this helps!
I've had this laptop for a couple of days now and it is great. Exactly what I was looking for. Immediately upon starting the computer up I updated it to Windows 10. If you wait and try to do it after you have installed other programs on it, you will not have sufficient storage so I recommend doing it right away. Next, after you update it, delete the old OS. If you don't, you will only have like 2-3GB of storage left on your SSD. To delete these files, go to Disk cleanup -> Clean up System Files -> Check the box for "Previous Windows Installation(s)". This will free up another 8-10GB on your SSD and the computer will be freed up again. In addition to this, I also deleted all the bloatware that came with the PC. It makes it a ton faster.
I think 95% of the college students would be happy to have this as their only computer. First, I was little bit skeptical about the performance of the CPU and the lack of the hard drive, but CPU was surprisingly fast and hard drive was a non-issue as I save everything on OneDrive. When I say "CPU is fast," I do not mean that it is as fast as a expensive CPU as I5 or something, but it is fast enough that you don't feel like your computer is lagging on your daily jobs.<br/><br/>This is cheap, light, fast and durable computer.<br/><br/>However, this laptop is not for<br/>- High quality 3D gaming<br/>- Media editing (Photoshop runs fine but I wouldn't do much<br/>- Advanced programming (Visual Studio will fill the hard drive)<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this laptop to anyone unless they really need "high performance computer."
I ordered a HP laptop. I received 8 boxes of diet Snapple and 2 bags of Chips.
This thing is great, especially after trying out a few other ultrabook,,cloudbook type of pc's. I have a nice HP 17.3 inch laptop, but after a year a few keys started to go bad it. I'm still probably going to get it fixed even though I've been using an external keyboard. Which is just odd. Because everything else about it is awesome. Anyway I needed something so I can type reviews, word, works, youtube etc. This is the best by far. Especially with Windows 8, NOT Windows 10, arggh. All these new machines especially budget ones like this just do not run it well at all. To much updating, slows down everything and is just bad overall. I'll stick with this, even though some people hate 8, I like it. I never use the tabs anyway. just straight from the desktop.<br/><br/>I also recommend getting some expandable memory for this, I got 128gb SD Card, which is plenty. I also have a few External HDD's but they are to large for regular use, and I wanted something hidden. So I have all of my music etc on it, and still have over 50 gigs left. All the pro-reviews have been good for this unit, all I can say is I wish I hadn't messed around with other ones and gotten this to begin with. It's quick (Especailly for the specs) and runs Windows 8 great. Fluid and smooth. Not sure where people get the idea it's "slow". Especially if you use Google Chrome instead of IE. Very quick. Holds a great connection too. I actually like the track pad, it's very solid, smooth scrolling, and the trackpad keys are good. Just takes a little while to get use to the small size. Especially when you right click on something. Which is probably what most people meant by saying it's finicky.<br/><br/>So get one while they are around, I got this (blue) for myself, may get my mother one as well. The bottom does run hot, as many have pointed out, but nothing you could fry an egg on or anything. Especially with no fan. I got this at Wally World for 179$, should have gotten two for that price. Good speakers, blue tooth and screen as well. Viewing angles are not nearly as bad as some people say. And I like the Matte non-glare finish. So HP is about the only good company out their right now for PC's. Most have fallen by the way side.I like Acer, (have for years) but they are getting cheap on us. And Lenovo is also a great company, along with Asus (some of them). So anyway pick this up, you won't regret it. (20 year computer engineer here). :)
Originally gave five stars for the price, for use as a lightweight Linux machine. I have dropped this to 3 stars because of the extremely limited Wifi range.<br/><br/>I found the Wifi range to be *extremely* limited on this machine. The connection was dropping at 4 to 5 meters from the router. After doing some research and troubleshooting, this appears to be either a design or manufacturing issue, and other people have mentioned similar problems on Windows as well. If you buy this laptop and have similar problems, I solved this with a Wifi range extender (in my case, Netgear N300 - $35).<br/><br/>Runs well with LMDE 2 (Linux Mint Debian Edition 2 - or "Betsy") with Mate desktop. I found the Cinnamon desktop to have choppy performance. It took a bit of futzing with the BIOS settings and partitions, but it is nothing out of the ordinary for Debian users. Wifi hardware worked out of the box, so no need for hard-wired ethernet on the install (which is good, since there is no ethernet jack). I noticed that it only found my "G" Wifi - apparently "N" is not supported. 22GB of space left after the OS install. Performance of this machine is generally peppy running Linux. TouchPad seems to work well under LMDE2, so perhaps the issues reported in other reviews are related more to Windows and not the hardware.<br/><br/>This netbook has been designed to be manufactured at a low cost. You can't upgrade the storage, and the battery isn't exposed. Still, the keyboard has a nice feel, the screen is decently bright, and it looks cool. The design looks nice. Battery life appears to be decent - 6 to 8 1/2 hours under light use (using Linux - Mint LMDE with Mate). No fan in this laptop! It runs quiet and cool.<br/><br/>MineCraft plays reasonably well, with about 20 fps average. A little chunky at times, but quite playable. You *must* drop some of the graphics settings (video) to get consistently good frame rates for Minecraft 1.8 and higher. Good enough for the kids. Note: I don't expect this to be the case if you try to play MineCraft on Windows on this machine, as Windows minimum resource usage is a lot higher, and MineCraft eats a lot of RAM. I tested under Linux only.
I bought this computer to replace my barely three year old toshiba that started shutting down on me randomly. I'm a broke college kid, so in my life, buying a brand new computer is gonna get me farther in the long run than trying to fix something that keeps breaking down. (Hopefully I can get that old one fixed someday when I have more of an income, because it's still superior in a lot of ways to this one. But for now, this thing is perfect.)<br/><br/>The main thing that attracted me to this computer was its price. I used my tax refund to get this and a few accessories. I did a lot of comparisons and I decided that for me this would be a much better option than a Chromebook because it runs full windows 8.1. That was the thing holding me back from getting a Chromebook when my old computer started having problems about a year ago. I just couldn't justify giving up the windows experience, because although there is very little I do outside of the computer browser, I am used to having the option. I like playing with art and music so having the option to use image and sound editing stuff that run outside of my browser was what I was looking for. After reading through the reviews (and not just the good ones :P) I decided this was the one for me.<br/><br/>The main "con" points as I remember from the 1 star reviews were that this computer is slow and freezes when you have more than one program running. I haven't found this to be true, and I am by no means a computer expert (as much as the older people in my life like to believe). The only tweaks I did to this computer were following the list of another commenter in removing some of the software I wasn't going to use or pay attention to. It's really not that hard to figure out how to do this, either. You could probably just google "how to uninstall software in windows 8.1" and you'd find a helpful, step by step article or video. Don't be afraid to look around if you don't know how to do something.<br/><br/>The biggest weird thing/problem I've had with this computer is that when I  watched a couple movies and TV show I'd purchased with the $25 Microsoft store credit, the sound got really glitchy and annoying. I tested streaming just some music (from soundcloud) and a couple youtube videos and they did not have anywhere near this problem. So maybe just don't use the gift card for stuff in the microsoft movie/tv store. (Still really cool to have the gift card though.)<br/><br/>The other qualm I've seen people talk about with this computer is that the trackpad can be kind of wonky. This I can say is somewhat true, but you can adjust the gestures on it so it's a bit more stable. The biggest problem I have with it now is that when I'm in Chrome, I often accidentally drag tabs so that they become their own window, which is frustrating when I'm trying to switch between tabs when working on things. (If anyone can help me fix this, I'd appreciate it!) Also, the physical trackpad can take some getting used to if you're used to the kind of textured ones that come with earlier laptops. However, they work pretty much the same way once you've used them a bunch.<br/><br/>The smaller things that I'm not a big fan of (but willing to deal with) on this computer: My main thing is that I don't like how soft the keyboard keys feel, not enough resistance to me when typing. But! This was easily fixed for me by adding a molded silicon (sp?) keyboard cover I got on ebay for less than $5. Quick, easy, non-permanent fix that I get to use to add a little bit of my own style to this computer (I got the keyboard cover in pink!). The other tiny thing was that the blue color option for this computer was for some reason $60 less than the pink/purple color option, which I would have preferred. I guess a lot of people prefer it, and that's why it's still priced a little higher than the blue option. However, the blue is still a really cool color for a computer, it's super unique and I still like it a lot.<br/><br/>There are positive things about this computer too though, I promise!!! I really like how long the battery stays charged. I can go all day using this and not have to plug it in until the wee hours of the night, which is amazing compared to my last laptop, which had a battery life of about a half hour (even with a newly replaced battery). Depending on what you use the computer for, you could have different results, but I'm extremely happy with what I'm getting with this computer.<br/><br/>I also really like the speakers built into the bottom part of the laptop. They sound really good compared to my last one, and most laptops I've tried to use the speakers on. They can be turned up to a pretty good level, and things sound good on them. I'm not a professional musician, but they sound good.<br/><br/>The matte finish on the screen may be more of a budget thing, but for me it's also nice because it's easier for my eyes (in my opinion). The colors also look good on the screen in my opinion.<br/><br/>Last but certainly not least, this computer is so light! I love this, because my last laptop was so heavy I'm convinced I exacerbated some back problems when lugging it around in my backpack. I'm currently taking some time off from school so I haven't extensively carried it too much, but there is an obvious difference in just lifting it up.<br/><br/>It's super quiet because it's fanless, which I love. My last laptop would wake me up in the middle of the night when I accidentally left it in sleep mode, but not this guy.<br/><br/>I didn't like windows 8 at first, but now that I'm getting used to it, I do kind of like it. I never thought I would like windows 8, not in a million years, but this computer has converted me.
I needed something which would let me comfortably type, surf the web, and fool around with Wordpress from the comfort of my bed. I'm stuck at a desk all day and I regularly take work home with me so it is nice to come home, relax, get in my PJs, lay down, put this sucker on my chest and get some stuff done. Tablets, regardless of OS, have serious productivity limitations, trust me, I have tried to make it work to no avail. So I had a need for a portable device that is natural to type with and navigate the interface, while compatible with the software I use. I mostly use Macs so a MacBook Air would work perfectly as it is constructed both light and very solid. But that would also cost me about $1000 with tax and it would be nice to have a more natural way to access the Windows world rather then the unwieldy Bootcamp option. If this machine was constructed in the cheap and flimsy manner of HP notebook's of past, I would never consider this machine as about 5 years ago you couldn't pay me to use a HP product as the quality of their laptops was absolutely terrible. I must say this laptop's build quality is on par with a Sony VAIO and even to a certain extent an Apple product. It is light, very solid, and quite. I am very impressed by this. I have only 3 minor problems with this product, well 2 minor and 1 sort of serious.<br/><br/>#1 problem, the HP bloatware. You absolutely must get rid of it because it both siphons performance and consumes precious disk drive space. Fortunately, if you take 30 minutes to an hour, you can accomplish this with little problems, but it is very annoying that HP still does this. All in all, not a big deal.<br/><br/>#2 the screen. The screen is not good. By not good, I mean not even average and certainly not even close to a MacBook Air, but it still works LOL. You can see things just fine even if it is not the highest quality resolution. Anyway, this is not such a problem for me, and I'd certainly understand that this is one of the trade offs involved with buying a $199 PC laptop. If you want to watch Netflix in bed, you certainly can, but I would say most any tablet, especially an iPad with Retina, will be the far superior option.<br/><br/>#3 the flaw that really pisses me off the most is the touch pad. It is not very responsive nor precise. Again, I understand the trade offs with buying such an affordable laptop but this really irks me. Not enough to stop using the machine, but still, I really would have hoped for better touchpad performance, especially given the premium feel of the machine when you hold it in your hands. Luckily I do a lot of typing with this and I would say the keyboard is the opposite of the touchpad. Despite looking a little small for my preferences, the keyboard is very solid and allows for natural, second nature key strokes. This is something I was unable to replicate with the various bluetooth keyboards that you can pair with a tablet.<br/><br/>To summarize, I give this machine 4.5-ish stars, or perhaps more accurately a 8 out of 10.  The touchpad is a major annoyance and the screen is noticeable downgrade from the average devices of the day but the otherwise superb construction and software value of this product is too great to ignore. I am very pleased I went this route, coming from a OSX background, windows 8.1 is not so bad and the $800 I saved by not going to the Apple Store for a MacBook Air is very nice indeed!
Because of low price, I am giving this one the full five stars. I find it to be stable, and quite capable for general web browsing, email, and similar lightweight chores. The storage system is SSD (solid state) meaning that there is no spinning disk drive. Consequently, battery life is excellent: On the balanced setting, it will last for five to nine hours. The size is comfortable. I have big hands and old eyeballs, yet I can use it with no discomfort. It has a port for HDMI output and a socket for micro-SD memory card. The latter is useful because the size of the internal SSD storage system is quite small.<br/><br/>There are many limitations that you should be aware of. The camera is the worst that I have ever seen: low resolution, noisy, and washed out. The trackpad is not the greatest. It is good enough so that I am not motivated to use a mouse, but still. The screen is not the greatest. Not awful, but you won't confuse it with an Apple Macbook, that's for sure. WiFi is 802.11n, rather than the latest 802.11ac.<br/><br/>About the storage system: it is small. The main partition is 14 GBytes, and a good portion of that is occupied by Windows. There is another 7 GBytes that is dedicated to recovery. If you like to tinker, you should be aware that those 7 GBytes are necessary for Windows to function. I verified this by trying to install Linux in that 7 GByte space. It sort of worked, but Windows would not load after that.<br/><br/>Speaking of Linux, you should be aware that only the most recent versions will be usable on this machine. The biggest issue is the SSD data storage system. There is a special partition that is read only, and the current Linux distributions (kernel version 3.18 and less) do not handle this well. During a Linux boot, the kernel will try to read the problematic partition again and again. Practically speaking, this means that a Linux boot can take 10 minutes to complete. If you launch gparted, you can kiss another 10 minutes of your life goodbye. I will return to the subject of Linux in a moment.<br/><br/>Well, problem. After about 6 months of use, the tiny disk drive is full. As far as I can tell, the fullness is due to all the software updates that Microsoft sends. I have tried a lot of tricks, including clean-up software tools, moving software to a micro-SD card, and deleting software entirely. The disk keeps getting more full. As far as I am concerned, avoiding these updates is not an option. Without them, the computer is not secure. Another month of this, and the computer would be done for.<br/><br/>To continue using this computer, I could find no alternative to intalling Linux. Recall that I have complained about issues with Linux, mainly SSD access. To address these problems, you need Linux kernel version 3.19 at least. So far, I have had good results with the latest Ubuntu Linux release 15.04. I allowed the Ubuntu installer to delete all Windows partitions, and then I updated everything. Finally, I did an "apt-get dist-upgrade" to force some recalcitrant packages to update, including the all-important kernel packages. This process took some time, but finally I have a usable computer again. I don't expect the little disk drive to fill up any time soon.<br/><br/>I got this machine for the low price of $200 and it is worth it, but only because I was willing to put Ubuntu 15.04 on it and blow away Windows completely. Now I have a nice little machine for traveling, and for general fooling around. If I drop it on the floor, have it stolen, or foul up its software I am not going to shed any tears. An inexpensive computer is very nice to have.
It came in yesterday morning. The design and feel of the computer altogether is awesome! It's light, sturdy, and easy to use. Windows 8.1 is kind of difficult, but easy to get used too. The keyboard feels awesome under your fingers. It resembles the macbook keyboard, however it is not backlit except for the CAPS LOCK button. Nice key travel and keys are spaced apart perfectly.<br/><br/>The trackpad is kind of iffy. It works good 95% of the time. The reason some people have difficulty with it, is because using more than 1 finger on a trackpad can sometimes trigger multi touch and makes the computer tabs shift or close.<br/>The screen is matte finish, not glossy. Youtube video quality and netflix stream pretty good. The webcam, it's not the best camera, but it's something. Ideal for quick selfies and short videos. The bottom of the laptop gets hot really quickly if you stream video for a long period of time. Or use it for a long time while it's charging.<br/>Charges pretty quickly. The battery life is somewhat equivalent to a phone, but easy to work with. For me, it lasted about four and a half hours of continuous netflix streaming. But remember that any online data download or streaming will take a decent amount of battery power.<br/>It works great with Microsoft office, perfect for students who need to put together a lot of presentations and type essays.<br/>Laptop isn't ideal for gaming, however some casual games like minecraft, league of legends, and other low-medium end games run pretty well.<br/><br/>Speakers, great! DTS really outdid themselves on these speakers. Sound is crisp, clear, and clean.<br/><br/>On the other hand, having too many tabs open can slow the laptop down a bit. Overall I give it a 9.0 out of 10!
The HP 11Stream. Piece of junk. The touchpad is non-responsive. The bloatware is a nightmare to remove. It is not user friendly and just a bad design overall. I wanted to love the thing, but it is the worst purchase I've ever made from Amazon and cannot return it fast enough.
I love my laptop & it came a day early.. the color is exact & it screams me! lol I have no troubles with it since ive worked with windows.. it was actually preferred loved it!
So far so good. Ive been using this computer for light college work and it has been a good computer so far. The only thing thats kinda weird, im not sure if its a special feature or a special defect (I have never used windows 8 before) but everytime I swipe to the right and I have multiple windows open, the screens constantly switch windows.????<br/>Other than that, the magenta color is really cute, the computer is thin and light weight, and gives you so much bang for your buck!!!<br/>I needed a computer with a CD drive but that didn't stop me from buying this, bought an external drive on the side for $30. Cant go wrong for the price!
The HP Stream notebook is an excellent, budget friendly, lightweight, Windows 8.1 Celeron notebook for those that need something more than a tablet but do not want or need to carry around a full sized notebook.<br/><br/>This machine comes with 2Gb of memory, an 11.6 inch 1366x768 screen and a 32GB flash drive which means there is no fan and the machine can run up to 8 hours on a single charge.<br/><br/>I like the HP Stream a lot. I mainly use a computer for web browsing, email and writing of different sorts, including amazon reviews, so this notebook fits my needs exactly.  It is lightweight and inexpensive enough that I can take it with me when I travel and I do not constantly worry that if I drop or lose the machine that I may have to pay hundreds of dollars to repair it.  if I were to drop my iPad Air or my more expensive MacBook, I could easily pay the cost of this machine to fix either of them.<br/><br/>I see this machine as an excellent choice for a student who needs to take a notebook to school and may not always be as careful as an adult might be taking a notebook to work each day.  The blue case is eye catching and the ombre blue inside keyboard area is also very pretty.<br/><br/>My two biggest complaints are the lack of sensitivity of the trackpad and the default setup that always wants to connect you to Microsoft's cloud at boot.  The track pad is too insensitive for me; I often have to press multiple times to get a response.  When I can, I plug in a USB mouse to use instead.  This is unfortunate.  I also do not like that, by default, the OS is setup to always want to log into Microsoft's cloud services.  I disabled this feature shortly after setting up the machine.  I have no interest in placing my personal data on Microsoft owned cloud machines.  This can be turned off by disabling the feature in your user profile through settings.  I also like the 1 year free subscription to Office 365.  It is a wonderful cost savings for anyone who wants to use those applications.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a great, inexpensive take it anywhere PC notebook.
Total garbage.  This is the second one I purchased in 5 days.  I received the new one just yesterday and the "N" key is stuck.  Garbage, garbage, garbage.  These huge companies are selling trash to consumers and getting away with it.  Don't buy!
I bought this laptop intending to use it as a cheap, portable computer for Office use and web browsing, plus a bit of light coding. For all of those things, this computer works perfectly.<br/><br/>DESIGN<br/>This was probably the thing that I was most concerned about before receiving the device. While it looks super bright in pictures, the actual color is somewhat subdued and actually looks quite nice. I'm not a huge fan of the blue to turquoise gradient in the keyboard area, but that's a minor qualm. It's small and decently light, good enough to take everywhere. The build quality is surprisingly solid considering the price; the only issue that I've had has been that the touchpad is a bit looser than I'm used to.<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE<br/>It doesn't scream, but the SSD does make things run a lot quicker than on my old laptop. The screen is fairly good when on-angle, but colors quickly wash out from other viewing angles. Probably the largest shock to me as someone who has had HDDs in the past is the fact that this machine makes literally no noise due to the lack of moving parts. It's amazing, and more laptops should be getting this type of design as heat dissipation continues to improve. The keyboard is perfectly servicable.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE<br/>This computer is equipped with Windows 8.1, meaning that you'll be able to get your work done offline more easily than on, say, a Chromebook. The interface is well adapted to this type of machine and the OS runs along with nary a stutter. HP does include its usual bloatware, but it doesn't take longer than 10-15 minutes to address. In addition, Office runs well on this computer with the included 365 subscription.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/>At $229, the HP Stream 13 is a steal. It isn't the best laptop out there by any means, but it gets the job done for a good price point. I'd recommend it.
Bought 2, one for each Daughter, as Christmas presents.  After they opened them, one of the HP Streams did not turn on.  Had to call customer service and they said I would have to return it to be fixed and they would ship back to me.  I was told on 2 separate occasions that it would be no cost to me (I made sure that the 'no cost to me' provision was repeated several times over the phone).  After receiving the return shipment box, there was no return address label enclosed so I called HP again to report it.  I was told that they would send me a shipping label ASAP.  After a week and a half, I received no label and called again.  This time I was told that I have to pay to ship it back to them.  Apparently, they were never going to inform me that a return shipping label was never mailed to me and now they expect me to pay more $ for a lemon of a product that I already paid full price for and have not even been able to use yet.  Very disappointing.<br/><br/>Update:  I definitely had to pay for shipping back to HP out of my pocket.  I received the repaired laptop back in a week and it has been running fine for my daughters ever since.  I contacted HP directly so did not see a reason to open another dialogue with an HP rep through this review board.<br/><br/>As for the one that actually worked.  It is the perfect size for my 9 year old.  Personally, the keyboard is too small for my 30+ yr old male hands.  The option for the standard desktop and new Windows 8.1 format is nice.  Startup time is quick and the light weight is convenient.  Performance wise, it is used for elementary school homework, simple games, chatting, and streaming videos, and it has handled all of those tasks with no problem.
Well, let me add my two cents! I love amazon reviews, but have to say I bought this off the MS store because it was cheaper, but mainly because they sell a "signature series" in which they take all the bloat ware off the machine...even all the stickers except for the intel inside. So I have not had ANY problems with all that garbage. They also install windows defender for viruses...fantastic! I bought this to do three things. Surf the web...works great, use Word and Powerpoint...works great and use Logos Bible Study program. I knew it only would have about 17GB on opening. I loaded MS 2010...took another GB, but I already had it and I'm not paying a yearly fee for Office, are you kidding me??? I then purchased through Amazon a 32GB USB  3.0 Flash drive, low profile, speeds up to 138 mbs and loaded my logos program (10 GB) onto that instead of the hard drive...works fantastic!!! Had a 16GB micro SD in my tablet I reformatted and just installed...so I have plenty of storage for my needs right on the machine, as well as One Drive and Dropbox<br/><br/>Trials and tribulations: Track pad is taking getting used to. I have had a windows 8 tablet for a year and so know my way around 8.1 very well...on a touch screen. This leaves you with only the pad...I have found myself clicking when I did not mean to and scrolling is a challenge. I have to think of the pad as a mini screen, then it makes sense after using 8.1 on a touch screen, most gestures are the same.<br/><br/>The screen is nice, not super bright or clear, but for what I am doing, basic computing...very nice.<br/><br/>Finally...I can't get the free App Store credit...the page keeps crashing...what is up with that???? Ill keep you posted if I get it to work, followed the instructions to redeem and the site appeared to be down<br/><br/>Happy computing, hope this helps...so far, day two this little machine is running great!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Well, unfortunately this Little guy is going back to the store. The 32 well actually 17gb hard drive was just not big enough. The 10 gb intensive program I thought I could run off a fast USB 3 stick just could not quite do it... close, but way to frustrating... too bad. Otherwise I really likes this computer... oh well, back to the drawing board.
Has too many preloaded APs and useless programs which makes it extremely slow. I had to go through and uninstall over a dozen adware programs. If I had it to do over I would not have bought it.
Awesome laptop when comparing price Vs performance. I am only disappointed with the track-pad, it should be better even at $199. After removing the bloat wear I was surprised that Windows 8.1 was only 5Gb thanks to WIMBoot.  I installed Windows 10 Technical Preview and seems to be working good on the Stream 11, 10 takes up about 10Gb. Before purchasing this computer you should do a research and set your expectations accordingly. I am manly using the Stream 11 as a second screen on the couch. I would recommend the Stream 11 for kids and students unless gaming is necessary.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>1) Price<br/>2) Size and weight<br/>3) No fan, No moving parts<br/>4) Keyboard is fantastic<br/>5) 64 Bit Windows<br/>6) Battery life<br/>7) USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and Full size HDMI<br/>8) Included Office 360 Personal for a year.<br/>9) Included $25 certificate to Microsoft Store.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>1) Track Pad should be better but I am getting better with it each day.<br/>2) SD card slot should be deeper as the card sticks out. I plan on buying a shorter adapter as I am using a micro SD card.<br/><br/>Highly commended but set expectations accordingly for $199.
I was impressed with the product at first since everything worked great. The speed was impressive even though I had 5 tabs open. The trackpad was great since it was smooth and I could instantly click things without using the bottom of the trackpad. The video quality was fair for the price. I was really enjoying my new laptop, but fast forward to two weeks, the screen totally blacked out. I tried to be patient with it by restarting and it worked for a few days, but continuously blacked out. Now, I can't use it anymore since the screen just stays black.
I honestly had this laptop about 2 hours before I was on the phone with HP support trying to find out why the wireless had intermittent connectivity.  I researched for close to an hour on my other laptop trying to find out what the problem was.  After reloading the drivers, ensuring the drivers were up to date, hard coding the DNS settings on the NIC, I finally called HP.  Their answer was to reload the drivers.  So I did that again while I was on the phone with them.  When that didn't work they asked if I wanted to send it in for repairs.  No I don't want to send a 2 hr old laptop in for repair, I want a solution to what the problem is.  Their answer was it's an undocumented problem that they've never seen.  Somehow I find that hard to believe with all of the other Windows 8.1 issues I found on the net.  Needless to say I boxed it up and requested a return through Amazon.  I cannot recommend this laptop unless you truly enjoy self inflicted pain.
This laptop was supposed to come with a gift card to the Microsoft app store. The pamphlet that comes with it says go to microsoft.com/hpstream, but the website doesn't work. Countless hours spent being passed around by Amazon, Microsoft, and HP trying to get what was advertised and none have a solution. They all just tell me to contact someone else. If there is no gift card, then don't say there is. Simple. You have taken what should have been a straightforward purchase and made it difficult and frustrating.
I absolutely love my laptop . so cute  I love how they keyboard has ombre. First time ordering refurbished laptop but it works and looks brand new! Nice size , and light weight.
I purchased this laptop from the Microsoft store a couple of weeks ago (their signature edition of this laptop has no crapware installed) and it's been a pleasure to use this laptop. Now I completely understand that everyone has different needs and certainly this laptop is not for everyone, simply because it can't do everything well (no $229 laptop can).<br/><br/>It's perfect for me as long as I am browsing the web, working on Microsoft Office and using other non graphic intensive applications. It really does not do well with games or applications like Adobe Photoshop and the like.<br/><br/>Here are some pros and Cons<br/>Pros<br/>1) Very well priced (can't really beat a full windows laptop at $229)<br/>2) remarkably fast for small amount of RAM<br/>3) Full year of MS Office and associated One Drive with lots of space in the cloud.<br/>4) Smooth scrolling surface and adequately sized keyboard (Not full sized though)<br/>5) Very good Battery life. 6-7 hours on average<br/>6) Surprisingly light at a little over 3 lbs.<br/>7) Attractive Gradient Blue shade.<br/>8) Micro SD slot for additional space<br/>9) Quiet. No fan<br/><br/>Cons.<br/>1) Only 32GB Flash Drive. (about 12GB left after installing OS and MS Office). Have to use Cloud or offload to Micro SD card eventually<br/>2) Screen colors are washed out a bit. (not 1080P didn't expect it either at this price point)<br/>3) Only 2GB RAM, although haven't seen a major slowdown yet.<br/>4) Not good for graphic intensive work or gaming<br/><br/>All in all this is a great value for money. I have a Surface Pro 3 also and believe it not I prefer this for most of the tasks I perform mostly because it has a larger screen and keyboard than the surface pro 3.<br/><br/>Very happy with it.
I normally use a Mac but purchased this out of necessity for an on-line computer course I am taking (it requires Office 2013, which does not run on a Mac).  I am extremely disappointed with this product and feel it was a total waste of money.  It would have been more worthwhile to pay more for a better product.  The mouse pad is horrible, not very responsive or sensitive to touch.  It also seems to malfunction quite a bit; while moving the cursor across the screen inside a program or app, suddenly 3 or 4 other apps will just open out of nowhere.  I find it so much more difficult to use than my Macbook.
I have to admit that I am a tough critic.  I almost never rate any product five stars.  However, for the price, this computer is great.<br/>Be advised however, that you are going to have to do ALOT of tweaking to make it run smoothly.  But, a novice can do the tweaking.  I spent in total about 4 hrs tweaking it.  There wasn't much crapware installed.  I learned how to tweak it on youtube.  The below is no means an exhaustive list, but some of the major things that I did to have optimal performance.  Again, if I was an Comp. Expert, there would have been a lot more.<br/><br/>I tweaked the ram, changed appearance and themes for optimal performance, under Registry Editor, I tweaked how fast windows open, kept background black, turned off notification sounds, under the VIEW TAB (UNCHECK-display file size info, hide empty drives on comp, show encrypted or compressed files in color, show pop ups,) I also disabled windows indexing, ran power at high performance, deleted uncesessary tasks, stop IE Explorer, and stopped all unecessary services.  IT MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU, BUT IT WORKED FOR ME.<br/>I also  downloaded the following:<br/>1) malwarebytes<br/>2) ad block and ad block plus for google chrome<br/>3) Revo unistaller to delete crapware<br/>4) CC Cleaner<br/>5) AVG 2015 Antivirus<br/><br/>You do all that, and you should be good to go as long as you are not using the computer for any comp graphic design or gaming.
Was excited when I opened it. Very cute. But as soon as I turned it on I realized the keypad did not work at all. I could not type anything on the set up questions. Keypad completely not functioning. Very disappointed. I'm not sure if it's the seller or the product but I'm not going to give it another chance. Waiting for shipping label to return for a refund. What a bust .<br/>I was forced to pay for the return shipping in order to get a refund. So basically I paid them money for no product. Not every happy. It was broken, don't think I should have to pay for a refund.
Review of HP Stream,<br/>I purchased the HP Stream 13 so my son who is a middle schooler could have an inexpensive and light weight laptop to take back and forth to school with him everyday.<br/><br/>My son and I both like the laptop; it has a very sleek, and attractive design. I purchased a 64 GB MicroSD to give him more storage, and I deleted whatever applications I felt were unnecessary to increase speed and startup time. A November 12, 2014 comment on Amazon.com helped me sift through and delete applications that could be considered bloatware.<br/><br/>The laptop is mainly used by my son for watching assigned homework videos, for typing reports, and doing light research. My son has not had to take it to school yet, but it’s light weight makes it very easy to transport.<br/><br/>The keyboard is easy to type on, however the mouse pad can be unresponsive at times. We’ve solved that by getting him an external mouse. Overall I think this computer fills a gap for first laptop users (young kids) and for other users looking for a Window’s computer at a Chromebook price. Plus the one year subscription to Office Online, and a $25 Microsoft App Store gift card made this purchase worth it.
There is so much crap popping up we can't even get on the internet to do anything.  Will have to take it to a computer repair just to be able to use it. Should've went to Best Buy.
Before I purchased the HP Stream 11, I checked a bunch of reviews from different places. Some said it was good, some said it was under powered. Well, I decided to purchase one anyway because I was going to give it to my mother and she only needed a computer for playing card games. When it first arrived, it was very slow. Internet explorer could not handle the multiple windows I opened up and my streaming was choppy. There was so much bloatware that the computer felt very sluggish. The 2gb of RAM felt more like 512 and the atom, excuse me, the celeron processor seemed slow. (The celeron basically is the old atom processor.) So the first thing I did was to uninstall every piece of "extra software" that came with the computer. I took out McAfee (Windows defender is good enough for me), all the HP software, and the extra programs that were not necessary for windows to run. (Including bonjor which I consider bloatware) I even took out the office software as I had a copy of office 2011 th... Read more
I bought this $200 wonder primarily to stream video from websites to my TV using HDMI cable.  For the most part, I am thrilled by Little Blue.  The fact that it has solid state memory instead of a hard disk is tremendous - will use less electricity, and hard disks are always the first component to burn out. I feel good about running it for many hours per day.<br/><br/>The problem I ran into was choppy video.  I was on verge of returning it.  Side by side comparison using more powerful laptop showed that Little Blue just didn't have enough video processing capability.  I looked in task manager, and sure enough the CPU was pinged at 100%.<br/><br/>I switched from Chrome to Internet Explorer for browser, and wallah!  It streams video beautifully.  Apparently the Internet Explorer is better integrated with Windows 8.1 operating system, or it is somehow much more efficient.  CPU runs at comfortable 40% when streaming high def.  I am very happy to not have to deal with returning my otherwise satisifying purchase.
Purchased and received the Stream 13 a few days ago from Amazon for my wife.  She's the target customer - email, web surfing, Word document creation and very light gaming (Solitaire, etc.). Given the low price and experience with working with other "low end" laptops, I had very low expectations.<br/><br/>All that said, The S 13 has exceeded my expectations in almost every way.  The build quality is top notch - in fact, it reminds me of the original MacBooks (before they went to the aluminum uni-body design). The keyboard is surprisingly good - no flex in the chassis and even though this isn't a core I-7 processor, the CPU speed is more than acceptable for light-to-medium duty tasks.<br/><br/>It has 3 USB ports (including a USB 3.0 port) and a microSD slot.  I haven't tested it yet but I believe it will actually support the new 128gb microSD cards. It handled my 64 microSD card just fine. It's also fanless which is a plus.<br/><br/>Throw in the fact that it comes with a 1 year subscription to Office O365 Personal - which now includes limitless OneDrive storage and a $25 Microsoft Store gift card, you're essentially paying about $135 for this device.<br/><br/>The drawbacks?<br/>1. Only 32 gb of onboard storage.  After installing Windows 8.1, Office 365, Netflix and a number of other smaller apps, it's down to about 4gb of free onboard storage.  Granted, you can offload your photos, docs, music and videos to the microSD card or OneDrive, you still have to install the actual apps to your C:\ drive.<br/><br/>2. No support for touch.  I have a number of other laptops that have touchscreens. Although it doesn't sound intuitive or comfortable, once you've used a touch screen laptop, you'll see there are scenarios where it's actually very useful.  However, given the $229 price point I wouldn't expect touchscreen support<br/><br/>Long story short, highly recommended and I'll be purchasing another one for myself - primarily as a consumption device.
I just received my Hp stream 13 and it won't connect to the Wi-Fi. I've tried everything. Cute laptop but I'm very disappointed
So I have had many pcs. I currently have one with high end specs. One from 6 years ago running vista and a netbook like dual core 1.7ghz machine with 8gbs ram. That HP dm1 is what I will compare it to.<br/><br/>1. The stream is much lighter.<br/>Yes the stream looks and feels like a toy but it does work like a real pc not a kids toy.<br/><br/>2. Quiet. There is no fan. Where the dm1s fan is running all the time and it runs hot. This gets warm but with no fan is silent. Big plus in my book.<br/><br/>3. Solid construction. Where the dm1 feels like a lot of it is cheap plastic, though this does too, it feels more solid. The dm1, though has survived many falls and drops and still works fine, it also has a ssd like this. I haven't dropped this yet, hope not to, but feel it would survive.<br/><br/>4. SSD. Works well, but very small. Plan on using externals for storage or more as it is intended as a cloud complimenting device.<br/><br/>5. RAM very limited but functional. You will be constantly maxing out but with ssd when a page file is used it won't be a s slow as it could be. I have a work pc with that normally uses only 1gb to 1.5gb ram so it is possible to do well with the minimal ram. So far mcafee has impressed me more than Norton. The dm1 with Norton maxes out up to 4gbs ram when running because it uses whatever it can. Internet explorer is just as bad. if you have many poorly designed web pages open you could max out the ram quickly but the processor helps to make it not as bad as it could be.<br/><br/>6. Processor Intel. Celeron. Yes it is a Celeron, but there are worse. Celeron processors used to be considered the cheap junk intel processors, but now in comparing the e2-1800 amd of the dm1 and this, the Celeron wins. Your processor utilization will max out....a lot. The dm1 is horrible in that respect, also only 1.7 where this goes up to around 2.5. When ie and Norton run I can do very little, even type on the dm1. Typing is torturous. You press letters that never appear on the dm1. It took me a while to figure out what was happening. it was just that the processor was running at 100% too much of the time. This does run at 100% too and has had letters not show because of that too, but definitely not as bad as the dm1. For this I think the Celeron processor and faster speed helps, obviously. Again remember this is a low end computer. it will have tradeoffs, but so far it has been a much more acceptable experience.<br/><br/>7. Graphics. I did not test any newer kind of games. I tested star wars battlefront 2 like on my dm1 it runs with most high settings just fine. This will not be a gaming machine but you could have some games on for yourself or kids. it did work fine with an xbox 360 controller. It also played 1080p youtube videos fullscreen just fine. Netflix also played high quality just fine.<br/><br/>8. Space and settings. There may be bloatware but with so little disk space they could not add a lot. There were only 2 things running in the systray when I got it and now only mcafee.  You will have to change some settings. I had to change the power settings to max performance. They are not set to that by default so if you want the most out of your pc change them. If you want better battery life leave them as balanced or power saver. The touch pad works ok. There are better but again for the price there are worse. It can be tapped and doubled tapped to simulate mouse clicks so complaints about buttons only being at the button are not necessary. The dm1 also can accept taps and does have two physical buttons at the bottom,. Again it is functional, but you will have to disable the reverse scrolling or it may drive you nuts when you swipe down and it goes up on a web page.<br/><br/>All in all I got this as a disposable kind of laptop to train my kids on. It is not as safe as a chromebook for viruses and malware yes, but it is a full computer not just a browser. The security software is a trial for 30 days but doesn't seem to affect it as much as Norton does my dm1 so I will probably renew it and may switch to mcafee after on my other pcs.<br/><br/>Final words:<br/><br/>I might buy more one for each of my children and myself to replace the dm1, which has become an unenjoyable experience. My favorites---it is quiet (no fan), does not get hot, it is light, and the keyboard types well. I haven't really tested the battery but again it depends on what you use and your power settings. It is not user replaceable though.<br/><br/>Negatives I have noted so far. It drops my wireless network every so often, but my high end computer from hp also has a network card that has failed in less than a year, not worth the warranty and effort having already sent back once for something else (their laptops are better)  that I have had to replace with a $35 netgear usb wireless. I hope this fares better but you can replace it with a usb if it happens. The screen is a little washed out. It just feels like the colors are faded Other than that I now have a good cheap laptop for my kids.<br/><br/>I will recommend buying from Amazon. Hp's website is horrible and they decline orders for no reason and their customer service is horrible! But all that aside I like their devices. Tradeoffs I guess.<br/><br/>I haven't tried the free offers included but office personal is included free for a year which is normally 70 dollars. This adds more value to your purchase. You can set windows to boot directly to the desktop for those of you who fear windows 8. I actually think Win 8.1 is a great operating system with much better task manager features.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a spare pc, has kids, or wants a basic laptop. $200. Worth it.
Okay so I was kinda sceptical about a laptop for only $200 but it is fantastic! It doesn't have a lot of actual space on the laptop but everything can go on one drive and hp drive that they give you with 1 terabyte of storage so that's not even a problem. I am an engineering student and needed it for matlab (a big software program for writing code and such ) and it runs wonderfully on there which was a fantastic addition! Some of the reviews said something about a partial touch screen but I don't think that is on there and I felt real stupid taping my laptop trying to find it! Baisically the only computer most college students will need! Plus it's stylish! I had a surface before this that was a pain and this definitely kicks the surface's butt!
The HP Stream 11 is pretty terrific. It's much more capable than Netbooks ever were and gives Chromebooks a serious competitor.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Chromebooks ever since the original Google Cr-48. I also have the HP Chromebook 11 and use it now and then when I don't feel like carrying around a full laptop. Even though I'm in deep with Google's ecosystem, there are times when I'm annoyed with Chromebooks and miss having Windows or OS X. With the HP Stream 11, that's no longer the case because it has a full version of Windows 8.1 (Bing version). And it should be plenty capable of running Windows 10 when it's released.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Under $200!<br/>- Full version of Windows 8.1<br/>- Good battery life<br/>- Nice keyboard<br/>- Less than 3 pounds<br/>- Comes with some nice extras<br/>- Stays pretty cool<br/>- Fanless and whisper quiet<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Subpar screen quality<br/>- Single band Wi-Fi adapter<br/>- CPU is constantly pegged and memory usage high<br/>- Power adapter could be more compact<br/><br/>PERFORMANCE<br/>The Intel Celeron N2840 is no speed demon by any stretch of the imagination. And I'm actually surprised that Windows 8.1 can run at all with 2GB of RAM. But wouldn't you know it, the system is actually pretty peppy if you don't have more than one or two programs open at a time. Of course, if you're running Chrome with several tabs, you'll see things slow down, but it's totally usable otherwise. I can run a browser and Word at the same time and get some work done. Just don't expect miracles; I didn't even bother trying to install anything like Lightroom or Photoshop. Besides, you won't have room on the Stream 11's tiny 32GB eMMC drive.<br/><br/>The screen is 11.6-inches with a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It has a matte, "anti-glare" coating and is easier to see in sunlight than the glossy screen of the HP Chromebook 11. However, the Stream 11's panel is awful compared to the Chromebook 11's IPS display. The Stream 11's display looks washed out at most angles. When you find the sweet spot, though, it's decent.<br/><br/>The Stream 11's Wi-Fi card by Realtek (RTL8723BE) is solid and I never experienced any connection drops. I'm slightly disappointed that a device that relies so much on networked services, doesn't support dual bands.<br/><br/>CONNECTIVITY & BATTERY<br/>The Stream 11 comes with two USB ports (one USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0), a headphone jack, SD card reader, and a full-sized HDMI port. For the size, the number of ports is generous. It also has stereo speakers that sound about what you'd expect from a tiny sub-$200 laptop; it gets loud, but there's like, no bass. Plug in some headphones for best results or make use of its Bluetooth connectivity and pair some BT speakers to it.<br/><br/>The battery is rated at 8 hours and 15 minutes. It's hard to measure exact times, but battery life is noticeably better than the Chromebook 11, which is rated at 6 hours. The AC adapter is kind of big, unfortunately. I much prefer the Chromebook 11's charger, which charges over micro-USB.<br/><br/>KEYBOARD & TRACKPAD<br/>The Stream 11's keyboard is 97% full-sized. The Chromebook 11's keyboard *is* full-sized, yet I found the Stream 11's keyboard much easier to type on. Maybe it's the slight layout difference in Chromebooks, but I type nearly at full speed on the Stream 11, while I'm constantly making mistakes on the Chromebook. I wrote 90% of this review on the Stream 11.<br/><br/>The trackpad is a decent size and glides smoothly. Button presses feel nice and have a suppressed sound to it, rather than clicky like the Chromebook 11. The best feature of the trackpad is that it doesn't pick up accidental motion when I type. On the Chromebook, I had to turn off tapping, because the trackpad was so poor at detecting my palm over my fingers.<br/><br/>SOFTWARE & MISCELLANEOUS<br/>The HP Stream 11 didn't come with too much crapware in my opinion. I did uninstall McAfee LiveSafe and Bonjour, but I kept 7-Zip 9.20 and Office 365. I also got rid of a few desktop shortcuts, like Dropbox, TripAdvisor, Snapfish,etc. and HP's "connected" services, like Drive, Music, and Photo.<br/><br/>The included extras are nice, including the $25 Windows Store gift card and the free year of Office 365 Personal.<br/><br/>The lid on the Stream 11 is hard to open, even with two hands.<br/><br/>I was able to stream Pandora and Amazon Prime movies without any buffering problems.<br/><br/>Since it's Windows, I can create a local user account on the Stream 11 and use a shorter password to log in. Logging in to my Chromebook is a pain, because I use a very secure password for my Google account. Since Chromebooks require the same Google password to log in, I'm forced to type in that password every single time.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: If you set your expectations right, the HP Stream 11 is an excellent Windows 8.1 laptop at a steal of a price. If you've always liked the idea of a Chromebook, but didn't want to bother with another OS, check out the Stream 11. The Stream 11's biggest weak point is its display, but at less than $200 and so much else going for it, I can overlook it.
it is an amazing Deal !! I bought it because I wanted a lighter yet effective laptop , HP is a great brand . i am taking  online classes , I get my stuff done efficiently ! super great laptop , I enjoy it to the fullest . I'm very pleased with its functions. Highly recommend for me every time.
I've had my Blue Stream13 for a year now, and think it's great. I'm a power user, with high-spec Lenovo and Dell ultra-light laptops at home and office. I was in a situation last year where I needed a laptop quickly, so I walked into a store and bought this. I haven't regretted it. I use it mostly as a netbook (that is, I open files from my online SugarSync drive), web-browsing, and for Exchange-based e-mail -- I like that I can use whatever Windows programs I want, unlike being tied to Google apps if I use a Chromebook. I did buy a 64GB microSD and keep a copy of my data files there; they're not always up to date, as SugarSync won't look at an external drive, but this way I do have access to old files easily if I need them. Because it's relatively cheap (I know $225 isn't nothing, but I'm in a situation where that's money I can afford to lose), I didn't worry when I took it traveling internationally to a variety of high-potential-theft places -- even if it was damaged, lost, or stolen, I hadn't lost my main machine or a huge investment. For about 6 weeks last summer, it was my only machine, and I didn't regret it. I don't use high-processing-speed programs (I don't watch a lot of video, I don't edit video, I'm not running AutoCAD, etc.) -- just plain office software most of the time. I'm quite happy.
UGH. I read rave reviews before purchasing this. II have had it less than a month. Issues with construction. Not easy to type on. Meaning I often have to go back and hit the letter I need hard and right in the center for it to work. The touchpad is not the best to navigate. It closes down unexpectedly and is very slow loading videos, websites etc. I feel like it is loaded with viruses, without viruses. Also, I have only used this for internet use. I receive pop ups constantly that I am running out of storage space. From what!? I have not used all other functions it offers, but as a new owner of this...not impressed.
I find the system awesome but just wont come up from the power button. I don't understand what is going on. If i can get a lead on what to be done. Thanks as i awaits your favorable response.
Full of bugs! The product is listed as new but it's definitely refurbished.
I'm obviously spoiled by great machines and this one just doesn't match up even to a Chromebook. It runs slow and appears to be vulnerable to viruses regardless of anti-virus programs which take up a large amount of usable RAM. I was planning on purchasing 24 this summer. I'm glad I had a chance to review this machine before having made a huge mistake. One of our technicians classified it as operating an "old machine".<br/><br/>The installation was not intuitive. Program upload time is awful. Battery seems to work better than the whole machine.<br/><br/>I don't know what was the last time I wrote such a negative review.
I've been without a computer for a painfully long time. I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy myself a laptop. As a part time waitress I don't have a lot of money to spend, and I didn't think I would be able to find anything that great. But this laptop? It's spectacular!<br/><br/>This computer is fast, light, and stylish. Perfect for a student. I really can't get over how wonderful it is. I will update this review if I have any problems, but so far it's been flawless.<br/><br/>Don't be nervous because of the price. This thing is phenomenal!!! ❤️ (And so so pretty!)
First, please understand, I am no computer geek though I use them daily for work.  Like my car, I want to turn it on and have everything work with no hassle.  Pros:  Cost, feel and weight are great.  I need portability for a variety of reasons.  Cons:  Limited storage memory (so wish there was something exactly this style with more memory).  Second, though I most certainly use the internet (teaching and starting Monday as a student again myself online) I was a bit dubious about so much tied to the internet.  Beware, the advertised one year of Office 365 turned out to be one month.  I contacted Microsoft with no headway made.  I contacted Amazon last night and the person I talked to said he would follow up and I trust he will but as of yet I have not heard back (he was going to contact Microsoft).  I start both teaching online and a 10 week online course in two days and as of writing this review it is unresolved.  I am an Amazon Prime Member, love Amazon but not happy about this at all.  It really needs to be on Amazon to make sure what they advertise is clearly represented.  Neutral:  Windows 8.1
I don't care for the color,but I have to say I really like the ultralight, slim body. Two months in, my biggest problem has been with the memory and processor. I am not a gamer and I don't download video or anything like that. My primary use is general web browsing and MS office applications. I often have several (6-10) windows open. Google Chrome regularly crashes and it simply this laptop simply has trouble functioning with 1 or 2 programs open.
It cuts off all the time while browsing i<br/>Or just playing games.
I recently purchased this laptop 3 months ago for $200. I purchased it for the purpose of using it for college and I needed one to do work and study. I will be going over some pros and cons with this laptop and will also give it a evaluation.<br/>Pros:<br/>-This laptop is cheap and affordable. For $200 there aren’t going to be much that are better than this<br/>-It also came with a $25 Microsoft gift card and 1 free year of Microsoft Office. Now those two items alone can be worth up to $100, probably more. Spending $200 on a cheap laptop and getting at least $100 back? I’ll take that deal again any day.<br/>-It’s reliable; while this is a cheap and reliable laptop, it has also gotten pretty slow over the months. At first it was pretty fast and I was amazed. Then as time went on it started to show why it was only $200. Although it’s gotten pretty slow, it still gets the job done and hopefully (fingers crossed) it doesn’t get slower as it’s still usable and reliable now.<br/>-The life on the battery is pretty good. I’ve used my laptop for 7 hours straight before doing work and listening to music, and I still had battery left over when I finished.<br/>- This laptop also shipped to me in Windows 10, which is amazing. Unfortunately it does take up most of your space as this laptop doesn’t have that move space.<br/>Cons:<br/>-The keyboard takes some getting used too, and after 3 months I’m still getting used to it. It’s pretty small and if you have big hands, you should probably buy a separate keyboard that suits you.<br/>-Clicking things can also be frustrating. Whenever trying to click on things, sometimes the computer doesn’t register it and I have to click it 2 or 3 times. It’s as if the key needs to be clicked on harder than most keys.<br/>-No storage space. Even though it says it’s 32GB it’s not. Also after Windows 10 there’s little to no room for storage. So if you’re thinking of downloading a big program or anything I would advise against it; this is also probably why it’s been running slow lately as it keeps saying I’m about to run out of storage room.<br/>For $200 this is a pretty decent laptop. Would I spend an extra $200 dollars for a better more efficient laptop? Probably yeah. Does this get the job done? Yes, I’ve written multiple essays, and still do, and I’ve also studied a lot with it. If you just need a cheap laptop to get work done then buy this laptop. If you’re looking for anything else I’d advise you to buy another laptop.<br/>Rating: 7.5/10
Okay, so I`ve had this computer about a week so take that into account on my review.  I have read every single review and was prompted to give my review because I take issue with many of the things I have read.  First, I have the blue one, not the purple one that so many seem to want to avoid the "crapware".  Microsoft is selling the purple one in their store and, at first, I was tempted to take mine back to Walmart and buy that one because of so much fuss about the crapware.  However, as I played with mine I realized I was not having any issues with it.  I did eliminate the programs I did not need like bonjour and a few others to free up some space.  I upgraded to Windows 10, put in all the updates and added flash player, java and firefox.  I currently have 8.3 GB of free space and added a 32 GB SD card.<br/><br/>I want everyone to know you do not have to be tech-savvy to have a good running machine so do not be put off by what you may have read in regards to eliminating everything.  I have all my HP software still on my PC and it works great.  Furthermore, I find the HP utility center to be very helpful.  Maybe it does effect the speed but I certainly have not found that to be a problem.  The only issue I have is with the touch pad which many times requires another touch or two to select an item.  I can live with that.  I tried Youtube and had no problems viewing the various clips as well as playing a movie from my USB drive.  Bottom line, I absolutely love this little computer.  It does exactly what I want, is easy to carry and the battery lasts a very long time.  Buy it, you won`t be disappointed unless, of course, you get a lemon in which case you simply return it and get another one.<br/><br/>Final thoughts:  I`m thinking of uninstalling firefox, not because there is a problem but because Microsoft Edge works very well.  I see no need for two browsers.  Also, we are coming up on Black Friday so you might want to wait and see if these little gems are discounted further.  I got mine at Walmart for $179 ($193.50 with tax).  Microsoft still wants $199 as of this writing.  Hope this review has helped someone.  Enjoy the Stream and happy computing!
Got this laptop on prime day, I was unsure if I wanted this PC or a chromebook.  With the $20 off $100 promo they were running I went for it. My cousin is a developer and any questions I have about computers I go to him. Since he was building his own computers at 14, and I am no Einstein when it comes to these things, I know the basics and a little beyond that. So I asked him what I should get  for school, and he said all anyone needs is a chromebook and use cloud storage. Which is true, I use drive, dropbox, etc when I have to work between my colleges computers and my old dinosaur desktop at home.<br/><br/>When I saw this little thing though I was sold on it, yea it might not be as fast as a chromebook but you get a free year of MS office, and now that they changed it to a subscription type service that means everything to a college student!  Plus, I can print easily, instead of having to make it a process.<br/><br/>If you complain about the 2GB of RAM  that's not expandable, on a $200 laptop there's something wrong with you...  I  have NO problems with 2GB RAM because I don't have a million things running and a 15 tab browser open.<br/><br/>I will always hate windows 8.1 but hey I cant afford a macbook so we make it work.<br/><br/>So if you're frugal like me, and just need a basic computer for web browsing and writing papers GET THIS. Yea the memory is  32 GB oh well, use  cloud, get a microSD or external hard drive and then go be happy you bought this thing and weren't a sucker for buying a $800 laptop just because its "better".<br/><br/>P.S. Get a Bluetooth mouse, since the touch pad is the only aspect I dislike. Also get the 13.3 over the 11.6 you can expand the memory easily, you cant add a bigger screen.<br/><br/>So I<br/>- Got the 13.3<br/>Bloatware & adware removed<br/>-Cisco LEAP and EAPFAST<br/>-McAfee AV Just using windows defender<br/>-Apple Bonjour<br/>- HP Tools registration &HP; Tools support<br/>- Removed the apps I did not plan on using, Netflix, Skype etc.<br/><br/>I use my cloud/ MicroSC and will use my external hard drive if needed<br/> I  got a bluetooth mouse<br/>I installed FireFox as it is my preferred browser
I am currently using this laptop to write this review and I'm very pleased with it so far. When I first opened it I was a bit disappointed just because it reminded me of one of those fake laptops I had as a kid that could only be used to play games and stuff. The screen is just..ugh.. It's probably the worst screen I've ever seen on a laptop (I had a sony vaio and an acer aspire previously) and the storage is definitely not great but installing an sd card will resolve that problem, I downloaded utorrent and itunes and I now have 10.9 GB available of 21.3 GB... The keyboard is awesome though, i love typing on it and the dark to light pink gradient is lovely against the white keys :) The keypad..the keypad is ughhhh lol I hate it thankfully I took the advice of another HP stream owner and bought a logitech wireless mouse immediately. As a college student, I just needed to get a laptop that I could use to get my assignments done surf the web watch movies on netflix etc. However if you don't want any unnecessary apps like mysms or tripadvisor getting it straight from HP is also an option. The giftcard that comes with it seems to be a hassle.. I had problems redeeming it so I read up on it and it seems like I won't be able to redeem it until mid November? and then I have 90 days to use the $25 but I don't know for sure. The sound on this laptop is really good as well and the laptop itself is so light! The battery life is also pretty good. Overall, this laptop is amazing for the price but if you're used to expensive looking laptops with top of the line specs and 13-15" screens this laptop may not be for you as the screen size is taking awhile for me to get used too. If you are a college student like me or a high school student looking for a decent budget laptop this is perfect for you.
This is the worst computer I've ever owned and I regret having purchased it.<br/>Here are some reasons why this computer drives me nuts:<br/><br/>1. Since I've had it, I've had to restore it to factory settings twice! And, I've only owned it since the end of February!<br/>2. The memory is highly insufficient. After you've downloaded one or two programs, some images and some documents, it starts to tell you that there are too many things and that the memory is running low.<br/>3. The internet connection just can't get right. It goes from spurts of taking too long to connect, to connecting on a page one moment and not the next, to disconnecting altogether while you're in the middle of working.<br/>4. Within two months of having purchased it, the Wi-Fi card that it comes with inside, broke. I was forced to buy a Wi-Fi USB adapter. Here is the kicker... I've had it in a protection case since the day I purchased it and it hasn't fallen once!<br/>5. It's just all out TOO slow! And when I mean too slow, I mean like '1999 Dinosaur Desk Top with AOL Dail-up' slow.<br/>6. Lastly, but definitely not least, after about a month and a half of having owned it, the keys on the keyboard started sticking and a few not working at all. You'd think that I'd dropped it or something causing them to go lose, but no. They just started sticking and/or not working for no good reason whatsoever. Maybe I type too much, I don't know.<br/><br/>The ONLY reason why I am giving this item 2 stars is because I eventually had to pass the laptop down to my son, and he seems to play on Disney Jr and the like with no problems. Basically, he's content with this piece of junk.<br/><br/>Sometimes, I tend to think that I might've gotten a faulty devise, but after looking at some of the reviews on here I've noticed that it isn't just me. This computer is blatant junk.<br/><br/>All that being said, I am giving you fair warning; if you're an individual that's looking for something to work on, or a college student, DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S! However, if you intended on getting this for your child as a computer to dilly-dally on, then maybe it'll work for you.
At first I was a lot skeptical of this "laptop" as it boasts that it is a "Chromebook killer" in many reviews.  Having read many reviews on many different Chromebooks, weighed the functionality between this book and the Chromebook, I ultimately chose the HP Stream 11".<br/><br/>As a student, I am oftentimes not online when I am doing my schoolwork during downtime at work, I needed a machine that was lightweight, able to perform the same functions as my laptop but smaller and easier to carry.  I have had this machine for 2 days, and I have fallen in love.<br/>Here are some things I have noticed in the short time:<br/>-While small, the keyboard is almost the same size as my 15in laptop and the keys are easy to adjust to.<br/>-The screen is bright and I don't have to have the brightness turned all the way up in order to view comfortably.  I have seen mixed reviews on this issue, but I dont see the problem<br/>-Not laggy.  I haven't noticed any lag, at all.  While setting the machine up I was downloading and installing windows updates, installing a mouse driver, installing Norton Security and office 365 (which was included free) and the machine never skipped a beat.  I was able to do everything in a couple of hours, even setting up the OneDrive storage to make my laptop files available to this machine.  I was impressed that even running Chrome (which can be a memory hog) I have several tabs open at a time and no changes.<br/>-At this moment, I have 2 word documents open, 3 chrome tabs open and an additional tab open with youtube and I pulled up a movie purchased through Google, not a hiccup.  Played flawlessly at full screen with no problems.<br/>-I haven't tested the SD card capability, however I currently have a 32gig USB flash drive in and it is working fine (I had read some reviews that the machine would only read 16gigs of removable media)<br/>-Fanless.  I can sit this thing anywhere with no fear of overheating or burning my legs.  It has been running for 5 solid hours with very little warmth from the bottom.  Also, quieter.<br/>-Speakers sound good.  I was able to hear my school lecture clearly over the road noise while driving (no I wasn't operating my laptop while driving, I turned it on, set it in the passenger seat and went)  Even through the youtube channel, I was able to hear my movie clearly and the sound isn't up much at all.<br/>-I was able to install printer drivers.  Yes I know, it is 2015, cloud servers, Bluetooth printers, etc... I still have an old school printer, and I have to plug it in and I experienced no problems.<br/><br/>Things I am not so hot about:<br/>-The box I received from amazon had obviously been opened and someone had this machine prior to me.  They fixed it, but it still grated my nerves a bit.  I expected better.<br/>-The mouse.  Call me old fashioned, call me whatever but this mouse is set to the lightest sensitivity and sometimes doesn't register my taps... only happened a couple of times, might be a PEBKAC error... more on this later.<br/>-Hard Drive. I understand, it's supposed to be a lightweight, functional, blah blah blah windows version of a Chromebook.  But windows holds most of the hard drive and after installing office, updates, norton and other drivers, I am left with only 6g.  I can save to my USB, but still, maybe up the HD to 64g or 2 smaller HDs equalling a larger amount.  I just feel so limited in that aspect.<br/>-I keep hitting CAPS lock.  ugh.<br/>-Google offers 2 years of storage ranging from 100gb to 200gb; MS went with 1TB of storage but for only a year.  Not so pleased with that, will be purchasing a MyCloud in the future anyways, but I would rather a longer use of storage.<br/>-I have yet to receive 7 or 8 or however many hours of battery life they say this offers.  The most I have seen from the battery meter is 5 hours when I am using it, tested that tonight, went ahead and plugged in after 5, and I am using the recommended settings from HP.<br/>-FN (function) keys are backward.  When I would normally hit fn then the sound, or display, and not have to hit anything just to f5 or alt-f4, I have to hit the fn key to use any f-key... just taking some getting used to.<br/>-Chrome is a memory hog, it's getting annoying actually, I have the same issue on my laptop<br/><br/>Things that make me LOL at other reviewers:<br/>-If you are using an online storage system and don't want to use the memory on your machine, you have to make sure that are aren't keeping the files available offline.  If you keep them offline, then you are essentially saving 2 copies and using both your online storage and hard drive.<br/>-I read several reviews where people blamed the machine for viruses.... seriously?<br/><br/>The main reason I chose this over a chromebook...<br/>-Functionality.  As a student, I need MS Office, access to my printer and a machine that will work when offline.  Chromebook didn't seem to offer that.<br/><br/>All in all, i am pretty pleased with my purchase. Will be back to update if necessary =)
Fantastic value for the money!!!  My friend wanted a laptop for her daughter.  Her daughter had a Chromebook at school but it was only for school use and couldn't be taken home.  So she gave me a budget to get her a machine but I didn't like the idea of a laptop that required an Internet connection to be useful.  This machine fits her perfectly.<br/><br/>This is a full Windows 8.1 PC.  It's has a beautiful body with a fantastic blue paint scheme.  The keyboard is great and roomy.  The screen is the only negative because it's not bright and has narrow viewing angles but it's perfectly acceptable.  It's surprisingly fast for a machine at this price.  It doesn't have an SSD but the eMMC is definitely faster than a traditional hard disk drive.  She was shocked how fast Windows 8 loaded compared to their old desktop PC.<br/><br/>It comes with a year of Office 365 but you always have access to the free Internet-required Office.com which is the online version of Microsoft Office.  I also installed Chrome so she has access to all the Chrome apps and Google services just like she had a Chromebook.  So she has the best of both worlds.  In fact, Windows Chrome has more features than the Chromebook version of ChromeOS so there's things that she can do that's not possible with a Chromebook.<br/><br/>The great thing is when she's online, she has full use of her Google/Chrome services and full use of other services like Office.com and things like Skype, Youtube, Viber, etc.  But when she's far away from an Internet connection, she can still use the machine.<br/><br/>Now, it only come with 32 GB of onboard storage.  So you have to be very aggressive with clearing out files after setup.  For example, because of the recovery partition (to recover the operating system in case of emergencies), there is only 21 GB to start with.  But Windows occupies some of that so there's closer to 15 GB free.  Then you go through and set up and install all the Windows updates so it can drop all the way down to 9 GB free (to be fair, this is 9GB after installing a bunch of apps).  However, this is because the updating process leaves a lot of leftover files.  You then have to go to Disk Cleanup and clean out all unnecessary files and system files as well.  Do this AFTER you finish updating the system.  This will recover a lot of GB so I had 13 GB free after cleaning up the drive.  Note that Windows 10 (which will be a free upgrade for all Windows 8.1 PC systems) was designed to take up less space than Windows 8.1 so I'm going to be upgrading this computer as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I also installed a 64 GB MicroSD card so that she can put her OneDrive storage there as well as her downloaded files.  I told her to install all her programs and download to the MicroSD card due to lack of onboard space.  So she installed iTunes and other stuff to the memory card.  When she's ready, I'll upgrade her to a 128 GB card.<br/><br/>Note:  I purchased this machine at another store which I won't mention so I don't get into trouble.  But it came clean (no HP bloatware), came with a $25 gift card, and also had a 10% student discount.  So combined with the Office 365 package, it was an amazing deal.  I never thought a laptop for this price could be good.
I've been using this laptop for a solid week now, and it's served me quite well. As long as you remove some of the crapware and do some optimizations with video playback (Magic Actions for Youtube!), you should be pretty fine with having 10 tabs open and microsoft office open. 2 GB is totally doable. Since the SSD is only about 21 GB of usable space (assuming you don't reformat), you're quite limited with applications. Being an engineer and a scientist, this is not my primary laptop for those heavy duty applications (MATLAB, COMSOL, etc.), but it's nice to read and edit papers on. Downloaded Adobe and TeXstudio on here, along with chrome and office, with a few other important applications. I also just ordered a 64 GB microSD card for media storage. Definitely remove the crapware on the computer, and the McAfee Virus protection software, and use CCleaner for some extra disk space.<br/><br/>In terms of battery life, I've easily seen it perform for 6-7 hours without any problems. Touchpad seems to work fine for me (I suppose others have more problems with theirs). Keyboard is quite fantastic. Springy and nice to type on. The overall look of the model is quite clean and nice for $230. I believe for most students and even some professionals, this laptop + SD card is all they need for a pretty well performing computer. For gamers and professionals with intensive programs, more RAM and SSD storage would be appreciated, but you should probably use a desktop for those sorts of tasks anyway.<br/><br/>To summarize, I think this laptop is an extremely affordable and it has enough capabilities for the majority of the population. It does word processing, presentation editing, web surfing, and video playback just fine (which is what 90% of the population use their computers for, anyway). For those in need of lots of RAM or processing power for engineering or science for quick simulation/computation, I recommend another laptop for your needs.<br/><br/>As a recommendation to HP, if they upgraded this computer to a 64 GB SSD with 4 GB of RAM, it could easily become the new Macbook air in terms of popularity and usefulness. It probably wouldn't cost $230, however. I would churn out another $100 for the hardware upgrade, though, and it'd still be cheaper than most computers!
I bought this for my wife as a Xmas present. She's not a "power user".<br/><br/>90% of her time is via browser on the internet, with 10% on traditional Office type apps. She wanted this for light browsing & kitchen duty with no expectations on her occasional need for Office apps.<br/><br/>All that being said, HP has done a really excellent job with this unit. They've really managed to put together a package that is greater than the sum of it's parts in terms of functionality. They are getting good performance with their measly 2GB, so someone put some time into streamlining the hardware integration in design...kudos to HP.<br/><br/>I was expecting it to be slow now and then, and that's simply not the case.(11", don't know about the larger versions) My brief install/run of Open Office seemed to show it will serve my wife fine for her occasional Office needs as well.<br/><br/>As other people have pointed out, there's some bloat ware. I think the most annoying of which is the "special" version of Internet Explorer on it. I always put Firefox on any computer my wife uses and she uses that...but very occasionally when scripts don't run right you have to use IE and the version on this HP is just annoying.<br/><br/>The styling is nice, the touchpad works well, but there's no specific buttons for mouse control, it's integrated into the bottom of the touch pad...which takes some getting used to. I'm sure it was a cost savings measure to get the price down...it's not a deal killer for me or the wife...just different.  The keyboard is fantastic. It's close to full size, but even more important, sturdy. When I first received this laptop from Amazon and opened the box I have to admit I was a little disappointed initially...as initially it comes off like a "netbook", which I bought my wife several years ago and didn't even last a year(Acer). It was slow and flimsy and a bad experience, so I was hoping this HP wouldn't be similar.<br/><br/>After over a week now it seems that's not the case with this particular HP laptop...so all is well.<br/><br/>If HP was going to take advice, about the only other thing I'd recommend is that they offer a version with a fully sorted Ubuntu install as an option as well. I really don't care for Windows 8.1...but I know that would be a niche product and may not be worth their time.<br/><br/>All in all it's a great value for $200. As I type this I notice the price is now $291 after the holidays....I'm not sure if I would pay that as I'd have to research all over again...but my gut says $291 is a stretch and the competition may get tougher at that price level.
Computer keys stick, mouse pad is  non responsive
When you buy a laptop for $200, you know you're going to sacrifice something somewhere. The biggest question when evaluating such a product is whether or not the sacrifices are something you can live with! Considering I do most heavy-duty computing on a work machine, I really only use a laptop at home for uploading photos/videos, web browsing, and watching Netflix/streaming video, which can be done on a Chromebook. But I wanted to do some gaming, so a Windows machine was needed.<br/><br/>Browsing the Web - With a few tabs open (Chrome) the machine still handles well, but begins to slow noticeably after you open up ~10 or so.<br/>Video - Netflix streams nearly perfectly, HBOGo slows/skips slightly but doesn't need to buffer. Live TV (EG ESPN360) is pretty good - I don't see a noticeable degradation from a more powerful computer.<br/><br/>Gaming - I mostly play Civilization 5, and it largely works well. I haven't played on a faster machine so I don't know how the Stream 11 compares, but the graphics have a delay before fully loading all details. Loading saved games takes a fair amount of time.<br/><br/>Durability/Screen - Despite being a plastic laptop, it feels strong and secure. I haven't felt like it was going to crack or bend a single time. The screen is more than decent, though a retina display it is not.<br/><br/>OVERALL - love the performance for the price, and for what I do with the machine, it serves the purpose perfectly.
I am a MacBook guy. But lo, my MacBook started giving me problems and I needed something cheap to stream and do really light productivity (writing, emailing, simple stuff) with.<br/><br/>THIS COMPUTER BLEW MY MIND. I can't believe how nice it is. Of course, remove the bloatware and BS from it. Easy stuff. If you are an audiophile, do not be deceived by other reviews that tell you to turn off the DTS Studio Sound enhancements, because you get a way better response and a superior listening experience, especially with some good cans or headphones. But the built in speakers dominate any Apple product.  I was surprised at how wonderful this thing sounds compared to my Mac. I can watch Netflix without headphones and hear a little nuance, finally.<br/><br/>The screen isn't the most amazing thing out there, but it's not bad. The only real downfall is the viewing angles. But overall, it looks nice, with vivid colors and clear images. Just not AS nice as pricier laptops. But I don't mind one bit. You probably won't either, since you are getting this bad boy for 200 bucks.<br/><br/>I am living for the micro SD slot on the side. You can just pop a 64 or 128 GB card in there and goodbye memory problems.<br/><br/>Plus, this computer is just really sturdy and darn beautiful. I expected something much cheaper looking and feeling to come out of that box but I was pleasantly surprised. HP got it right with this charming little machine.
I was looking for a new laptop that I could use for work and take around with while I go about for my job. Read up on the Stream 13 and its lightweight design and how interesting it was. The price as well made it all the more fascinating and I decided to get it.<br/><br/>Completely forgetting I just bought an HP.<br/><br/>Now, I should note that the battery life on the Stream is amazing. On top of that when this thing wants to work properly, it is amazing for simple work tasks. The problem is getting this thing to work has become a chore. In less than three months I've had to reinstall the wireless drive five times. An issue that has forced me to reach out to HP's tech support. On two separate encounters I have known the issue was hardware and they tried to resolve it with updating the driver. Only now are they willing to have it sent out for repairs. On top of that the copy of office suddenly crashed and I'm in the process of reinstalling that. Obviously I'm using a mouse but the track pad on this thing is the worse one I've ever encountered. The screen itself is so stiff to open, I'm sometimes worried I'm going to break it open.<br/><br/>My old laptop needs to be plugged in to work and sit on a cooling fan and the damn thing gives me less grief than the Stream. I've had bad encounters with HP before, but for the price by brain put logic aside on this case. It won't be a mistake I make a second time
Love it. Just as described and perfect for what I need it for.Its compact and fits in my satchel. It has 2 USB ports so I can use a mouse. Almost as compact as an Ipad but it has windows and java. I love it.
I am totally happy with the hp stream 11 I purchased direct from Microsoft's store before Christmas.  Their signature edition as I see here has no bloatware in it and it was on sale for $179 then.<br/><br/>I have been a ipad user for the last few years only.  pleasantly surprised at windows 8.1.  lots of personalization made me happier.  Normal windows stuff.<br/><br/>did not know about the lower edge of the glidepad having the right and left buttons until I read a review here.  thanks.<br/><br/>that being said I did purchase a logictech wireless thumbwheel mouse as I can recline in my easy chair with an elevated side arm to rest the mouse on.  lazy old guys setup.<br/><br/>full brightness on the screen regardless of the power source helped the appearance at a somewhat shorter battery life.<br/><br/>miss the ipads predictive typing and spelling suggestions.  no office needed.  no cloud storage either.<br/><br/>wifi works great.  have had as many as 10 windows open.  no lag.<br/><br/>my last windows portable computer is a sony 505g 2gb hard drive in 1998.  still have it.<br/><br/>$2k then.  this is $179 17 years later.  amazing.<br/><br/>I am typing on this now.<br/><br/>needed a notebook to run a windows only program to monitor my motorhome and this works great.<br/><br/>temped to buy one for my grand daughter who is 8.
A great deal for the price. It will run a few games,  stream movies, run all windows apps, even Photoshop. I use it for just about everything that i can do on my macbook pro, it's just a little slower when it comes to loading ad-heavy web pages with tons of garbage javascript/flash stuff going on, and it's not a gaming machine by any means - but I do run WoW, Skyrim, Fallout, etc with an acceptable FPS at the lowest setting.<br/><br/>The screen is so-so. I have an acer c720 chromebook that sits in the same price range as this machine and this screen is nicer, but the c720 screen is brighter. The keys are great. the track pad is ok, but the software for it is garbage. the first thing you need to do is turn off all the swipe gestures and it will be fairly serviceable.<br/><br/>Windows runs great on this machine. It starts up in about 10 seconds, shuts down in about the same time. Access times on the SSD are lighting fast, a little slower when accessing the micro SD but still nowhere near the slowness of an HDD.<br/><br/>No fan is nice. It doesn't get hot, even when running games. It's totally silent.<br/><br/>if you're looking for a laptop that you can kick around, a second computer, or something for your kids/older parents, you can't beat this for the price. add a 64 gig micro SD card to the slot, and you have PLENTY of storage.
I wasn't so sure about the new HP Stream. I checked out reliable sources on line and read reviews. All were fairly positive. I didn't need anything fancy just needed to be able to surf the web, check my email and watch my shows. The price of $199 was hard to pass up so I finally decided to go for it. I was so excited when my package arrived. I opened it up and took it out of the box. It was so cute and compact. I powered it up and went through the initial set up. Easy enough. At first I didn't know if Windows 8 and I could be friends. I would want to go one place and It wanted take me somewhere else. UGH!! After much trial and error and viewing of tutorials Windows 8 and I are finally becoming acquainted and soon to be friends. The HP Steam performs just as promised. Plenty of web surfing, email checking and movie watching with enough battery life to get you through. I like my cute little HP Stream I think you will like it too!!
Great laptop for students or someone who is on the go. I bought this computer as a replacement for my old laptop. I own a small business and needed something small and easy to take around the house with a long battery life. This is it. I really only use the internet, microsoft office, and check email on it. I LOVE that it comes with a year worth of Microsoft 365. I would recommend this computer for someone that just needs the basics.<br/><br/>Pros: The physical size of the computer is lightweight and small. It is quick to respond when turning on and off. The 1TB of Onedrive is AWESOME! I was using dropbox, but transferred all of my documents to Onedrive and barely touched the memory. I save all of my documents and stuff to onedrive rather than the computer itself.<br/><br/>Cons: RAM is really low. I had to delete a lot of the preinstalled apps because I was almost maxed out with just downloading a few things.
Bought this as a Nexus 7 replacement for the missus. I am specifically reviewing the 13" laptop shipped from Amazon for 249.99, as I cannot vouch for any 3rd party sellers.<br/><br/>This little laptop is perfect for someone who uses mostly web based applications and just needs a mobile screen and keyboard. Netflix, Spotify, and HD youtube work fine over the WIFI. All of your MS office programs will run fine. The speakers are passable (although located on the bottom...) and the screen is a functional 1366x768, 16:9 display dulled by the anti-glare coating.  I personally think the touch pad is absolute garbage, with unintended gestures registering every time I try to use it. If I had to use this for any extended amount of time, I would pair it with the wireless magenta mouse from MS.<br/><br/>After you get everything set up and remove the bloatware, you're still only left with about 15 gigs of hard drive space.<br/><br/>Pros: Light, thin, and functional for web based entertainment. The keyboard feels good. HDMI out.<br/><br/>Cons: Awful touchpad, speakers are on the bottom, power port is located on the RIGHT side.
This is the worst purchase I have ever made. The machine is loaded with adware that I cannot uninstall. It constantly pops up with deceitful messages misleading me into accepting the installation of additional malware. The computer is nearly unusable and I have spent two days struggling to make it minimally acceptable. Neither Internet Explorer nor Mozilla work properly. They have a mind of their own and unwanted websites constantly pop up. I downloaded Chrome, but the computer does not allow it to boot.<br/>Selling this kind of merchandise is a stain in the otherwise excellent reputation of Amazon. Drop this product, the damage to your good name far exceeds any profit that can be derived from this sale.
I'm unsatisfied with this little laptop for two primary reasons:<br/>1) the trackpad is practically impossible to use and very non-responsive<br/>2) the wifi antenna is very low quality and has alot of difficulty picking up signals that other devices have no problem connecting to.<br/><br/>I am returning this little laptop and instead buying the samsung chromebook, mainly because it has the dual antenna wifi.<br/>For the same price, you can buy the Asus cromebook with double the ram, and probably a slightly better trackpad, but that one doesn't have the dual antenna wifi that I am avid about.
Might as well toss $200 in the trash. I am so disgusted with this computer. Just over 3 months after purchase screen broke, with ink seeping throughout screen making it impossible to use. See photo. I did not drop it and probably used it 30 times. Called HP and they said they would repair it for $269, plus $50 shipping. I told<br/>them it would be cheaper to throw the hunk of junk away and buy a new HP not that I would ever buy this again. Prior to this it was constantly crashing. I also did not like how cheap it looked and felt.
I would like to say this is a very capable computer. I bought it at walmart today due to the negative comments I choose to order it at walmart for 18 dollars more so that if the computer were to have problems I can return in a certain amount of days but I love it. It's really small but it does the job and comes with word Microsoft. Doesn't have a thing to put CDs In it but I found no need to put CDs in it. Really good computer for school. I wrote this review the first day I got it but it froze the next day
Bought the signature edition from Microsoft on Black Friday for $199.  First impression is an excellent one. No expectations for this little laptop. Super fast, good size comfortable keyboard. Seems to be put together very well. No issues with battery, time will tell if it lasts 7.5 hrs as advertised. ONLY software installed is Windows 8.1 and Windows Defender. No touch screen, touch pad sensitivity could be improved. Comes with a free years subscription to Office 365 and a $25 Microsoft gift card. Loaded Skype onto computer, worked very well and connected to wi-fi very easily. Has usb 2.0 and usb 3.0 and HDMI ports. Will take up to a 64gb micro sd card, bought a Samsung 64gb class 10 EVO card, 59G usable on computer.(no partition & no formatting necessary)<br/>Overall a good quality little laptop, a definity buy (from Microsoft)!!!
I bought it for my wife and she loves it. She previously had a 5 year old HP netbook, and it was very slow. This one has a bigger screen, larger keyboard and is lighter than the old one. It's very fast and has many built in features. The cost was in our budget and she really likes using it. We got the blue one. She wasn't using her old one and did everything she could on her iPhone. Now she's on her computer every day.
needed a new computer as my Mac finally died. Bit of a learning curve going from Mac to a Windows machine. I bought mine from Microsoft store , signature series. $179.00 and no bloat ware. seems to work okay . screen resolution isn't the best , cruises the web ok. came with office 365 for a year . All in all for the price seems like an okay deal. I would suggest you buy it from Microsoft store before other places.
I got this computer last month for school. It's a perfect size for on the go people and it offers a very stylish design. This laptop has poor performance. It's not good for gaming, video quality is sub par it tends to freeze up a lot. the memory is very limited I recommend buying an external hard drive for this computer. Besides all of the negative I really do like this laptop its a good price for a laptop.
I purchased this laptop for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas. We absolutely love that it's Windows 8 & come with Office 365 Personal free for 1 year. Also you get $25 Microsoft gift card free to purchase apps, games, music or etc. It's lightweight, love the color, not too bulky, just perfect. I tried out the Internet going to different sites, it has a pretty fast processor. Overall love it....
Best laptop for this price, I spent days looking for the right buy and I finally decided to try this one (but on Microsoft it is much cheaper 199.00 US dollars) It works great, I was able to download Google chrome into it, so browsing is not a problem. I use to own a Chrome book (Samsung) but it was unable to do a lot of things, especially offline. I love this new 'chromebook killer'
This computer for the price was the reason why I'm giving it five stars.  I primarily bought this computer for my daughter to play minecraft with the family.  We've had it for about three months and are currently happy with the purchase.<br/><br/>If I were a kid again I would love to get this for a present.<br/><br/>It does have limited capabilities but you get what you pay for.
I absolutely love how this laptop is lightweight. It's so easy to take to school. The battery life is incredible! I don't have to worry that my laptop is going to die and bring my laptop charger. The color is also nice and the laptop is not loud. This is perfect for me. The laptop is as how it was described online. Just totally fell in love with it! Can't live without it now.!
Don't know. Could never log in. Someone already was logged on with their password. I guess this was a return sold as new. Try and contact HP. Impossible. So frustrating .<br/><br/>Finally got hold of HP. great help. Now I discover that the person who returned the laptop used the free office 365, stole, so now I have<br/>to purchase a new one.
As a student this is a great notebook.  I am able to access every thing i need for my classes, watch movies and listen to music.  if you are looking for something faster and with lots of storage this is not it.  But if you can get used to saving to the cloud storage is no problem.  The stream is a great everyday computer.
It's a great laptop for the price.  It's light weight and sleek design make it super portable plus the bright color makes it fun.  It's great for email, gaming, social media...plus you get all the apps and versatility of Windows 8.  Great battery life...I got 8 hours with social media use and gaming.  Money well spent!
Bought 2. Of these both of them broke within 90 days
At $230 including shipping and office 365 this was a really good deal. The 13" screen is also a nice plus in this price range.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was the "see-saw" implementation of the mouse clicks. I sometimes right-clicked when I wanted to left-click and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Just bought a second one of these and am upping my review to 5 stars (on a for-the-money basis), They're now throwing in lifetime 4G for the same price. You can't beat this. It compares very favorably with Chromebooks on price and includes Microsoft Office, the ultimate app as far as I'm concerned, which Chromebooks don't have.
I hope you have your reading glasses on, because it's about to be a long one. Grab a loved one and a hot beverage, sit back, and let me spin you a yarn that'll put you in the computer buying mood.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this computer comes with Windows 10 Home Edition. I have a bit of a problem with Microsoft and Windows 10 since I wear a tinfoil hat on most days and believe that without your knowing consent, the operating system is keeping track of data from you and using it to tailor make advertisements for you, not only while browsing websites, but on your own start menu. If Microsoft and Advertisers get that sort of information about you, who else is getting that information? Do you care? Do you have "nothing to hide"? Am I going down a dark path you don't want to think about right now?<br/><br/>All of what I said just now is factual, just sort of look it up in your free time. Fortunately, you can turn off pretty much all of these things aside from Telemetry data (non-identifiable information about how your computer is being used such as program history and crash reports) that goes straight to the codemonkeys at Microsoft to help them make a better update in the future. Unlike Windows 7 and Windows 8, unfortunately, you will be getting that update, as Windows 10 Home comes with no way to turn off automatic updates. Technically, neither does Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise, but they do come with access to Group Policy Editor, which will allow advanced users to change the way Windows 10 handles automatic updates beyond what's advertised on the user friendly menus. In general, you're going to want to install some other OS on this little machine, because Windows 10 Home is criminally lacking. Perhaps you may want to downgrade to 8, or upgrade to a better version of 10, but unfortunately for me, it doesn't seem that 7 is an option as HP has seemingly discontinued support for drivers necessary to 7's installation. More experimentation for me, I suppose.<br/><br/>Now, I know I just slammed Windows 10 pretty hard, but in truth, there's still a Microsoft operating system somewhere in there trying to help you have an enjoyable experience. Beyond all of the strange and potentially privacy invading settings, it's a solid operating system with a lot of useful (and worthless) applications built in. Out of concern for my own privacy I connected this laptop to my Wifi only long enough to download essential software for on the go work, and I haven't allowed it access to any network since. The connection was solid, though. Now, let's get to the part that's going to aggravate most normal users:<br/><br/>This is an HP PC first and foremost, and that means it's going to be preinstalled with about 50 pounds of worthless, redundant bloatware. I was actually surprised how little there was on this machine compared to devices I've purchased in the past, but it's still there and you're still going to want to remove it, along with the one year subscription to McAfee because it's just trash. The HP software tends to make the processor go up to 100% use quite often, so with it still on there, you're going to notice slowdowns for no apparent reason. Just poor optimization on the software's part, I assume. Fortunately, it's easy enough to take this stuff off, and it'll also let you reclaim a good chunk of your relatively small Hard Drive, which is solid state. The read times are incredible, and really, 32gb is enough for you to store the OS and any larger programs that you want to run quickly. For those of you who want to store your pictures and video and music and such - that adds up fast. I suggest buying an external hard drive, as it'll go at lightning speeds when it interfaces with the USB 3.0 port included on this laptop.<br/><br/>Physically speaking, this laptop is exactly what I wanted - a mobile computing option that is durable, more usable than a tablet, but still small enough to fit in a bag while I'm out and about. This laptop measures in at about 1 foot and some change in length, and its width is no more significant than one of those black and white composition books. It's incredibly lightweight, and while closed, the battery seems practically endless. With proper power management (dim screen, few programs, etc) you can get a workday's worth of use out of this little thing off of one charge. As strange as it is to say, my personal favorite part about this laptop is that it has no fans, and really, no moving parts at all. Not only does this eliminate weight, it really allows you to use and store this laptop anywhere without worrying what kind of dust it's going to suck up. Most people love having their laptops on their lap, or on a bed, and unfortunately, dust and fuzz gets sucked up in there and eventually becomes a problem, causing the processor to overheat or the fan to outright stop running in extreme cases. It makes no noise and keeps itself cool based purely on how little power it consumes. Even though it has a completely plastic shell, that tells me it was designed to last.<br/><br/>The keyboard being white on an otherwise all indigo laptop (and yes this is a very deep bluish purple, not violet as the name suggests) is a little disorienting, and I don't look forward to the fact that eventually, no matter how clean my hands are, the keyboard's going to start to look dirty. I would have much preferred black keys, or y'know, keys that match the color. The touchpad is honestly one of the worst I've ever used. The tracking can be jumpy and the buttons barely function. If you don't have a wireless mouse to go with this, Logitech makes many great ones at reasonable prices, look into them. I don't consider that worthy of detracting a star from this otherwise stellar laptop just because so much about the design makes me really happy.<br/><br/>You're hard pressed to find better for the price - I couldn't find a better deal even with Black Friday/Cyber Monday factored in. Some of that may depend on the kind of specifics I was looking for, but in general I'm happier with this purchase than I ever was with my old laptop which ran me twice as much as this one. My biggest gripes are honestly nitpicks about the fact that there isn't a model that comes with an AMD processor (I dislike Intel) and HP's apparent lack of concern for supporting Windows 7, even though Windows XP still received support for much longer after it became "legacy". On the advanced end of the spectrum, the BIOS is a bit lacking and doesn't seem to allow you access to the really advanced options unless you pull of some intense registry editing. I'm not too fond of the "return" of the Start Menu, since it's less of a start menu and more of 8's awful home menu squeezed into one little area. A step in the right direction, yes, but I don't want that pointless clutter in my start menu. A program called Classic Shell helps you get around that, and it's absolutely free.<br/><br/>Overall a great purchase for all levels of experience.
This looked like an good laptop for basic use, so I ordered it. I find it to be fast enough for basic tasks, with a solid keyboard and decent screen.<br/><br/>There are some good points to this laptop:<br/><br/>+ I wanted this device for basic word processing on the go, and for that purpose it is very good. It is not as convenient to pack as my former 11 inch, and at 4 lbs is a bit heavy, but is fine for a backpack.<br/><br/>+ Overall I'm finding that I like the size - the screen is easy to see and quite readable. Some folks will complain about the relatively low screen resolution (1366x768), but in fact this resolution makes it excellent for basic word processing; it is much easier to read (and use, overall) than my more expensive Dell convertible.<br/><br/>+ I like that HP bundled Office 365 with it, with a one year subscription. The files are executed off the hard drive, which makes it run faster.<br/><br/>+ The keyboard is a bit small, but has very good backing and is absolutely silent in operation - great for a classroom. I like it for touch typing.<br/><br/>+ The overall construction seems quite sturdy.<br/><br/>+ The dedicated keys for home, page up, page down, end, print screen, and etc. are separate and easy to use. This is a fully functional keyboard, unlike some models where the keys have dual use.<br/><br/>+ The touchpad works very well, with a solid left and right click. More importantly, the keyboard is situated such that I was not constantly accidentally hitting the touchpad and moving the cursor. I've had some laptops for which I've actually had to disable the touchpad because it interfered with typing - not this one.<br/><br/>+ With the default power saving settings, I was able to get 5 hours of screen time. I think this could be pushed with tweaking and turning on airplane mode.<br/><br/>+ OK, it is only cosmetic, but I really like the blue color. In fact, the overall design is stylish, while not sacrificing sturdy build quality.<br/><br/>+ Three USB ports, although only one is 3.0. What I don't like is that the 3 port is not colored blue, which is industry standard.<br/><br/>+ The 3mm port supports both headset and microphone, which means you can plug in an earbud or basic handsfree for use with Skype and etc. This leaves the USB ports free for other tasks.<br/><br/>+ The full size HDMI port is great for playing movies.<br/><br/>+ The supplied charger is very small (a mini brick), which will fit better in the backpack.<br/><br/>There are some things that are less good.<br/><br/>- I found that the hard drive has only 15 GB free when booted up. Fortunately, it does have a MicroSD storage slot (unusual, since most have a standard SD), which can be used to store files. They also provide a one year subscription to OneDrive for a full TB of data.<br/><br/>- The screen is not touch sensitive, but at this price point that is just a note, not a drawback.<br/><br/>- The antivirus is only good for a single month, and ironically, it looks like I will have to uninstall it and reinstall the same program so that I can register it. Mcafee allows unlimited computers to use the same license at home, and it actually works very well.<br/><br/>- There is some HP bloatware, but that can be easily removed. This is frustrating on a machine with limited storage space.<br/><br/>- I did notice that the laptop has a definite way of operating - occasionally it will slow down for a brief second. But it is not noticeable in general, and did not detract from using it. I attribute this to the Celeron processor and limited memory. You have to work with the machine, rather than fighting it.<br/><br/>- When using this laptop, you will want to stay with the basics. This machine is not at all suited for gaming, or heavy database / spreadsheet use. Programs can take a few seconds to come up, but then they run fine. I don't plan on running more than a couple of major programs at a time. I'm actually impressed with how well it works with only 2GB of main memory. Once everything completes the boot process, it runs well. I did not bother running PC diagnostics - if you are interested in those numbers, don't bother with this machine!<br/><br/>Summary: A very decent laptop for student use, at a great price. Highly recommended for light word processing and excel.
So this thing is basically a tablet with a keyboard and lots of ports to connect peripherals. The ports were my reason for buying this instead of a tablet - you can get data, applications, etc off of it without a network or cloud.<br/><br/>I followed suggested, "remove crapware", instructions in other's reviews and as they say it runs smoothly thereafter. I can open a bunch of tabs in Chrome and the CPU averages about 6% and I'm not having any trouble with typical browsing. Hulu and Netflix work smoothly and the HDMI out runs without skipping at 1080p.<br/><br/>Battery life is at least as advertised. I use it most of the day without plugging in, regardless of what I'm doing with it.<br/><br/>It's very light weight so is easy to sit on the couch with or carry around. It feels kind of cheap / plasticky - like when the lid is closed and you carry it around the two halves aren't secured, they, "clack", a little. I type for a living and I can type pretty well on the chicklet keys. For $225 I guess I can't complain about the build - it all works.<br/><br/>Turning DTS off is a big deal if you use the microphone for Skype, etc. With it on you sound like you're in a tunnel. There aren't any visible DTS applications anywhere, you have to type, "dts", at the search prompt and run the located program and turn it off. It's not a studio quality mic but at least you sound like you.<br/><br/>The 32 gB storage is really bare minimum, you don't really have much room to install anything. It comes with 12 mos of Office, but you have to install it and yes, it takes space. I installed Office and just a few other applications and I have 6 gB left. Even though I expected this I am still surprised how little space is left and I'm getting used to doing everything off USB sticks. Right now I'm too chicken to update to WIndows 10, mostly because the disk space thing leaves me thinking I'd wind up with a rescue operation and a lot of wasted time and the words about, "drivers won't be recognized", spooked me a little.
I purchased the HP Stream 11 laptop as a second machine to type on. I've used several 5+ year old laptops that retailed at over $1000, and the HP Stream is much faster than them, a pleasant surprise, and also much cooler; from what I've read it won't overheat easily like my old laptops. I've also used a gaming quality desktop PC I built two years ago, so I immediately noticed how the HP Stream takes about a minute to run my suite of startup scripts and programs, and how it lags frequently while browsing the internet. The HP Stream can play a video and browse the internet at the same time, but I wouldn't even think of playing a game on this. That's good for me, because I don't want to be doing anything but writing on this machine. The HP Stream 11 works very well for simple tasks, and for $200 this is an excellent value (that said, pay the extra $10-20 for the Signature Edition, which has none of the pre-installed junk software the regular retail edition comes with).<br/><br/>Here are some of the HP Stream 11's quirks and some tips to work around them:<br/><br/>1. The standard edition comes loaded with bloatware. Instead of spending hours removing the useless extra programs, pay a little extra and buy the Signature Edition from the Microsoft Store.<br/><br/>2. The 32 GB hard drive is actually 21.3 GB, and after installing programs it will be even less. I had about 10 GB free after setting mine up. I recommend an SD card for additional storage, though beware that the SD card sticks out of the slot slightly and is easy to eject by accident. If you're storing many large files, you'll want an external hard drive and possibly a USB hub with its own power supply.<br/><br/>3. There are only 5 ports: 1 SD, 1 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0, 1 HDMI, and 1 4-position 3.5mm jack. I was using an external mouse and keyboard, so I used a USB hub to get a few extra ports; use a USB hub with a power supply or the extra devices might not get enough power.<br/><br/>4. The built-in keyboard and touchpad are nowhere near as responsive nor comfortable as the gaming mouse and keyboard I'm used to. That's two out of two available USB hubs.<br/><br/>5. There's only a single 4-position audio jack. All my headsets have separate mic and headphone jacks, so I would need a 4-position to 3-position mic/headphone adapter to use my external microphone. A USB mic/headphone would also work, though not in a USB hub with no external power supply; I tried this and got treated to a blast of static along with the sound of the video I was using to test this setup. The laptop does have a built-in microphone and webcam, but with my setup I'm not in front of the laptop so I'd need even more USB ports if I wanted to use those.<br/><br/>5. 1366x768 is the maximum resolution on the laptop screen. I used an HDMI cable to connect the laptop to an external monitor; the setting to display the desktop on the second monitor only will use the full resolution of the monitor (to quickly change this setting, hit F4 on the laptop keyboard). Of course, since I'm using an external monitor I got the HP Stream 11 instead of the HP Stream 13; either laptop screen is tiny compared to a good external monitor.<br/><br/>6. The laptop comes bundled with an Office 365 Personal 1-year subscription and a $25 Microsoft App Store card. I don't need Office, so I gave the Office subscription away. I mistakenly though the $25 card was for the regular Microsoft Store, where I bought the HP Stream 11 from, but it's really for the App Store. Before I could even use the card, I had to do a sloppy verification procedure in Internet Explorer that involved disabling default security features as specified on Microsoft's official website. I then had the pleasure of learning that not only would I not pay for anything on the App Store, but I wouldn't even take any of the slim offerings for free. If you know you can use either of these freebies, then good for you.<br/><br/>That's what I did to use the HP Stream 11 as a dedicated typing machine with my existing equipment. Summary: Buy the Signature Edition for fast setup, expect about 10GB of internal storage, expect to need an external USB hub, and don't expect to do anything more intensive than browsing the internet and watching a video (even then, it will hang occasionally). I initially thought it was funny that I was using $400 of external equipment (mouse, keyboard, monitor) on a $200 laptop that never touches my lap, but it actually works quite well. It's nowhere near the quality of a $1200+ gaming quality desktop computer, but it's good enough for typing.<br/><br/>Update: After setting up this laptop I learned HP also made an upgradeable desktop version called the HP Stream Mini, which has two extra USB ports and an ethernet port, and surprisingly is even smaller than the laptop.
I'm a tech-savvy 30-something female. For the last few years, I've been using an Asus netbook for my personal use (which is about once a day for basic Googling, Firefox browsing, email, pics, Facebook, etc). From time to time, I use MS Office suite of products (Word and Excel, specifically). My good ol' trusty netbook was running on Windows 7 STARTER! It wasn't too big of an issue for me, but I went to download a program and found that it wouldn't load without the full Windows 7 system. Well, that was going to cost me. $90+ to update a 5yr old $150 netbook? No thanks! So, it prompted me to look into a new laptop. I did my cursory research, and then went into a BB (major electronic store) to compare them in person. I'm so glad I did! T<br/>This thing initially turned me off just because of the color (I warned you, I'm a chick, and stupid things like that matter). Anyway, in the store, I actually fell in love with the size and sturdiness of this HP Stream 13. I was shocked. So, I turned around, walked out, and ordered it on Amazon for $70 less than the major retailer's 'sale' price. Today, when it arrived, I was nervous to delve into the world of Windows 8.1. I was needlessly anxious -- it's pretty much a common-sense approach to how a normal person uses their computer. It took me all of 5 mins to set up and personalize. Nothing so involved that it would scare off a regular ol' non-techy person. If your intent is to code sites and play intense games on your computer all day in your mom's basement-- this is not for you, and why are you looking at a $200 machine to meet all of your needs for 12hrs a day?<br/><br/>Bottom line: this thing is a GREAT buy! A price you can't beat. A simple machine that gets the job done, with all the tools you didn't even know you needed. And room to expand!<br/>I love this thing. Amazing picture. Amazingly fast processing and response time. And simple to use.<br/><br/>Buy it, and love it.<br/>(and if you hate the color of it - who cares? They make vinyl skins for it. Otherwise, suck it up -- it makes it unique and ensures easy spotting  under a stack of papers on your desk)
I don't often write reviews. I purchased this laptop to lighten my travel load. My company issued laptop is like toting a boat anchor around. wanted a smaller laptop that would fit in my purse. I got that and so much more! First of all, I read many of the reviews here on Amazon and on c-net. I needed the space to install a very graphic heavy software program for demo. Check. Enough room. I needed to be able to run a power point presentation. Check. I can write one. It came with Windows 365 for a year, free. I needed it to connect with my 5 year old Dell projector. Check. No additional drivers needed. I plugged it in, it recognized it immediately and functioned flawlessly. I had a few other things that I needed it to do to be able to leave the boat anchor at home and have everything I needed on the road. Check. Everything. Check. I still had hard drive space. I also had a 32GB SD card in the slot for extra storage. So I installed Adobe Photoshop Elements 13 for fun. And still, no problems.<br/>I have found the transition from W7 to W8.1 to be much easier than expected. I am enjoying the new interface. At 2 lbs it is an easy carry. And I still can not get over the value for the money. Does all the basic stuff like Skype, web surfing, email, rented movies, etc.<br/><br/>Now for the technical part. I am not a programmer by any stretch of the word. I read a review that indicated that a lot of the loaded applications that came on the computer would be unnecessary and would slow it down. So when the computer arrived I handed it off to my IT person and he removed or disabled anything I would not need to increase the speed and release some space. He returned it to me a few hours later with Office 365 installed, free McAfee activated and all the junk removed. My hubs is impressed he would like one. This coming from a guy who just got an iPad air as a retirement gift. He loves his iPad but he said this would be easier for him with a built in keyboard and a simple way to read and create documents.<br/><br/>If you are someone that requires a ton of RAM and lightning fast speed for gaming this is not going to be your thing but if you just want to lighten the load a bit I think it's a great little laptop for the money.
After only one evening of use, I like this laptop a lot. I read extensive reviews before purchase, so I had a good idea of what I was getting. And for $200 you're better off setting your expectations low. Read all specs before purchase and make sure this will work for you. I already have a good HP desktop but wanted something I could use on the couch to surf the web, pay bills, watch Netflix, and for light productivity, as well as to tote around town for work. It seems that it will deliver quite well on these expectations.<br/>My first impression was that it looks and feels like a toy laptop for kids. However it is super light and compact, which is a big plus. It took about an hour to set up, and once you get through HP's easy process, Windows 8.1 is ready to use. I set up user accounts for myself and my wife to keep data separate. It handled that well. It connected to WiFi quickly and easily too.<br/>The OS seems smooth and responsive, and relatively fast considering the small processor - however I only had 1-2 apps open at once, and apparently this is all the processor can handle. I installed Chrome and it ran fairly quickly with no issues. A quick test run of Netflix went great, with an easy to use interface and decent playback with no buffering. I jumped on my work PC through Log Me In and it ran perfectly. I read several reviews that complained about the pre-installed bloatware, but I didn't see too much. I immediately uninstalled McAfee and will rely solely on Windows Defender. I deleted some desktop shortcuts to HP's photo services and helpdesk, and was left with over 16 GB on the SSD, which seems much better than other experiences I read about. Of course if you want more storage you can expand it through the SD slot. I have an external hard drive so storage won't be an issue. The 1TB OneDrive storage is an option but I won't be using it. This package also comes with Office 365 (1 yr license) and $25 to spend in the Windows store. I will be using both, so that is a nice bonus.<br/>The keyboard is great. Typing was fast and silent. I like Windows 8 okay, but it has a bit of a learning curve if you're used to another OS. The trackpad is pretty bad and made navigating a little frustrating. I can deal with it in short sessions, but if you're going to use for hours on end, get a mouse. The screen is low quality, and the on board camera is probably the worst I've seen. I plan on using Skype with this computer so that is a concern. Those are really the only cons I've noticed so far, other than the overall cheap feel of it. Overall I am pleased though, and for $200, you have a fully-functioning laptop.
With the exception of a couple of brands I have owned just about every type of computer. From the Tandy 1000 in the eighties to Apples. I am a graphic artist so obviously a good computer is essential. This being said I currently have 4 other laptops at home and am getting a new Macbook in February. I also currently own two Kindles, an Ipad and a Samsung Galaxy Tab and another Android tablet, My point in telling you this is to say I am pretty well versed on this type of technology and am able to form a well rounded opinion. So going into this purchase I knew what I was getting. Meaning I knew I was only 32g of Memory, only 2g of Ram and non-touchscreen model and a SD mini flash card slot.<br/><br/>So what made me get this?<br/><br/>I was looking for a lightweight, non-bulky, easily portable LAPTOP for my college online courses. I was not looking for a gaming computer, or anything to run my Adobe design programs. I wanted something that I could work for the internet easily and use Microsoft office and blog. I did not want a tablet with a attachable keyboard (Although, that Microsoft Surface Pro was looking kinda sweet but if I was paying that price I am getting my new Apple first). I was originally considering the Chromebook, but even though the Google Apps would be able to open my Microsoft files, I really did want that continuity. I wanted a HDMI slot so I could hook this up to a monitor and several USB slots. I knew it did not have a DVD/Cd reader/writer, but I cant even remember the last time I needed one.<br/><br/>When I saw this laptop advertised with a windows operating system, at less than $200 (for the basic model) I knew this was going to be my official "school" laptop. I had plenty of others to run my graphic intense programs. My only struggle was did I want blue or pink?<br/><br/>This purchase has not been a disappointment. I have never been a fan of Windows 8, but after I maneuvered around I got the hang of it. (My beef is with windows 8, not this computer. General users often don't separate the two when they want to complain). It is extremely lightweight. It runs about as smooth as a computer with these specifications should. The free year of Microsoft 365 is a bonus. People may question why it is a SD mini slot and not a regular SD which is the most common card used in things such as digital cameras. Yes, I might have been nice to have a regular card slot in it, but it is not like this is a computer that can hold thousands of photos.What the mini SD card slot is good for is adding additional memory to it for storage.<br/><br/>I am not sure what the other reviewer was referring to about pulling off stickers and "crapware". Mine has not come with any of that. I opened it, followed the prompts to set it up and boom... up and running with a sticker free computer with no software bogging it down.<br/><br/>I did not get the model with the data plan. I am around wifi enough, plus I do have a free wifi from freedompop.com as backup, which I never have to use anyway. I suppose if you don't own wifi, and don't plan on  using online often the model with that data could be beneficial. But only if you live in a area with t-mobile.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this if you just want to surf, do online college courses, blog, email and video chat.<br/><br/>This is not for gaming or design. And its only disappointing that it doesn't have a built in regular SD card slot if you think you are going to use this for photo storage. There is plenty of USB card readers out there for that, as there is USB cd/dvd readers and writers.
I bought this little pc laptop because my telecommuting firm requires a PC to run one of it's programs.  We are a MAC family -- so I needed a low-cost option for work purposes.  I prefer little laptops for portability (I use a Mac Air 11 inch as my primary computer) -- so this was a no-brainer.  That said, I am pleasantly surprised at how well this little laptop runs -- and it's really a great deal for someone who wants to surf the net, steam, or do office based tasks.  It comes with a free year of office 360 -- really upping the cost benefit.  It is also perfect to let my little boy play around with because frankly, even if he ruined it, it costs so little that I wouldn't be devastated.<br/><br/>This doesn't claim to be a work-horse desk top replacement computer, and indeed it isn't.  There is no CD-drive (I have used my external one) and it's processor and memory are too small for real gaming.  I think even Minecraft wouldn't be good on this little guy.  However, this is perfect for what I need and would be great for those who want a very portable laptop to surf the net, do homework/study, travel with, take to cafes, etc.  I would recommend this highly as a first laptop, a secondary portable laptop, for students who need functionality without gaming, for older people who are just starting out, and for someone like me, who needs a pc for some application that isn't Mac compatible.  I have been surprised how zippy the little guy really is -- and that it's actually quite cute.  I got the blue color (so my son could eventually take it over) and it really looks nicer than you'd think it would for so little.<br/><br/>Does it compare to my Mac.  Of course not.  But, I wouldn't expect it to.  But, I am very happy with my purchase.
Let me first start by saying that I bought this at a Microsoft Store, so it doesn't come with any bloatware, or McAfee antivirus or bing bar. Just Plain vanilla windows 8.1<br/>After installing the included office 365 key, which gives you the full office suite, and all the pending windows updates I was left with roughly 10GB of usable hard disk space. Not much at all. In fact, nowadays is nothing.<br/>I also added a 64GB SD Card (They claim it will work with cards up to 128GB).<br/><br/>I bought this $200 machine because I needed a small computer, it's lightweight and 11 inches is a great size. I was also moving from my 10-inch Windows RT tablet. RT is great, but I needed to run a couple of x86 apps so I switched.<br/><br/>It took me only 30 minutes to get everything up and running: installed office and downloaded the lastest updates. The machine performs better than my Tegra 3-ARM processor with Windows RT. Despite being an aging celeron. No vents, no moving parts, two USB ports (one claims to be USB 3.0), HDMI, analog audio and SD slot.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the screen. It's a major downturn. Feels like as the first LCD's that came to the market. Colors are washed out, and it's no way near the quality you expect with modern noteboks, seems it doesn't have much contrast and that crisp and clear image is not there.  Feels very cheap. In fact, if I ever return it, it will be only because of the screen<br/><br/>Overall, for the $200 price point is as good as it gets. No internal part is user replaceable, and I wouldn't be surprised if the internal SSD was just a "memory card" and not a SATA-compatibe-drive, if you think you can replace it for your own.<br/><br/>I do own a full featured desktop and a 15" intel i3 laptop, so this comes in a third place just for the purpose of showing presentations at work and for quick travels where I need something small but usable. In all cases, carrying a standard 15' computer can be heavy and you get the battery life issue.<br/><br/>HP (and windows) claims you get get up to 6 hour battery with this, so I'm only sticking with this for that fact, not because of the screen quality or the available disk space (yeah, you can get an SD to expand memory, but since the system doesn't take the SD as a hard drive, you mostly will run into problems if you want to install programs to it. You can store your documents and multimedia, but no system files.)<br/><br/>And please REMEMBER that you are actually renting office suite for a year. It's not yours, it's leased, so be prepared to either pay the renewal fee or buy the permanent license.
Brilliant little device especially for the price.  Remembering that it is a budget notebook.  Perfect for student or as an additional device in the home or even for the lady of the house.  Small, lightweight and works very well..<br/>Amazing value for money especially with the 1Tb One Drive and 12 Month MS Office 360 Subscription thrown in free.<br/><br/>Windows 8.1  - totally up to date.<br/>Setup was a breeze.<br/><br/>All the MS Office Apps installed from the "Free" Office 360 12 month subscription work absolutely fine.<br/><br/>A little Bloatware on the device in the form of other apps but they can be removed if you want.  So far I have left them but might do a small purge at some stage.<br/>The "recovery partition takes over a little too much of the original 32Gb "SD" drive..<br/>Again you can create an external memory stick or memory card version of that and remove that to reclaim more space.<br/><br/>I also bought a very Fast Hight Performance Lexar 64Gb MicroSDX UHS-1 Flash Memory card (Lexar High-Performance MicroSDXC 633x 64GB UHS-I Flash Memory Card LSDMI64GBBNL633R)  during the Blackfriday Sales. This fits in the memory card slot and gives me an extra 64Gb fast drive.. I would have bought a 128Gb version but at the time I get that was just beyond my budget and the 64Gb was at an awesome BlackFriday price - again from Amazon..<br/>That said I now think I should have got 128Gb and be  done with it but it was all about the $$$<br/><br/>So I recommend it.. At the price Hell yeah!<br/>But not for a power user..  But as a Student, Spare computer at home, A computer to use while travelling to do emails, internet, a little word-processing and spreadsheet work etc.. Awesome!<br/><br/>I have a ChromeBook and this thing is way more useful or versatile IMHO and pretty well as quick.<br/><br/>BTW there is also a model with a 4G Sim card slot in it..  That would be better but as I am not in USA the Frequencies that the device supports are not so useful to me here where I am so I elected not to get that model.  If I lived in USA I think I would definitely buy that model.
Just bought this from another retailer. MS. So I thought I would post my thoughts on the computer. I have owned a bunch of laptops and desktop computers. This is a netbook its not a full sized laptop. It doesnt have a beefy processor, it doesnt have parts that can be changed out. However the good new is that this can do what 80% of the population does with a computer. Watch videos and surf the web. This laptop is fine for all of that. It can surf the web and load up pages very fast thanks to the SSD inside.<br/><br/>That just means the hard drive is all digital. No moving parts. So its faster then a regular hard drive... It was quick and painless. Boot up time takes around less then 1 minute. The 2 gb for memory might seem tiny however this is a budget computer after all. Windows 8 does run fine on 2gb it can in theory run on as little as 1gb. Also you cannot add more memory to the computer. So yes it does load up web sites fast and does stream video very good. All of the trial ware and other non essential stuff was taken out. The DTS control panel for sound adjustment , the backup storage unit I disabled. You can look at some of the other reviews to see what to remove. The hard drive is small 16 gigs left over the for the user. Its go an Micro sd card reader if you need more space.<br/><br/>I did change a few things. I hate Metro. So I downloaded and installed Classic Shell. Its a free program that allows you to make windows 8 more like windows 7. Its super easy to install and to use. So I never have to see Metro again. They got rid of gadgets for windows 8 desktop. Must use Metro the easy way to get around this is to use Rainmeter. Another free program. A little bit harder to use then Classic Shell but does give you CPU and ram usage and its free. You have to unload the Welcome Screen after you set it up. So I have it up and running and have used the Pogo game site online to try it out. Worked just fine.  The speakers are plenty loud but dont have any bass. So they do sound kind of tinny.<br/><br/>The screen is a little dim for my liking I wish it was a little brighter. Not terrible just not great. The graphics card is not going to allow you to play any demanding games. Indie games and older games should play fine. The mouse pad is very so-so. Sometimes it will play nice and other times it goes nuts. Mostly has to do with the right clicks and left clicks not being recognized sometimes. So copy and paste can be frustrating. Although the more I played around with it the better it got. I still am not thrilled by it. It feels very flimsy and makes a hollow sound when I tap on it. Better off getting a wireless mouse. Useable not great.<br/><br/>The computer feels very light and is super quite as it has no fan. I never felt much heat from it. No DVD drive. You could hook up an external one for very little money. If you needed too. I like the color and the keys. In the picture it look a little like a play toy. I think it looks better in person. I paid $200 dollars and that price feels like a good deal. Mine also came with Office 365 for one year and a xbox360 gift card that you have to redeem online only. They give you a booklet with a web site address that you need to fill out.<br/><br/>Overall I am very pleased. Its fast enough to be the go to computer if your on vacation and just want to surf the web and watch some videos without the need of a power cord for several hours. Also for those that need office try to use open office its free and works fairly well. Well thats it for now. May post more if I have issues with the computer.
Faster than expected on the mundane applications that I usually use.  A little heavier than ideal.  Decent but not great screen due to being somewhat dull in brightness.  Overall I am very satisfied with this.  Unlike some people, I really like Windows 8.1 because it is a truly complete OS.
Wow this computer. I have a chromebook acer 11 and this is very comparable. About the same price for both and they are about the same speed for firing up webpages. They are the same except the gaming experience. I can't load games on my chromebook except those made for the web games which have there place but are really not my thing. I wanted to play Second Life and this actually worked. Second Life is worse than Minecraft for how much resources it uses but this actually loaded the graphics fine. It wasn't spectacular but what can you expect. I also love the pink color I got. The materials don't feel cheap at all. My only big complaint is the trackpad. It is awful awful awful. I had to go in and change the settings and that helped a little but it is just not that responsive and I have had it fail to click on what I want. This computer would be absolutely perfect if the trackpad was as good as my chromebooks. My chromebooks trackpad almost feels like a macbooks. I don't know what this one feels like but I don't like it. Maybe it will just take time to get use to. I'm still giving this a 5 though because I feel for the price that they  did an exceptional job. I have an HP envy as well and I have nothing but good things to say about that one too. This did come with a lot of bloatware but that was easy enough to fix.<br/><br/>Update: On further testing I think I over-exaggerated the problem with the trackpad. Maybe just one 'awful' was need haha. I think it's just the smallness of it that makes it hard to get use to but once I got use to it it works fine. I was just not pressing hard enough for it to register my clicks. Once I started pressing hard enough I never had a failed click.<br/><br/>Update 2: I wish my upgrade to Windows 10 had been smoother on this device. I lost all track pad function and had to hunt down the drivers. That said, my device runs a lot faster (amazingly fast actually) and the track pad is a lot more responsive. The track pad is amazing now. I prefer the Windows 10 update to 8.1. It is more streamlined. If you upgrade this please go to the HP support site and update your drivers otherwise you will have problems with your speakers. There was crackling sounds before I updated all the drivers. It's a better machine now with Windows 10 definitely.
Up till now I love it. I have had it for a week now. It arrived on time. I love the color but thinking about getting a decal skin. I am a student and don't play games on this one. It works for me. Very convenient and light to carry around. Typing on this one feels great. I wasn't sure whether to get the 11'6'' or 13'' and went to bestbuy to look at the computer sizes before I decided. I was worried it might be too small for me but then I saw a Samsung chromebook of exactly the same size. Slightly cuter and more expensive with similar indexes like screen resolution. I loved the smaller size and bought this one right away. The apps are running nicely. Granted apps in windows store are not as many as those in apple but I intended to use this one for basics only anyway. So far it served me well.<br/>Screen resolution is okay. I wish the screen light could go up more. It feels a little dim for me, especially when I am sitting outside under the sun (can barely read the screen). Battery is great. I didn't time it but it can definitely withstand more than 4 hours of continuous working (I think it should hold up to 7hours as it promised, but probably not with playing videos).<br/>This is one of the best choices under a budget. Does everything I need. Windows system runs on some special gestures over the touch pad like double finger scroll, one finger swipe to another app etc... Anyway, great buy. I either buy things on impulse(decide within two minutes) or extremely indecisively. I looked up on Amazon for quite a while for a cheap pc with nice reviews before I chose this one. I also looked on youtube about this one. There are quite a few good demonstrations.
Great little laptop. I use to to power my TV. Cancelled the Comcast and use high speed internet to stream everything. A lot cheaper than paying Comcast. This is the way computers are going - apps, no hard drive, no fan, and HDMI. Buy a 1 TB HD to store you pics and files or use cloud. HP sells apps but there are enough that are free.<br/><br/>Here are my positive:<br/>1) light weight<br/>2) metallic frame instead of plastic<br/>3) 32 GB flash RAM<br/>4) one HDMI port - full size and two USB ports<br/>5) battery life is very long - I've had the pc on for 5 hours continuously and still have 45% batter life on this new laptop<br/>6) $199 and free shipping for Stream 11.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>1) comes in either swimming pool  blue or pink<br/>2) the cursor device is not as sensitive as it should be. Sometimes when I try to move the cursor (can't remember the name of the device you put your finger on to move the cursor), the cursor does not move.<br/>3) The lettering on the keyboard should be a bit bitter or bolder - would make for easier reading.<br/>4) Cannot figure out how to delete Microsoft Internet Explorer. I'm using Chrome and since there is only 32G of flash I want to delete IE. Haven't figured it out because the program is not on the control panel.<br/><br/>Neutrals:<br/>1) the speakers are adequate. There is one combo speaker/mic jack.<br/>2) USB ports and HDMI port are all on the same side<br/>3) one year Office 365.<br/>4) too many useless apps - took me some time to figure out how to delete them only because I'm not used to Windows 8
I love this laptop. I am in the military and doing online college classes. We do a lot of field training and this is where I need a lightweight and a productive laptop. I own a Samsung Chromebook but Windows does great things with MS OFFICE, better than everybody else.
Wow! I'm impressed! I bought this for my daughter for school work. Based upon the hardware in the laptop, (Dual-core Celeron® N2840, 2GB of RAM, 32 GB SSD, and Windows 8.1) I was not expecting much. My phone has more RAM! It is a very low-end system, with very low expectations. I would have been happy if web pages opened within a minute. Or if switching from one application to another took a while.<br/><br/>Am I so glad to be wrong. The system is surprisingly snappy! Office 365 applications open about as fast as more powerful systems. (I have an Intel i5-4670 with 20GB of RAM with a Samsung Evo 840 250GB hard drive for comparison.) Websites open quickly as well. Boot up time, logging in, opening the Start menu were all faster than expected.<br/><br/>I didn't want to spend money on McAfee antivirus, so that was uninstalled and I'm currently trying Avira Antivirus. It hasn't slowed the system at all. I'm blocking unwanted ads, which helps keep the laptop running smoothly on the web. My daughter's gaming websites run fine as well! (Bonus!) For more testing, Netflix streams fine, as does Hulu and Amazon Prime. iTunes also installed fine. (For more storage for iTunes, I added a fast 32GB MicroSD card.)<br/><br/>Other thoughts:<br/>Wireless connectivity is 2.4GHz channel only. (No 5Ghz support here.) The screen is not a touch-screen, which is not a deal-breaker for me. The laptop will not be used for graphics design or 3D gaming. But for what it is used for, Office 365 and general web browsing, occasional streaming and syncing iTunes, it's more than perfect!
OMG this pink laptop is great, smooth, lightweight, small but not too small, fast, easy touch keys, nice touchpad response and the free software for 1 year doesn't hurt either.  The new OFFICE software takes a little bit to figure out but I am sure will some day.  ;-)
Love it. I have a desk top also that has 6GB of RAM as well as 2.5GHz processor. The down grade in memory is completely noticeable, however, it isn't bad.<br/>it is only bad when youre trying to watch a video and do something else as well, or have a lot of apps/pages open. however, if you a lil more patient than with most things youre probably used to...its a great laptop. i love it. Plus it is a GREAT deal.<br/>The blue....well its B L U E lol
I just got this laptop a few days ago and I'm pretty much blown away with it. 200-250 is dirt cheap for something this quality. I was a little concerned about the hard drive size (32 GB) and the ram (2 GB), but it really handles lightweight applications like Office, chrome, and spotify like a boss, even when I'm running them all simultaneously. I'm surprised with how much it can do with such meager-sounding specs. Battery on it is phenomenal, probably mostly due to the fact that the Intel Celeron is so efficient. Really, the Celeron processor is the unsung hero here. It's the slowest line Intel makes, but it still performs quite well. Its a dual-core, which is enough for lightweight applications. The Solid State hard drive is really a selling point. It won't hold much, but it's really fast, reliable, and durable when it comes to drops and bangs. That's really important for a portable laptop like this. As for the RAM, it's at about 90% usage when I have quite a few apps open, which is pushing it, but i've yet to see it max out. There's no vents on the bottom, but it doesn't seem to need the cooling anyways, plus cooling fans just use up more battery anyways. As for gaming, if you want to do anything other than angry birds and other 2d games, forget it. Bottom line is, if you want to do everyday tasks, but you don't want to be confined to doing everything through a browser (like a chromebook), and you want a full-blown Windows 8 OS that's portable, cheap, and reliable, you should get this. ﻿
An amazing deal for less than $200.  I bought this so one of the kids can carry a laptop to school in a book bag. The year of office was a huge bonus.  Overall, it is a fairly slow computer but can handle real tasks lie, the web, email, school materials and office. Windows 8 plays very well with the home network, finds printers and auto installs drivers.<br/><br/>The physical construction is very durable and seems more expensive. The cheap price shows on the screen that offers fairly modest contrast and the webcams is bottom of the line. Sound is pretty good. I'm glad this uses a barrel jack for charging instead of the vulnerable micro USB that many cheaper units employ. Excellent keyboard.
I didn't buy my Stream 11 from Amazon. I bought it from Microsoft so it didn't come with bloat-wares. The laptop is 100% clean. I didn't have to remove anything. Just started it up and everything began working smoothly. As a writer, this laptop is perfect for me. It came with one year of Office 365 for free which is a Christmas present for a writer like me. The laptop itself suits all my needs. Web browsing is lighting-speed. In my opinion, the screen is beautiful. The battery lasts between 5-6 hours with a moderate usage.<br/><br/>I've heard some people complain about the trackpad. The trackpad is totally fine. You just need to get to know it. To perform a left-click, simply touch the trackpad and quickly release your finger. To move the pointer, touch the trackpad and hold your finger on it for about half a second, then move your finger to move the pointer. If you touch the trackpad and move your finger almost as the same time, the system will register your gesture as a swipe. To perform a right click, touch two fingers on the trackpad at the same time. To scroll down, swipe two fingers up. To scroll up, swipe two fingers down. Very easy, you just have to learn to use it.<br/><br/>Performance. If you're a gamer or a photo-editor, this laptop is not for you. But if you are a college student or someone who needs a laptop for only web browsing and document typing. This laptop is perfect for you.
There is honestly so much that can be said about a computer. With so much that you can download from games, to music and all of your media, it seems like we are relying on placing them into clouds to make sure they are much more secure and safe whenever our computers do get hacked. With so many people relying on smartphones, and tablets to get their internet everyday, it seems like people do want other obligations. HP has seen that, with the success of the newer version of Windows, it has became more of a must. HP has seen the gamble Google has done brilliantly with their new Chromebooks, and the chrome operating system. This laptop is geared more so you can surf the web, and store all your data with MS One Drive Cloud storage. Yet, you would have to have MS Office 365 as more of a must, if you want to own this laptop, and subscribe to its service. Still, it is very dynamic, and works very well. Yet, I do wish it had better anti-virus like the Google Chromebooks do, but you do get a lot done for its money.From good use of the Microsoft Windows 8, and you can stream well movies and content from the web. If you really want a good obligation for a computer, yet you do not want a Surface tablet, than I do suggest you give this a shot.<br/><br/>Price: B<br/><br/>Convenience:  B-<br/><br/>Overall: B 1/2-
I got this little laptop for my 13 yr old son after reading several positive reviews. I was not a fan of HP and Intel Celeron Processors but the positive reviews made me give it a try. I have to admit that I'm totally satisfied with the purchase. I read the review from 'formortals" and spent the 1st 45 minits uninstalling the HP, Cisco and Realtek bloatware. I did keep the HP system restore utility just in case I have to reset the machine in the future. Also got a sandisk 32 gig micro SD card to expand memory.  Now for the actual laptop review. This machine is built very well. Looks cute, slim, sturdy and is very light. It runs very smooth & snappy, I've so far not experienced any lag due to a sub par 2 gig RAM. You tube videos run flawlessly at 720p. Some Microsoft store games like Jetpack Joyride run flawlessly without any lag. Boots up really fast. Came with Office 365 for one year and a $25 app store credit that you can claim from www.microsoft.com/hpstream. My son absolutely loves this machine, he doesn't like the trackpad too much but he has a Bluetooth mouse that connects and works well this machine.  If you're looking for a budget laptop for travelling or for your kids to do school work, you will certainly not be disappointed with this laptop.
Disclaimer: I'm reviewing the linux installation (not dual boot - only linux).<br/><br/>On paper, this is the perfect laptop to install linux on. In practice - it's quite complicated to actually install (I only managed with Mint 17.1. Ubuntu itself and Mint 17 didn't work). It seems that microsoft really tried to make it hard to change OS on this device.<br/><br/>Even after installation - the wifi card seems to be one that Linux doesn't really support, so I'm still having trouble there and need to reset the connection once in a (long) while.<br/><br/>If you want it as a linux machine - it's possible, but I'd choose a different machine. Had I known about it then - I probably would have bought the dell inspiron 15 3000 ubuntu edition ($250 from the dell website, comes with ubuntu preinstalled, has 4GB memory and 500GB hard drive).<br/><br/>Unfortunatly - Amazon doesn't sell it. I would link the dell website, but I don't know if it's allowed.<br/><br/>--------------<br/><br/>About the laptop itself: Light weight. Very sexy. Good keyboard.<br/><br/>However, there is an annoying thing where the "F1...F12" keys need a modifier to use (except F5). By default those buttons are the media buttons (volume up/down, mute, etc. F12 is actually the flight mode button - so pressing it accidentally turns off wifi)
I've had this 13" Stream for about 6 weeks now and it is super.  In early April, I did a lot of research over several intense days including some in-store looks for some of my initial online selections.  I narrowed things down to Acer and HP and 13" minimum with HDMI port.  Ultimately I went with the better rated processor here on the HP Stream after researching that angle (Intel Celeron N2480 here v. others' AMD and others' 'lower' Intel processors).  Plus I just got a really bad vibe from Acer based on Amazon user reviews and elsewhere tech reviews.  This is a really strong notebook for the price.  As its name implies, I stream.  And it streams well with very strong resolution.  So strong that I did not really need to hook it up my tabletop flat screen uber HD TV using the HDMI port.  The only drawback is the built in touch pad and it's a bit of an uncontrollable mess (previous HP laptop did not have this issue at all).  Wireless mouse easily and readily fixes touch pad slop.  This notebook has a really nice keypad, looks sharp, is technically competent, is highly portable, and satisfies my needs hands down.  I did purchase from HP directly at same price here; had a miscellaneous, minor credit to use with HP.
I am so happy with this laptop! I bought it a little over 5 months ago and I really love it. I have only two drawbacks: 1. the low memory. So much crapware on here!! But I solved this by deleting all the nonsense and buying a little usb flashdrive that stays plugged into the laptop and expands the memory! I bought mine on here and you can choose whichever one you want based on how much memory you need. 2. when watching a video in full screen mode it may skip every now and then. Nothing major just maybe a little skip or so it's hardly noticeable, but can be a pain sometimes. Other than that this laptop is perfect for college students. I take it to class every day and people comment on it saying how cute it is. It's often mistaken for a MacBook which I laugh at because this is a steal! Also the laptop is very light, it's really easy to carry around in my backpack or just holding it in my arms. I did a lot of research before by this and I was worried at first, but this was the best investment I've made. It runs like a champ and does everything I need. Plus as a college student One Year free Microsoft Office subscription is a life saver! Highly recommend to anyone that needs a relatively cheap laptop for little purposes.
Purchased this laptop as new but without original packaging. And included oem charger only ( $ 114.00 )  Processor/ ram combo is pretty good for a<br/>200.00 price point, but the 32g flash storage is inadequate . Only had 1.9g of space when I opened it.. Installed newest  windows updates left only 820mb  Removed all unneeded programs from HP and Mircosoft office. Got message 30 days free ( means used ) Mcafee  security used Windows Defender and unwanted apps added firefox and vlc media ran disk cleanup back to 1.8g of space . why D disk is 15g with 1.2g installed is a waste<br/>of valuable space. Will copy D to usb drive and try to delete with hope C will expand to unassigned space. Or buy a external SSD drive not HDD<br/>the SD slot is for files only. Great running computer loads in 30 seconds or less and pages open in a click . STORAGE IS THE PROBLEM !  Still very happy with a full 8.1 OS . And with Windows X coming I can use it before I update my main computer running W7. MY take 2 days in .<br/>DAY 3 loaded HBOGO and a USB flash w/video  Both streaming very good HBO had a slight lag at start but runs smoothly within a minute ..<br/><br/> ran disk cleanup
Just received my HP Stream 11.6" Laptop today.. I'm looking forward for it to goes very well but by the look of some negative reviews from other people probably done something wrong with theirs
This is a handy extra laptop. While it isn't great, the HP Stream 11.6-Inch Laptop (Intel Celeron, 2 GB RAM, 32 GB SSD, Cobalt Blue), will be a sturdy addition to your home.<br/><br/>Essentially, it feels like a toy. I mean that in the best way. It is colorful and feels less dainty than my other laptop (a medium-end Windows-based product). As it is much smaller, and because the price-point is low, it is easy to grab-and-go into meetings.<br/><br/>It is all in there, everything you expect in a Windows machine. That's a plus. The downside is the hardware. The thing is slow, the resolution is weak and the keyboard feels awkward. Granted, because the it is smaller, the keyboard is also smaller, but it is difficult to get used to.<br/><br/>I like it as an extra computer on which I don't store anything like photos or documents. It is excellent as a way to Skype, YouTube and Netflix, as well as some insignificant surfing. Bring it to the beach without worry.<br/><br/>Don't think of this as a laptop, but as more of a tablet (minus the ability to use a touch screen).<br/><br/>--Brockeim
I purchased this laptop on Thanksgiving 2014. It arrived after 4 days, i opened it, i was amazed by the color "HORIZON BLUE" its added a perfect look on the laptop with HP logo. So, i cleaned up junk softwares and installed some which i use like Mozilla, chrome, CCleaner and registered the copy of office 365 which comes along with the laptop. First day i Completed my 25 pages project report and experienced that keys are quite good to use and one can type comfortably on this 13.3 inch laptop. I have just ordered Samsung EVO 64 GB Micro SSD which can add more space on to my laptop.  As i am student so need the light weight laptop to carry on different place. This laptop solve my every purpose in addition MS Office 365 and 1 Tb of One drive add value to this. Since this is small laptop it's not recommended for modern days gaming purpose as i am also gamer, though i have lenovo Y 50 for gaming but it's heavy so can't take it everywhere with me..<br/>In short, Worth buying if you are student and want light weight laptop at cheap price of around $200. Highly recommended ..
I picked this up from another store recently after my Asus laptop died from a horrible meeting with a beer. Do not drink and laptop people. So anyway, I wanted to find something affordable to replace it that wasn't a clunky black dinosaur. Saw this sleek little guy and was sold. Color played a huge part in my decision, I'll admit. But hey, for $199, it gets the job done. I use my laptop for banking/bill pay, social media, researching stuff, streaming to my TV, etc., nothing too crazy, and it's pretty flawless. My old laptop was a touch screen and it's taking me some time to get used to not having that, but this laptop is fast and hasn't given me any trouble at all where as my old one could be a bit glitchy (and it was twice as much). It was super fast and easy to set up and I loved how it immediately pulled up my settings from my old laptop as well as my wireless printer. It plays youtube videos perfectly. I'm sure this isn't the most helpful review for you techie people, but for those who want a solid little computer for light daily use, this is perfect.
Four stars means I like it for $199 - with one warning/thing to know.  I bought this laptop because I wanted something that I could surf the internet while watching TV, write in Word documents, and something small and light that I could travel with.  We're usually a MAC household, and use a mac laptop for work (usually), and have IMACs at home - so when I bought this - was instantly reminded of how riddled with viruses/malware PCs are.  I was shocked a bit - that OUT OF THE BOX - the laptop has tons of adware, viruses that slow usage.  There also seems there's a ton of junk that HP/Windows has pre-installed that are just ads/useless commerical ads.  McAfee isn't much help - so recommend highly instantly spending $25 and getting some other malware advanced to clean it up.  Also had to spend a couple hours uninstalling unneeded programs that were slowing it down.  There's not much disk-space so every bit helps<br/><br/>On the plus side.  It does what I needed, it's very very light, and good size. and the battery last a very long time
Had this little pc for a few days now and it's perfect for what I need it for. We have a Dell that's gotten pretty slow but useable, my husband got me this one to use for my youtube videos/my daughter's youtube videos, and basic facebook, email, banking, browsing, shopping, things like that. I used my smartphone as well but sometimes I just prefer the bigger screen and he's been using the dell for his class. The touchpad is a little too touchy and sometimes will zoom out of a webpage if I touch it wrong but its a quick fix on the settings icon. The touchpad took some getting used to and i'm sure i'll master it more as time goes on, but overall this is a great little PC for the basic internet needs. Light, cute, speedy, no lagging on my videos, not much space but I don't plan on adding too much on it anyways. Can always put photos in the cloud storage. There's no disk drive which is a little disappointing but for the price it gets the job done. I did purchase a replacement plan in case of any issues which I do recommend.
I just bought my nephew who is going to college an HP Stream 13 for $230. Beautiful and powerful computer, but it took me 90 minutes to remove all the stickers and all the crapware & adware. I still need to offload the recovery partition to a flash disk to recover the SSD storage. It has a total of 32 GB SSD storage so every bit counts. I'm also waiting for a 64 GB MicroSD card http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IVPU7AO so I can expand the storage.<br/><br/>Removing the crapware and adware took 2 hours plus another hour to install Windows update. I removed all the browser extensions and add-ons in IE and then installed Chrome. Then I installed CCleaner and removed McAfee anti-virus so that I can just use the free Microsoft AV. Also removed a bunch of bloatware like Cisco wireless networking utilities like LEAP and Apple Bonjour. Removed the Realtek card reader software since it slows the card reader down. Then downloaded fresh Realtek card reader driver and manually installed the driver without us... Read more
My son was wanting a new laptop and after checking out a few online he decided he wanted us to buy him this HP Stream. We ordered the Magenta colored one for him and the color is really pretty. It comes with Windows 8.1, has 32GB of storage and 2 GB memory, which was just fine for him since he is just using it for stuff like Facebook. If he decides  he needs more space there is a spot for an SD card.  The screen is 11.6 in. and the laptop weighs a little over 2 lbs.  so he can take it wherever he goes. One thing we did not realize until he received it is that it does not have a CD drive.  The keyboard and mouse are easy to use and he hasn't had a problem with them sticking at all. Sometimes it does take some time to get things to load correctly but then again that is to be expected with a cheaper laptop.  He uses it a lot so he really likes that he can be on it for 7 or 8 hours before he needs to charge it. He has had it for a few months and is really glad that he decided to have us buy this one for him.
Love it so far. It's perfect for casual web browsing. I bought an external hard drive for more memory because it's only 2g. Camera is eh, but I honestly wont be it except for Skyping. It's light and thin and the blue is a lot prettier in person (I was nervous ordering!)
Got this for my son for Christmas.  He's a little rough on things and this computer appears sturdy enough and hopefully up for a challenge.  The size is great as well.
Absolutely hated the whole thing. Upon booting, you're forced to create a Microsoft email account and enter your address and contact information before getting to the desktop. At some point I was also forced to use a Credit Card, although I can't remember exactly what it was for; It took days to personalize b/c this laptop didn't allow a simple change of Font (the slider is grayed out so you must guess what size you want everything to be and reboot the laptop each time you choose a number over 100...140 magnification worked for me after several attempts); it would perform updates and restart randomly even though I set it to Notify me first (while I was in the middle of class taking notes, no less); the HDMI out was permanently set to Center Display so the screen size on a 55inch Vizio was only about 37 inches AND it would not allow you to change to Full screen b/c there wasn't any other option available on the drop down menu (I tried this on multiple TV's of different sizes and even adjusted the screen resolution on the laptop, but still only Center Display was available and the screen size was a fraction of the TV); it wouldn't allow me to resize windows that were larger than the screen (VLC media player/Spotify/Chrome) so , for example, when I made an adjustment to the VLC media player I couldn't click Apply or OK to save the changes b/c the options were below the bottom of the screen and I wasn't able to resize the window or scroll down to see them; Spotify was missing the Equalizer that my Samsung Note 8.0, desktop, and iPhone all have, and the laptop doesn't have an equalizer of its own, either; the track pad was finicky with resizing, left/right clicking and scrolling (I ended using the Logitech M215 to make things easier); and last but not least, the screen viewing angle and clarity was horrendous in broad daylight. I am a full time health student w/tons of homework, papers, and studying to do, and sometimes you want to escape the classroom/library to sit outside to work. I could barely see my screen and max brightness<br/>and unless I was directly in front of it, I couldn't see anything on the screen. PLUS, a classmate who bought the same laptop had the same troubles and then some (she had issues w/pop ups and spam even though it was only hours out of the box). This might be an excellent laptop for an 8th grader or computer novice, but at the collegiate level this is a piece of junk that I highly recommend staying away from. You'll want to spend a little more cash for something with more than 2.16Ghz, 2Gb SDRAM and 32 gigs of storage. I returned mine before 30 days and AMAZON was gracious enough to refund me within hours of them receiving it. PS...I LOVE AMAZON PRIME and STUDENT!
Prefect for what I needed it for. I needed a laptop to take notes in class and portable enough to take wherever I might need it. This little laptop does the trick. The small size allows for easy transfer and at only 3lbs isn't cumbersome at all. There is a lot of junk apps and software, but they can be removed, and the Office 365 makes it really worth it if you need applications like Word, Power Point and Excel.<br/><br/>Other than the junk apps the only thing that brings the rating down for me is that the touch pad is awful compared to ever laptop I have used before. I don't know what it is but it just doesn't seem to respond how I want it to. Maybe it will just take more time to get used to, but I have seen other reviews on here that have similar complaints. That and Windows 8 takes some getting used to.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a laptop and the primary use is for surfing the web, and/or needing something to travel and work on this laptop is prefect and at a good price.
I have been looking for a Windows based "Chromebook Killer" laptop for awhile, but I can honestly say this computer is not it. Even though it is well made and has some inciting benefits, it is frustratingly slow as compared to my Acer C720 Chromebook. Videos stammer, webpage loading is slow - it is just not a very fast machine. I have since returned this product and during my quest I have come across the Asus X205TA. So far it has been a very pleasant surprise. It awakens from sleep incredibly fast, battery charge last forever, very light weight, better screen, and great price. The Asus uses a quad core processor vs a dual core and this really seems to help. It does have a few Chromebook limitations (lags while watching videos using chromecast in the chrome browser), but for me, the Window benefits outweigh the losses. If you are looking for a Windows based laptop that meets a Chromebook price point and speed, the Asus will get you closer - not the HP Stream 11.
I wanted a small laptop for the occasional trip. I considered a chromebook but I felt more comfortable with a window laptop for a few dollars more. After I got it I upgraded to window 10 which went pretty smoothly. You need to erase the windows 8 back-up because if you don't you will have next to no storage space left.<br/>I like the size and the battery life. I also like that it has no fans and that the hard drive is a solid state.<br/>I don't like that it doesn't have a left click or a right click button. The mouse pad is a giant left click button but in order to right click you have to use some sort of finger combination that I can't seem to get to work right. The mouse setting seem limited. I wish there was a way to turn the sides of the mouse pad into a scroll areas. I wish there was a way to reverse the scrolling gesture.<br/>I wouldn't want this as a primary laptop but for the occasional use it will work perfectly. Its a good travel size.
This laptop is great for people who simply want something lightweight for browsing, documents and light media. If you're looking to use this for gaming, it's definitely out of the question unless it's casual (emulated/snes/etc).<br/><br/>Pros<br/>-lightweight<br/>-virtually noiseless<br/>-SSD provides fast boot times and overall solid performance<br/>-Feels sturdy and looks neat<br/>-Battery life is really good, although it would be affected differently under various situations. (utilizing for browsing and docs, about 6 hours)<br/><br/>Cons<br/>-Can't add more RAM<br/>-Additional software installed is CPU heavy (you can remove it if you like)<br/>-Pricing was a bit steep considering I could have gone with a full sized laptop for practically the same cost ($250 at time of purchase)<br/><br/>Overall it's a great laptop if you're using if for work and want something really light to carry around.
First impressions. HP tech support was rude, impatient, and not helpful at all when I called for help to unload all the garbage that kept making it crash. That being said this computer is a good word processor which is what I bought it for. Pros: Cute, lightweight, the battery lasts forever. Cons: So full of garbage and crapware I spend all my online time backing out of ads and closing windows. I don't even go online with it anymore. Not worth the aggravation. I've had it a month and haven't had 24 hours to get rid of everything that is slowing it down. Haven't even uploaded email yet. It's rather cheaply made. No bells & whistles. I keep uninstalling the same garbage. But it's lightweight enough to take anywhere for word processing. Maybe if I'm ever stranded on a desert island with absolutely nothing else to do, I'll get around to utilizing its other features the rest of you seem to enjoy.
Not entirely sure what I was expecting for a $200 laptop but this is a little disappointing. I bought it in February and was happy with it, except for the awful windows 8 and all the bloatware that it came with, and now in July it's getting pretty annoying. The storage filled up very fast and even though it says 32gb the usable part is much less. I mostly only use it for internet and avoid saving things onto it and I'm already at 4.4gb free space.<br/><br/>I was hoping I'd be able to update it to Windows 10 when that came out but I never got the register button and it looks like this machine was specifically designed for Windows 8 which is a huge let down. It's a cute little computer if you don't need to do much on it other than maybe light internet (don't open too many tabs) and like, word documents or something else small. Wish I had looked around more before I bought this honestly.
This is the perfect laptop for students or working on the go.  It is not meant to run large programs or complicated games.  Given the choice between this HP Stream and a comparably priced Chromebook, I'd pick this hands down.<br/>You have the ability to install and run programs (ex. in my case Teamviewer could not be installed on my Chromebook).  Now I have complete access to my work computer when Im on the go.<br/>The size is perfect. Compact enough to comfortably carry but not too cramped to type or view the screen.<br/>The blue color is great. Very vibrant and easy to spot in a cluttered office.<br/>Web pages load quickly.<br/>Installation was quick. It is easy (yet somewhat time consuming) to customize the start screen and taskbars. A lot of unwanted stuff is there as default. Small complaint in the scheme of things.<br/>Overall would definitely recommend this laptop.
I LOVE this computer. It is light weight, feels and looks well made and sturdy and the color is not as obnoxious as I was worried it would be. I've only had it for about 3 days but so far the only trouble I've is that sometimes it thinks I am left clicking the mouse pad when I am trying to right click, but it isnt that often and doesnt take away from the effectiveness of this laptop.  The pre installed apps and programs only seems to take up about 20% of the space on my computer. Ive downloaded a few additional apps, like Facebook and Chrome and added about 150 digital photos and I am at the halfway mark of available memory, but for the low cost of this device I dont have a problem with using the cloud or buying a memory card. This computer runs just as fast as any I've had in the past and I am very happy with my purchase. It was worth every dollar!
I was very happy with my purchase.  It was delivered in a timely manner.  I have been busy using it and I'm glad over my decision to get it.
The HP Stream 11-r010nr 11.6-Inch Notebook (Intel Celeron Processor, 2GB RAM, 32 GB Hard Drive, Windows 10 Home 64- Bit), Cobalt Blue is an extremely light-weight, easily portable laptop.  It fits comfortably into a medium size purse or commuter bag and with a securely closing top, you don't need to worry that the unit is turning on/off (as I do with my IPad).<br/><br/>The installation process was quick and fairly intuitive, probably taking just under an hour to complete.<br/><br/>My only big issue is with the track pad.  At times it is very 'unresponsive' and other times is overly 'sensitive'.  After re-booting, it usually resets itself and works properly, but is extremely annoying to have to do when you're in the middle of typing.<br/><br/>The battery life is good and in general I am very happy with this laptop.
As a student, I need a portable computer for research, writing papers, and occasional music/ video consumption. When my 2009 Macbook Pro died on me, I didn't want to spend another $1000 on a new one, so I just decided to buy this computer to hold me over temporarily.<br/>Well, after using it for a month now, I am sure that I will be keeping this computer for a long time. Here's why:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Surprisingly snappy<br/>Office 365 for free<br/>Very portable<br/>Excellent battery life<br/>No fan. This computer is totally silent.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>32 GB of memory can be limiting. (this can be easily fixed with an SD card, which will sit nearly flush inside of the computer as semipermanent storage)<br/>2 GB of RAM means you need to be aware of how much you have open at once<br/>Track pad can be iffy
This is the perfect "moron computer" as my mom would call it. It's a pretty basic yet modern laptop without all the bells and whistles of some of the more newer laptops. I also tried searching for a laptop that didn't have a touch screen. This was a christmas gift for my mom and it certainly was the icing on the cake. It's perfect for browsing the internet (internet as in chrome because internet explorer blows), online shopping, Facebook, email, simple things like that, but definitely not for gaming which was EXACTLY what my mom was looking for. The speed is pretty good too. Also my mom really liked the color. Is it the best laptop? probably not. But it does the job and it was wallet friendly. Very pleased with this laptop and I hope my mom gets years of use from it.
I have brought this item about 3 times. My 14 year old daughter (Magenta) and my 12 year old son (Blue)It ran originally I brought it for them since they both needed for school and the entire MS Suite was a big plus in this purchase. Well the only problem we have faced was during the screen saver it will crash remove it off it will run just fine( I will remove all of the crapware that comes on it later) Big deal for my dollar my son was able to run Minecraft without any lagging. My daughter was able to be every social media site all at once with a video chat and worked perfectly. So today I brought myself one also now that the Magenta laptop is back in stock. Intended use for me will me emailing and Netflix, Youtube. On the go along with light document edits.
I LOVE the color and it is so lightweight.  Everything is perfect besides the fact that there is NO SPACE.  When I first turned it in there was only 9GB of space in the c drive so I couldn't even download windows ten.  It has alot of things in the c drive and  I don't know what I can  delete so I did the c drive cleaner thing and it went DOWN to 7 GB. After having it for a few days I deleted more things off the c drive and made sure not to accidently download anything and my space WHEN DOWN AGAIN to 6 GB. It went all the way down to 1 so I went crazy and deleted a bunch of stuff from the c drive and now I have 3. I don't know what is taking up the c drive but I'm not storing anything big on the laptop except documents so I guess it will be fine.
This is exactly what I needed. It is small, light, fast, doesn't have a fan and has great battery life. And the price is great. I have a chromebook also and it is great but I think I would pick this over a chromebook just because you can run windows software on it (Microsoft Office). It comes with a year of free Office but you can sell that on Ebay if you don't need it. Don't forget you can port office off of an old computer if you are switching over. You don't have to buy it all over again. You have to call Microsoft when you activate it and tell them you are moving it from a "dead" computer. FYI - I didn't buy this on Amazon. Microsoft Store was having an awesome year-end sale in 2014 so I bought it off of there for less.
I find this computer a really good value for its price. First of all, its bigger brother, the Stream 14, has the same screen resolution as the Stream 11 and is $100 more. The Stream 11 also has a better processor than does the 14 which allows it to handle everyday tasks better. I used the 14 and found that it is a bit slower than the 11. I also compared it to a Chromebook which has around the same specs.<br/><br/>For many people, the fact that Windows laptops can run desktop apps (and work fully offline) means they're inherently better than Chromebooks, regardless of the price. As a bonus, the Stream 11 actually costs less than most Chrome OS devices, which could make it a no-brainer for some shoppers. And there's definitely something to that: The Stream 11 is a full-fledged Windows machine, but it's also portable and inexpensive, with a comfortable keyboard, cute design and surprisingly good audio. Oh, and it comes with a $25 Windows Store gift card, which, depending on how you look at it, could knock the price down to $175. Either way, it's a good deal for the money.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean there aren't any trade-offs. The display quality is a step down from most Chromebooks. And although the Stream 11 has similar specs as a Chrome OS device, and costs about the same, there is a noticeable difference in performance: The battery life is shorter than on some competing models, and the boot-up time is slower too. That isn't necessarily a deal breaker, but I would encourage anyone considering this to adjust their expectations. Yes, you can do more with a miniature Windows laptop like this, but because of that, you also need more power for it to run smoothly. As it stands, the Stream 11 is usable, but in the way netbooks were usable, which is to say it can be a bit poky. Then again, for $200, you might be able to forgive that.<br/><br/>I have also tried some games on this including Minecraft. I had to adjust the settings to get better frame rates but it was smooth overall. I dont think that this will be able to handle games that are more graphic intensive than Minecraft.<br/><br/>I would suggest this laptop to so many people because not only can you run full Windows 8.1 on it but you can get it for the price of an Android tablet. I will be using this as my daily driver for the next couple of weeks to see how good it is.
I knew this wasn't going to be a powerhouse, but I really like the cheap price and that it's absolutely quiet.  It's a great laptop to bring around with me to work or on trips.  Even when hooked up to a 1080p monitor via HDMI, there is absolutely no slowdown when browsing the web or looking at high-resolution videos or using a word processor.<br/><br/>Battery life is 7-10 hours if being used inconsistently.  If you're at it the whole time, or watching a movie, I would guess 4-5 hours.  It's light, although there's chromebooks that are lighter.  The keyboard is easy to use, even with my large hands.  Trackpad is a little small but I'm not a fan in general.<br/><br/>Like other people are saying, the blue looks a lot better in person.  I still think it's weird they didn't release a white or black model, but no harm done.<br/><br/>The hard drive has about 17 gigs free when you first get started.  I don't think that'll be a problem, but if I want to store much music & video on the computer I'll have to use an SD card.<br/><br/>I knew this computer wouldn't work well for games, but I have a few Windows games in a Steam account and decided to give a try anyway.  The (very old) Civilization 3 works very well.  Civilization 5 works OK as long as every single slider is turned to the minimum.  Walking Dead 2 worked well at low resolutions.  The XCom demo was unplayable.<br/><br/>I know Windows 8/8.1 is the dead horse everybody keeps beating, let me join in on that.  I had never used it before - I thought Windows XP was great, but recently I've been using Mac or Linux.  The OS is technically refined and basically works well, but the person doing the design was kind of stupid.  Pressing the start menu button brings up what feels almost like a second, tablet-like operating system of cool looking boxes.  I suppose I could organize the cool looking boxes into a sort of start menu, but it's kind of a bother and I don't plan on using these special tabletized versions of apps.
The HP Stream 11 and 13 are very nice small low cost PCs. I bought the Stream 13 because of the bigger screen and the extra ports. Otherwise the two appear to be twins. The nice bonus is the Office 365 personal! It gives one license for the PC and 1 license for another phone or android device. At the same time I also acquired the ASUS X205TA model with similar price but quite different otherwise. The X205TA appears to be slightly better made and a lot smaller but does not have the Office 365 personal so the value proposition is quite a bit different ($69 for Office 365 Personal not being included).<br/><br/>Overall they are both real real nice PCs. The screen and keyboard are better on the ASUS and the CPU speed and value with Office are far better on the HP. The ASUS is also quite a bit smaller if you want a real small lightweight netbook. Other small differences on networking show the ASUS using the 5MHZ band and the HP using the 2.4. When applying fixes the HP kicked butt over the ASUS. Since these both have 32GB storage remember to use a cheap USB key to create a recovery partition and reclaim the 8 GB space. Also add a 64GB card to enhance memory.<br/><br/>And for those in the continuing battle between MS and Apple I also acquired a Mac Mini with Yosemite. I like both brands but given the current pricing and function Microsoft and Windows 8.1 wins easily. The Mac interface although pretty is still just a kludgy shell over Unix. Since I have been away from Mac for a long time I had to look everything up on Google. Not intuitive at all. I guess I have gotten used to the better aspects of Windows 8.1. I think most Mac users that like the Mac do not run many programs. Recently I have seen articles saying Apple never wants to merge the iOS and Mac platforms. They are aiming at their foot now because the Windows 8.1 form factors from phone to mega gaming rig are a huge advantage. From the tiny $99 units to the two $199 laptops above to Enterprise level units the experience is the same. Not to mention Apple stole the 8.1 tile interface made it round and called it the Apple watch.<br/><br/>What is Apple doing right? The Mini has a wonderful no cost Development environment that just about erases the value difference and a $19 server. Strange to see the two sides trade their advantages eh? MS getting more user friendly and Apple getting more developer friendly.<br/><br/>In summary you cannot go wrong. The HP Streams are neat, fast and cute while the ASUS X205 is tiny, precise and great to interact with the internet on. My main internet consumer to date has been a Nexus 7 with the latest android but the compatabily larger screen and small size of the ASUS will probably change that.<br/><br/>On Office 365 found one downside, you cannot have 2 licenses on the same user id. MS please fix. The workaround is to create 2 ids but then you lose the wonderful Homegroup support.
Nice little web browsing computer, tried to update it to Windows 10 but right out of the box there's not enough free space on the internal drive to do this, even after removing as many apps and programs as possible (the Windows 10 upgrade tool will NOT proceed if it does not have a certain amount of free space) I installed Linux Mint, wiping out Windows and now the drive is mostly empty, and that's including a full Libre Office suite installed. Now it can be upgraded in the future, is more secure for browsing and has a lot more room for storage, well 24GB anyway, but much better than about 8GB or so with Windows. There may be a way around the Windows upgrade issue but you still won't have as much free disk space as Linux.
Just got my Stream 13 in this morning and so far, I love it. I'm still in the process of cleaning up some disk space, but the fact that I can install applications on my SD card is extremely encouraging. I have a desktop as my primary with 8gb of ram, and the speed difference is noticeable but not terrible. The Stream seems to manage it's memory well as long as you don't have too many things open at once. Web browsing is as good as my desktop (using chrome for both) and the battery life is excellent. It charges very quickly, and I have been using it unplugged for almost 5 hours with a predicted 2.5 hours left of life. I tried to use in home streaming through Steam and that was less successful; STO was extremely slow even with my desktop doing most of the work. This was, however, expected with only 2gb of RAM. Typing is comfortable, though as others have mentioned, the travel time on the keys is pretty short, so that takes some getting used to. I have experienced no problems with the trackpad; it has been responsive, though I primarily use the tap rather than the click so that may be the difference. Also, even though there is no marking to indicate it, the bottom part of the pad is divided into right and left clicks, which is helpful. The screen, as mentioned before is not excellent, but it is certainly serviceable, and I have no issue with it. The overall build feels good. It's solid, but still light enough to not feel clunky.<br/><br/>If I have to offer one criticism, it's that it takes longer than I would expect to boot, though that may be more due to Windows still updating than anything else.<br/><br/> All in all, a very nice little computer. For what I paid, I can't see it being beat.
I was nervous about buying this because I thought any laptop that cost $200 was bound to be a little bit terrible, but I was extremely pleasantly surprised. It's very light, performs all the basic laptop functions very well, has excellent battery life, and I've had fewer weird software issues with it than I've had with some of my more expensive computers. Mind you, it's important to keep realistic expectations for a $200 computer. It's not exactly lightning fast, and it runs out of memory once in a while, which I'd almost forgotten was a thing. If it were my primary computer, I'd probably go insane. But for something I drag around to weird places for word processing and a bit of light browsing, it's great.
I got this laptop as a secondary one. I'm a HP fan and have a bigger touchscreen laptop that I do most of my work from. It has a nice little space in the kitchen and is happy there. I don't really like to move it from it's happy place. So when I saw this, I thought it would be perfect to take places and to have with me when I'm just browsing the web on the couch or in bed. It's a great laptop for the price and it fits perfectly in my lap. Also just in case anything happens to it, the fact that it is such a good price I wouldn't be devastated. This is also great for kids,if you don't want them on your computer. PLUS it's a really neat color.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this for any age group.
My Sony Viao died. I am awaiting a decision on whether the repairs will be covered under an extended warranty. In the interim I needed to have something that would get me by. At just a tad over $200 for the 13" HP Stream I was sold. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles, just something that is light and travels well. This laptop fit the bill. It was a breeze to throw in my carryon, and the battery had no problems lasting while we waited for our flights. I was a little concerned that we would have difficulty connecting to the free wifi at the airport or at the hotel, but no, it connected seamlessly. (wish I could say the same for the viao).<br/>I was extremely pleased with the ease of setup. It took no more than 15 minutes... apparently it can take all settings from another computer and place them on it. I have not redeemed the office 365 as of yet. I did redeem the $25 giftcard for apps, but am hesitant about adding too many incase the computer slows down.<br/>I am extremely pleased with my purchase. The colour is amazing. Merry Christmas to me!!!
I brought this because I needed to download a particular software on to it. It's not a bad little computer. If you're doing basic browsing this will cover you. I brought it for school. I needed to put iTunes on it to access my schools lectures and it works fine.<br/><br/>The cloud feature isn't bad. It can be a pain if the things you need to access are saved to the cloud and you don't have wifi. I've gotten used to saving things to a thumb drive and using that as my main storage device with my back up in the cloud.<br/><br/>The color is very vibrant. I've also haven't had any problems with touchpad sensitivity or wifi. I've had this laptop for a few months and still holding up. Love it.
I brought this laptop about 10 months ago when my other laptop broke unexpectedly. It was my second year in college and I started looking for a basic computer that I could write papers and do research on, nothing too complex. So while searching I found this computer for only $200 dollars. I was surprised because only chromebooks were that cheap and cute. I thought about getting a chromebook but was talked out of it. Many of my friends wanted me to get a macbook but I simply could not afford that. My price range was $500 dollars. I love windows and thought this would be the perfect computer for me. After doing research, I decided to buy this computer. It is the perfect size, its cute, and it does everything I need it to do. I felt I saved so much money since the other laptops I was looking at were all around $400 dollars and up. It doesn't hold much memory but I honestly don't need it to. AlI I do on my computer is my school work and simple social media. This laptop has not given me any problems so far. I love it and would  recommend it to others.
Great little back-up laptop for business trips. Yes the memory is not the greatest. Easily taken care of with a memory card. Also, had no problem downloading Windows 10. Just remember get rid of as many bloatware aps that come pre-loaded prior to attempting upgrade.<br/><br/>You should as try to keep everything on the memory card (which I highly recommend). Keeping programs and files off the C drive will make your laptop noticeably faster!<br/><br/>I travel quit a bit and am always being asked about this little machine.<br/><br/>The only negative was the "free" Amazon gift card that came with it. Totally worthless. Tried countless times to activate with no luck.
This is the best bang for your back. I kid you not.<br/><br/>What I love:<br/>Portability<br/>Size<br/>Weight!!  So light.<br/>Color<br/>Accessibility to everything because it is NOT a chromebook<br/>AMAZING battery life<br/>USB access<br/><br/>What I don't love<br/>Lack of memory or ability to expand<br/>Does lag if you have too many things going on<br/>The color and resolution is a little off buy nothing bad<br/><br/>I love this thing so much. It was the best decision I could have made as a student and full time worker. It allowed me to not have to lug around my expensive and heavy laptop. This is affordable (yay), and works so well.
I bought this laptop back in January and now, after only 3 months, the screen has gone black.  Very frustrating.  I  just loved it when I got it....the size is great, the screen resolution is fabulous, easy to maneuver throughout all the programs, speed was good, but all of sudden, I have no screen.  I am a Realtor so I wanted something portable that would support my needs and it surely did, for a while..... I am very disappointed, but Amazon is working with me to replace it so I am going to return it and try another one....just like it.... and see how it holds up.  If it happens again, I will not buy another HP laptop again.
Love, love, love this little guy!  Works beautifully and the size is perfect for curling up in a chair or on the couch to watch TV and still be able to keep this lightweight device on your lap or portable laptop desk.  Admittedly, I'm not a techy, so I really can't comment on performance for tasks other than the very basic, like emails and browsing around sites and stuff.  There's one thing I personally have a pet peeve about, I like when there's a CAPS ON light, and this one has it!  Small thing, I know, but for my particular use, it's easier for me to see that.  The color blows everyone away too!  You will like this!
I love it! So cute, lightweight, and fast! I use it for work since my company's IT is obsolete and super slow. It is small enough to carry in my bag for my commute on the train, so I can work on my way to and from work!  It allows me to do everything on Microsoft Office with ease so I can finish faster.  I save everything to Google Drive since the hard drive is small on this laptop, and so everything is available to me on all devices.  I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and removed all bloat ware prior to doing any thing else. Amazing computer at an unbelievable price!
I got the laptop today and it runs fine and all but when I try to redeem the gift card amount it says that you can get with these it says<br/>Not valid for the gift card offer<br/>Your PC does not qualify for this gift card offer because your Microsoft account is not registered in an eligible country or the device you are redeeming from is not a qualifying HP Stream.<br/>There is no reason it should be telling me this at all. Other than that which disappointed me the laptop seems perfectly fine for what I got it for which is for college use and regular browsing.
My mom got me this computer for school, and I absolutely love it! There are so many great features to it, and it just has so much to offer. The best part about it is the color. I think the color is so awesome, it just stands out in a crowd. Plus the year of OneDrive and Microsoft Office is a reeeeally nice touch. Its also super lightweight, which is nice for school. The keyboard is also super comfortable and easy to type on, as it is an island keyboard, which I swear on. Overall, one of the best computers I've had, and would recommend it to anyone.
This came in record time. I really needed a laptop as opposed to a chromebook because there are things I need to do that I can do on a chromebook. For the price, this really can't be beat. It was very easy to set up and there wasn't bloatware that needed to be removed.<br/><br/>It's a great choice for anyone wanting to use Microsoft office programs, write documents, and just browse on the internet. If you're a gamer I wouldn't recommend this, however it isn't advertised as one. It's a great laptop and the price is great for anyone on a budget,
Great computer but hardly any storage space on the actual computer. Plus the bare-bones programs that come with the OS (the "apps', which just seem to be shortcuts to websites and are frankly totally useless if you have a web browser) eat up a lot of space and you can't uninstall them easily. Like, there's an app on there for Amazon. I know how to get to Amazon, you don't need to take up 3mb just to put an "app" on there that takes me to Amazon. So yeah, get a hard disc or use iCloud or something if you have a lot of files to store.
For the price you really cant complain. I just recieved this in the mail and the ONLY problem I have with this laptop is the mouse pad. Holy smokes its soo inconsistent and sloppy. It tries to mimick the mousepad of the Apple Macbook but there is no comparison. I was a Mac user for many years and switched over to a PC and I have to say, the mouse is terrible. It confuses itself and clicks things I didn't even click. Again, you get what you pay for but HP couldve spent a little more time on better configuring the mousepad.
Prior to making buying this HP stream, I purchased this laptop here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNPD1VW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00FNPD1VW&linkCode;=as2&tag;=newcams-20&linkId;=KWUIT6CKWKJORYWA<br/><br/>It was a great laptop to use and to deal with most of my work. Unfortunately, it was not good to all of it. I wasn't allowed to use any of Microsoft software's which I needed for my work. So I had to type everything on Google docs and then when I got to work, I had to convert it to Word. It was a pain and I was getting sick of it. When I went to purchase a new laptop I had no idea what I wanted. I'm very picky. I think I made a great choice with this HP Stream and it is great for my daily work!<br/><br/>When I took this HP stream out of the box it was almost ready to use it right away, really easy to set up. The performance is pretty good; it isn't quite a desktop replacement, but it runs well. The keyboard is a good size (not to small in my opinion), the touchpad is pretty cool, and the screen is very sharp. I was really happy to see two full-size USB ports, SD Card Slot, and HDMI. Moreover, the sound is surprisingly good for something of this size. The laptop is also sturdy and feels very solid in your hands, yet it's light and just the perfect size to lug around in a backpack. The battery life has been decent and I’ve had no problems with Wi-Fi whatsoever. Performance is right where I'd expect with the resources available. You can get faster processors and more memory, but pay more. All in all, I'm VERY happy with this HP and would recommend it to everyone!
Love the color it's a transparency color :) hopefully it can support my essays 😂👌
I work from home and really love how light this laptop is.  It is really easy to just grab and go.  I am not a fan of Windows 8 (this is 8.1) but you can make your desktop look like XP or 7 desktops which I like.  It doesn't have much on board memory but again, I just use it for work so I don't need much.  It is fast and VERY quiet since there is no fan.  Even though it has no fan, it doesn't get hot like my other laptop.  For $200.00 I am very pleased.  I would highly recommend for a second/work computer.<br/><br/>Update 02-01-2015.  I am really liking the fact that I don't have to worry about this computer overheating.  My other laptop I have to have a cooling fan and it gets to hot to sit in my lap.  This one, I don't have to worry about that at all.<br/><br/>Update 4-10-2015  I liked it so much I bought a second one.
I've had it for 1 week and I love this little laptop. Goes w me everywhere. I download my power points and study virtually anywhere. The free 365 is awesome, makes it even more so worth the purchase. Don't complain about the lack of free space on this laptop. I bought an external hard drive and have a desktop computer for that as well. This lil laptop is strictly used for convenience for a college student that needs to study, take notes, view PowerPoints, send emails, things of that nature. 💗💞💻
Easily the worst laptop I've ever owned. Decent price, horrible performance. Windows 10 is absolute garbage, takes up so much space with all these apps no one cares about or even needs. Processor has a hard time balancing all the garbage that is pre installed on the laptop along with basic applications. First time buying an HP and most definitely my last. Rather spend an extra couple hundred bucks for a reliable laptop that can actually handle basic processes and uses, like Acer or ASUS.
Exactly what I needed. I store files virtually, so I didn't need a large internal drive. Very happy with the free 1TB of storage that came with this (plus I already have a Google Drive account). I needed something that I could work on (I use the Microsoft Office Suite for work, so having Office 365 free was a big bonus for me) and stream movies and TV in my spare time. And in less than a month it automatically updates to Windows 10 and I have plenty of room on the drive to do so.
There are a lot of thourough reviews so I won't go into much detail.<br/>PROS:<br/>Loud speakers<br/>Matte screen<br/>Nice color<br/>Decent keyboard<br/>Lightweight<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Getting used to windows 8<br/>Had to remove a bunch of stuff like mcafee and internet explorer<br/>Set up took a long time and I had to register a windows live email<br/><br/>So basically the computer is great, the price is great, the windows 8/live stuff is annoying but can be overcome
It is neat, organized, and I really liked the color. I am in high school, so this is perfect to do my homework.
Buyer beware.  Please note that this computer comes with a very small hard drive.  Once partitioned, and with the operating system installed on it, you will only have about 7GB of free space.  They advertise a free upgrade to windows 10.  This is not possible without extensive time spent at the computer.  When I tried to upgrade to Win10, I was told I needed 13Gb of free space to complete the download and install.  Space this computer just does not have.  Returned it.
Don't be fooled with 32GB storage. I bought 2 of this for my kids. After windows update etc., the 32GB storage size became 21.1GB. Don't know where the 10.9GB goes. With Windows/Anti-virus/etc, there is only 6GB left in the laptop and the message of low storage space keeps popping up. All documents/pictures/music are in 64GB UHS-1 SDXC Card (SanDisk) for documents/pictures/music. I wish HP is more transparent about the storage size.
I needed something affordable for class and learning excel and the fact this included the office for a year from was beyond perfect For 200 bucks I have a shocking pink lap top for all the needs I have honestly couldn't be happier but it's day 4 so we will see how it holds up! I have a protection system on it and I don't use it except for excel and papers and minor websearchs I don't use it for Facebook or Netflix although you can!
I purchased this for a small laptop for nursing school. Do not get it if you want to use it for videos, moving, gaming, etc. because this is a basic laptop. Highly recommended for school/work. Lightweight and easy to transport to class. Screen big enough to type and look at PowerPoint/lecture-information/e-textbooks at the same time. Fast enough to watch my small, short videos for class and work with my simulated-patients.
So pleasantly surprised by this laptop. Its excellent for the price. I am an adult student and it works perfectly for me!  People will tell you that you need something more powerful but no you don't. The average person is using their laptop to surf the web, shop, complete work or school projects and keep in touch with family and friends. This does the trick!  This was honestly one of the best purchases I've ever made!
At first this laptop thoroughly aggravated me. It felt like a quality piece despite its price but immediately filled up to the point that I had only 2GB of space left.  I ran a disk cleanup of system files and upgraded to windows 10 for free.  I now have windows 365 and 15GB of space.  It really runs well for a 200 dollar laptop.  For a casual user who is comfortable using cloud storage it's great.
Purchased this as an inexpensive labtop for someone attending college. Great Labtop for the price. If something happens to it I won't feel to bad unlike if something happens to a surface of Mac  Labtop. Not designed to be a gaming computer. Just a good labtop for word processing, MS excell PowerPoint and surfing the web. You might have to take some time to erase some of the pre installed programs.
We bought this for our 9 year old daughter for Christmas and it is perfect for her! We bought the pink one because everything in her room is pink. she's been able to do her own research, type her own research papers, watch Netflix, etc. It's lightweight( since she got it, she's been calling my HP Split "an extremely heavy laptop"). I'd say this is a gret laptop for children and teens.
Bought as a present for my wife who decided to go back to school. She loves it. Can use all her programs she needs for classes at one time ( excel, word, power point. She also use Viber and Skype. The only issue is it does not play media well ( 720p and 1080p ) and the speakers are not the best. Otherwise its a great product. Comes with Windows 8 which will upgrade to 10 for free.
I received my laptop yesterday! And I must say that it's definitely worth $200! It's everything the description said. It's compatible and lightweight. I have a big computer but it is so heavy and can't fit in my book-bag for college which is a hassle. I love my HP Stream. I got the Violet Purple which is my favorite color 😍 thank you so much Amazon! Y'all are the BEST!
The only issue I have had is with the HP updates.  For some reason the down load never works.  I have had to cancel out several times because after 3-4 hrs it was showing that it was downloading and it shouldn't be taking that long.  The download icon now continually has a "!" showing that I need to download the up dates.  I really do not know what to do
It is a basic laptop, nothing special and not for multitasking or doing hard work. Not for gaming unless you're playing basic games without a lot of graphics. Doesn't have CD/DVD ROM. All internal parts are welded, so they cannot be changed. It has Windows 8, which in my opinion is crap. Reproduces 720p video as much, but doesn't reproduces more than 30fps.
This little machine serves it's purpose, which is to schlep around with me for easy access to the www and my documents. The capacity is very small, so there is little room for customization. If you keep everything on the cloud then this netbook might work for you. It comes with a year of Office 365, which makes this a good deal.
So far so good, my boyfriend got me this for an early Christmas gift. Would recommend a wireless mouse but other than that everything seems to be great.  it is very lightweight so its great for on the go. I'll be using it mostly for school so ill update when i start to let you guys know how it does with all my school work on it.
Great product for a low price. There's a most helpful review posted with instructions on how to clean out the system of all the "gunk" and speed it up; recommend you follow those guidelines.<br/>Also install cc cleaner, you'll need ever bit of storage possible. I advise cleaning it once a week with cc cleaner.
Not sure what people are talking about for bloatware and track pad. Mine didn't come with really come with barely any bloatware. Mostly HP stuff. Also I found the track pad to be really nice. It doesn't register palms and does a nice job and gestures. Sometime you have to make the leap and decide for yourself.
wonderful and I got at black Friday price of 199.00...I removed most of the bloatware,  but I store almost everything in various clouds so that is not an issue..I use for work and it is great for travel and office is a great bonus...I love this computer and it is beautiful..you cannot beat it for the price!!
This computer is exactly what was advertise. A streamlined Windows 8.1 computer with cloud base storage. Microsoft Office free for a year is a great perk! It's not the fastest computer but I have had much slower. It is also very light weight and easy to carry around. For the money, this is a GREAT computer.
I bought this for my daughter I had it 1 1/2 months and it totally crashed. She was heart broken because she really liked it. My daughter is 16 and very careful with her stuff. I contacted HP they said it was a hardware problem. Now waiting to see if they will fix it nicely or do war games.
Classic shell and modify touchpad properties to stop the charms bar from popping up with swipe in, and this is a great laptop. Fast, screen is large enough and Win8 works well modified. White keyboard does get dirty quick, tho. Can't beat a great $200 laptop with Prime shipping.
Cool device for my daughter who needs a small laptop to take note while performing therapeutic treatment in patients' homes.<br/><br/>I set this device up for her... It is just a small but comfortable Windows 8 machine.  The keyboard is not too cramped (my hands are large).
First of all: this computer is NOT given enough brainpower to run the OS, let alone anything else! I can't even run pandora on it without major problems, and it won't run the version of MS Word IT COMES WITH. It hates firefox and even chrome runs slowly on it. And that touchpad! Ugh, gods save me from touchpads that are trying to be apple's single-click system. Gross! Don't get this! The only good thing about it is the monitor is super crisp and amazing and the machine doesn't overheat, but without any ability to add power or memory, you're better off using it as a super light satellite for only the most basic text editing or whatnot.<br/><br/>For reference, spouse and I both have one of these. This is what I ask my laptops to do:<br/><br/>1. Run pandora or 8tracks on a continuous basis (I need to listen to music all the time due to misphonia)<br/>2. Run MS Word<br/>3. Run firefox (I prefer firefox to chrome due to a wider range of accessibility apps)<br/>4. Run telegram (a light IM app)<br/><br/>Sometimes, I would like this laptop to run audacity, which it does if that's ALL I'm doing.<br/><br/>This is not a lot to ask a computer to do simultaneously, right? This lappy can just about manage to run telegram. It's *atrociously* slow. My spouse has fared better, and has managed to get his to run:<br/><br/>1. Chrome<br/>2. Telegram<br/>3. iTunes<br/>4. VLC media player<br/><br/>Not all at the same time, but in combinations of 1, 2, 3 or 1, 2, 4. He still fights with the damn thing on a daily basis, and comments that it is extremely slow, and very fussy.<br/><br/>In my mind? This computer *might* do better running a version of Linux, but as I'm not a supergeek programmer, that's not possible. HP 'stream'lined this machine TOO MUCH, and it's a waste of money, even though it's cheap. About the only thing going for it is that it's tinysmol and has a GREAT mic/speaker/sound system. If all I wanna do is record something on audacity, this is the machine I use.<br/><br/>What a waste of good hardware! It should have been made with more processing and memory capability, then it would have been able to take advantage of that sterling graphics and sound hardware!
This is a tiny, small inexpensive made portable demi-netbook, suitable for a child or someone whose computer needs are focused on internet activity or someone who doesn't have the money to purchase something more durable with a larger screen.  It came pre-loaded with windows 10, and full of software 'free for a while' that you will have to pay for after the subscription period ended. It is not super fast, but not super slow, although my 5 year old dell runs faster. For me it is functional, but closer to a toy than a piece of serious hardware. But if you take into mind the audience you are purchasing it for, it might suit a certain type of user. Someone who wants to chat, check facebook, browse Amazon, and whose vision is great, might do well on this small tablet-sized machine. For a person trying to do more, this machine might be too limited.<br/><br/>It boots, and immediately wants to find your wifi router. Connecting to wifi was simple and easy. I was on the internet in minutes, mostly because I had to add this machine's mac address to my mac address filter.<br/><br/>Looks wise, it is cute. It is bright blue plastic, resembling a toy computer. The keyboard is responsive, the track pad is a single piece, the screen narrow and tiny but appealing with a backdrop of pre-selected icy snow.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't purchase a machine like this, as I need more robust power, but if you are looking to gift grandma with a computer to check her email this might be something you might buy- as long as granny has good vision. I would be concerned about using this for children, as it is a heavily internet reliant piece of hardware, but that's each parents decision to make.<br/><br/>This machine doesn't blow me away, but it isn't bad either. It is a solid piece of technology for what it is.
It’s that time of year.  My kids (9-year old son and 7-year daughter) have started back to school and it’s apparent that kids aren’t taught like I was when I was their age.  Encyclopedias?  What’s that?  My parent’s purchased my two brother’s and I this encyclopedia set and I can’t count how many reports I wrote (gasp! with a pencil and paper!) using those encyclopedias as reference.  Anyways, don’t get me wrong, this review isn’t to go off on a tangent about teaching today (my kids are way smarter now than I was when I was their age…..heck, I think they are smarter than me sometimes at my current age), I just wanted to start off the review with a little background.  Plus, I like to have a little small-talk first instead of jumping right into a review.<br/><br/>OK, small talk over.<br/><br/>It was clear I needed to get my kids a laptop for school so they could get online and download assignments and things like that.  Until now, we used my computer for this type of stuff, but I really wanted them to feel empowered and take responsibility for their own school work so I thought if they had their own computer, that would really help.  I quickly learned that there are more types and styles of laptops/notebooks on the market than there are species of insects, so I let Amazon handle all the heavy lifting for me and just looked for laptops about $200.  The 13” HP Stream was near the top of the list, I read a few reviews, hit the “buy” button, and 2 days later it was sitting on my front porch.<br/><br/>I knew I wasn’t buying a Cray super computer and I wasn’t going to be mining Bitcoins with this thing—I just needed something up to the task of 4th and 2nd grade academia.  After a week of use, this thing has not disappointed me.<br/><br/>First off:  the touch pad on this thing is h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e.  Since it’s spelled out like that, you know it’s really bad.  I had read other reviews prior to purchasing complaining about the touch pad and I told myself, “Pffft, what are those people talking about?  How can a touch pad really be that bad?”  Well, it is bad.  If I had to decide between getting eaten by a crocodile or using this touch pad for the rest of my life, I’d choose using the touch pad….by a slim margin.  It’s accurate, but you constantly find yourself clicking on the bottom corners of the touchpad where the “invisible” buttons are only to find out you didn’t actually click the button but have instead moved your cursor.  Frustration ensues.  You start contemplating how far you could throw this lightweight laptop across the room.  Just do yourself a favor and pick up a cordless mouse.  It doesn’t matter what kind you get, it’ll be better than the touchpad.  Really, it doesn’t matter what mouse you get—you could actually get a real, living, breathing mouse and would be more satisfied with it than the touch pad.  I removed 1 star from my rating because of the touch pad.<br/><br/>I spent the first 2 hours removing all the apps/software from this thing that I knew would never get used…including the trial version of McAfee…I’ve been very pleased and well served by Microsoft’s Defender application that comes with Windows.  Once I got all the SW removed, I did the free upgrade to Windows 10 (it comes with 8.1 installed—which I don’t like either).  I read other reviews stating they didn’t have enough room for Windows 10, but I had no problems.  I also upgraded to 10 right after unboxing and removing all other unnecessary software, so this thing was as bare bones as I could get it.  Following the upgrade to 10, there was only about 2GB of free space left, but using the Disk Cleanup utility to remove the old Windows 8.1 files (which I think Windows automatically does after a few weeks anyway) increased usable storage to about 13GB if I remember correctly.<br/><br/>It doesn’t come with a CD/DVD drive.  Not a big deal for me.  Maybe it’ll be an issue in the future, but it’s been a long time since I’ve used the CD drive on my other computer—everything is downloadable these days.  If you live in an area that doesn’t have high-speed internet, this may present a problem for you since download times could be ridiculously long. You can buy an external USB CD/DVD drive for the price of a few frozen pizzas.<br/><br/>I know I’ve only had this thing for a week, but it’s been great so far.  The kids love it and I even find myself on it if I need to check something online real quick.  If you want a simple, low-cost, effective laptop for 200 bucks that will be used primarily for surfing the interwebs, this thing will serve you well.  I’ll post a follow-up review in a few weeks and let you know if anything changes.
I ordered this computer not only because of the great price but because of how lightweight it was. My laptop is always with me and it's a breeze to pull out of my bag and get my work done. I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I love it even more now. I've had several laptop and desktop computers over the years and HP has never failed to please. I tried MacBook for a short period and it took forever to navigate because I was used to a regular PC. Every Dell I've had has constantly froze up on a daily basis. We have an HP touchscreen desktop computer in our office for our files and accounting work and I don't like the tablet feel of it. I also own an iPad Air and an iPad mini (4th gen) that I was using for our accounting and secretarial part of the business, but I hate typing on a tablet or cell phone. I love that I can open up this laptop and get right to work. It's compact and lightweight so it's never been a chore to carry it in my bag with various receipt books and planners. I chose the pink color (because it's my favorite color) and it's kind of an ombre effect when you open the computer. It also came with Microsoft Home Office 365 which was handy for my family. I am rating the product 5 stars because it doesn't have the standard SD card ports or a CD/DVD drive and so I had to go buy those separately. I'm sure it was probably in the description and it's my fault for not paying attention. Even in purchasing a card reader and external CD/DVD burner, I still spent less than I would have on other laptops.<br/>I don't recommend this laptop to small business owners or photographers. You need a PC that you can plug your media right into and get to work.<br/>This is a great laptop for students. The sound is great, camera is clear and not pixelated or sluggish, and it has a micro SD port to transfer photos and videos from your cell phone or GoPro camera. The USB ports immediately recognize a device and after granted permission, they transfer quickly. I've never waited longer than 2 minutes for files, videos, or photos to transfer. And it comes in a variety of colors!
I purchased this from Woot on a refurb sale and it was cheap enough (well under one-fifty) to justify buying the type of laptop I normally avoid--the "netbook" or Chromebook type of laptop. This kind of PC doesn't have a DVD read-writer and its main purpose is to be a better-than-tablet type of device with some storage and ability to run Windows software that won't run on an Android tablet. The task I have for this PC is to run Photoshop Elements (version 13 and earlier can have several devices on one license.) The capacity of the memory is limited, so adding in Premiere Elements or Corel VideoStudio (for video editing) along with PSE is probably not going to happen, but I haven't tried.<br/><br/>Storage is very limited: 32GB on an solid-state hard drive (SSD) and only 2GB of system memory. (This is why I think you can't put up video editing software, which usually requires a lot of RAM and hard drive space.) The purpose of the laptop was to do some more advanced photo editing while traveling, and it did handle that well.<br/><br/>I loaded PSE 13 by downloading the "trial" from Adobe and then going to Adobe where I had registered my PC copy. The license allows for two devices, so I was able to add the license during the trial install and update it to a full running copy with a valid software key. You have to download any software as there is no DVD drive. But much software is downloadable these days, so this is really not a huge problem.<br/><br/>Re photos: there is a microSD card slot, You also get an HDMI port, a headset jack, two USB 2.0 ports, and single USB 3.0 port. So plugged into an outlet, you can use it to charge USB devices or attach them.<br/><br/>It is surprisingly fast using PSE 13. The battery also has good uptime--nine hours between recharges, the longest battery life of any device I have, including my Kindle. Suitable for working on long plane trips with no power outlet. The keyboard has a good feel. I didn't like the touchpad (but I hate most of them, anyway.) It's relatively unresponsive, so I'd prefer the mouse version (there is one) and the touchscreen version might be worth the investment if you really want a notebook computer.<br/><br/>It comes in some colors: I got the aqua blue but there is also a magenta. The screen is bright enough and sharp enough.  The unit also comes with a year license of Office 365.<br/><br/>Bottom line: decent notebook with limited storage and memory. Good for video, but limited for gaming and good for software such as Office or Photoshop Elements. This won't replace a full powered laptop but it weighs under a pound and is hardly bigger than a larger tablet. It slips in my purse. Long battery life. Add a mouse to overcome the lousy touchpad, the one flaw. Limited storage can be overcome with an external drive of some kind.
Very happy with the purchase, especially at $184.  A few thoughts, the resolution of the small screen make it very readable.  I was concerned about this as my eye sight is not the best.  I am very happy with the compact size and am glad I did not get the larger unit.  The keyboard is a very usable size and the keys themselves are large with a good response.  Some reviewers complained about the track pad, but I have not had any problems with it.  Like any new track pad, it takes a little getting used to. The scroll feature is very handy.  The unit boots very fast and runs fast, due to the solid state hard drive.  After seeing the difference, I will never go back to a spindle drive.  I did delete the bloatware as noted by other reviewers.  It takes a bit of time, but is worth it.  I have not created a  recovery usb yet to gain more space. I will wait for the windows 10 upgrade before I do that.  No issues with the wireless as some others noted.  Nice and fast.  I ordered an external cd/dvd player and memory card, which should expand the use.  No issues with the installed ram.  I do not keep many tabs open and use foxfire.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very good purchase for the price.  The construction is solid and hopefully will last a while. My uses for this laptop are internet browsing,  small spreadsheets, letters, reading, music, netflix and this laptop performs well.  It comes with a subscription to Office 365 for a year. The stripped down basic pdf reader is pretty good.  I will probably not install Adobe Reader as I like this basic reader and never use many of the features in Adobe.  Comes with some HP apps for music, photos and storage.  Also comes with cloud storage.  Came with a trial of anti-virus software which slowed things down a bit, I deleted it and installed my own to speed things up.<br/>2 month update - Still running well. Slowed down a bit after adding programs. Nothing bad.  Did not update to Win 10 yet, still on 8.1  Track pad is a bit of a pain, after a while it gets annoying.  Using more key strike shortcuts to avoid track pad use.  Still was a good buy.  I really do like the keyboard, big keys, nice feel.
Yes, this item truly is a bargain.  It came with security software already installed; is very lightweight and therefore portable. The keys are comfortable and easy to use (not always the case with smaller laptops. Microsoft Office 365 Personal software is available to use free of charge for one year.  I was surprised to find that there is a slot for media cards, and three USB ports!<br/><br/>Two things I would mention (that were the only reason why this laptop didn't get 5 stars instead of) -- is Microsoft Office has to be installed, it is not pre-installed as MacAfee was and the pad you use to control the cursor is not always predictable.<br/><br/>My remote mouse did not work with the laptop, but that may be because it is old. A newer remote mouse may work fine.<br/><br/>Microsoft Office is the 2013 version, but I believe that is all they are selling right now.  HP walked me through the installation.<br/><br/>I love the laptop.  Be very careful when you take all the materials out of the box  to not lose any of the support manuals -- remember, the Office 365 documentation is very tiny and mine was in a separate, very small, wrapper. It was not with all the other information, booklets, etc., and was, at first, lost .  You will not be getting a CD or DVD to install Office with.<br/><br/>Look for the clear wrapper with the tiny booklet that says: Office 365.  Having that handy will save a lot of grief.  You will be getting the complete version of Microsoft Office once it is installed, and will not have to provide a charge card...it is free.  A tech support person named Patrick helped me do the installation, and he was awesome. That made me feel that HP will be there when something goes wrong.<br/><br/>I have several HP products, and after getting this latest laptop, which is a real bargain and unbelievable for the price, I'll remain a loyal HP customer.  They've got my business!
I'm about to go on a business/vacation trip for the first time to another state by Amtrak train for the first time as well. The train ride is going to be quite long so I wanted something to keep me entertained other than the smartphone/tablet option. My current laptop I own is a 15.6" widescreen so it's pretty long and heavy to carry around. I first set eyes on a 11.6" laptop which was an Acer One but at the time I did not have the budget to get it. Soon after they disappeared from the stores and I kept that money saved for other things. I later came across this HP Stream ... the display unit was the Pink Orchid and wasn't too fond of the color pink but being it was a purplish pink I was thinking it'd be okay. Blue is my favorite color so when I found out they do have it in Blue I was leaning more towards the blue. After doing internet research I decided to get the Blue so that my husband can take it to work sometime too. Would kinda be awkward for him to be using a pink laptop.<br/><br/>The setup of this laptop was a BIG pain in the booty. But after a few facepalms, headaches, and mumbling I got everything set up and working. The highest OS experience I have is Vista with a wee bit of Windows 7 on my husband's desktop. So fumbling through Windows 8.1 was something *new*. I'm loving the windows store and how they have some Xbox360 games on there. Even more loving that you get a $25 Microsoft Gift card to spend in the store. I think my main highlight of this laptop has to be the Windows Store and being able to download apps like it were a tablet. My main dislike is it doesn't seem to be able to multitask without slowing down your computer quite a bit. Otherwise it's a good computer for maybe tweens and maybe kids to use. I'd recommend getting a mouse to go with this laptop as the touch pad is a bit finicky. Overall it's a cute little laptop perfect for travel and commutes on a bus or train.
Had a few minor issues: speakers started buzzing, machine was very slow.  The speaker issue was fixed by an HP tech who recommended a BIOS upgrade, I was able to tweak Windows in the same way most users tweak Windows, by turning off lots of gunk and uninstalling much of the HP software/adware.  Machine gets a bit warm when on AC power...I hope that doesn't affect the life of the system as there is no fan.  The unit gets much hotter than my new ASUS Chromebook C300.  As a Linux,/Android/Win 7 user, Win 8.1 has a bit of a learning curve, but I've now come to like it a lot, especially with the touch screen, which is very responsive.  The keyboard and build quality is nearly as good as the ASUS, but the screen is much better, especially at angles.  Battery life is good but not even close to the Chromebook, about 6 versus 11 hours during normal use.  Touchpad is better than the ASUS, but it's so sensitive that you might inadvertently trigger something you don't want while typing.  Windows 8.1's hybrid nature is awkward compared to Win 7...I think MS should have stayed with the Metro interface or just stuck with Win 7...pick one or the other but don't try to kludge a desktop paradigm with a tablet interface.  That said, there is lots of functionality here that you won't get in Chrome or Android...many of us still use Microsoft for good solid reasons.  If you're new to the Windows world, however, you might do better with Apple, Chrome or Android....or maybe the new Win 10???  I''ve been a Windows software developer for many years, which helps me work around Win 8's idiosyncrasies...newbies to Windows might find some frustration here, but if you stick with it, you might grow to like it as I have.<br/><br/>After numerous tweaks and settings changes, the machine is now quite fast and responsive...I got my money's worth at $229.  The Office 365 apps run fine.  I recommend purging all the homegrown HP software, except the support stuff...it's just not up to par.  OneDrive from MS is very cool as is Dropbox...make use of the cloud if you're going to make this your primary PC.  Also, the Windows install and backup takes up a third of the flash drive...you don't get a full 32 GB for all of your stuff.  Video quality is acceptable...most Youtube stuff runs without issue.  Wireless performance is fair to good, not great, just a bit better than my ASUS.  At this price however, go for it.  This machine runs better than my Toshiba Satellite with a Core 2 Duo processor purchased four years ago, running Linux Mint 17.1.  I may make this HP a dual-boot with Mint or Ubuntu..that would be a bit of a squeeze on drive space though.
I received this today. As for signing in to my Microsoft account it wouldn't let me do anything but change it to outlook. which is fine. I have a Offfice word account and it wouldn't let me use that either so I just signed into the free one for a year then I will call and use the one I have. no big deal. I spent about a hour loading what I wanted on it after taking off all the apps and garbage I didn't want. there is a lot of things you can take off to give yourself some space like after you register it on the hP site uninstall it. the hp music I do not use I uninstalled that. just the junk I do not use. I really wish I knew how to do more as for changing things to make it run smother and faster but I do not. I just know if I remove unwanted apps I can add some space. as for the MacAfee antivirus that comes with it I will uninstall that soon but it was already up and running so I didn't mess with it for now. I can spend hrs just adding and delteing htings so for now I have what I need and later when I have more time I will continues to uninstall things.<br/>I have to say the speakers on here are pretty good. loud. the camera pretty granny but I didn't expect any better with what I paid. I have a bigger version of this I have had nothing but problems with from day one and this actually works better all thought the other one is more powerful and has a ton more space but what good is it if it never works right? so I went for this for now being way cheaper and can do the things I need it to do and I can take it with me traveling.<br/>It seems to start up pretty quickly. I really like it so far for what I need and bought it for. the blue color is nice. I thought of getting it in the magenta but then didn't.<br/>so as for working. I think its pretty great for the price and size. like I said the speakers are great, nice and loud. the camera granny. the keyboard easy to type. no stiff keys. easy to maneuver between windows and  explorer. do not when loading apps put them on run in background. it comes up pretty quick and if you miss this it will run as soon as you start draining battery power. its seems to stay cool. I have been on it for about 3 hrs now and it is not hot at all my battery is lasting pretty long , seems to be holding up well.<br/>I have a HP that the battery holds no longer then 2 hrs max so this is great for working on for me.<br/>I think as long as I add a micro card for space and only load what I need it will work out great.<br/>if you looking for something not expensive and works great  this si the machine for you. I have a tablet that cost 3 times as much and takes forever to load so money wise the more expensive is not always the best. I have learned that the hard way. and I am sick of buying expensive electronics. between phones that cost $800 to tablets and laptops. this one for $211 is great for me and anyone who feels the same and likes the specs should buy this. add a memory card and uninstall all the junk that you know how and I bet you'd be happy. its a sweet little laptop.<br/>i'll be taking it on a trip in  couple days so this will be the challenge when I need to do some work on the plane ride but I think ti will hold well to my challenges. I have already had 10 windows open at once and no problems running and I can't see that you would need more then that at once open anyways. while I'm typing this I have amazon  open on the other side and I like the 2 window open on the same screen at the same time. I do it a lot especially when I'm working on something. yes this is a cool little computer and seems ot do the same things as my 15" la[top except space wise but like I said invest in a sd card and you should be fine.
I was looking for a inexpensive laptop to use for school and I have found it! With great value, this laptop comes with FREE one year Office 365 AND a $25 gift card to Microsoft. Some things you should keep in mind if you are thinking about buying this laptop:<br/><br/>- Many have commented that it's hard to see the screen when watching movies. I don't watch movies on this laptop so I don't notice at all. If you're planning on just using this for work/typing/etc., no need to worry.<br/><br/>- The touch pad is a little awkward to work with but I'm used to it. Some have recommended purchasing a mouse but I'm fine without one. To buy a mouse or not to buy a mouse is dependent on your personal preference.<br/><br/>- There is not much storage on this laptop. I bought a USB with 16 GB on it and that should suffice for me. Although this comes with "32 GB" of storage, a bit of that is taken up by vital computer files, pre-loaded apps, etc. I deleted all the apps I won't need, along with any other things I don't use. I suggest you do the same. Still, the low price and great value of the Stream 13 makes it all worth it to pay less than $20 for a USB.<br/><br/>Some pros to convince you to buy this laptop:<br/>- If you think about, this laptop only costs around $100 if you count the free Office and gift card. WOW!!<br/><br/>- The color is fun and unique!<br/><br/>- The keyboard is great for typing for a long time. As I am using the HP Stream 13 right now to type this review, I can do so rapidly and accurately.<br/><br/>- The screen is not overwhelmingly bright. My eyes don't hurt after a few hours of work, as they do on other computers.<br/><br/>Generally, this laptop gives me the functions I need for high school and I'm confident it will continue to improve my life through college.
After reading numerous reviews I decided to purchase the HP Windows 8 Stream in the color Magenta. I am a college student and I was in need of a laptop I can count on daily. The HP 11.6 was exactly what I was looking for, it fits almost everywhere and I am in love with the free features and yearly subscriptions, they come in handy especially for those in the learning community. The HP Stream 11 surpass leading Chromebooks with a unique style, as well as an affordable 11-inch laptop that offers solid performance.<br/>Not like any other laptop, the HP 11.6 Stream is practical, but also stylish; being the perfect laptop for a student. The option of either Blue or Magenta makes them even more attractive, compared to leading brands that offer cheap glossy plastic. The Streams outer surface is fingerprint-resistant and is stiff enough as well a great size to feel safe to travel with. With weighing 1.27 Kg and measuring 12 x 8.1 x 0.78 inches the Stream 11 is petite and can be taken almost anywhere; its light yet durable design makes it possible for students to carry along with textbooks, or be placed in a backpack, sleeve, or a bag.<br/>The HP Stream windows 8.1 is affordable and I highly recommend it for students on a budget. I purchased a Magenta HP 11.6 a few weeks ago for the price of $199 with a two year warranty coming out to a total of $240. The HP Stream 11.6 also comes with a one-year subscription to Office 365, as well as a one-year trial for OneDrive featuring 1 TB of cloud storage, instructions as well as links can all be found inside the box. If in the future consumers would like to renew these subscription, they are eligible for a discount; OneDrive and Office 365 would cost $6.99 instead of the regular price of $9.99. If you are a student, you can sign up for the 10% off educational discount, bring the price down to $179.99. This offer is valid at Microsoft.com which also includes the 25 dollar gift card to the Microsoft online website. HP consumers also have the option of purchasing a used laptop from Amazon.com for as low as $169. For college students, like myself, who are looking for an affordable and well-rounded laptop; the HP 11.6 for the price of only $199 can get the job done for less with the same Max Turbo Boost Speed of 2.58GHz performance as leading Chromebooks.<br/>Even though the HP Stream 11 is less expensive than leading laptops, it is still known for its smooth performance. As a college student, I found the split screen feature helpful. It allows me to open up my notes while inputting answers into my online class work in a smooth and organized matter. The Windows 8 laptop gives you the option of surfing, video chatting, word documents, photo editing as well as simple everyday computer use. I definitely recommend it to consumers in the learning community. It includes HP Connected Music and HP Connected Photo for music and pictures that can be saved on your laptop as well as in the cloud; the HP Connected Drive confirms that important data is safe.<br/>Of course, when buying a laptop for the low price of $199 it does come with some flaws. One minor flaw is the trackpad; it is a bit overly sensitive when trying to right swipe besides that, the trackpad is not terrible and at the end of the day it gets the job done. Another flaw would be the panel resolution; it is a bit difficult to see the screen when tilted as well as in bright lighting. The screen is an HD anti-glare WLED-backlit display with Intel HD Graphics which makes it a decent screen, many laptops have worse displays, but overall with it being a $199 laptop you do get what you paid for.<br/> I’ve had my HP Stream Windows 8 for a couple weeks now and I cannot complain. Although it has two minor flaws, it is overall an amazing laptop; it is durable yet stylish and is guaranteed to perform smoothly and on top of that is a great deal. Not only is the laptop $199 it is also packed with free subscriptions being an overall bargain for any student. The reviews don’t lie, before buying my HP. I did tons of research and I found nothing but helpful and positive comments. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone who is on a budget and is in need or a solid yet inexpensive laptop, this is as good as it gets.
I should start with saying I bounced back and forth between this and a Chromebook. I'm not great with change though and although I cringe at Windows 8 I sacrificed knowing I can technically run any program within reason on this. I've had this netbook for a little more than a week now. it runs surprisingly well for the specs it offers. It's booted up within 15 seconds which is faster than my desktop that has 8gb ram i5 processor etc etc... It's obviously not a power house but I wasn't expecting that when I bought it. The reason I bought it is so I can easily move it around the house and not worry about carrying around a brick that dies within an hour. I ran it on full brightness listening to music browsing Facebook and a few random Chrome tabs here and there and it lasted about 4 hours. Pretty impressive for the tiny battery it has. The trackpad can definitely be finicky at times BUT I went on the HP site and noticed there is an updated driver, after installing that it works 99% of the time without having to move around to get it to register touch. The keyboard is pretty decent, it feels a bit mushy at first but before you know it you get used to it. The up/down arrows don't bother me in the least they are pretty tiny though. DO NOT expect to store more on this than a couple of cd's worth of music and a movie or two. After inspecting closer I realized 3/4 of the drivers were out of date and I had to update them manually which resulted in about 3gb of free space AFTER everything was up to date. Again, I realized this before I bought it and ordered a micro sd card for more storage if need be. We have a 1.5tb networked drive so there's really no need unless I go somewhere and need storage for some odd reason so it's really a last resort. The wifi card seems to be pretty decent. I saw a couple reviews stating it had horrible range but I can go places that my old laptop wouldn't even have 1 bar on and have 4/5 bars. The screen gets the job done but it's not going to blow you away especially in bright sun light. The matte finish helps somewhat but not entirely so be prepared to squint and adjust as needed. I haven't activated Office 360 yet or redeemed the gift card so I can't comment on that but I'll assume it'll work just fine same goes for HDMI, haven't tested it but I see no reason why it wouldn't work. The one major downfall I notice is Youtube videos in 60fps DO NOT run smoothly no matter what you do. I kind of figured this so it's not a problem but I can see how it would annoy some people. The webcam works fine for what it is, not great but not horrible either. The same goes for the microphone, no complaints really. MAJOR negative... CRAPWARE. Another reviewer made a list of everything that can be deleted. All in all I'm happy with my purchase. Fits my needs and does it well. Wish they had more colors though, a green one in the same style would be awesome but that's trivial. Needless to say I wrote this review from it. Hope I helped your decision making!
Awesome little laptop! I'm 16 and decided to purchase this after owning a very powerful laptop on which the screen broke... I was afraid that the specs on this laptop were too low to have great performance, but I was thankfully proven wrong! It's very snappy and gets the job done. Obviously don't expect it to do the things an alienware would do lol but I highly recommend this laptop. I absolutely love it. Perfect size for any lap, keyboard is just right, mousepad is just right, screen is just right, I could go on and on! I was skeptical that the battery would last very long due to its size but I was once again proven wrong! I can't believe how long it lasts! Beyond all-day battery life for sure!<br/><br/>A couple of things to note:<br/>When I first got the laptop, I HATED the mousepad. It seemed to have a film on it and it was so hard to move my finger on it! Very disheartening. But, within half an hour of using it it went away!  I attribute it to being new and never used before.<br/><br/>Also, when using Google Chrome (works the best on this laptop, highly recommend) you won't be able to watch 1080p videos on youtube without it lagging. This isn't really a big deal though because 1) you can't tell the difference between 1080 and 720, which works juse fine, and 2) Internet Explorer lets you watch 1080p without trouble.<br/><br/>Yes, it only comes with 32GB of storage, which is disappointing, but I got a SanDisk 64GB microSD card from Amazon for about $20 and I just keep that inserted in my laptop. Works great! Definitely a must-have for someone who likes to keep a few pictures and videos on their laptop.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a GREAT laptop and I honestly don't think you'll be disappointed with it. If you're wanting a laptop to surf the internet with and do basic computing and that's also light with a long battery life, choose the Stream 13! You'll love it!
3.5 Stars out of Five<br/><br/>I am a graduate student, and my laptop died. I needed something cheap that I could write on, run a couple of programs, and mess around on the internet. I looked into a Chromebook, but there were a couple of programs that I needed to run, and I didn't think I would be able to do that on a Chromebook, so I bought this laptop. I have had it for two weeks.<br/><br/>It suits my needs fine. It's not blazing, but it's acceptable. It takes perhaps 20 seconds to startup. It runs Spotify, OpenOffice, Chrome, and a Greek/Latin language program simultaneously without problems or lag. I can stream sports and Netflix without problems.<br/><br/>I should mention that I bought the Signature Edition from the Microsoft store, and there was no bloatware loaded when I received it.<br/><br/>The screen, while not great, is not as terrible as some reviews have made it out to be. The touchpad is fine after two weeks of use; it took a while to get used to it, but any problems went away once I became familiar with it. Battery life while running programs is close to eight hours, and while streaming video it's less (perhaps five? six?). The laptop itself does not feel cheap; it's pretty sturdy.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the Bluetooth connection. My mouse's connection cuts out randomly unless I also have a pair of bluetooth headphones connected. Sometimes it's also difficult to establish a connection with my wireless printer. I assume that these problems are connected, and hopefully there will be some sort of fix from HP soon.<br/><br/>Another weak point: the blue, while nicer than it looks on the internet, is not attractive. I'm actually somewhat embarrassed to use this laptop in public because of the color. The color on the keyboard section of the laptop has a bit of a fade effect, which fades into a lighter blue. The color on the lid is a normal, cornflower blue. Why couldn't they have made a black or white version?<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good, portable laptop for those (like me) who need to word process, stream, and run a couple of programs. For the price, it's a very good bargain.
If you are using laptop for checking your emails, browse internet, use office/using word,excel and watch netflix. Then this is the laptop for you.<br/><br/>Why spent $$$ for a laptop when you do basic functionality and don't use all its processing power.<br/>This is game changer moving forward.<br/>If you are looking for editing video, High definition games or music editing this is not the laptop for you.<br/><br/>Microsoft store has great deals, head over to the microsoft store to get the same for $179 holiday sale.<br/><br/>HP Stream 11<br/>http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/HP-Stream-11-Signature-Edition-Laptop/productID.309174400?icid=HomePage_WhatNew_3_122114<br/><br/>For a litter bit bigger screen HP 13<br/>http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.309174500?Icid=Homepage_WhatsNew_4_PC_HP13_120114<br/><br/>I have HP stream 13 apart from screen size, HP Stream 13 has more ports -1 usb 3 and 2 usb 2 plus HDIMI.<br/>And if you have smart tv (Miracast) it also lets you screen cast like chromecast to your tv.<br/><br/>The best thing is, it is configured by Microsoft - (Signature Edition) which means no bloatware/crapware, Just WIN 8 that's it.<br/><br/>What I like<br/>-Battery - last up to 8hrs almost.<br/>-Loading time is fast - 32GB Solid state, so pretty responsive.<br/>-For a cheap laptop the keyboard is not bad at all.<br/>- Good sound (DTS)<br/><br/>Also do yourself a favor buy 32GB microsd card, you will ran out of space very soon.<br/>After downloading updates and office 365 I have only  8GB left. So having external HD or microsd card helps.<br/>For those who have not outlook or hotmail it's not a big deal just create one. You get up to 10GB free space and 1 year of office 365 plus $25 gift card.<br/>For those who have questioned about using office after 1 year or don't want subscription to that. You can always use office online, while it may  not have all features of paid one, you can easily get by without any issues.<br/><br/>Online flash games or pbskids those things are fine but don't expect to run graphic intensive or memory intensive games on this laptop, this is not for those purpose.<br/><br/>So go ahead go to Microsoft store and buy from there. Provided if you want use this laptop for the above said purpose only.<br/>Why I preferred this over Chrome book is that I need to be able to edit my documents, worksheet offline and not have to be connected to the internet, unlike chromebook where you have to connected to internet all the time.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Ideal laptop for kids and families. Gift your parents/grandparents/Kids with this one. They will be happy.<br/>For those who are looking for the same model with touch screen best buy have them for $270.<br/><br/>Hope you find this review useful.
Recently bought this (the HP Stream 11) from the Microsoft Store (for $170 - with 10% student discount and 5% off coupon). I like it so far.<br/><br/>Like:<br/>This is compact, feels solidly built and I really love the color and texture (doesn't catch fingerprints)<br/>Keyboard is good (97% size of a normal full size keyboard; up and down arrows are a lot smaller though)<br/>Reasonably fast so far - turns on as soon as you open the clamshell<br/><br/>Neutral:<br/>Screen isn't great, it is kinda grainy due to the matte finish; viewer angles are very limited - ok if one person is looking straight into the screen, not OK if 2 people are watching Netflix<br/>Audio is just average - gets the job done<br/>Trackpad is finicky - disable side swipes (easy to do)<br/><br/>Dislike:<br/>Storage - 32 GB eMMC that allows the laptop to be compact also greatly restricts the usabiity. Just 1 week into using it, it has just 2 GB free. This is after I installed ms office pro 2013 and a vmware software (just these 2 programs!). I have an SD card but you cant install and run programs on it as far as i know... the storage is becoming a major concern and i am highly inclined to return it to MSFT store because of this. I so wish this came with 64GB SSD. I would have been happy to pay upto $50 more for it.<br/><br/>Tips: Backup onedrive on SD card, change default download location to SD card, get windows backup on USB drive and remove partition. You might be able to survive the 32 gb data that way.<br/><br/>Verdict: I really like this little machine - the form factor is awesome. So I am trying to manage with the little storage. Not sure if I can make it work with this little storage though. SD card and cloud can only help you to an extent - you need harddrive space to run programs!
Kids just opened their HP Streams for Christmas… my son's was bought from Microsoft website and works perfectly.  My daughter's, bought on Amazon, is loaded with a lot of crap programs and keeps freezing… cannot even get online long enough to claim a Microsoft credit without it freezing.  Restarted 6 times already… still trying to figure out a fix
I love my HP Stream 11! I am a college student and the Microsoft office 365 personal is great for me. It is easy to install although a little time consuming. PC setup was extremely easy. I got it today and I am overall very pleased. I love shopping on Amazon!
This laptop is definitely light enough for a college student, I take it in my backpack quite frequently. I was in need of a new laptop on very short notice with very limited funds so this laptop was one of the only laptops in the market available to me. The functionality of the laptop is there besides the fact that there's absolutely no space for anything. I went from a 4gb laptop to this and that was a big jump since I barely had enough space to do what I needed to anyway. I don't store pictures or movies on my laptop or anything, I always use Google Drive or Outlook for my homework, but I'm a Construction Management major and I have several programs such as AutoCAD, Google Sketchup, Revit, and Adobe Photoshop that I now have to run from a 64gb flash drive or use an on campus computer in our lab. It makes for very frustrating nights when I can't save my entire file because I don't have enough space. I'll admit this was only a short term solution. I've only had this laptop for about four months now and I'm upgrading again in two months. During this time the other factors of this laptop like portability really worked well for me. And having a hot pink laptop in a Construction class is always amusing. I wouldn't recommend this to other college students though, even those who do less than I do in terms of only surfing the Internet or homework. This doesn't have the space for movies or games or programs. I would recommend this more for a high school or middle school student only needing the laptop for homework at home and not constant travel. It would be perfect for my 14 year old sister, but not good for a Junior in college.
Just got This Baby a couple days ago and here is what i got so far for ya. Will update later with more info.<br/><br/>*** Best Features: No heat from bottom! The Color is Beautiful! The Battery Life Unplugged!<br/><br/>First thing I notice is that it doesn't heat up on the bottom like all the other Laptops I have had [insert 10 stars here] <3 ! Now this doesn't have a CD drive like all the others I have had but that is all good. More and More I don't need that any more. Now i'm use to a 10-key pad so it is taking me a little while to get use to that and that some of those keys that would be off to the side are in a different place now. But that is all good. The sound is slight lower than what i'm use to but not as bad as this tablet i got recently. It is a laptop so it is all good. and work able. Oh back to the Keys. All the other Keys are greatly placed. I have had no issue (excpet that extra enter key on the 10-pad that i'm use to) just got to retain my self  for the keys that are not there that i'm use to on a larger laptop. But dont' get me wrong this laptop is not tiny or small at all. It is a very nice size. Not to small and not too big. The "Battery Life" unplugged has been GREAT! It last a LONG Time unplugged!<br/>  Man I Love that the bottom doesn't get hot. This si so Awesome. I Love the Color "Orchid Magenta" So So So Pretty. " Happy Work inviroment :0)!  You can't help but feel happy while studying and working away on it.<br/>haven't tested every thing out yet but Loving the no burn legs I can sit any where and the color and the easy to type keys ( - ) the 10 key Pad :0)
an amazing laptop.. i was looking for something small and light weight as I am a writer. perfect for writers. Of course, you have to compromise with the memoty. but the key pad, the screen, touch pad is amazing. just what i was looking for in a computer. also, the MS office is an added advantage for someone who use MS doc often..5 stars
My primary reason for picking up the laptop up was for travel, because I was getting tired of taking my work issued tank on the road. This HP is only a little heavier than some of the Ultrabooks I checked out, and costs much less. Since it's running Windows, all of the apps I need run on it.<br/><br/>First off, I highly recommend the MS Signature Edition of this laptop. It's devoid of the resource hogging (both processing and disk space) junkware that the retail version has. Without junk to remove, I had all of the Windows updates installed and Office up and running within the first hour of ownership.<br/><br/>So far, I've been able to do combinations of basic tasks without issues. Most of my day is spent with a few Chrome tabs open, Excel and/or Word up and running, plus an occasional RDP session. I haven't noticed any lag doing that. Light online games also run smoothly, but as other have said, this isn't a high performance gaming box. One of the things I did to help overall performance, was to tweak the Performance settings under System Properties to disable all the spiffy Windows animations that are on by default. They look cool, but do slow things down, even on robust hardware.<br/><br/>The built quality of the laptop is impressive for the price. The plastics seem to be of a high quality, and the metal keyboard deck feels very sturdy. The keyboard has a nice feel, with key good travel. My only concern is with keeping those white keys clean, because dirt has nowhere to hide on them.<br/><br/>Overall, I heartily recommend this box. For the price, it does everything I need of it.
I bought the Stream 13 and used it for about 2 weeks before sending it back to Amazon. For $220 it was OK I suppose for a new laptop. I bought it going in not expecting much, but I still sent it back because I just could not stand the trackpad. I read other reviews that mentioned it wasn't a great trackpad, but it was much worse than I thought. For me I tap to click far more than I press to click, and I found with the Stream 13 that it didn't recognize me tapping to click often enough. I also like to use two-finger scrolling, and that worked ok but definitely wasn't as fluid as on other laptops I've used. In general the trackpad just plain sucked I found. I did try messing with the touchpad settings, and they helped a little bit, but the trackpad still was not good enough for me to feel like keeping the Stream. The keyboard was actually pretty decent, as it is a chiclet keyboard which I like on laptops. Performance was ok and was about what I expected. It plays YouTube videos fine and I was able to browse the web fine on it. Web pages don't load nearly as fast as my gaming desktop, but I knew that would be the case going in. I didn't end up trying out any games on the Stream as I knew shortly after using it for the first time that I was probably going to return it. I would not mind buying one again if I had a child that was needing a laptop for school or just to browse the web on, but for me I just couldn't compromise on the trackpad as I value that too much in a laptop. I ended up buying a used laptop (an HP EliteBook 8460p) for the same price as this and it is working great.
Not a really great laptop but it is what I expected from the specs. I had to disable the tap-to-click function on the track pad because I couldn't adjust to it, or it to me. That leaves "press fairly hard in a corner" as the only way to click, which is not great. Windows 10 installed a few days after I purchased it and seems to be the antidote to Windows 8, which was annoying for those few days I had it. It's light and it has a very decent battery. I took it to a coffee house and it worked well there.<br/><br/>The screen is a little narrow-angle for a laptop. The degree of it is that if you are looking at say, a cat picture from reddit, the detail will go away if you don't look straight at the screen and it might not appear as fluffy as it should. In the same conditions or worse, an iPad will still be clear. You will be able to read text if the designer provides decent contrast, though. On a desktop computer, or the sort of large laptop that you sort of really settle in with, this is not a problem because you'll establish a comfy position in your seat and optimize everything and leave it that way. On this type of computer you will tend not to optimize everything. When you're looking at a picture critically, you'll have to fuss with the orientation of the screen and maybe get out of that comfy slouchy position you're in.<br/><br/>A little off topic but after I got Win10 I tried the new Edge browser. You will find (late summer 2015) that lots of websites don't like Edge or can't figure out which browser it is. So I installed Chrome, which is an ironic outcome if you think about it.
I am so loving this laptop. It is small and easy to carry around the house while trying to take care of house hold chores. I take it to work with me to help complete school assignments. The fact that it comes with the 1 year subscription of office 365 is very helpful. I am actually going to order about 3 more for family members.
I'm a writer and I got this to write. I spent $100 dollars on the new 2013 windows and this laptop keeps deleting my work which has made me want to quit righting all together, it's done it TWICE. I've wasted another $50 dollars and getting a professional to try to bring my document back and he couldn't even do it because it disappeared.<br/>It's deleted my whole book twice meanwhile I was 90% done.<br/>Do not buy this laptop.
Fan less design made it very quite at work. The battery life is way better than traditional laptop. Performance can rival most of the low cost laptop. Can't believe it's only $199. I thought I was still using my core- i3 laptop sometimes.
For parents who are considering this purchase for a kiddo who loves to play minecraft, I will share our experiences with this computer so far. First off, yes, we can play Minecraft with this machine. I do modify the settings, to 60fps, fast mode, medium detail, etc to offset the limits of the system since this has far from a gaming comp specs (and price fwiw)! However, coming from pocket edition on an iPod my 9yo is VERY happy with this setup. If you're in a similar situation, considering this for your tween as an upgrade from PE, I would say GO FOR IT! For the price you can't beat this system. We haven't ventured into modded MC which would likely be more taxing on the Stream but we're very happy with what my kiddo does use it for- basic Minecraft with little to no lag (after settings tweaks), basic web research and some schoolwork online. One thing that other reviewers have mentioned is that the trackpad is horrible, and I will second that. I can (barely) get some drag and drop functionality but for my 9yo it is very difficult so you may want to consider a mouse. Also, windows 8.1 is a pain- very busy and difficult for my child to navigate. I would suggest the 10 upgrade from the outset- very much more user friendly! Also know that, for us, when we initially upgraded to Windows 10 it took a few minutes for the drivers to update so I had 0 touchpad functionality at first! This soon took care of itself as drivers installed or updated or whatever so don't freak out like I did! Hope this helps!
I have had problems with this laptop from day one. You can't do anything but to put music and pictures on it. It just doesn't have any space on it. I could barley play a youtube video on it. Completely awful. iTunes can't even download on it. Extreamly slow also. A laptop you'd get for your mother or granparents but not for a college student or anyone below. After downloading iTunes on it I restarted my computer & it completely broke down & never turned back on. & You want to know the best part? All this happened within my 30 days! I DIDN'T EVEN GET A GOOD 30 DAYS OUT OF IT. I could thank God that I was able to return it and get a refund from my lovely amazon but geeez. Complete waste of time.
If you are not a power user, I strongly suggest you purchase this as a "signature edition pc" (google it). You will have to pay sales tax, but it will be worth it to get the machine without bloatware. If you are a power user, read on...<br/><br/>When I buy or build a new machine, I always like to format and install a clean, bloatware-free vanilla operating system. With windows 7, this was a piece of cake: buy a new laptop, download the appropriate .iso file, burn it to a disk, and use the key from the certificate on authenticity to re-install windows.<br/><br/>Now, with windows 8, they encrypt the product key within the BIOS and you need to use a special bit of software to retrieve it. Further, you need to create usb install media with a customized EI.cfg and PID.txt in order to circumvent the windows installer from using the BIOS key. And I'm still not sure which ISO to use to accomplish this with the "Bing" edition product key.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I happened to have some spare keys from when Win 8 first came out with introductory pricing deals. So I was able to do a clean install of Win 8.1 pro with media center using those keys.<br/><br/>Now, as for the hardware... I couldn't be happier. I wanted a silent, fanless, light, compact laptop I could use in bed without having to worry about overheating, etc. and this thing delivers. Battery life is great, it doesn't get too hot. The screen is more than adequate, and overall the machine is relatively snappy for casual use.
First and foremost, I love the idea of a "bare bones" laptop (netbook), the problem this type of hardware however is the ability to upgrade down the line, And this hardware is no different. First thing I wanted to do was getting rid of all the bloatware included and install Windows 10, as it claims it is “Windows 10 compatible”.<br/>Getting rid of all the software that is not needed was the easy part. This left me about 11.5 to 12GB remaining for hard drive space. I figured this was a bit on the low side, but went through with the automatic windows 10 update. Sure thing after the download I had 8.5GB of disk space remaining. Shortly after the installation started I received a message saying I did not have enough disk space to install windows 10. Problem was, I had nothing left to remove to make this happen.<br/>I went onto “plan B” and went to install windows 10 off of a USB drive, this started out working good until fairly early on I received a device driver issue and could not continue the install process. I tried every driver I could find on HP’s site for the missing driver (touchpad) even their “supposed” Win 10 driver, none of which worked and allowed me to continue on. Eventually I gave up, eventually I may try again at a later date but as of the date I write this review, it is NOT compatible with Win 10.<br/><br/>Aside from this issue, the laptop looks great and is very “snappy”, if you don’t mind Win 8 and just need a bare bones laptop, this is a good buy!
I bought this because of the other laptop we bought by another manufacturer died on us and had to find something for our teenager to do her school work on. She said that she likes the new computer and it is faster than the old one.
You get what you pay for. If you are looking for a computer with no bells and whistles and just want a laptop for Internet browsing and light usage than you should be happy with this. Great starter computer for teens and preteens.
Had to get first one replaced because one USB port didn't work<br/>Amazon was amazing on replacing<br/>Couldn't be happier for traveling, checking email,  watching movies,  keeping finances in order<br/>Cheaper than a tablet
I love this little laptop. It is perfect for what I use it for, like Facebook, online shopping, games, netflix and email. I am glad I don't have to work with the num lock anymore. I love the color Just a great overall laptop.
I received this laptop fairly quickly. So far there is not a lot to complain about really. I knew this did not come with the most memory but it is enough for my basic school work in college. I love the size, I got the 13.3 one in blue. The camera on this is not thee best but it's not like i'll be using it much anyways. Movies and youtube videos load pretty quickly so Im not sure what the others mean by it when they state it lags. The touch pad is not a problem for me, it does not act weird or anything, it responds very well! Im sure perhaps with more use it will lagg a bit but so did my ex's HP 17' $1,5... laptop he got some time last year. After some use they all start to act a little wonky. I wish there were more colors to choose from, though blue is my favorite color, I would have preferred a silver and black one instead. Everything on this little guy works perfectly, you can always add a micro SD card to expand some memory and use the iCloud or google drive for extra storage. I've gotten compliments on the laptop how cute is looks and how the size is perfect compared to the 15' or bigger ones that make it more difficult to balance on your lap or carry around. It does not have a fan, so its silent, which I LOVE! My ex's laptop was a monstrosity and loud. I did like it but not it's size for sure. All in all for my first laptop I am pleased so far, eventually I'll upgrade to something else but for now this works beautifully.
When I first received this laptop it was in brand new packaging and looked great. I started it up and upgraded to windows 10 immediately then tried installing the free year of Office 365 it came with. After several unsuccessful tries I finally contacted Microsoft who told me it didn't have enough space. I asked them how that could be possible on a new laptop that I've done nothing on but the upgrade to windows 10. He did a scan and said there was corrupt files on the computer and said he could fix it for $99, when  I said I was going to get an exchange the Microsoft rep said Amazon would just insist it was new and not exchange it. He was wrong, I called Amazon and explained what happened and they sent me a replacement with no hassle. They were very respectful and made it really easy. On the replacement I installed Office 365 first and now it's saying I don't have enough room for Windows 10. I haven't contacted Microsoft about it yet because of the rep I got last time but I'm wondering if it just doesn't have enough space for both. Other than that, it is a great laptop in all other aspects, especially for such a great price. I got mine in magenta and it's a great color. I use this mostly for homework, which I have to use Office for a lot and watch many videos and it does great! I will update after I contact Microsoft again about windows 10. If I can get that installed and have Office at the same time I will change to 5 stars.
I wanted a laptop that I could do a bit of word processing and go online with and this is more than adequate for my personal needs. I love the color, the white keyboard, and the fact that it is very light and very portable.
I bought this to mainly be used as a vacation computer so my wife and I don't have to lug along two laptops. Other than a weekwnd get away it has not seen much use. The Stream is fine for email and browsing. The biggest issue is the small SSD size. After 6 months of ownership my SSD was down to less than 4G free despite starting out with 16G free. The only program I installed was Chrome. Turns out Windows update is the main culprit and fills up the SSD. I tried disk and system cleanup which got me to 4.5G free. I also found a manual method to remove unused windows features called DISM.exe. This helped a little and I got the not so bright idea to try compressing the c: drive. After compressing my free space dropped to 3G and when I turned off compression it dropped to 1.6G. I didn't spend much time trying to figure out what ate up the space.<br/><br/>I finally performed a recovery and got back to over 16G free on the SSD.<br/><br/>But even with 16G free I am not getting the Windows 10 upgrade option like I did on a Windows 7 machine.<br/><br/>Windows 8.1 is a perfectly good OS IMHO. But I would like the option of a free upgrade to Windows 10.<br/><br/>The screen and keyboard are fine. The trackpad seems to be a bit clunky at times. The one on my MacBook Air is much better.<br/><br/>All in all this is a good machine for what I want it for. I really think the SSD should be 64G though.
Value plus, incredible performance and value at one heck of a great price. First off I have a Toshiba top of the line laptop, and while it does have a combo drive, hooking up an external to this puppy is a snap. Removing the bloat-ware which was actually minimal on this unit too me about 10 minutes using the UNINSTALL feature in windows through the control panel. Adding memory was a simple task, bout a 32GB MSD at Walmart for $19.00 and popped it into the slot on the left side, which by the way it does NOT stick out like most do (thank you HP). As a retired senior, I like stuff simple, easy to use, and intuitive, this machine meets every requirement I have. No sound, no heat (drive-less SSD) so what's not to like. Plugged my HP Envy 4500 printer into one of the right side USB ports, it found the printer quickly, nothing to install and wallah! I was printing. Save the money, its not necessary to pay another $100.00 for the 14" model, this 13.3 is fine and my prime movies are incredible on this machine too. By the way, I also downloaded the full version of Adobe Photo Elements 13 from my Adobe account, it was a whiz to do as well. Perfect machine for students, families, seniors, and more, comes with Microsoft Office 365 for a year but I chose to Uninstall the offer. The App Store gift certificate is a nice add to buy games and apps as well. Bottom line: BUY IT YOU'LL BE TICKLED
Bought this laptop for my kids to do light school work and watch Youtube/Netflix, play some simple games, etc. The build quality and design is pretty good. It's good enough for my 6 years old to use at this price. At $200, can't complain about the performance and screen quality. The viewing angle is limited, meaning if you're not sitting in front of it, you will not get a good picture.<br/><br/>I have a Chromebook (Toshiba Chromebook 2) and while it might not be fair to compare Toshiba Chromebook 2 to HP Stream 11, since Toshiba has full HD screen and double the RAM at 4GB, I do feel that when you use a Windows machine, 2GB RAM isn't quite adequate to handle the job. Because Windows is a much more robust platform than Chromebook, it needs more than just 2GB of RAM to handle everything smoothly. However, if you're just a moderate user and don't use a lot of memory-intensive software, this laptop will work for you just fine!<br/><br/>It's got a good battery life and I especially liked the fact it turns on and off quickly due to the use of solid state drive instead of regular hard drive.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a good budget laptop for light to moderate everyday use. It's got a colorful design, 32GB of solid state drive ( you can add more memory by getting a SDHC card, and it comes with Windows 8.1 if you're used to using Windows.  For $200, this is a good deal!
This was probably the best computer I could buy for the price.  I have been using a Chromebook as my travel system and really liked the budget price and portability of the smaller device, but having decided to return to school to pursue my Masters degree I had to go back to a Windows based OS to get full Microsoft Office.<br/>  This device is operating better than expected considering the price.  I was able to remove several bloatware type programs and install Full Microsoft Office.  The device comes with a year of office 365 but I had an extra license on a previously purchased version of Office 2013.  I have not experienced any issues with lag or other problems.<br/>  This computer is not designed for high end photo editing, gaming, or any other resource intensive applications but it is perfect for normal internet browsing and Microsoft Office functionality.<br/>  The hard drive is a little small but you get a large online storage capability with the year subscription to office 365 or you could use one of the many other "cloud" storage capabilities out there like Google Drive or DropBox.<br/>  Bottom line, the device operates better than expected for the 215 dollar price tag, it is super quite, the SSD helps keep things smooth even though there is only a limited amount of RAM, and the battery lasts for several hours even when streaming videos online.
Pros:<br/><br/>Fantastic hardware design & implementation. Use of SSD memory w/mounted OS was brilliant. Cool computer that doesn't need a fan, dock, cooler or stand to keep from overheating is very very desirable. 10 hours of constant use does not cause it to heat up unreasonably. Wonderful resolution & anti-glare screen despite small size. Excellent keyboard & intuitive shapes. Excellent cost & availability and out-of-box functionality.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The touchpad is absolute trash. Terrible. Worst touchpad I've ever used. However, I use a wireless optic mouse so it's not an issue for me. 32gb SSD is puny. Give us at least 64, c'mon. Windows 8.1 w/out customization & proprietary stuff is very frustrating. Really no chance for a dual boot Linux machine, for example. Maybe in one year when all the geeks I love so dearly figure out a driver package, but it's gonna be a while at best. The Magenta/Cobalt dichotomy was frustrating. A black or greyscale or a calmer tone or series of tones would've been nice. I get the plastics have to be manufactured w/color (I used to work plastics) so I understand this may be a challenge, but they're really not ideal colors.<br/><br/>All in all:<br/>Customizability: 2/5<br/>Versatility: 3/5<br/>Functionality: 5/5<br/>Aesthetics: 4/5<br/>Pricing economy: 5/5<br/>Reliability: 5/5<br/>Hardware: 5/5
I've spent about five years now trying to dodge Microsoft and its overpriced, over-bugged, and over complicated products.  Windows 8 was the big watershed disaster, but with Stream, Microsoft is back in the game.  This notebook is a fantastic bargain at ~$200 and by being so well priced it undercuts my Chromebooks, which I've come to adore.  The basic rule would be if you don't need Windows for any reason, the Chromebook can rule.  But most of us need Windows and MS for something, and the Stream is indeed a successful Chromebook killer for many.  I effortlessly upgraded my blue Stream 13 (non-touch screen) to Windows 10, and the new system is just a massive relief from the ill-fated and awful Windows 8, with which the machine came as new.  You get one year of OFFICE 365 and that is undeniably a $60-$100 real-life usable benefit (for most) that effectively turns the price from low to no-brainer.  Plus a fresh, new installation of the latest, best Windows.  Add in the hardware, which is Chromebook-like and solid and you have a computer that works very well for very little money. Microsoft systems have been expensive and not working well for years now, but now they have it right.  LINK-<br/>
Picked up the stream 11.6 for school. I have an Acer C720P chromebook (also 11.6") I mainly use, but it can't run certain programs I need (hardware language IDEs, FPGA interface stuff, some of the heavier circuit simulation software) so I decided to get a cheap windows laptop for that. My entire experience with the stream 11.6 is colored by the last few years of using the C720P. Machine-to-machine, the stream is inferior.<br/><br/>  The screen is alright, it is matte and is pretty dim at its highest setting. I keep catching myself trying to turn up the brightness.<br/><br/>  The form factor is pretty good, it's a nice looking laptop. It's a little eye-catching. It's light and easy to carry around. I have a laptop sleeve made for 11.6 inchers, and the stream fits, but it just barely does. I have to remove my tiny usb wireless mouse dongle to get it in there. I wouldn't be able to leave in any size usb flash drive either, if I had wanted to mount one permanently as additional storage (which I considered). You'd have to buy the 13" sleeve.<br/><br/>  The speakers are pretty good. They are plenty loud enough, and the quality of the sound is acceptable.<br/><br/>  The keyboard is my favorite thing about it. The C720P chromebook's greatest weakness is it's shallow-feeling keyboard. The stream 11.6's keyboard feels (comparatively) very satisfying to type on, with lots of key travel. I prefer it to write my reports or long emails, etc.<br/><br/>  The track pad is honestly alright, with the disclaimer "For a Windows Laptop". For some reason, windows laptops always have these awful trackpads with limited motions and poor finger tracking and all kinds of other problems. This laptop has one of the better Windows laptop trackpads I've used, but it fails miserably in comparison to the C720P or any macbook trackpad I've ever used. I feel like I'm struggling with it frequently.<br/>  You can't swipe back and forward through webpages with two fingers, you can't switch between browser tabs with three fingers. All you can use it for is clicking and scrolling. Sometimes it won't even scroll.<br/>  The most annoying thing is that about half the time I wake the laptop from sleep mode, the mouse cursor has disappeared. Nothing I have tried can bring it back. I have to restart the computer. If anyone has this figured out, please message me. It is a very frustrating issue.<br/><br/>  The overall speed / performance of the stream is alright- after you remove lots of bloatware as stated in other reviews. The thing was honestly completely unusable out-of-the-box. The preinstalled programs were beating the cpu down so hard I could barely navigate a single web page. Don't buy this if you aren't competent enough with windows to remove all the bloatware and crapware that will be installed on this when you buy it.<br/>  After cleaning the system up, it runs decently well. It's a little slow to do anything. It feels extremely sluggish compared to the chromebook, but it is running full windows and is arguably more capable. It's slowness is a minor annoyance, but tolerable for the price.<br/><br/>  The hard drive- 32 GB solid state. I knew it would be small, but wow. I have a 64 GB SD card mounted to it that I am installing everything on. I haven't removed the recovery partition. I have done nothing with the primary hard drive except update windows, and it is almost full. I have 5.7 GB left. I have more windows updates waiting to be downloaded that are almost a gig. I am afraid that just updating windows is going to fill the entire hard drive.<br/><br/>  Overall, it's alright. For a windows laptop under $200, for someone with the know-how to clean up the system and get it running right, it's a decent little laptop. It can handle all the simulation and programming software I've thrown at it. It is ok with simple indy-type games (it ran Rogue Legacy just "ok"). It is an inferior machine to the chromebook and If I could do all my simulation and programming on the chromebook, I would probably never touch the stream. It runs less smoothly and fights against me just like every windows laptop I've ever used. But it does the job, and it's what I needed.<br/><br/>  Took two stars off for the trackpad, the bloatware, and the performance.<br/><br/>  As a final point I'd like to stress again, do not buy this if you can't clear out the preinstalled crapware. It is a useless machine until you clean up windows.
Microsoft Takes on Chromebooks with HP Stream 13 and 11<br/><br/>Microsoft has always been competitive in the PC market. With the growth of Chromebooks, there has been some concern that Microsoft is losing its edge, especially in lower-priced computers. The HP Stream 13 is one of the new models that may provide a solution to that problem and become competition to Chromebooks.<br/><br/>The Good and the Bad<br/>For those of you who want the bottom line right up front, the HP Stream 11 and Stream 13 has both positives and negatives about it. The main reasons to purchase this PC is its price and its ability to run desktop apps, including the full version of Windows 8.1.<br/>On the other hand, the main issues that users may have with this smaller device is that it is slow to boot up and only has an average display and touchpad. However, with a price of $200, it has a lot to offer budget-conscious users.<br/><br/>In-Depth with the HP Stream 11/13<br/>The HP Stream 11 is attractive to look at and will visually appeal to many users with its bright cobalt blue shell. You can also select the magenta shell. Either option is more fun than traditional laptops. The smaller size provides the feel of a netbook, and it is lightweight enough to carry around with you at 2.74 pounds.<br/><br/>A white keyboard contrasts nicely with the interior colors and makes it a fun device that you don't usually see at this price point. It has a modern design that will appeal to a younger generation or anyone who is tired of the plain black and grey designs that you usually see in budget laptops. With the same ports you would find on a full-size device, the HP Stream 11 is fully functional. It provides 3.0 and 2.0 USB ports and an SD card reader along with a headphone jack and HDMI socket.<br/>The one downside of the hardware for both the HP Stream 11 and 13 is the lower quality display. It doesn't have HD-resolution and the colors can look dull. However, that is common at this price and just a trade-off that you expect to make.<br/><br/>Performance<br/>In this area, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that the battery life on the HP Stream 11  as well as HP Stream 13 is decent. While it isn't the longest running computer, at just over eight hours, it has a decent run time. It beats out many other Chromebooks in this area and competes well with others.<br/>The bad news is on speed. It uses an Intel Celeron N2849 processor, but it runs much slower than many Chromebooks to boot up. It can take up to a half-minute to be ready to use while many Chromebooks take less than 10 seconds. If you aren't in a hurry, this may not matter to you, but it is a fact to be aware of. File transfers are also likely to be slower than on more expensive models.<br/><br/>A Winner in Software<br/>One of the big wins for the HP Stream 11 is the ability to run a full version of Windows 8.1. Microsoft is also providing 1TB of storage on OneDrive free for a year, which is plenty of storage for the average user. You can also download apps onto the device for convenience. It features a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 to allow you to do all of the things you need on the device.<br/><br/>Can It Compete?<br/>What it comes down to is if this new device makes Microsoft competitive to Chromebooks. The answer is both yes and no. Yes, because it offers many of the features that you see on Chromebooks that appeals to users. No, because the truth is that there aren't many competitors at this price point. Most of them start at $250 and go on up from there.<br/>What this means for Microsoft is that the company is not only being competitive with Chromebooks through the HP Stream 11 and 13, they are winning on price. For the user focused on price, they definitely get their money's worth with this device.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Shmou<br/>@krishdtech<br/>youtube.com/krishdtech
For Christmas my 9 year old daughter was sucked in by all the Surface Pro 3 commercials. It sits on the top of her list to Santa. However, being as I'm pretty close to Santa I know he won't spring the $800+ for one of those so sadly my little girl was going to be disappointed. And that makes me sad.<br/><br/>But what could I do? I didn't want a chromebook, since my daughter will want to take this with her places (friends, grandparents, etc) where WiFi isn't a given so offline use was important.<br/><br/>Then I had an inspiration: what about the Stream 13 from HP? I've heard good things and at under $250 it beats the pants of the Surface Pro for value unless you need to photo shop or something demanding.  And it's blue!<br/><br/>Well I went ahead and got one.  And I've found that for what we need it for (mostly web browsing, Netflix watching, Skype, and the occasional flash game) with offline capability, the HP Stream 13 is perfect. It's small, light weight, and I've found it to be plenty fast using Internet Explorer or Chrome browser.<br/><br/>So far I've  found the keyboard to have a comfortable enough feel (keys aren't too small and have enough throw) and the trackpad is responsive. It's usable for productivity tasks if you want it for that.  The display size is great, I think the extra couple of inches was worth it for me.<br/><br/>Bottom line, you can't remove the keyboard while doing backflips over a table (which is apparently commonly done on Microsoft Surface devices, per the commercials) but for a device to do basic work this fits the bill really well and at great value.  As of Dec 2014 you shouldn't pay more than $230 for this version so shop around. I got mine from the MS Windows store and (bonus!) it came free of all the added bloatware. Very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it.<br/><br/>For reference, I follow a basic system that says five star items are rare, they're the best I've ever seen in its' class. Fours stars means it's good, does as advertised, either better than similar competitors or it's a better value. Three means it's what I'd expect, no significant complaints but wouldn't go out of my way to use it again.<br/><br/>The HP Stream 13 gets 5 stars from me because for the size, functionality, build quality, and value I really think it is the best thing on the market today for low end light duty laptops in my opinion.
The laptop is pretty much all I need - just something to help me transfer files to an external while I'm on the road and make posts or watch Netflix. The screen's viewing angle is pretty weak and the tracking pad is less than exceptional, but that's not why I gave it two stars.<br/><br/>I bought this laptop to alleviate my troubles, but so far it has been a huge pain in the ass.<br/><br/>It is sold with a $25 Microsoft gift card that must be redeemed online and a free upgrade to Windows 10. Well, the 32 GB SSD is so full of bloatware (even after I cleaned most of it up) that you can't update without an external drive with 10 gigs (which, fortunately, I had). And, for some reason, the gift card failed to validate. I tried everything and triple-checked the steps, but it still failed. After spend 3 hours on the phone between HP and Microsoft (with people that barely speak English and just kept transferring me to different people and asking me the same questions over and over), I decided to spend another two hours in a nearby store as I considered investing in a Mac so I wouldn't have to deal with s*** like that.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I decided to keep the laptop because there's nothing wrong with it and it was a good deal, but HP and Microsoft have absolutely garbage customer service and I still haven't heard back about that silly $25 gift card.
I really wanted to like this computer. My computer experience has ranged from high end Dell laptops, to custom build desktops, to a Chromebook, and I was expecting something along the lines of my Chromebook from the Stream.<br/><br/>I bought this when my Chromebook screen and touch pad started to die, mainly because it has a slightly larger screen and can run full Windows programs but still be easily portable, which is something I needed at the time. The problem is, while a 20 Gb harddrive is perfectly fine for ChromeOS, which stores very little on your physical computer, Windows is a memory hog in every way, and any program designed for it is huge. The second problem is that Windows, sitting idle, uses more than half the RAM. So having more than about 10 tabs open causes Windows to shut everything down because it runs out. So if you are used to heavy  web surfing, or do a lot of research using internet databases, this is not for you. The track pad has been problematic from the start, but that is far less annoying than my browser shutting down 3-10 times a day.<br/><br/>On the plus side, this has a nice screen and the speakers are far less tinny than most this size.<br/><br/>In short, if you are looking for a good computer for email or to take as a travel laptop, this is probably for you. Otherwise, keep looking.
The HP Stream 11 laptop... so this laptop runs quickly and has a beautiful set up. The keyboard is a perfect size and color. The colors of the laptop itself are amazing!!<br/><br/>Pros-<br/>-Color is beautiful<br/>-Keyboard works amazing<br/>-Comes with a year of Office 365  (2013 version) which it is amazing! it works great with a new innovated design<br/>-Windows 8.1<br/>-Doesn't lag much at all<br/>-25 Dollar Microsoft Gift Card<br/>-Not expensive for a nice laptop<br/>-2.8 pounds (which it feels even lighter!)<br/>- Perfect screen display<br/>- Sound<br/><br/>Cons-<br/>-this doesn't affect the computer much but the processor is a bit older compared to other models<br/>- The touch pad is a bit sticky when it first comes*<br/>  *To fix the sticky touch pad, you will just have to use it a few hours before it becomes smooth. ALSO you should go to the settings where you can find the touch pad settings and make the SMART SENSE on the highest it can go. Then it will stop lagging.<br/>-adding the gift card was a bit difficult<br/><br/>In conclusion, this notebook/laptop is awesome! I recommend this to any student in middle school-COLLEGE<br/>You can also get this if you are not in school, but it probably would be best as a secondary laptop.<br/>This is a primary laptop for college students.
I got this for myself as a Christmas gift. My husband has a problem with electronics being delivered so this review is not verified. However, I did A LOT of research on many, many different laptops before deciding on this. It is by far the best laptop I have ever had. I am not sure what some people were expecting when I was reading through some other reviews as this is not a gaming laptop nor is it for DVD watching or burning, as it says in the description. However, you can get an external hard drive with DVD and that solves that. It has more than enough power and storage, (with all the online storage) to do just about anything a big computer can do. I work online and sometimes don't pay attention to how many windows I have open or programs are going and this Stream keeps up with it all. It is small and light enough I can take it with me anywhere, which I do. I think I have turned it off two or three times since I got it and am super impressed with the battery life. (My old laptop will only work when plugged in) I am not a fan of only two color choices but I saw those skins and am really excited that the color does not matter because I can cover it up. I am working on getting all the little accessories for this guy because it truly is the best laptop ever and I am sure it will last for a few years.
Bought it for my kids. Totally in love with it. Hard drive is solid, so it doesn't heat and I'm teaching my kids to use google docs with it. The cloud is the future so I'm very happy with this purchase.
This is our second HP Stream in our home with middle school kids who spend hours each night with homework.  We loved the price of our first one purchased last summer and since this newer model came compliments of the Amazon Vine Program we were eager to give it a try.  Set up was around 20 minutes out of the box.  You have to have a Microsoft Account  or create a new one to use the features.  It's loaded with Windows 10 which takes a bit to adjust to especially if you are used to the older Windows versions.  You get one free year of Microsoft Office 365 which was simple to download.  The laptop itself is stylish and lightweight, easy to tote around all day if needed.  Connected easily to my wireless Epson printer.  Battery life was decent and gave us several hours of work time before needing a charge.  Touch pad was responsive and there are several USB ports and one HDMI port.  My main use will be to dump photos onto flash drives with this laptop since I like to store documents on my hard drive at home and this won't handle the storage.  I see other reviewers mentioned the machine slows down with lots of unwanted "bloat" but I haven't noticed anything terrible yet.  If I find after another month using this that I run into issues, I will update my review.  Otherwise we are happy!
I received the item this afternoon a day earlier than I expected which I liked. I opened the laptop and erased some junk wares and was exploring some features it had. The window was up to date which didn't take away any of my time before I really start to dig into this new device. Everything was good, the touch pad was a little tacky but I use a mouse anyway so it didn't really matter to me. The overall system runs quite smooth and fast with no problem. It is only $230 and does a little more than what it is meant to. I liked it. The computer itself is great.<br/><br/>Anyway, after about an hour or two of setting up all the stuff for the new gadget, I was so frustrated with it because the 's' key on the keyboard started not working properly. Once I hit it, it is stuck inside and has a hard time poping itself back up. Also it makes a loud squeeky noise when it is hit, only the 's' key not others. It does pop up when I use a small pin in between the gap of the key and the board, but it gets in the way whenever I try to write 's.' it is nearly impossible to write what I want to write without a disturbance. I wanted to contact the seller first but couldn't find one for this product so I'm thinking of just getting a replacement for this soon, maybe tomorrow. I really do not want to go through the hassle of rewrapping and sending but it seems like it is the best option given. Other than this, it is a great laptop. Maybe it is just me unlucky other people seem having no problem such as mine.
I bought this laptop/tablet in March 2015. I bought it because it was smaller & lightweight. I am losing the feeling in my hands & fingers. I also was starting to have trouble lifting & dropping my old heavy laptop. At first I thought it would be nice. I did like the photo software.<br/>However after 2 months it became obvious that this laptop was more of a tablet. I tried adding more memory but this didn't help. I continued to use it until September.<br/>I made the decision to buy ANOTHER laptop in September. I would not recommend the HP Stream laptop to anyone. Most local stores have dropped the price on this laptop as it isn't selling. I believe that HP will be discontinuing this laptop. Our local Office Depot store has it listed as being discontinued and on clearance!
Installed Windows 10 the day I received it. There was not enough memory left to install the free office that came with the pc. Can not add more memory! This thing is worthless. Returned to Amazon.
Since I have to go through school and my one computer is FULL of stuff and I don't have enough money to buy a new desktop, I decided to buy this Laptop right here! I've heard so much about it and the reviews are true, after getting all the malware, programs you don't really need, and installing all your virus-protections and ad blockers and internet browsers, this laptop is really a good grab. :o I'm surprised! For 200$ it works more like a 800$ laptop, the sound on it is remarkable and crisp, the quality of the screen resolution was absolutely amazing, setting it up wasn't so hard either especially since I don't like Windows 8 very much. ;p (I originally bought it to be lazy and do my online schooling in my bed, and also watch Netflix and do various other things, nonetheless to say it was a good decision)<br/><br/>Overall I give it 5 stars all the way! Listen to the reviews, they're telling the truth. Plus all my programs work beautifully on it, and if you don't have much downloaded Minecraft actually works as well. Just keep your distance settings on low and you should be good! :) Plus the Microsoft office, dropbox, and things that come with it - Come in handy I'll say. I couldn't be happier.<br/><br/>I might buy another..xD
What a great little computer for the money, I bought an external drive for CD's and I dont find the track pad bothersome at all, its a fast little machine for basic users. The interface sometimes gets confusing but its probably Im not used to it.
This item advertises/describes an optical drive for CD's and DVDs in the pictures of this product.  This item does not come with such a drive.  I believe this to be false advertising.
The price was right at $199 when I got this during Black Friday. I do a lot of work with MS Office,  so having it on the laptop already was the main selling point for me. Out of the box it needed updating and I had to download MS Office. Updating took a few hours as usual and the only real issue I had with it was that it didn't have the bluetooth driver installed which was quickly fixed by calling the HP support line. I was going to get the larger model Stream thinking this 11" model might be small for my hands, but this is turned out to be the perfect size and I have no issues typing out reports (or this review) because the keyboard works nicely. My only issue with the keyboard is that the keys are white which I'm sure could get a little dirty. As mentioned in a few other reviews, the touchpad can be a little quirky missing or misinterpreting swipes or accidental touches, but I've learned to be a little more careful with it now so I don't have that problem as much (and a Bluetooth mouse fixes that issue altogether). After a month of moderate word processing, heavy web browsing, and watching a few movies on Netflix, I'm very happy with it.
Bought this as a gift for my mother who just needed something to read emails, browse the internet, and pay bills online with and it works great for that and is the perfect size.
Considering the cost, I have to say that this laptop is an excellent buy. It does has obvious drawbacks, however: the most prominent one is the limited 32 GB of ROM; another shortcoming is the touch pad, which in my opinion - mostly because of its hyper/hypo sensitivity (depending on which part of the touch pad you touch) - is very frustrating to use. If it wasn't for a mouse, I would go mad if I had to use the touch pad full time.<br/>Besides the great price, I love the fact that it's light weight - making it ideal for traveling; it also has Windows 8.1 (not 8.0), and it has the free use of Windows Office 365 (personal) for a year. I nearly didn't purchase this unit after I read a review from a senior user (such as myself) who complained about the size of the text (particularly when he used gmail). Although it's likely that there's a screen zoom feature in IE (which seems to have a smaller default text size), I also use Firefox, which has a relatively large default screen/text size, allowing for relatively easy text viewing for seniors/others with vision problems. The obvious lesson here: never buy/don't buy based on any one review!
This Laptop is great!!!  I had a google chrome previously with several problems that went along with it.....but my HP stream is far more efficient without any problems at all.
We purchased this laptop (HP Stream 13) for our 9 year old son for Christmas and have been delighted with it.  I did my homework and read several Amazon reviews as well as many other "techie" website reviews before going with this laptop.  I am glad I did.  The recommendations of several others helped in picking and in setting up things when it arrived.<br/><br/>In terms of bang for buck this laptop has been sterling!  It does not have a great deal of internal storage, so don't expect to be putting a large amount of media on the hard drive.<br/><br/>My son plays Minecraft, Terraria and a few other multiplayer games on it and they have all performed okay.  He has complained once or twice about Minecraft being "laggy".  I expected as much, but wasn't about to spend a ton of money to get a high performance gaming laptop.  This is great for the money.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a "gaming laptop", this is NOT it.  If you are looking for very reliable Windows based laptop, that isn't a Chromebook, or web-based machine, then this is for you.<br/><br/>Battery life has been fantastic.
It is like watching an episode of the Golden Girls or Empty Nest. I am talking about the screen colors, they have a very 80's wash to them. I personally still watch the Golden Girls so I don't mind. I Have to say that other than the under saturated colors this is a wonderful machine. Please research this machine to make sure that it is for you. I knew what I was getting and I am happy. The keyboard is wonderfully spacious and it feels very nice the press the keys. The track pad takes a few minutes to get down but it is not rocket science. I have watched you tube with no buffering. I enjoyed Netflicks with no issue. I started up Amazon instant video to see if there would be any stuttering.....no problems streaming. I got rid of some junk ware. I installed Google Chrome and it is fast with no issues. I can get to websites with speed and ease This computer works just fine..sometimes I wonder what people want.Windows works just fine no big deal. I have not had any of the issues others have complained about , internet connection is strong with no dropping. I am a full time student that uses word daily. I could care less about games and I don't need all the latest mumbo jumbo. What is this machine?? It is a basic computer for basic needs. It won't make you are star or make you rich but you will be able to do some word processing via Word or Google Docs. Another note please be familiar with cloud storage when purchasing this machine.<br/><br/>**Update** So... let me just say that I love my laptop. I got the Magenta 13, by stalking the HP website. The color is beautiful. I watched so many Youtube videos and a few movies I left it on all night and I still got three hours before I Had to charge the next day. The screen is nice and big and the keyboard is great. When you tap the back arrow be careful because this will switch applications. If you are on the fence don't be this is a great little machine especially for students.This model would be great with a touch screen, they have them on HP's website. I just wasn't patient enough to wait for magenta in the touch screen option. The price on the one is 279. 100% satisfied with my purchase.
Just got the Asus 300 13" chromebook I ordered for my mom today. Very snappy performance. Compared to my Stream 13 it feels overall snappier in WEB browsing but not by much - this has the N2830 and the stream has the N2840. The build quality is superior to the Stream though - everything just feels solid and its lighter. I'm impressed with how intuitive chromeos is, can't wait for android apps to come. But yeah, within a minute I could tell that the Stream is a better for my needs - need to run full Office and some enterprise software, plus it can do older games decently.<br/><br/>Update: Just ran an HD video on youtube side by side.... the Asus has a slightly better screen but here's a huge negative - it had several pauses during the test while the Stream just kept chugging along... The Asus is connected on 5ghz and the Stream on 2.4 so network shouldn't be an issue.<br/><br/>CS:GO runs at 25-35 fps at lowest settings - this is tweakable but this means that this laptop can handle light gaming.<br/><br/>Just compared the sound also - the Stream has much better speakers and volume, DTS studio sound.<br/><br/>So it's a trade-off, if you want a better screen and slightly snappier web performance, Chrome OS, better build quality and slightly battery life get the Asus, if you want full Windows and better media support, as well as better speakers get the Stream.
So far, so good. I was torn between a Chromebook (I've never tried) and this. I did purchase it through the Microsoft store because I didn't want the hassle of bloatware. It didn't even come with Mcafee (thank god). Shipping was free from Microsoft. Ordered it on a Friday, arrived on Monday!<br/>The version I bought comes with a year trial of Office 365.  Activating this is a bit confusing. Follow the directions included with the lap top and then 3 options pop up: Buy. Activate. Trial. You want to hit the ACTIVATE button. It’s a bit confusing because since you have a “trial” key – you would think you hit the trial button, but a trial will not give you a year. Hit the activate button and then log in the “key” code that is included.<br/>I did end up installing Google Chrome on this and it works fine.<br/>It synced up great with my WIFI and even recognized my WIFI (Epson) printer and works great.<br/>I don’t play games, and really only bought it so I can easily work/edit on Word.<br/>I do like the Windows 8 (using 7 on my Laptop) but…dislike I am not able to bypass the BING featured news.<br/>Anything changes, I’ll update. I so appreciate all the reviews (both bad and good) and spent much time trying to decide between this and a Chromebook – ultimately, it was no bloatware (when bought from Microsoft) and Word (trial) that came with it that made me choose this.
Its a great little laptop. It doesnt feel cheap. Definately plan on buying another one. Regardless of what others say, this is the best $200 you can spend on a laptop.
My mom has been using this computer and it runs great after removing all the crapware from HP's associates as another commenter suggested.<br/><br/>Pro Tip: Buy directly from microsoft's website to get their signature edition so it doesn't come with all of the crapware.<br/><br/> Its great that its fanless so I don't have to worry my mom will make it overheat by leaving it in her bed covers.<br/><br/>Good enough for web browsing and watching youtube videos.<br/><br/>If you've had other laptops that have touch screens or windows tablets, it might be hard getting used to the fact that its not a touch screen, especially with the touch interface of windows 8 that tends to pop up.<br/><br/>Another pro tip: if you don't like the windows 8 start screen, download something like "classic shell" (google it...or bing if you're like me) to get rid of the start screen and replace it with the start menu we all know and love.<br/><br/>The hardware is light weight and well built and sleekly designed. The colors might be a bit much for some but the blue is tolerable.
This computer isn't bad for the price. It has a cute design and it feels very durable. The keyboard is a nice size for a small laptop and the keys feel very responsive. The touch pad is a bit wonky and difficult to use at times so I'd recommend getting a small mouse.<br/><br/>The laptop comes loaded with TONS of bloatware. EWW. I had to use a combination of the C cleaner and decrapifier to clear up some space. The 32 gig hardrive just isn't enough to handle all the crap this pc comes with so be prepared to take some time to clean it up.<br/><br/>Over-all, I got this laptop on sale for $170 with the giftcard and Office subscription. My laptop does have 1 dead pixel but I think it's worth it for my discount. Once you get the bloatware off, the computer can function as a laptop for light web-browsing, videos, music and for productivity software. Do not expect to play many games on this PC, it just doesn't handle very well. For better performance, I'd recommend turning off automatic windows update. With it constantly running, it slows down the computer like crazy.
Bought this 11 in a month ago for $200. This laptop is awesome for the price. I can see why it has so many great views.<br/><br/>Why is this laptop worth the price?<br/>-1366x768 pixels resolution<br/>-2gb ram (instead of 1gb usually in a 11in laptop), major performance upgrade<br/>-full year of Microsoft office ALL applications included<br/>-$25 gift card for app store<br/>-fast startup<br/>-EXCELLENT and comfortable typing. keys are spaced out far enough for easy typing.<br/>-stylish looks, unusual but attractive color<br/><br/>What sucks about this laptop?<br/>-Technically it's NOT a full laptop so you HAVE to remember to watch your disk space.<br/>After all needed and recommended programs installed on this laptop, your looking at about 15gb left of space left. You can make up for it by adding a SD card of a flash drive.<br/>-Even though this has a 2gb ram speed, it will still be laggy running two different videos at the same time. For example, watching a youtube video and a netflix movie at the same time wont work too well.
This is SO light I love it!! Went through a 2 hour long security line at the airport and my shoulder was killing me, got home and saw the ads for this 3.84 pound laptop and bought it!! It arrived in about 6 days, and immediately got used and played with!! I did follow the reviewers that told me what all to delete that is preloaded as "crapware" and put on Google Chrome.  Love the blue, the keyboard is white and so much easier to see than a black keyboard. LOVE LOVE LOVE the lightness of it!! Ordered a mouse and the case from Amazon that fits it perfectly, still super light AND the case actually has enough room (without being bulky) for my Kindle Fire too!  It is fast, has a great screen and resolution, but not so good skype picture but for $199 I am beyond thrilled, if I had any grand kids the right age I would have turned around and bought them one of this!! Much better than a tablet/ipad for me as I hate using touch screens!! It is so light I don't have to use my laptop table I can rest it on my lap and it never bothers my legs!
I specifically bought this laptop because I'm not quite ready to abandon a fully computer for a tablet, but don't really need much from my laptop besides word processing, spreadsheets, web, and other basics. I'm not a gamer, graphic designer, or musician, so the HP Stream 13 was perfect. It's basic and meets all my simple needs. I've ordered a 128gb MicroSD card for additional storage of music/videos/pictures, as the hard drive only has about 21gb of usable storage, which gets sucked up quickly by other basic programs (Office, Adobe, iTunes, etc.).<br/><br/>One drawback that I've already noticed is the trackpad isn't the best. It occasionally doesn't read my finger until I lift it and re-establish it on the pad. The trackpad clunkiness seems to be a common complaint about this device so I was prepared.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this is a nice, cheap, sleek device with basic laptop functionality. I would recommend it to someone who isn't an intensive computer user and just needs something with a bit more functionality than a tablet.
I bought this laptop because I needed something light to carry in my bag to client meetings, that would boot up quickly (my old laptop takes 5+ minutes, this one takes 10 seconds) and that would run my insurance quoting software. This laptop does not have much hard drive space, but for me that's fine because all I use it for is work, and I don't work on anything that requires file space. There's enough room to save all my programs for work and that's just right.<br/><br/>If I were using this as a primary work machine, I would be quickly frustrated by it's lack of hard drive space and relative computing power. I would not use this to play games either.<br/><br/>If you just need a quick and dirty machine to connect to websites, run some small programs (not MS office, photoshop, etc) or watch videos on Netflix or use social media/email, this is perfectly fine. However, unless you have a reason to run Windows, you can accomplish all these thing with a tablet.<br/><br/>They keyboard is ok, but not great for a lot of typing.
This is disappointing.  It's so close to being a really good computer.  You are told you can upgrade to Windows 10.  Well not exactly.  As it arrives, with NOTHING additional put on it, there is not room to upgrade.  So it fails.  There's bloatware on here that causes not enough hard drive space to upgrade.  The hard drive is 32 gb, but much of it consists of hidden files and I'm guessing a restore partition, leaving only 21 gb that you can see.  It either needs to lose that partition or it needs a little larger hard drive so you can get it set up!  I THINK I can get around it, but I am an IT person.  If you are not prepared to use it as-is out of the box, don't count on easily making changes.<br/><br/>Update:  It's 48 hours later and I've found 2 people who successfully got Windows 10 on it.  But it takes a pretty good knowledge of IT to do it.  If you want Windows 10, don't get this computer or wait for a version containing Windows 10.  I'm still following their instructions without success on mine.  I have 2 more ideas to try.
I LOVE this computer.  It's fast.  It's light.  It's easy to transport.  It's cute.  It's fast.  It's a great price.  Also, I love that the battery life is long, several hours.  It's also QUIET--no fan!  I love quiet computers.  There is not much to like about this computer.  The only thing I have noticed is that sometimes the track pad is a little too responsive.  But I would rather the track pad work too well, than not at all.  Also, I almost did not purchase this computer because I thought it was slow when I sampled/typed on it at my local electronics store, but it was the store's wifi connection that was slow-- not this computer!  This is a great computer for kids/teens/adults/lovers of beautiful things.  It's great for web surfing, emails and word processing.  I have not tried any games on it, so I'm not sure how it works in that area.  Also, I hope to do basic video editing using this computer.  I will let you know how that works in a future update.  Did I tell you how much I love this computer??? Buy it.
Great laptop and I ordered a mouse to go with it.  Had a kink I n it and problem was fixed fast. Great price and I love that it came in my favorite color.
Works Great! It took some time for me to get use to it because I had a 15" Toshiba with windows XP. Then I upgraded to this. I bought it because I needed a potable laptop for when I travel to art shows, festivals, and conventions. This is very light weight yet durable. It's stylish and the screen display is very clear. The touch pad took about a week for me to get use to because it doesn't have buttons but I did get use to it and now I love that feature. The only cons for me is that it actually only has 17 gigs because they use some space for the pre-installed apps. I don't see where you can uninstall the apps you don't want so...I say if you need more space buy a usb memory or sd card. For my full review visit shortygul.daportfolio.com and check my Youtube page. Thanks. Oh, word of caution. Make sure that the first thing you do is register your McAfee/Norton security account. It will say active when you first turn on the computer but it isn't really active until you sign up.
I received it promptly and in fact. I had read many reviews so I also purchased a memory card and an external drive to help with storage and space. Of course when you log in and get started the first thing it asks about is upgrading windows and it also has information for loading office 365. I loaded office 365 with no problems however I'm having difficulty with Windows and if course I knew there wasn't enough space for windows when I bought but even I directed it to the memory card there's something wrong with the computer and I haven't even used it for anything. I may be sending it back. I called tech support when I had a chance but its frustrating because I'm too busy for this foolishness. At any rate, even though the upgrade to Windows 10 is offered as an incentive to purchase this laptop, it does not support the upgrade per the techs with HP. So I have paid $17 to have my computer shipped to them and because I've only had two days its under warranty and it will probably take four weeks to get it back...a week to get there, two weeks of repair, and a week to get back to me...so the brand new laptop will be out of my hands for a month of my warranty time...I should probably just return it....uuugghhh
My wife needed this for school. She had to have Microsoft Office and a way to browse the Internet. It does both really well and the price was great.
I was very pleasantly surprised by the overall quality and performance a the price; a great value. It did take some time and effort to clean up much of the preloaded "crapps"  (you can purchase a "clean machine" (no 'third party' crapps) direct from HP, but at a higher price . . . get less for more!).  All of three of my favorite and really helpful for Windows 8.1 laptop software applications installed and function without a problem. I also added a 64GB micro-SD card and relocated the "Libraries" to the SD, thus saving a great deal of the HP's small 32GB internal memory. The only major issue I have with this laptop is the distances between the two USB2 and the HDMI & USB3 ports: not all of my devices can be plugged in side-by-side. Minor issue: the keyboard is very good except for the glossy protective coating applied over the characters, plus the "," and "." key symbols could be lower and more distinguishable.
The actual computer I received had network connection problems almost immediately. Sent it back to HP, who sent it back to me still broken. I'm not sure if it's a software or hardware problem but it's something to do with the network driver and sometimes it works and other times it doesn't at all. However my boyfriend got the same computer around the same time and he loves his. He uses his just for internet, youtube videos, streaming music and movies and it's perfect for that. His also doesn't have network connectivity issues.<br/><br/>I notice the 2GB RAM when using many tabs, especially on chrome. And the harddrive space, if you don't set your Onedrive settings up so that you can't access files offline, is only 15 gigs or so after all the software on the computer and runs out quick.<br/><br/>It's a cheap computer so don't expect much, but if you don't need much I'd recommend it. I would have loved mine if it actually worked.
This computer is great. I've had it for about a month now and i have little complaints. It has little weigh, a good sized screen, and a full keyboard, which is great because i am a college student. The limited amount of memory does bother me because i store almost everything on my jump drive, but i did purchase a micro sd card so that i would have more space for music. The speakers are very loud but they do stick every once in a while when i am listening to music on youtube. I've received many compliments on the color, which is a very bright blue for a laptop. Depending on the angle the screen is being viewed at, it does not appear clear. The webcam and microphone is great on skype. I've seen some reviews that mentioned that the keypad is bad, but i've had no problems what so ever with mines. When you press the power button it starts up in about 3 seconds. I would recommend the computer to a college student or children in school.
I have had this computer for around 2 months, and so far I love it. I'll mention, however, that I only really use computers for typing papers, making powerpoints, and surfing the internet. So if you are wanting to know how well gaming works with this computer, or if you can make movies on it, I have no idea. In my graduate education program I have to take several online courses, and all of the syncing stuff that I have to do to connect my computer's microphone and camera to everyone else's works fine.<br/>I had read on several other reviews that this computer came with a lot of junkware, so I set myself to erasing most of that when I received it. I am virtually computer illiterate, so I basically just erased anything that did not look important. I then installed CCleaner and free Avast. It ran slow for a few days before I realized that McAfee was still running, but after I erased that it worked fine.
When I needed to replace my old 10" Asus netbook I went looking for another of those, but I fell in love with this little laptop when I saw it in a store in the blue version.  I was even more in love when I saw it in the magenta online!  I use it primarily as a second laptop to take to my office, and generally use it there for basic word processing. I find the keyboard is comfortable to use, which was a bit of a problem with my old Asus. When I had to take a laptop to a conference, I chose this over my full size primary laptop and found it was just as good at everything I needed to do.  (Plus it was most definitely the cutest computer in the room.)  I've been using it for about three weeks and have had no complaints.  Obviously it won't replace my main computer with its faster processor and all the other bells and whistles, but it's perfect for a backup machine to take the office for paperwork.
Okay so my $1200 laptop I got not too long ago DIES.  So, I start looking for new options.  Now that so much content can be stored in the cloud, I thought, let's try something that is lower cost and just plan to use the cloud for storage.<br/><br/>This is a great option.  It is still fast, though not as fast as my dead laptop had been with the i7 processor.  Still, it's not different enough to make me annoyed.  It also does well with streaming content.<br/><br/>For most computing purposes, this is a fine replacement machine at an affordable price point... I can't say that I'd want to get the more expensive machine again...  I suspect that the cloud has changed the business model for mobile computing... so I would strongly recommend something like this machine.  It's also super lightweight and easy to take with you, whereas my last machine was too big and awkward to take, esp on business trips.
Easy to set up and the gradient blue color is fantastic!  Exceeded my expectations. A lot of value for the price!  Great little laptop.
This is a good compact light weight laptop that does a lot for the money but don't expect too much. Start up takes longer than Im use to but with limited memory thats shared with the operating system thats to be expected, storage is 1TB OneDrive Cloud storage. Wonder what the cost is after the year is up, no info about this is offered that I can find. Gaming isn't a strong point, even simple games bog down with a choppy screen if that. If surfing the internet is your main need this handles most internet brosers without a problem. Battery life is short compared to a chrome book but its only a 3 cell Lithium Ion so 4 hours isn't too bad. Windows 10 has privacy issues, if this concerns you research it first. This comes with Office 365 Personal for one year. The plastic case has a soft touch that doesn't feel cheap. WiFi connects fine and has the range I expected so happy over all.
I am very happy with this book so far. It arrived the next day I didn`t even ask for rush delivery. It was smaller than I expected, I guess I forgot how small 11 inches is. Well, at least for a laptop.<br/><br/>It came with Microsoft Office Personal, a 1 year subscription (365 days) which was very elementary to set up. A few details about yourself, a quick download, and you`re done. You can immediately start using Office. It also comes with a Microsoft gift card which I used on my Xbox One, haha.<br/><br/>2 things I am having to adjust to on this book are the keypad and the screen size. I`m used to having larger laptops. This is not a laptop I could do my business or gaming on. But it`s nice just to type something up or browse the net.<br/><br/>It`s very colorful. The battery charges a long time. It uploads web pages, pictures, and documents fast. Fast download speed.
I was skeptical about this laptop because of its small size and price. I thought It is $200 how good can it be? When it arrived in the mail, I was beyond excited! I was pleasantly surprised about this product! The color is beautiful, and the screen is bright. I had read reviews about the track pad and keyboard not being too good but that however wasn't the case. they keyboard is very easy to type on and doesn't feel cramped in my  opinion. the track pad so far has been very responsive. I am not a gamer, so I can not tell you how it runs with games. internet browsing seams pretty fast. the occasional YouTube 3 second pause is the worst I have had. the Battery life lasts me all day without recharging too!!  If you want this computer for basic web surfing, social media, emailing, and typing, this computer is perfect for you!! Look no further than this laptop!! I love it!!
Bought a refurbished model, which means no MS Office Store gift certificate and no 1 year free online storage service. That's okay. Anyway, some reviewers have said this is slow, but it's working fast for me. Maybe it's a perception issue, since my 5+ year old laptop (which still works, but there are...issues) has a 1 gig brain. As for this one's hard drive, it has about 17 gigs free (Win 8.1, Bing, MS Office (which I'm not going to activate, going to use a free office suite instead), a recovery partition, and a handful of apps), which also is not a problem for me since most of what I'll be doing will be via external drives.<br/>I'm still getting used to the screen; my laptop's is about 15" and the casing around it was thinner than this one's is (about an inch). I'm also adjusting to the smaller keyboard and to the trackpad. But all in all, so far, so good.<br/><br/>Update, May 2015: Graphics are clear and defined. I use the free software XMPlay for some of the audio files, which works great; otherwise, good sound. Slows down when accessing my 1 TB external drive (this could be because it's a 3.0 in a 2.0 port; I have a 32 gig mini-usb in the 3.0 port), which means waiting until the "loading" is done before I access the files. (Remember, this is not meant for "heavy-duty" work.) "Surfs" the Internet very well. My large hands are now okay with the keyboard. Still so far so good.<br/><br/>Update, late May 2015: Moved the external 1 TB drive to the 3.0 port. It does run a little faster. And long story short: I treat this notebook as though it's a tablet.<br/><br/>Update, early July 2015: The computer was occasionally complaining that the 32 gig SD card that I bought to share between this and my other computers "needs file system repair". So I allowed this repair, but the problem kept periodically happening. At first I thought it was because I originally kept it in FAT format, or because I was watching a lot of (little) videos that I put on it, or maybe possibly the card was bad. But apparently some (?) laptops running Windows 8 and 8+ have issues with SD cards. (huh, what? Really?) and updating of the SD card reader driver is among the recommendations. But I have a little SD card reader, and the card works just fine through it and by itself with my other computers (and with the Stream if I use it briefly), so I'm not messing with things right now.<br/><br/>Another July 2015 Update: Got a "file system error" when I used the card through the little reader, so maybe possibly the card is bad. But it still works fine with other computers. I don't know...keeping the card anyway. :-p
I'm typing this on my HP Stream and I love it! I have had it about a week now and it is perfect. Or, should I say it is perfect "for me". My husband is an IT professional for a major hospital chain and I had him look into the Stream for me before purchasing one. If you are a huge gamer, then this is not the laptop for you. But, if like me, you just get online, work on documents, watch videos, facebook, etc. then this is great! I love the touch/feel of the keyboard. I purchased a wireless mouse with my Stream, just because I hate the little finger pad mouse on laptops, they drive me crazy! The fingerpad on the Stream can be set so that it doesn't interfere with your typing and I REALLY like that! My daughter wants one and with her birthday coming up, we are considering getting her an HP Stream, you just can't beat the price. Five stars all the way!
PROS:  Excellent for the price.  Lightweight, very portable, attractive, durable, superb battery life.  Runs Office and web browsers without issue.  Have had no problems with it.<br/><br/>CONS:  Lots of bloatware installed (most is removable).  32GB of storage space isn't much - even with an SD card added to store data, you are still limited to the original 32GB for Windows and Programs.  With Office, antivirus, and a few other programs installed, there is only about 4GB of free space remaining.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:  Awesome laptop for the price.  We would have liked the option to pay a little more and get more internal storage for future-proofing, but as it is its a great value.  Would a Macbook be nicer?  Of course.  But you can buy 5 of these for the price of a Macbook.  This is perfect for a student to carry back and forth to school.
I bought this laptop because i wanted a small very lightweight computer to just to some office and internet capabilities when im at work.<br/>PROS:<br/>very nice color<br/>lightweight<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>runs slow...windowns 10 loads up fast but microsoft edge and crhome takes a couple seconds to long<br/>i use a mouse but i find the mousepad supplied isnt to responsive and sometimes their is a lag on the screen.<br/>INTERNET LAG....this runs on a realtek driver that is known for its issues with internet connectivity. Example...I put this and my other computers/laptops one together...and click chrome for each.  This opens the slowest. then type amazon....this loads the slowest....I have been researching it...hp hasnt released the fix for it. up to now.<br/><br/>So jus a heads up....expect some internet problems.
At first I was second guessing purchasing this item.  Why is it so cheap I thought but after have purchased 3 laptops all over $800 in the past few years with 2 teens I decided to give it a go and I am so pleased that I did.  We have had it for about a month now and I have no complaints.  It is a perfect size for what we need, school work and the basics.  The keyboard is made well and the mouse seems to be perfectly located and very easy to maneuver.  The teens love it and my 5 year old is learning to use a laptop now.  I can't say enough great things about this purchase.  You will not regret buying this for the basics.  I have also watched Netflix on here with no issues what so ever.  This is minor but the color is exactly as pictured and is really beautiful.  It was very easy to set this up on our network and printers.
Can't go wrong for the price. Two years ago I got a Acer Chromebook. Equal to this HP. It's wonderful. With a few exceptions. One being the word processing is odd. Two being you can't hook a printer to it. And you can't set up Cloud Print FROM it. You need a Mac or PC machine to set up Cloud Print. So, I bought this little guy. Now my printer is all set up. But this little guy - which for all intensive purposes is the same as my Chromebook - is significantly slower than my Chromebook. Plus, the thumb pad can't decide if it wants to work or not. It does, then it doesn't. Then it kicks into hyperdrive. I like the keyboard significantly better than the Chromebook's. Screen image is ok. Chromebook is more clear. I like the webcam. Chromebook doesn't have that. Also, the HP runs significantly hotter than the Chromebook.
That's the laptop for office stuff.<br/>Very good quality.<br/>Used 12 seconds form boot screen to the windows desktop.
Great laptop. Phenomenal value. While I love this laptop, I can't vouche for it on Windows 10. The limited computing power seems to be further inhibited on Windows 10 as opposed to 8. My web pages load much slower and this is even after a reset. In addition to this, Microsoft got rid of smart files/place holders for onedrive accounts which significantly took back from the hp stream experience (Google Windows 10 smart files to learn more). In fact, I have a hard time seeing the appeal of the 1tb storage on this unit when they got rid of smart files.<br/><br/>Overall it's probably the best value in computing today, but is held back by software updates that are demanding more from this system. I still highly recommend this to the basic user who wants a web browser with a keyboard .
After my current 10 year old computer (also an HP which served me well) started running a bit slow, I wanted a cheap replacement just to browse the internet and watch a few tv shows from time to time - nothing fancy. About 30 minutes after starting an episode on Hulu, I was about 15 minutes into the show. I have never seen a brand new computer run so slow and freeze up so much. I figured it was due to a bad internet connection but even when trying to navigate around  the PC settings, etc (offline), I was met with "loading" symbols that lasted for minutes at a time when it should have been an easy click through. No doubt this is going back first thing in the morning. I had to write this review on my 10 year old computer or it would have taken me all night on this new one.
The Stream by HP will recognize External Drives and you will be able to utilize the whole Drive. I have a 1TB Drive hooked up to this. I successfully installed Windows 10. Make sure you Download WIN 10 to a USB or Ext Drive first, the PC needs to Boot off this Drive with WIN 10 on it. Make sure you have Windows Update on Auto and Update WIN 8.1 first. I also successfully installed Microsoft Works via a USB drive. Thank GOD those Tiles are gone from the desktop! I use Linksys wireless router with no problems. It does NOT get hot at all to me. Also the Screen is not dim!  I freed up 17GBs by uninstalling unwanted programs and apps. Also if you go to Disk Clean up, clean up System files as well. This was done on my larger laptop and I freed up 90GBs!! I have restore turned off.
I highly suspect that HP doesn't need another review but here is my impression. I have been waiting for a PC like this for many years. This is an extremely advanced piece of gear. If you don't play games all day, use monster sized applications and actually have a clue what an Operating System it is, this is the PC straight from the future. The SSD drive allows a 15 sec average boot time on bloated Windows 8.1. This is something I never thought I would see in my life time. If you don't use the SSD like a trash can you probably won't run out of memory. It takes a different mindset to not think of the SSD as a storage medium. Keep your Apps. on the SSD and store everything on flash or SD cards. I think that HP and Microsoft are collaborating to sell the stream lineup at cost.
This laptop is extremely slow and I cant get it to stay connected to my WiFi. The laptop freezes every time I try to disconnect and reconnect and when it finally loads my WiFi network is not available. I have my other laptop sitting here and the internet is working just fine. I bought this laptop just for school and I cant even do anything with it. Its a little piece of Crap and not worth $200. Definitely not getting what I paid for. Also, I change the time zone and it wont go to the actual time and will not let me change it to real time. The left pad button will only work if I press it a thousand times which doesnt always work either..the internet isn't the only thing slow when it is connected but trying to save school files from my USB to the computer is just as slow.
So if you hate Windows 8 as much as I do, do not be fooled by this "free upgrade to windows 10". I spent over 12 hours trying to get it to update. It does not come with the icon it is suppose to come with.  I finally gave up and took it to Staples. They are offering free tech support and free upgrade to Windows 10, even if you bought the device elsewhere. Well it took them 5 straight days to figure it out. Apparently HP stream is not compatible with the Windows 10 upgrade. They spent many hours on the phone with Microsoft and finally received a specific USB for HP stream to download Windows 10. So we finally have it but it was such a headache. I am very grateful for Staples and their hard work! And I do like Windows 10 much better. Much easier to understand!
Purchased the HP Stream the latter part of February 2015 for my 16 year old for her to participate in Virtual School.  We love it, she enjoys the light weight feel of the laptop and it's very fast for what she has to do in school.  She's able to access various windows her teachers request in a moments' notice and when she's done with school is able to access her favorite websites to view videos and to Skype her friends & family.  This is the 1st time I've purchased an item on Amazon and I am "now" hooked.  Not only was "this" product $100.00 cheaper than your competitors, but Customer Service was exemplary.  HP Stream gets 5 plus stars as far as I'm concerned and I'm a tough mama to sell to!<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Satisfied in SC
I purchased this laptop to use solely for streaming video and watching movies off an external drive to my 40" TV, via the HDMI port.  The video on this laptop appears to be the same quality as my "higher quality" HP Folio 9470m laptop.  I've used it for a few weeks and have been very happy with it.  Keep in mind this is a $200 laptop so don't expect the same quality as a $1700 laptop.  If you need a laptop to play around with and you aren't going to be using processor intense applications like Adobe Photoshop then this is the way to go.<br/><br/>I was already paying $9.99 a month for Office 365/ 1 TB of onedrive space so this laptop saved me $120 for the next year, effectively making the cost of this laptop only $80.<br/><br/>Great buy!
Can't be beat for the price. Super compact. I have a full Microsoft office suite installed amongst numerous other applications with still 6 GB's to spare. Using a free OneDrive account for all of my files. Was nervous about trackpad performance based on other reviews, but I've had no issues at all. Super compact. Screen is what it is...economical, but netflix and mlb.tv look just fine. I'm using my Stream primarily for grad school work and it has no problems running multiple office programs, streaming music, and browsing the web all at once. Speakers sound great and keyboard is really nice as well. The colors are a little bold, but you get used to it, and for $190 bucks, you'd be hard pressed to find a better laptop for the money. Highly recommended.
I wanted a Chromebook but because you can't use Skype on them I looked around for an alternative and, by chance, discovered the HP stream ''Chromebook killer''.<br/>I travel to the US from the UK quite a lot and bought this thinking it may save me from carrying a full size laptop.<br/>It is light and fairly fast with a quick boot time (Once I stripped out the ''Bloatwear''). I bought a low profile, 64gb flash drive to pair with it and, in one word or less, it is ''Fantastic''. The included Cloud storage works well, as does MS Office 365 (Also included). Battery life varies but with constant use it is about 6 to 8 hours over the couple of months I've owned this HP.<br/>For what this is it works well and I am happy. Forget the PC snobs, this is usable.<br/>I have found that Panda Cloud free Anti virus is best for this type of machine. It is very light and uses little resources so does not slow it down. It is also one of the best AV out there.<br/>I also use Chrome browser but only because I use several devices and can cross platform with Chrome.
Tested this out at a store and thought it was great, but make sure you purchase the Microsoft Signature Edition from Microsoft's online store (sorry, Amazon, it's more HP's fault than yours). The Signature Edition of this machine from MS doesn't include any of the bloatware/crapware that this one comes with. It will be a better overall experience to begin with.<br/><br/>All PC companies should stop shipping or selling any machines with crapware. It's unfortunate that this is the world that we live in, that a machine is out-of-the-box near-unusable because of a bunch of "free" and "trial" crap that honestly no one wants is hogging the resources.<br/><br/>It's the same issue these days with software downloads that bundle other software- this is just the hardware version of that. Ugh!<br/><br/>After testing this out, I will likely get it as a cheap Linux machine.
Does not qualify for Windows 10.  The machine has less than the required minimum free drive space right out of the box.  These are falsely being promoted as upgradable when they are NOT!  Must have a minimum of 20GB free space which aint gonna happen unless you are a tech savant.  The recovery partition and the operating system take up over 20 GB.  The free Office 365 is easy to load, the free $25 at the app store is almost not worth the time.  I could've made more money at work in the time it took to get that one sorted out.  So far the machine has no real issues other than the wrong operating system loaded at the factory.  Why not 7?  Its better than 8.1 for a PC w/o a touch screen.  That said I've done worse for more money.
This is a little no frills computer, but it is quite pretty.  It has very little bloatware on it. After I got it optimized and cleaned out, it has turned out to be a zippy little thing that boots up faster than any laptop I have ever owned.  It does not have a big memory, but it does have a card slot and usb ports if you are open to using external storage.  I prefer keeping my sensitive stuff, photos, etc off my internal hard drive so that suits me just fine. I used to restore old computers and give them away--and from that, learned to love HP and Compaq as practically un killable.  I had strayed to other brands for a few years and this is my first HP in quite some time.  I am remembering why I was so loyal to this brand!
I got this laptop last Christmas so I've had it for nearly a year. It is a pretty good laptop to use. It's also small and light, however it's not too small. It<br/>is not too hard to travel around because of its size and weight. I do wish that it could have more memory though. I like to play my Sims 3 game, but because of the limited space on this computer, I do not have room to play the game I payed for. And sometimes, the mouse pad gets kind of annoying because sometimes you just touch it and it changes the zoom on your laptop or the side menu will show up. This laptop is still great though. I recommend this laptop if you're planning on buying your children one because it's perfect for kids and teens of all ages.
Just bought this for my wife and I am very impressed with this machine at this price point. It has exceeded my expectations in performance and while it does take some effort to remove the bloat-wear and install the necessary stuff this is true of all PC's. I purchased the 4G version and happy I did. Now she can browse from more remote locations without wifi. More than anything it is a very "pretty" machine. It is the perfect size to fit in her purse. If it came in a "manly" color I would consider buying one for me to travel with. It is so inexpensive I see myself gifting this to family and friends. I can't say enough good things about it, it is a snappy little computer with a reasonably good build.
I bought this because I needed an ultra portable laptop for work that I could use Microsoft office on and browse the internet. While it does not replace my primary laptop, it is perfect for my needs. The design is sturdy and the blue, playful without being juvenile. I really like the keyboard; a lot more than I thought I would, actually. The touchpad is responsive and I experienced no difficulty with it like other people described. The screen clearly isn't the best on the market but it isn't awful either. The speakers are fantastic considering the size of the laptop as well as the price. Bought on the microsoft store for $179 and best of all, no bloatware! Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase!<br/><br/>--Update--<br/>After using this for almost a week I have to say the hard drive does get filled up very quickly. Note that I am running just the bare minimal in terms of programs and apps. I've only installed office 2007 that gives me just over 10GB of Hard disc space. I purchased a 64GB SD card (like other users recommended) to increase the storage capacity and that helps. Since I only intend to use this at work where I need to reference pdf files, prepare documents and browse the net, it is just about enough storage, but space definitely could be an issue depending on what your requirements are. While I haven't noticed any problems when using multiple tabs, if I start to watch a YouTube video with other tabs open, at times there is considerable lag. Still pleased with my purchase but just note that it is important to think about what your individual needs are before purchasing this (or any other laptop).
I satisfied with my HP Laptop. I like its design and color. especially, I like to its weight. It is light.
Perfect for students. Light weight and functional. Does the basics well (everyday Internet use,  schoolwork, etc;) Battery life is decent. The blue color is a little bit loud but it looks cool, especially for the younger crowd. The keyboard backround fades from dark to light blue under white keys which I'm worried might get dirty.<br/><br/> I bought the 11.6" from the Microsoft website, signature edition, for 199.99 (Shupping was also free)<br/><br/>I would have bought from amazon if they didn't raise the price 80$ literally overnight, but buying the signature edition meant that it came without all those third-party apps you have to uninstall.<br/><br/>Would not pay $280 for this laptop.
I own this computer and it runs better then my cousins Acer and their larger HP, I can quickly use it on the internet and for college and multitasking, I have not had one problem and the computer is durable and doesn't feel like a cheaply made larger computer, has a nice matte finish paint easy to grab and wont show scratch's easy, or fingerprints, keyboard has a good feel to it and keys snap nicely, if you want a computer that runs quickly and proficiently and not over pay for some big screen slow computer then I would defiantly  recommend this computer.<br/>* I use this daily, for college, notes, word, browsing, Netflix, YouTube, social media, emailing, and business with out any problems
I've now had this for a little over 6 months.  I use it for personal stuff like email, surfing the web, checking facebook,, and keeping spreadsheets for my monthly household expenses. I keep my files, especially my pictures on the cloud. I found it necessary as there is very little in the way of a hard drive. Six months of light duty use and I keep getting a message about low memory. It is so low, I was unable to upgrade to Windows 10 as it didn't have enough room. Now I also have to put up with an annoying message about it being ready to install. This laptop is OK for extremely casual use. In my opinion, it would not suitable for things like working from home or playing computer games.
I enjoy this computer its light weight. Only problems doesn't have much memory but not a problem for me.
I bought this thinking I would use it to do some work in cafes or other wifi spots.  I seem to always have trouble w getting online.<br/><br/> It's a cool looking computer and obviously cheap but my iPhone is far more powerful than this thing.  It makes me impatient trying to do work on this machine.<br/><br/>Also since you need access to the Internet to look at your files etc., the wifi issues kind of prevent me from using it to do client presentations and the like.  I guess maybe I could do that by using an jump drive but still.  The handiness I was hoping for does not seem to be there.<br/><br/>I still use it sometimes and figure it can be my toddler's laptop down the line.
I am a college student and wanted a lightweight laptop that I could use for doing homework/research, writing papers, and watching Netflix. This laptop has definitely met my needs, and the price can't be beat! I would not recommend this for anyone who needs to do anything more complicated with their laptop - I don't know that it could handle a lot of the photo/video editing or gaming software, and there really isn't much storage at all. I have a little flash drive that I use to store my photos and documents on so the storage isn't completely maxed out! It has not been enough of an inconvenience for me to regret buying it, though -- I love this laptop (and how little it cost me)!
I like so much about this laptop -- it's not my MacBook Air, and that's not a fair comparison, but it feels similar in size and mechanics and that's a good thing. The only downside I see so far is with the Office 365....I don't like it. It is somewhat like Google Docs or Dropbox, and the instructions are not very clear. A bit clunky and circuitous. I prefer to have my Office living on my laptop, not in cyberspace. I can save docs to my documents file, but as I need professional documents I am sharing with others, I am not confident in the compatibility and the fact that the docs live in the Cloud. Overall, though, it does what I need it to do for browsing and online work.
I have a thing for HP laptops. I never had a bad experience. I bought this one because my old HP started to ask for retirement. I like the look of this laptop. It's cute. It's very light and slim. I wasn't expecting the audio to be this good. The image is of quality too. It came with 1 year Office 365, which is very helpful for a college student. So far so good. It has been a good laptop for the price I paid. The only thing I am not sure if I like is the battery. I was used to the batteries that you could replace but this one is built-in. Oh! Also the battery life lasts pretty long. Last time I calculated it took 6 hrs and half and I downloaded stuff and watched videos.
I bought this laptop to replace a much older and slower HP mini. For the price, the HP Stream is pretty hard to beat and I'm very satisfied with it. It's much faster than the older mini and I find I can do everything I want to do. It comes with Bluetooth which was a selling point for me. And that's why I give it onlly 4 stars. Out of the box, it couldn't find my mini Bluetooth speaker. After fiddling with it for a couple hours, I called HP support. After performing remote diagnostics, she deleted & reinstalled drivers and then it worked fine. I should not have had to go through that with a brand new PC. Aside from that glitch, I do (and have) recommend this computer.
I am not an expert computer user. I ordered this the HD Stream for online classes, watching movies, check email, and online banking.<br/><br/>Pros: price is right. Very light, easy to carry.<br/>Cons: Finger mousepad is finicky, often not responding on the first click or attempt to move. This gets old fast. Other big con: difficult to do more than one task at a time, as the computer will run slow/freeze. Even watching netflix with nothing else running is a challenge. I took the time to get rid of bloatware, and I don't store much of anything, so I doubt that's contributing to slowness.<br/><br/>All that to say I don't know that I'd recommend it, because it's sort of important for the mouse to work and serve the purpose I ordered it for, which so far, it has not done smoothly.
Office 365 activation key was invalid. Microsoft refused to replace key, so I had to return the entire computer to amazon for replacement.
Mouse pad has started to malfunction. Cursor jumping all over the place. In the second month of use.
Exactly what I always wanted during the 18 months I used my $200 Chromebook--an equally inexpensive, full Windows laptop that runs Office, has an SSD, doesn't lag, has almost workday-long battery life, a great keyboard and is affordable enough to easily replace. The screen isn't high-end and like many have said, the trackpad is annoying. (You can never get the settings just right to stop it from feeling like it's working against you.) But even with those two issues, I love using this machine. It feels too good to be true, but it really is the laptop I've been waiting years for. I replaced both my work laptop and my home Chromebook with this one machine.
I absolutely love this laptop . I received this as an early birthday present from my mom and it's everything that I expected and MORE ! I've read many reviews and watched many reviews before telling my mom that I wanted this product ( more negative than positive ) . Even though I took everything that I heard and saw I took into consideration I still decided to pursue buying this product and I am more than happy that I did . I was however on edge about the size , but I was very surprised when I brought it out of the box . This laptop exceeded my expectations and whoever is on edge about buying this laptop/notebook ... DO IT ! It's well worth it .
No problems. Operates fast and does all that I need and more. For the price it is the best value.
I'm able to carry this with me to school and it is so light! I was so tired of carrying around my heavy 16 inch HP that I bought a few years ago- so heavy and annoying, wouldn't even fit on my desk in class. This laptop is perfect. Before buying this I bought the Google Chrome book and did not like how I could not save anything on the actual computer. Then I bought an acer and it came defective. I should've stuck with HP from the start. The system runs smoothly and the battery does last quite a bit. This is perfect for individuals who want a light laptop for every day use and especially for college students like myself.
I love this! I was questioning it due to needing it for school but it turned out to be great.
I love this little notebook!  Light weight, easy to hold on one's lap and take anywhere - just what I wanted!  The reason I knocked it down a star is that is does not keep it's wifi connection.  For some unknown reason, like once a week, I have to reconnect the wifi - and I am not taking it away from home.  There is no reason for it and my laptop does not do this.  It is such a small screen that internet browsing is a chore because it is hard to read the very small print and I haven't found a satisfactory solution.  Just to use the word processor, it is fabulous.  Other than these two small issues:  I love it.
Bought 3 of these and they all seem to function as expected. I am using these in a classroom with 3rd graders so the keyboard size will be perfect and you can't beat the price.  The only issues are all related to Microsoft.  Windows 8 is just another bad idea. Microsoft,  if it's not broke, don't try to fix it.  Also this comes with one year of Office 365.  Took two hours to get it activated, including one hour on hold to Microsoft support. Needed machines that kids could work on without internet access and ones that had USB capability.  Ipad and Chromebooks would not do the job and these were so much cheaper.
It's a nice little piece but seems to be slow to response when Im trying to type something.
If I could give it zero stars I would. This arrived and my daughter was super excited. She loved the color and how light it was. We began the setup process and as it was installing Office, it took 2 hours to get to 1%. She had to go to bed for school the next day but when she woke up, the thing had a white screen and wouldn't do anything. Called HP and their solution didn't work. Returning it with a very disappointed child. I think maybe the moving parts in the mail may have done this or it's just an awful computer. Not sure but I recommend spending your money elsewhere. Quite disappointing.
Awesome computer! Looks and feels so good! I bought this for my wife who was ecstatic with it.<br/>It's lightweight compared to my Toshiba Satellite. It was Windows 8.1 which can run programs that my Chromebook can't.<br/>It boots up fast and shuts down fast which my Toshiba usually takes 5-10 minutes to shut down!<br/>It may not store much but that's ok she's using this for web browsing, email, and music listening.<br/>And we can take this on vacation since it's light weight.<br/>This works like a regular computer although there's no DVD drive, but when's the last time I popped one in?
Very slim and responsive.  Nice screen.  Fast WiFi.  Keyboard has a good feel.  I'm still learning how to use Win 8.1 but doesn't seem all that much different for what I do.  My desktop has Win 7.  I haven't had a laptop for several years so this will make work on the road easier.  Good price for what it does.  A free year of Office 365 and 1 Tbite of OneDrive makes a nice package.  The well documented limited hard drive storage (about 8 Gb available on the SSD) could be an issue but with the 3 USB and micro SD ports, there are plenty of ways to store data even when not using cloud devices.
So I got this as a Christmas gift from my uncle and I loved It. Its a good ish laptop but I ran this thing like a Razer blade pro<br/>It crashed, blue screened and deleted Windows I don’t know why but Im now running Linux and I hate it<br/>So if you are going to tun this thing like an alienware or a Razer Blade pro beware<br/><br/>I liked it while it was still running<br/>It has skype already installed and the power in this thing is unbelievable<br/><br/>This is good for running word and photoshop and other things but not for a lot of gaming. NEVER<br/>cause this thing has no fans
I bought this for my son who is 14 he basically is an internet surfer and you tube Netflix streamer.  Typical of his age.  It came along with a gift certificate for some application and he uses it regularly to surf the net it is fast and durable.  I cannot complain because at the price it was truely a bargain I did not want to pay 600 or 700 dollars for a laptop when my child only really surfs the internet and plays browser games.  It comes with Windows 8 as well.  Very good deal and was packaged great  so that there wasn't any damage during shipping.
For the price, this is a great computer.  I've had it for a few weeks now and I haven't had any problems with it. Once I got used to Windows 8.1 I got to really like this little computer. It does everything I need it to do: run a word processor, surf the internet, and run Netflix. If you need much beyond that, you need a different computer. You won't be able to store much music or really any games or movies on this little guy. But it's great for a student or someone who just needs a regular computer to supplement beyond their tablet or smart phone.
***Update - Computer is now dead.  Lasted a whopping 4 months before some error came up during startup once and now, its dead.  HP warranty is 90 days -  amazing how they time those warranty programs.  It's a POS from the 32G hard drive that is consumed by Microsoft's OS...just don't - spend your money on a real computer, not this mickey mouse POS.
I got this laptop in January and it worked really well for a while. I only needed it school work which is basically all online and it fit my needs. However about five months later it just stopped working. It turned off and never turned back on. I tried charging it, I tried rebooting it, but nothing worked. Then I used the warranty and I received the same computer brand new. But two months later the same exact thing happened.  However my sister has had one for about a year and she hasn't had any problems with it. I don't recommend this laptop.
$217 $217 $217 $217. I can't believe it. Where do I start?? Purrfect  for college students. The Microsoft 365 is a fabulous addition. The color is amazing. My keyboard showed up different then the picture  but who cares it ended up being an ombre blue....yes I said ombre. The laptop is very thin, and the TouchPad I find very doable unl I keep other reviews suggest. Very zippy bloatware included. Please don't delete anything, you don't need too. If you read the reviews everyone who has a problem with the laptop tried to delete  bloatware.
After only one month on this computer the software all went to hell.  Customer service for the computer told me they could not support me unless I paid $120 for support.  This computer was purchased for $230 and they wanted to charge me more than half that for customer service.<br/><br/>The computer from the get go was not easy to use.  It does not have Ethernet ports and the volume of memory was no where near enough.  The computer itself looks cool, but that is it.  Do not buy this computer.  I have had nothing but problems with it.
I purchased this laptop to haul around for college because my old laptop was rather heavy and it's short battery life got to be a nuisance.<br/>I expected not to use this laptop for much other than class, but boy was I wrong. It's super lightweight, got a battery life of maybe 6 or 7 hours, and although it's not as fast as a ~4 or $500 pc, it doesn't really have that many issues performance-wise. Don't expect to play too many games on it but it can stream 1080p video without hang-ups and can handle any school related work with ease.
First off, understand that this is not a high performance laptop.  You really need to go into this purchase with a clear idea of what you use your laptop for.  I use mine to surf the web, write in MS word, and occasionally play some old school RPGs (I'm currently playing Fallout 2, which came out in 1998).  This computer does those three things extremely well for a rock bottom price.  I've only had it for a day, so things may change, but for a light user (which i consider myself) this little computer can't be beat.  The free year of Office Personal and MS storage makes this a great value.  Windows 8.1 runs flawlessly and the web loads up with very little lag.  There isn't much storage space, but with 3 USB ports you attach some flash drives to make this machine work for you.
Bought for our daughter to start college with. She wanted something small enough to fit into her purse but, with a big enough screen so she could see it easily and have a full size keyboard. This is a perfect size and weight. Wouldn't recommend it if you need to do heavy duty graphics or gaming, but mainly she needed it for writing reports and doing internet research. Her only complaint is the color. You have your choice of bright blue or pink. She said it looks like it's for a 13 year old and wishes it came in black or silver.
This laptop is small, thin and light.  And it's a beautiful color blue.  I love everything about it.  I was able to download everything I needed and I did it all by myself.  I am not tech savvy so I was worried that I would need someone to help me with this when it arrived.  The directions and support that come with the Stream are great and very easy.  If I can do it, anyone can!  It does everything I need it to do and a lot of things that I haven't even begun to figure out.  It also can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free.
This a great little laptop.<br/>I bought this laptop for school. My primary use will be for writing. It's fits right in to my broke student budget. Lightweight and performs reasonably.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Keyboard<br/>Sound<br/>Speed<br/>Color (pink, yay)<br/>Price (!!!)<br/>Windows<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Track pad leaves a little to be desired<br/>Screen clarity isn't great from all angles.<br/><br/>I would recommend buying this if you are a student or if you'd like to buy a laptop you don't mind the kids using.
This is a pretty solid laptop and can't be beat for the price. Sure there are things that can be better, but you have to keep in mind it is a $200 laptop. This makes a great computer for people that just need a computer for basic things and don't want to spend a ton of money. I'd recommend buying the microsoft signature edition or reformatting the laptop immediately if you don't. There was a quite a bit of crapware loaded on it which did slow it down noticeably. I'm currently running windows 10 and its running very well.
Perfect for school very thin and just the right size. I love the apps as well
That is very nice pc for me. You shouldnt expect many things from this little machine. But for me, it is a lot better than a tablet. Keyboard is very nice to type, battery life  also lasts very long. Screen quality is not best since you cannot open a video in 1080p quality but I think that is normal for this quality. Overall, if you would like to do some basic stuff like searching web, using windows office and checking email, this is for you. why you gonna pay triple for any tablet.<br/><br/>strongly recommended.
I have had mine since January and i really like it. I needed it for school so i ordered it and it runs great. Can't go wrong with the price for a good quality laptop. If you need very little space like for school essays and to do your quiz or test then this is for you. If you usually have about 15 or more programs running then this isn't for you. For my school needs it works great! The blue in this display picture doesn't look appealing to me but when it came in and i opened it i liked the color as well.
Great quality product. Well made, good screen quality, and fast enough for web browsing and a few applications. Got this for my kid to use since 99% of what she does is on the web, and it is working very well. I had a Chromebook in the past and this is much better with the Microsoft products on the unit. Added a 64G card and this provided all the storage space needed for her music and pictures, as well as whatever documents she might create. I thought the color was a bit loud but my daughter loved it.
The only reason I'm giving this three stars is for the way it feels. I'm a writer and wanted something light but with a full size keyboard. This is great when you spend hours a day typing. Unfortunately, after upgrading, adding an antivirus + writing software, and attempting to uninstall some of the junk that came on it (most wouldn't), there's no longer enough space to install updates let alone the 1 year of office 365. I'll keep it for the comfort but will be buying something new as soon as I can.
It's perfect for my writing. I have the Windows Surface and love it, but I ran into the problem of not being able to download the writing programs I needed. The HP Stream 11, about the same size of my Surface, solves that problem. It's lightweight and as easy to use as my Surface. The day I received it, I downloaded my writing programs and now I'm able to be out and about and keep up with what I'm doing IN the programs I use. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs great functionality at a great price.
I love this thing because it does all the simple things I need a computer for with incredible start up speed. My more complex laptops take so long to start up that I end up looking something up on my phone. This is fabulous for you basic laptop needs and it's really light weight. I've only had it for maybe 9 months or so and it's still running great, but if for some reason it were to break after a year or two, it's only $200. I can buy 5 for the cost of my last laptop and I like this one way more!!
Its absolutely beautiful!!!!! I love this cute, mini conmputer :) I have completely fallen in love wit it. At first I noticed the touchpad didnt have two buttons at the bottom but its ok. I learned how to operate it and you can still use left, right click, and even highlighting text abilities without a wireless keyboard so I learned quick. I just needed something simple but cute because I just gave away my compaq presario computer when this bad boy arrived :) I am so happy and reccomend this to all
It does the job.  Inexpensive and portable, just what I was looking for.
Great laptop for school use. Know what you are getting though. its not a machine to run Photoshop and such. Its great for note taking and writing. web browsing and such. long battery and no heat/noise output. also if you want to play media in 1080p to a 1080p display it can run it smooth and nice.<br/>Delete the HP junkware and you're good to go.<br/>I got both the 11 and 13. and the there is a major difference to note. the sd card reader size is full on the 11 and micro on the 13
As a student, this laptop fits the bill perfectly. Slim, lightweight, and powerful for a computer of its price range. I would be remiss if didn't mention that this laptop comes pre-loaded with adware and spyware disguised as harmless programs. Most are easy to remove and/or disable if you consider yourself a "power user" or are decently familiar with windows funtionality. It's just frustrating that modern computers come from the factory like this. Doesn't seem right.
You can't expect more for $200.<br/>It's quiet good for the price. The downsides are the processor which is quiet slow for tasks other that chrome with only 1 tab open, and it's trackpad is not the best.<br/><br/>I had to buy an extra SD card to install something on it, and a mouse as well. So in the end I ended up paying $300 with the accessories.<br/><br/>Most of the issues though are from Windows 8 I believe. The bad trackpad recognition comes as well from the OS.
The first impression is a beautyfull laptop this orchid color is fantastic for me. I was tryng to use win8 but it's not for me, so a friend of mine change some patches and now I have the old characteristics of win7 but runing in win8, Installing office 2010 and eliminate a lot of trash, installing chrome and now I have a Powerfull laptop, I buy a Samsung 64GB SD MEMORY to manage my documents, great computer to manage my thesis. For only 200 bucks it's really a bargain
I purchased this laptop for my daughter. She primarily used it to complete her classwork, which included essays and online tests. The laptop connected to my network easily, and was dependable. The small size makes it easy to carry. However, the screen is also large enough to utilize streaming services like Netflix. She didn't have a need for a computer with a massive storage capability, and thus, this laptop is a great fit for her. I am very pleased with the product.
It's a nice little laptop for light work. Good for casual net surfing or basic work. If you're looking for a work horse, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. Still, once you go through the arduous task of getting it set up and removing the shovelware, it's a nice laptop. Definitely worth the price. I do suggest you buy a mouse to go along with it, though, because the touchpad is iffy at best. That's really my only issue with this laptop. Otherwise, it's $200 well spent.
I don't know why everyone complains about the add-on software. It doesn't have any more than any other laptop I've ever bought. Also, the battery life seems phenomenal in my opinion. It may not be fast enough for gaming, but it's plenty fast for my personal business and home office. I'm very pleased with it.<br/><br/>Update: After six months of use, the battery seems to be losing its ability to hold a charge. Every time I go to use it, the battery is low or dead.
Love this little HP Stream 11 Laptop computer. Does everything I need for on the go. I still have a large laptop but this computer meets most of my daily needs so I do not use the large one nearly as much. It is wonderful that it came with Office 365 Personal for a year. I had looked at this computer elsewhere but Office did not come with it but had to be purchased separately.<br/><br/>Shipping was fast and well packaged. Easy set up. Easy to get the programs I needed on a daily basis. I am extremely pleased.
I finally (I think) have got rid of the junk on this computer. It was unusable as I received it. Had to do a full reset once and a refresh twice. I would not recommend it to someone who knows little about computers. Aunt Nell would likely pitch it into the river and start drinking whiskey straight from the bottle or fruit jar depending where she bought her refreshments. Must have been twenty places sending popups to it. I know the 'net is a mess but really....
First of I got this within 7 hours of ordering, that was crazy fast!!!!!!<br/>Thank you to the thousands fulfillment associate that works on this :D<br/>Honestly this laptop works great, great size and super light and I also bought this with the bundle which is really a great deal. And you get $15 dollars off voucher for the next Microsoft item you buy so yay!!! Free money<br/>The free 1 year subscription of Microsoft Office is god for 1 pc/mac + 1 tablet
A really lightweight laptop. Value for money and it comes with latest windows 8.1 usability. Performance wise, don't expect too much as it's running an low cost, low power consumption processor. But if you are just surfing the web and checking emails, this should do the job well :)<br/><br/>With a higher budget, get this<br/>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PPTP9IO?ie=UTF8&camp;=213733&creative;=393185&creativeASIN;=B00PPTP9IO&linkCode;=shr&tag;=civcikdx-20
This little laptop is a sleeper hit!  $200 usually gets you a Chromebook but now you get a full Windows machine.  This is not Windows RT, this can run actual .exe programs.  SD card expansion slot, headphone jack, usb ports, loud speakers, great feeling keyboard and my favorite part is it's fanless.  No worry's about throwing this in a laptop bag as it won't overheat.<br/><br/>My video review can be found here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlZkqk66w08
This is my first laptop that has an SSD. It boots very fast compared to one with a conventional hard drive. My wife uses it to take notes in her college classes, and its size and speed works well for that. She paired this with a 32GB SSD so she has a little more storage. If you are looking for a laptop in this price range you are probably seeing many Chromebooks, with this you can spend the same amount and have Windows 8.1. The blue color looks nice too.
THIS IS USELESS....DISCONNECTS ALL THE TIME AND WANT A REFUND......
I just recieved my HP stream 13 and I already love it. it is much prettier than on the picture, lightweight, and overall a great product. but it did take me a long time to remove all the crap and install necessary programs. it is pretty fast, And I love the gradient blue look. it can be a little slow when switching between pages, but nothing too bad. so if you're looking for an alright laptop for a good price, this is a great one to put your money on.
I've only had my gorgeous new computer for about 2 hours, but I'm already in LOVE!!!! Very simple to set up, the color is PERFECT, and I could not be more pleased. It's lightweight, compact, and EXACTLY what I've been wanting for MONTHS. I was going to order the same computer in blue a few months ago, because the 13.3 inch was not available in the pink... I am SO glad I waited.. Now I must shop for some accessories :) Would DEFINITELY buy again!!!!!
It's Pretty decent. It has all the functionality of a nice Windows laptop.  With such low configuration I would have expected to be little lighter. It comes with half the Memory left and if you update to windows 10, you will be very low on hardisk space because it will keep the windows.old file. So, make sure you delete the old installation of Windows after you upgrade to have any space at all. Other than that, pretty good for basic functionality.
I absolutely adore my HP Stream 13 Laptop!  It's perfect for me.  I mostly just check emails & Facebook & weather.  My husband does all the heavy-duty bill paying on his main laptop.  This is such a great size & large enough to see well, yet small enough to put in your lap when watching t.v to surf the web!  I'm so glad my son referred this particular laptop to me since he knew exactly what I needed.  Thank you HP for another fantastic product!!!!!
Very pleased with computer. I bought it for writing but once you remove all the extraneous programs and links it very fast. It doesn't have enough space even with all the deletions for windows 10 so if you need that then buy that don't try to add. This is not a gaming machine its for term papers, spread sheets, stories and general surfing. It starts fast it works best with a mouse but all in all I'm very please with the machine verses the price.
The HP Stream Laptop is perfect, small enough to carry around, but not too small to see the screen. It's light and portable, not to mention the beautiful Pink color. It runs super fast. Totally love it! I just wish the hard drive is bigger, but it's not a big deal for what I'm using. I can always get an external hard drive if needed or save everything on the Cloud drive or Google drive. The price is awesome for what it is. I'm highly satisfied!!
I like it so far. I chose the blue versus the orchid because it seemed to bright. The keys are easy to type on and the setup was easy. The only problem is that it doesn't have enough memory to do the update for Windows 10. The mouse pad is extremely sensitive and I have now ordered a wireless mouse for it. Other than that, it suits my needs for completing my school work. Great buy for the price and better than the Chromebook I was gonna get.
I use this computer for school and love it. The mouse sucks but I just got a wireless mouse. I got the people one. It has amazing battery life I probably charge it once a week and I constantly turn it on and off. Use it for college which takes a few hours, it's cute I always get complements on it. It's people on the top and goes to a dark pink towards the bottom. One bad side; not allot of memory but i got a flash drive to help that problem
This a great laptop, for what you pay. I was looking for a cheap laptop for school and I found it. It does get a bit hot on the bottom and the storage is very limited. It is a 32GB HD but remember that Windows takes up some space, so you are left with about 10GB of real storage. In other words, use a cloud storage solution. Keyboard feel nice. Trackpad is decent. Battery life is sufficient. Overall, this a very solid little laptop.
Exteremly slow compared to my chomebook. You can barely browse with one tab. If you use 2 or more tabs everything reloads and is very slow. It was good for the 1st month but I've used mine for a few months and I will get rid of it. Ridiculously slow performance. My cell phone is faster than this laptop. The battery and build isn't bad. But the actual performance is terrible. Using facebook or google is frustrating. Please dont buy!
So far so good - just purchased, have not had any problems except those that naturally come with getting used to a new computer. Battery life is AMAZING. I'm using mostly for internet research and word processing, and it lasted REALLY long before I had to plug in. Obviously not a top-of-the-line model, but the price is unbeatable and the computer is perfect for everyday use. Very lightweight, too. Will update if I have any issues.
Works as expected. The main downside is the track pad. It doesn't always recognize the gestures I make, and takes quite an effort to press. Adding an external wireless mouse fixed these problems.<br/><br/>The viewing angles for the screen aren't great either, but are acceptable. For the price it is a good buy if you have basic needs such as web browsing and using Office. This machine is no power house, but gets the job done.
Very good quality.  I think the concerns over the installed software are a bit overblown.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  I'm not a great fan of Windows 8, but its still nice to have a full version of Windows vs chrome.  Yes the keyboard might not have the quality of a thinkpad, but it only costs $200.  I can't think of $200 better spent, if you showed it to anyone they would guess it cost well over $500.
A very nice computer works well and no real problem execpt one. Even though is says it can be updated to windows 10 it dosent have enough memory to do so, although it allowed to use an external dirve. i did this and for some reason it failed, i tryed everything but in the end i had to call up HP and request a recovery disk. luckely after the disk the computer worked. Atleast the custmer service wasent that grueling.
The computer is fine. 32GB is very small for HD.  You only end up with 10GB or so after the OS and system files.  Buy with an external drive or stick.<br/><br/>What I hated the most wasn't the computer itself, its all the "bloatware" that Amazon puts on it.  Cleaning that up took forever.  For that reason I would spend the extra $20 or so and buy from HP or Microsoft certified without all the extra crap.
I bought this laptop for my autistic son. It is an awesome laptop but not very sturdy. However, I must say, it's extremely usable for the price. It's not a gaming laptop, but mainly it's for surfing the web and doing homework and watching streaming videos.<br/><br/>What I have a problem with is the HP service. This laptop has a one-year warranty but getting HP to respond has been a nightmare. Same with Amazon.
Great machine and great buy.  I would have given it 5 stars but I did have some trouble installing the Office 365 one year subscription.  My subscription card did not work and I had to go through two levels of support and several hours on the phone before they just sent me another subscription card.  I finally have my 1 year's subscription to Office 365 working which really makes this purchase worth the money.
UPDATED:  Have had it about a year and am very restricted by memory size.  I have added almost nothing beyond factory,  but there is not enough memory for Windows 10.  Also, if I have more than 4 tabs open when surfing the internet, I get a message that  it is out of memory - it will not access any more web pages until I close some.  I would not purchase this it again.<br/><br/>Love the size of this little computer!  I like it so much better than using my tablet.  Not real powerful so we have large apps loaded on server and I work through the server when needed (like Microsoft Office).  It does all I need it to do.  Surfs the internet quickly. It hasn't locked up once and I have had it about 2 months.<br/><br/>I am still adjusting to Windows 8 however.  Not crazy about it so far.
This is a cute little notebook and it's great for surfing the web.  My only complaint is that it advertises Office 365 for one year and 1 TB of storage in a drop box, but there was no card to claim this in the box and when I went to the URL suggested on the box, it said I needed a promo code/access code to register for the 1TB and the Office 365 was going to charge me $9.99 a month after the first month!
Love this small, light weight notebook! This is absolutely perfect if you're going to school and just need one to do just that. School. I would give it five stars howeveeeerrr.... It only has 25 GB internal memory!!! You can very easily fit more on it, to compensate they offer a year free cloud drive of 1 TB, but I'm not one for 'cloud' data, see what happened to Jennifer Lawrence??? Yea not me pal!
I've bought it for my wife and she loves it. Instead of paying $150+ to a tablet, we decided to try this machine. What a good decision! The performance and capabilities of this laptop definitely surpasses a tablet of the same price. Also similar to an ordinary laptop, connecting it to all peripheral devices like printers, scanners, external hard disks and CD/DVD drives are possible and very easy.
I bought this laptop last year as a christmas present for my grand daughter, its not functioning now. My grand daughter was 11 years old when I bought this HP Stream 11.6, I thought it would be perfect for her age group, however I now know I should have spent the extra bucks and bought a real laptop. You live and you learn, this was an expensive learning experience since it did not last long.
Love love love this! I bought one ...I received it....I immediately bought a second one! I read a review stating it was more powerful than the Netbooks and the Chrome books and that was the truth. It was an easy set up and my daughter and my husband love it. Neither of them download many things such as games or pics so I can't review if that would be a problem. I received this item in 2 days!
I hadn't had a new laptop since 2009 & my old one was on it's last leg.  This is a good machine.  Ssd makes it very fast.  It weighs less than half my old one.  Buy a 64gb or 128gb micro SD card and you have a monster of a machine.  Now the specs on this aren't going to blow anyone away, but if you want a nice windows 8 (or I guess windows 10 is free for current 8 users) this is a good value.
i love this thing.  i am actually on it now.  it starts faster then my windows 7 computer and also faster then my tablet.  i hit the power button and it is on.  it isnt meant for game play.  i use it to email and this stuff here.  i move files with it, large files to my different devices.  it does slow down if there are too many files transferred at once so i use a file manager to help.
Very satisfied after learning how to navigate the new OS
we bought the HP STREAM 11Laptop hp for our 15 yr. old daughter as a gift. Needless to say she loves it. It is always with her as she is constantly on it. Since she is happy and has told us thanks more than once has made it very well worth it. Thats not adding the other pluses like -the price was great, easy on line shopping, and fast shipping. Yes it was well worth it. Thank you.
This is a great little notebook for web-browsing, buying and watching youtube etc, and emails.<br/>Doesn't have much hard storage and wouldn't suit a power user, but for a light, clear notebook<br/>its terrific...hint - remove all the junk software it comes with including the anti virus and just get<br/>Microsoft Security Essentials. See amazon reviews for how to clean it up.
Laptop is great so far. If you upgrade to Windows 10 right away, I would recommend doing a disc clean up afterwards, as you end up with only 4gb of storage. Disc cleanup will prevent you from going back to Windows 8.1.<br/><br/>Also, get yourself an SD card with at least 32gb.<br/><br/>Battery life seems to be incredible even when running multiple apps and watching videos.
This is a great little laptop. I agree with everyone. I had no problem installing the free 1 year Office 365. I would of scored it five stars but the $25 gift card doesn't exist anymore. Good luck in tying to get it. I tried for 2 hours and finally gave up. One of the links listed for HP stream brought me to a xxxx rated web site. I called Amazon and they past it off on HP.
Awesome laptop for the price.  I got this and a Chromebook at the same time.  While not being a fan of MS, I was really surprised at how much better this performs that the Chromebook.  Boot up time is near instant, web pages load fast, no swapping going on.  It is super light and feels decent.  Keyboard is nice, touchpad is a bit rough if you like to use the actual click.
I bought this less than a month ago and am already having trouble with it. Some of the keys randomly stop working and then I can't even log into the computer. I was going to return it, but decided to try going back to the default settings and giving it another try. It lasted a day and now doesn't  work again. Guess I'll  return it and probably won't ask for a replacement.
I love the size and the price.<br/>I uninstalled a lot of application when i got it.<br/><br/>The free microsoft office works if your online. And that was a bummer. Part of the reason why i bought the laptop was the microsoft office i need for school.<br/><br/>It didnt matter that the memory is minimal.<br/>Cuz im not going to use it for any heavy application.
This little laptop was a gift for my 8 year old and shamelessly I have been using it more than he has.  It is amazingly fast and very easy to use. I have recently even used for work which requires multiple levels of security and a VPN connection. It's so lightweight - great for on the go. I find myself using far more than any of my iPads. Great buy and great price.
Fantastic laptop that does just what I need it to: last the whole work day, watch movies, enough storage for music files, and minimal bloatware.<br/><br/>The only caveat is that mines has a technical problem of sometimes not starting up properly from shutdown, but that's a very minor quality of life issue for me. Otherwise, 5/5 considering the amazing price.
This is a cute laptop. It's very light and simple for new laptop owners. The sound is pretty great for a laptop of its size. It also comes with a year trial of Office and $25 windows gift card.<br/>The only downside I've had is that my laptop keeps making this buzzing sound every few minutes when watching movies and videos which is why I've rated this 2 stars. /:
Received before estimated time ! Love the laptop 13 inch
Don't waste your money. Love that it's little & lightweight but the "disappearing" hard drive memory has been a problem since day 1 and HP customer support is HORRIFIC. They will not stand behind their product.  (Note, I have deleted most apps & installed zero programs/data and am still "losing" HD memory on something no one can pin point.)
Had about two good days of fast web surfing, nothing but trouble since then.  SLOWED to a crawl, unresponsive touchpad, unannounced shutdowns  Hours spent on line with foreign technical support, resetting to factory, reloading all my stuff.  IF I could return for all my money I would.  But did not hang on to the packaging.  Will probably use as a doorstop
Am so happy I got this laptop. It's so me, lol. Am not a computer geek but I don't think I need to be one to know this works perfectly well. My only concern though is that there should have been a click button to open it from. Also, I think a mouse will do a better job than the pad. However, it's really a good buy because am a happy customer and I guess that's what matters most.
I got this to replace my toshiba that went belly up on me.  It is a nice computer. I would not recommend it if you are a gamer. It does run a little slow at times.  The processor is not very big. For me it is fine. I just do my school work and check my email and facebook.  If you need something without bling, this is a good computer.  arrived on time.
Great computer. I originally bought it for myself to replace a laptop that had been stolen from me but since getting it my 10 year old has taken it over. She loves the color and the ease of use. It's actually so streamlined that even my 4 year old uses it without issue. I will probably purchase another for myself so I don't have to fight for this one!
So far I do not like this laptop at all. I am really considering returning it to Amazon. I bought it to replace an older, larger HP laptop. So far this makes my old laptop look really good. I don't like the apps setup. I do not like the immediate targeted advertisements. Grandma is slow but she could outrun this laptop. I'm just very disappointed.
So far I've had this laptop for several months and it has worked well. This has probably been the best laptop I've ever owned. I love that there isn't a fan and I don't have to worry as much about it overheating. I wish there was a cd drive but it's fast, the graphics and sound are fine and it's holding up great so far, especially for the price.
Nice little laptop overall. Reviews warned about some shortcomings, so I was not too surprised.<br/>The use of Windows 8.1 was not explained as well as it should have been, especially the cursor and touchpad techniques.<br/><br/>With light use, charge lasts a week, which is convenient.<br/>Looking forward to the Windows 10 upgrade, however.
9 MONTHS OLD AND MY BATTERY COMPLETELY WENT DEAD, ONLY WILL WORK WHEN PLUGGED IN, WILL NOT CHARGE!
I needed a new laptop and was on a budget, so I decided to try this one. What did I end up getting? A piece of garbage that doesn't respond to simple point and click commands. I want to open a website, but the cursor goes crazy all over the screen and starts clicking everywhere except where I need it to click. Horrible, terrible, do NOT buy!
I have owned many laptops and HP is definitely the best. It is very good as far as memory, speed, resolution, and all that, especially for $200. The only complaint I have is that the touch pad (mouse) is on the highest sensitivity setting and still refuses to click on things half of the time. It's irritating, but other than that it's great!
I tried to use all the advice offered by the computer guru in the previous review. I was able to download CCleaner and delete most of what he said to do, but I am not having the smooth experience that he had. This computer regularly crashes Chrome and freezes. I wish I had spent more for a better product rather than trying to cut corners.
I absolutely love this laptop I love the color as well as the use of hdmi free office 365 and free year of cloud. My only issue is i didn't know it only had 21 g of space even cloud make up for it a little it still kinda sucks also i wasn't aware it didn't have a optical drive that's crazy to meee other than that i really really excited
Got one of these for an office I work with. It's pretty good for what it is. It's not a top of the line laptop, but it is small, cheap, and works. We just use it for a web based program and word processing and it definitely can handle that. There is not very much storage on it at all, but we don't store stuff on the computer anyway.
Bought this PC. I really love it, its all I ever wanted!! The color, the webcam, the keyboard. Everything about it is really GREAT! But I tried to upgrade this PC to Windows 10. Well that did not work out. There was not enough space on the hard drive. Plus the mouse pad is Really annoying at times. But overall it's a great computer.
This item was delivered in the time frame promised. This is a very attractive laptop that offers all the features and capabilities that I currently use on my desktop computer. This laptop also included Office 365 Personal for one year, a Free upgrade to Windows 10 along with a Gift Card to download games. Wow! I'm happy! Thank you!
Pros:<br/>Great for kids<br/>Cute<br/>Small and light<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Weak computer<br/>Not for gaming<br/><br/>Why I rated 4 stars:<br/>Don't get this computer to use for school or work! This should be a computer just for kids under 12 ish. It's very weak. But I got it for my little sister who is 4 and she loves it!
Good little computer.  Worked great right out of the box.  One annoying thing is that there is no Windows product code so that makes upgrading to Windows 10 a pain.  I loved the gift card that came with it.  It seems to be constantly downloading updates.  It did 49 just this morning.  That's annoying with any new computer though.
My wife says it's nice and small and she loves it.
This computer is definitely child proof. it has been stepped on and the screen still works PERFECTLY. (on accident of course)<br/>The graphics are great, not good for games so much, but it can hold some simple browser games. Perfect for studies or to be on social media. Great computer for kids, Or a regular business person.
Works great best laptop for under 300 great buy
I have had to ship this back because because the first laptop was defective.  I could not install any programs kept giving me error.  When I received the 2nd laptop had trouble downloading windows 10 and would not recognize the code given to me in use for a "free one year" subscription to Office 365.  DISAPPOINTED..
Very pretty laptop but had to take it back. 1) comes with 32gb only 21gb of that is usable, so it's constantly full 2) wifi connectivity is terrible, turns off every 20 mins or so 3) touchpad is not that great, mistakes signals<br/>Overall would I recommend to anyone? No, I'm a student so not having these 3 things are deal breakers for me
My wife loves this little light weight laptop...however, the advertising that you can upgrade to Windows 10 is incorrect  as this PC does not have enough SSD storage to do it...you get a flash warning that disk space is insufficient to upgrade...I would not have bought it with Windows 8 if I had known this!!! Dave Murray
Did'nt like this computer it was very flimsy, the mouse pad did'nt click with ease and took a few taps instaed of just one to navigate, so I returned it and Amazon made that process so quick and smooth I was very impressed with the service, I have bought other laptops thru Amazon that I love such as my Google Chromebook
Just excellent. Very good price and very neet.
It's amazing speed and stability despite using a celeron. true that I can not believe, having bought for only 199 and also comes with a gift card 25, the Office 365 for one year, 1TB of cloud, extremely light, light is not a super laptop, but for use everyday is enough, I'm impressed, not how they can do. Thanks
Absolutely wonderful little computer. It meets all my on the go needs. I needed something a little better than a tablet and this is like a tablet sized computer. It's not going to run fast games or big programs, but for college essays, internet browsing, and watching streaming videos this is the perfect laptop.
great computer but the office code didnt work
I bought this laptop for my daughter on her ninth birthday. I think it is a perfect match for her. Easy to use, easy to understand, perfect first time computer. The price was right too. She loves it and I can use parent settings to protect her. It seems to be pretty durable too. Great buy! Thank you Amazon.
I've had this for about a week and my family loves it. I originally got it for myself so I can sit on the couch and do bills etc. My husband and kids have used it more than me! They watch videos on Amazon Prime and youtube with no problem. Hubby searches Craigslist with glee :) I have no complaints here.
At first when I got this laptop. The computer slowed down too much and infact it also crash 1-2 times.<br/>But then I realized the RAM is too low for all the pre installed apps, so i clean everything out and now it works great.<br/>They should try make a clean laptop without any apps like a new iphone
Computer is brand-new, and cannot stay connected to the internet for more than 30 seconds at a time, even when it says it is connected to a network. Horrible, especially given the whole purpose of this computer is supposed to be for basic web browsing. Basically a paperweight. Not worth the frustration.
Perfect beginner or basic laptop for web browsing or working in Microsoft Office. The one year of Office 365 makes this an ever better deal. Huge bargain. My 11-year-old daughter is extremely happy with her little purple laptop. She does prefer to use a wireless mouse instead of the track pad, however.
Nice and small. It is used for writing while riding the buss. I killed all of the useless apps and turned off the "charm corners" like you need to with Window-8. Loaded the included Office Suite and was up and running in no time. Enough memory for word-processing so it works for my application.
good laptop for the money. Not a power house but enough for web browsing, word doc, and remote work if need. Ran a bit sluggish under window 8 so i replaced it with ubuntu running xfce4. For me everything work under linux except for bluetooth, i am still trying to figure out what is missing from that.
It is so beautiful, small and very light. I can carry this everywhere with absolutely no hassle! It works amazing, although I'm not a huge fan of the new windows update. Strongly recommend this laptop for those who are under a budget, especially for college students who need a laptop for school work.
So far, everything about the laptop has been great. I'm able to do my school work, was able to download Windows 10, Adobe Reader, and even an app for watching movies; unfortunately, that 2GB  of space which was almost half gone before the downloads, is gone and that's my only problem with it so far.
Great laptop for the price.... The battery lasts all day. The HP help desk was very helpful in assisting me setting it up. If you are the type of person who likes your computer screen so bright your eyes feel like they are on fire I would not recommend this for you. Great for light sensitive people.
Sleek and small and exactly what I needed!!
light weight, does what I need it to do.  Came with Microsoft office for a year. Service is excellent. I have had the laptop for about a month. I have made 3 calls for assistance. They have been professional, good listeners, helpful and solved my issue over and above what I expected.  I love HP :)
Very nice, easy set up for me. I am not very computer savvy but I was able to get started on my own  and am learning as I go.<br/>This is my 1st laptop and I am pleased with my purchase. The color is not as purple as I thought it would be( like in the picture)<br/> but the color is very nice.
A little disappointed with the performance of loading data rich websites, but other than that it is fine.<br/>It came without part of the power supply, namely from the brick to the wall, but I had another from another device that works.  I don't really know how to communicate that to Amazon.
I did a lot of research and this is by far the best laptop in this price range. Bought it as a lightweight laptop for my wife to take to school and it's perfect. The trackpad can be a tiny bit sketchy at times (clicking it moves the cursor a tad) but it's not a problem at all. Great machine.
i got this from wal mart its a good computer for 2 hundo but i dont like it as much as i hope i would. the speakers on it are lame as funk and it dont have a cd drive  but other then that its nice and it has a hdmi plug on it so its alright and it come with mcafee  for the virus protection
In love with this laptop. It's the perfect entry level laptop, if you're not looking for anything over the top with lots of features and memory. I personally would recommend this to anyone looking for an entry-level laptop, whether you are a student or you just need it for work purposes.
This is a surprisingly capable little laptop. I got it for it's size and am very pleased with its light weight and slim design. Feels solid, even if it is a plastic exterior. Good grip and little smudging. The keyboard is pretty bad, but that's to be expected at this extremely low price.
I don't have a crazy extensive review on this as we bought it for a 6 year old. Setup was easy (though I am ex-IT), but it has literally been set it and forget it. It works perfectly for her, no issues, no intervention from me. It's light, it's quiet, and the battery life is amazing
I just bought this laptop at Walmart and I'd say it's a wonderful product. It's very fast and the color is bright and very pretty. The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because the picture quality for watching movies on Netflix isn't very high, but it is still good.
Just right for my Middle school Daughter or the travel professional who doesnt need a gaming laptop.<br/>I also purchased a 64GB MicroSD for some extra HD space. Internal is only 16.<br/>For the professional, I would use this as a spare when traveling not as my main Go to laptop.
Cheap! And so far so good. The selling point for me was the ability to work off line. Has a decent monitor & good keyboard for the money. I'm still getting used to the peculiarities of Windows 8.1 &, perhaps for that reason, find getting around on the Internet less than smooth.
Bought this for Christmas for my 10 year old.  It is light weight, pretty color, speedy and she loves it. She can check her email, watch YouTube videos, watch other videos using Amazon Prime and Netflix (we have subscriptions for both).  Great little computer for decent price!
I LOVE THIS LAPTOP i thought this wa going to be one of those products i would regret buying but i was wrong its the best thing that ever happened to me the quality is amazing works like a charm for my video editing and music especially with external hardrive buy this product
For the price this is a good computer for webmail, browsing, simple word processing, etc.  The size is convenient with a comfortable keyboard despite the limited space.  The big potential problem is that 32 gigabytes is pretty limiting for adding software, photos, music etc.
I like the machine nice and light and a good internet terminal, BUT, do not buy this machine looking to upgrade the crappy Windows 8 to 10 -- up until now the install/upgrade fails miserably.  I'm now on my 3rd attempt, and I'm  a retired programmer with 25 years experience!
I have only had this computer a couple of days but I am simply in love with it already! I was worried about how cheap it was but I was in need of a quick fix! This computer topped all of my expectations! Definitely a must have, and it's pink! How much better can you get?!
cute and handy dandy. my only complaint is the storage size and ram size. i solved the storage by adding a sd card and a spare drive, however the ram is what it is. thanks to the post that tells me what to remove, i did do that, and added chrome. enjoy this little laptop!
Fantastic. Runs beautifully, stays charged forEVER, super lightweight (I carry this thing in my purse) and I get a lot of compliments on how cool looking it is. Would definitely recommend to any office professional who needs something for files/web browsing for meetings.
pretty satisfied. i bought this for a Christmas present for my 8 year old daughter.  so that she can play minecraft on it. it runs smooth. no issues. im very satisfied. the violet color is awesome and i think my daughter is probably going to freak out when she sees it.
I love my new laptop. Very lightweight. I can carry it in one hand. Fits perfectly in my backpack, there's no need for taking books to school. I just wish it had more memory. I have A LOT of photos. By I'm very pleased with my laptop. And it's BLUE!! My favorite color.
Great laptop, for the price I paid for it. I use it for work, school, and social media. If that is what you need it for, I do recommend it :)<br/>I would, however, recommend buying a portable mouse to go with it, as my only complaint in the mouse pad is hard to use.
A nice, light laptop. I get audible clicks when I listen to Rhapsody and read my Google mail. Interestingly, the screen will only open to an angle a little over 90 degrees from the keyboard, The keyboard is nice. The machine is a 64-bit system, for those who wonder.
Great starter laptop for the price. Brought this for my 13 year old daughter. This is her first computer and it meets her needs.<br/>Be warned however that it comes pre-install with a ton of apps that are not necessary. Suggest system clean up prior to start using.
I like this laptop a lot. It's a beautiful color. Super fast to set up. It works great. Light and thin! The mouse pad is a little giffy but you can get used to it and the screen could be a little better but overall it is a great deal especially for the price.
Very cute little PC. I'm planning on using this mostly for web development and it seems to be more than up to the task. Right now I have about 16 g- bites of space (which was way more than I thought it came with) 2 giga bites of ram and a fairly snappy Intel chip.
I love this mini computer and am now taking it with me everywhere.  I added a 64 GB SD card for additional storage of my photos, music and Excel files to keep the C drive freed up.  It does everything my larger laptop does at a smaller, lighter footprint.
Love this laptop, lightweight and easy to use.  The only downfall is it doesn't hold a lot of storage - but I purchased a mini SD card which makes up for it.  I recommend it for anyone who is using it for basic stuff; school work, minimal pictures etc.
This is exactly what I wanted and more! It is super lightweight and it is adorable. It came faster than I expected and it was easy to set up. I recommend this computer for those college students that need something lightweight to type notes or essays.
I bought this computer just for something portable I can take and use on the go to get some light work done. It does comes with 32gb of on-board storage but you will run out really quickly. Just like any laptop you buy from a manufacturer it will come with a lot of bloatware, program you really do not need that will take up storage and each up that 2gb of ram. I suggest that yo claim your free one year subscription to Office 365 and 1TB of Onedrive cloud storage. Once you have claimed that I suggest you do a full clean install of Windows. That means opening up settings, go to recovery, and reset the pc. It will ask you if you want to keep your files or remove everything. Choose remove everything. This will do a fresh clean install of windows without all of the bloatware. Once your computer starts back up you will easily have about around 10gb of free space (it depends). This space you get back you can use for programs and windows update.<br/><br/>For storing Documents, photos, videos, etc. I highly recommend you get a micro SD card for storage and set the computer to automatically use the micro SD card for storing documents, programs (some will let you choose where to install them), and other things etc. This means going to settings again, select system then choose storage. Under Save Locations move everything to your microSD card.<br/><br/>As for performance its pretty good for the price you pay. I suggest not having anything running in the background of your computer at idle except for system task. You only have 2gb or ram and more or less 1gb or that ram will be used by the operating system. That means you have about 1gb for programs that you will run on the desktop. If I am not doing anything too specific for web browsing I would more likely use the Microsoft Edge browser since it takes up less system resources than Chrome.<br/><br/>Other than that you get a pretty good computer for light web browsing and word processing. Its a great inexpensive first computer for first year college students or students in general or people who don't do many things other than light video watching (you can watch one 1080p video from Youtube but when you open another video and have two running at the same time the system throttles heavily mostly due to memory and processor bottle necking), word processing, and light web browsing.
First, let me acknowledge that I am in no way a computer expert.  My review of this product is merely my humble opinion by making a simple comparison between the current product and equipment that I've previously used.<br/><br/>The trackpad for this Notebook does not interact properly and I often have delayed responses - particularly when attempting a right click.  I found that I could avoid this by using a USB mouse.  The slowness however drove me crazy and made we want to throw the Notebook out the window.<br/><br/>You will need to delete a lot of garbage that is pre-loaded on this computer (temporary files, etc.) to free up the 32 Gig hard drive.  Once mine was cleaned up, I had 12 gigs left.  With a 32 Gig hard drive, 64 bit operating system, and only 2 gigabits of memory - this system is SLOW.  I updated a tablet at the same time as this laptop (the exact same updates were needed) and this laptop was much slower in uploading the updates.<br/><br/>I really dislike that there is so little storage space on this laptop.  Users will have to be constantly saving photos, data/documents, files, music, etc. on the cloud storage as the 32 gig storage space will not allow much long term storage (most smart phones have more storage space than this).  This means that you will be uploading everything on the cloud, and when you need to use it again - you need to then download it. If you live in rural areas and your internet provider is slow, you may have wait times that are not insurmountable but very annoying when uploading and downloading.  The fee after the 1-year of free storage appears to be currently priced at $7 monthly.<br/><br/>I find that this Notebook is practical for browsing the internet but for my use - that's about it.  I really don't like it and wish I would have realized that you cannot expand the RAM or storage space. The small 32 gig storage space ensures that you MUST use the cloud as opposed to having it be for optional long term storage.
For basic computer use, this is the perfect laptop. I bought this laptop so I could do a bit more with video editing and not have to use my family's old desktop computer that barely runs anymore. There are 2 downsides to buying this computer, however. The first one is relevant to most consumers. Even after downloading no software on the computer after activating the computer, there still isn't enough space on the hard drive to install Windows 10. If you were hoping to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, you should plan on buying a 16 GB Micro SD Card that you're willing to keep in the system at all times.<br/><br/>The other downside (doesn't pertain to most buyers) is that, being a $200 laptop, it doesn't do the greatest when it comes to video editing. Being that I make Youtube videos, I needed something that could run Adobe After Effects and Premiere. And it does run them. There isn't exactly enough hard drive space to have them on the computer itself, with Windows taking up most of the space on the hard drive. So, I used a 1 TB external hard drive that I keep connected to my computer when running it, which does allow to be able to use it. The programs do run slow as expected, as there isn't exactly a lot of RAM. But, if you're willing to wait the many hours for a 10-minute video to render, then this computer will do the trick at a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>Besides that, I don't really have any gripes with this product. It works just fine for my uses and it was worth the $200 that I spent. I don't really expect it to last more than a year, but that's okay with me. If need be, I can just buy another one next year, and probably for less, being that since I've purchased it, the price has gone from $200 to $180.
I wanted a laptop that was cheap enough that I didn’t care about it getting damaged or stolen.  There were a couple must-haves, including a USB 3 port, HDMI, and an Dual Band AC capable wireless card.  This laptop has the first two, but not the third.<br/><br/>The wireless card in this thing is fine for normal use, but I am using this machine as a field technician to test wireless speeds in different locations, so I needed an Dual Band AC capable wireless card.  HP has an approved AC wireless card that works with this machine - the Intel 3160.HMWG.R Dual Band, which you can get on Amazon for under $20.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Great, now all I had to do was install it.  If you’ve ever done computer parts replacement, this is pretty stratightforward, and the service manual is available for free online.  (link: http://bit.ly/1MfE2AB)<br/><br/>However there are a few gotchas that I thought I should point out because the manual isn’t very clear.<br/><br/>1.  ****Before you start**** Download the driver to your desktop, otherwise you will need another computer with internet access to get the driver to your Stream.  You can get the driver for the Intel 3160 on their website.<br/><br/>2.  The rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop are self-adhesive. Pry them up with something that won’t scratch the laptop and peel them off.<br/><br/>3. Once you’ve removed all the screws, you’ll need a plastic opening tool to pry the top case off the base of the laptop.  Start in the front until you get a section to pop up and then work your way all the way around, including at the base of the monitor.  The whole thing should come off.<br/><br/>These tools will work:<br/><br/><br/><br/>4.  Make sure to disconnect the battery connector first - I accidentally turned the laptop on while messing with the power button connector.<br/><br/>5. The manual says to disconnect the keyboard and touchpad cables, but I found I didn’t have to.<br/><br/>6. *****IMPORTANT***** Disconnecting the power button cable was tough because the connector is so small. This cable is short and must be disconnected to gain access to the wireless card. I ended up breaking the locking mechanism and spent an our fashioning a wedge to replace  The correct way to do this is to GENTLY pop up one side of the white locking mechanism, which swings open but stays connected to the port on the motherboard.  Then the ribbon cable slides out.<br/><br/>7. The manual covers the replacement of the wireless card well, which is pretty easy.<br/><br/>The rest is covered by the manual.  I tested this card and it works perfectly.  I was able to get over 90MBps download speed on the 5GHz band, which is the maximum my provider gives me.  I’m sure it can go higher.  Prior to the upgrade I was topping out at around 30MBps on the 2.4GHz band.<br/><br/>The only other things that bug me about this laptop:<br/>- The trackpad, which is annoying but usable<br/>- The screen, not very crisp or bright, but serviceable<br/>- Can’t do more than one thing at once, or the processor starts to choke.  I had to remove dropbox because it slowed everything down.<br/><br/>But for a $200 laptop, this thing works. And with the new wireless card, it’s perfect for my needs.  Now the $2,000 Macbook Pro stays at home safe and sound.
I purchased this little computer as a travel computer, for use in hotel rooms and on a 50-hour Trivia retreat/contest I attend every January. Having recently used it on a 2-week trip to Europe, here is my general reaction:<br/><br/>PROS: Very cute, lightweight/portable, allows use of a regular desktop in case you are not a fan of the blocky Windows 8 home screen, does not create heat (no hard disk drive), good-quality screen, decent speakers (though if you want good speakers for listening to music, there are very good Bluetooth options out there), easy to add a mouse/other USB peripherals, charges within a couple of hours, holds a charge for several days<br/>CONS: Not fast at ordinary internet tasks such as loading webpages or videos, comes loaded with some "bloatware" programs which you may or may not be able to remove, not much processing speed (3 open webpage tabs brings up the "Chrome is causing high processor usage" message, which doesn't stop what you're doing but is bothersome), no CD-ROM drive, NOT a touchscreen<br/><br/>On my recent trip, I mostly needed this so I could keep up with podcasts, e-mail, FB, and check things like weather and train schedules. Although I didn't always have reliable Wi-Fi in order to do so (this was the hotel's issue--not the fault of the computer!), when I did, it managed tasks like this very well. It is a little slower than other computers I've had, but I was willing to let it do its thing while I ate breakfast, consulted a map, etc.<br/><br/>I am a little concerned that, although it will be great to have an actual laptop for the Trivia contest in January (I _hate_ trying to type quickly on a tablet or phone screen), its speed will not be up to the standard I need for finding answers in a timely fashion. (Also, the guys will tease me for having a blue laptop, but I'm used to that kind of thing!) This is a case where "the proof is in the pudding"--I won't know if the laptop stands up to the situation until I'm in the situation. So, we'll see what happens.<br/><br/>Overall, for the price, this was a good purchase for my purposes. However I would not buy this computer for school or university use, for work, or as a primary computer for someone who needs to use this for all their computer needs.
This laptop is a very good value.  I got it for $179.  The price was reduced because it came with Windows 8.1, which I soon upgraded to Windows 10.  The upgrade took some time and should be done with care.  Because the computer has only 32GB of disc space (a bit over 28GB usable) there is very little left over after the upgrade because Windows 10 keeps a copy of the previous operating system (Windows 8.1) in case you want to restore it.  This means that after the upgrade I had barely 3GB of free space; you can delete the old operating system by using the Windows disc cleanup utility.  Do not try to delete it directly; it contains lots of system files that you cannot manually delete.  Let the disc cleanup utility do this.<br/><br/>After getting rid of the Windows 8.1 files, I got about 11GB of free space (out of 28.2GB).  Since this is little to work with I would not load up a lot of files on this computer.  Nonetheless, I was able to install several favorite programs (e.g., Firefox, VLC, Irfanview, UltraExplorer and more) and still have about 10GB of free space.  Bottom line:  you can work with this computer for most simple tasks.<br/><br/>Before I purchased it, I was concerned that it did not have Intel Widi capability, which allows you to connect wirelessly to smart TVs and some other devices to project your screen onto a larger one.  This is very useful if you are streaming media and want to see it on a larger screen.  Although the Widi program is not present (and cannot be installed because of hardware limitations) to my surprise the HP Stream was able to connect to my TV successfully.  There must be some other (undetectable as far as I know) hardware/software combination that allows for this.  (You can also connect another monitor or TV thru an HDMI cable.)<br/><br/>The HP Stream is not a powerful machine.  But it does work more than adequately for most common uses, such as web browsing, text editing, email, streaming, and watching movies.  The keyboard is better than some other laptops and the battery life (about 8 hours) is superb.<br/><br/>The screen is quite small, so text size can be a bit hard to read in bad light.  It's still bigger than a tablet, and very portable.<br/><br/>After using it for several days I increased the system page file in size.  This will use up a couple of GBs of disc space, but it helps when the 2GB of RAM might not be enough.  I added a 32GB SD card for more usable space as well.
I am a college student that lives off campus.  Therefore, I chose the HP Stream 11 as a secondary computer for the sake of carrying it in my backpack to work on homework/do basic tasks while on the go.  Although I would not recommend using this laptop as a primary computer for a college student, it seems like it will work excellently for my intended uses.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>The HP Stream 11 is relatively fast, given that you do not have more than a few tabs open at once, and is fairly comfortable to use on your lap, a desk, or even in a car. Additionally, the keyboard seems to be made fairly well and the color (I bought it in blue) is absolutely beautiful. It fits well in my backpack along with my books and the battery life is AMAZING. This is excellent because I will not have to worry about bringing the charger with me every day. Lastly, Microsoft Word runs VERY smoothly on this laptop, which was the biggest concern of mine.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>On the downside, the touchpad can be a bit aggravating at times, but this is easily accommodated by a cheap USB mouse. Additionally, this laptop is a bit heavier than the standard chromebook, but this is not necessarily a bad thing, it just means that if you are going to be carrying this in your backpack, like I am, that it will add a bit more weight. Lastly, the internal memory is rather small, but I was aware of this prior to purchasing it.<br/><br/>Overall, I do very much like my laptop. However, I would suggest that buyers (who are not buying for young children) pay a little bit more and purchase the HP Stream x360 Convertible Laptop. This is mainly because the 360 has a touchscreen, which would be quite helpful considering that both the HP Stream 11 and 360 have a free upgrade to Windows 10 upon purchase.
This laptop really delived a great experience. My father bought me one for Mother's Day from Amazon<br/>Quick Facts:<br/>1. Very smooth feel, keys have soft, yet firm feel<br/>2. Quiet click sound from keys, but loud enough to hear.<br/>3. Screen resolution was good.<br/>4. Speakers not the best, but did deliver what is needed. Maybe not the best for a large consumer of streamed radio. Add external speaker for that.<br/>5. Touch pad is responsive. Though you will have to learn some less known movements. For example, the bottom of pad does click left and right. It is not labeled or defined, so it is easy to miss.<br/>6. Windows 8.1 is a failure. Not to worry, Windows 10 will be released October/November. That version is NOT TOUCHSCREEN based, but an option. The familiar home screen returns...YEA! Oh and it will be free upgrade.<br/>7. This keyboard does have both a delete and backspace key.<br/>8. The contrast of white keys is under-rated. IT IS WONDERFUL. Don't be afraid of the unfamiliar look. You will come to love it and not ever want to go back to a black keyboard.<br/>9. Laptop is very light, does not overheat, and battery life was very good. Does take a bit to charge.<br/>10. Overall experience was a good one.<br/><br/>What didn't work<br/>- Too may unnecessary tiles taking up memory. (Similar to a bloatware frustration for some, but easier to remove).<br/>-Live tiles slow response times during other activites. Get rid of as many as you can that are not desired.<br/>- Because this is not a touchscreen, taking advantage of the intended Windows 8 features is difficult. Not impossible, but tiresome and a bit too time consuming. You will find things pop-up and go away unintendedly.<br/>- It does slow down considerably when having multiple windows open, especially muti-media. I found once I got to 4 (2 you-tube, email and Amazon), the load times became to slow. Add whatever extra memory you can for a better experience.<br/>-If cosmetics is important to you, smudges are going to be an issue. I am not overly bothered by that, but out of box, it took a good amount of de-smudging and that became a daily thing when I did feel bothered.<br/><br/>WHO SHOULD BUY<br/>Awesome buy for a student, any one who travels alot, those comfortable using online dependant documents and services, basic computer use, and a back-up to your heavy laptops. This really is a good little laptop. My outcome...well I did send it back. I wanted a faster laptop with swifter load times, and because I have enourmous amouts of saved Word documents and projects, an optical drive is more necessary. If the Stream had more speed, I would have given it a 5. I was actually disappointed it had to go back. Just remember everyone.....this laptop is designed for internet use/online only services, Windows 10 is just around the corner, and the experience will shift. If the Windows 8 is your only gripe, keep this little guy. You'll love it even more. HOPE THIS HELPS!
I really enjoy this little machine.  I bought the 13 inch model.  No, it's not going to run the latest PC games or break any land speed records, but for everyday productivity tasks, web browsing, messaging and streaming, it's hard to ask for a better deal for $200.<br/><br/>One of the first things that caught my attention was the build.  I like how HP made the effort to construct a sturdy, durable casing for this unit.  Too often, this is a total afterthought on cheaper laptops (and even expensive ones).  The HP Stream is very solid.  As others have noted, the keyboard is surprisingly comfortable.  I haven't encountered many issues with the touch pad either, but I use it more as a traditional mouse pad than the gestures it was built around.  Also, it's fanless.<br/><br/>I haven't tried running any games natively on this, but I know Steam Streaming seemed to work fine.  I have noticed some occasional hiccups when viewing full screen, 60fps YouTube video, but other than that, the laptop does everything I expect of it.  You can easily multitask with office, a web browser and messengers at the same time.<br/><br/>The 32GB hard drive won't leave you a lot of space.  After I cleared out some of the bundled programs and did all the Windows Updates, I had just shy of 10 GB free.  I did not install the complimentary subscription to Microsoft Office.  I would suggest looking into LibreOffice or OpenOffice instead - both are free and have a much smaller memory footprint.  If you want more space, this unit offers a MicroSD slot on the side, so you can easily add another 64 GB or more if you want.  It also has a generous number of USB ports for external hard drives, a game controller, mouse, etc.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm impressed with this machine.  I went in with measured expectations and I felt it exceeded them.  I liked it so much that I bought one for another family member, who uses it even more than I do!
The old adage "you get what you pay for" holds true with the HP Stream 13. Let me start out by noting the good things this machine has going for it. The first is the price, 200-250 dollars buys you a solid Windows laptop. This is important because in recent years, Windows has slowly seen one of it's customer bases erode due to the rise of Google's Chromebooks. As a Chromebook owner myself, I can see why. Chromebooks are cheap laptops that are virtually maintenance free and pretty secure.<br/><br/>That said, for all the positive moves that Google has made in regards to it's productivity suite of "apps" inside of Chrome OS, the reality is that the majority of academia and business still run on Windows or Apple's OS. If you happen to fall into this group, this machine may be for you. I wish I could give this laptop a hearty recommendation, that HP and Windows have teamed up to deliver a Laptop that is for virtually everyone at a price that is hard to beat.<br/><br/>The truth is that before buying this laptop, you should do careful research and think long and hard about what your computing needs really are. Do you want/need a machine to do video or photo editing? Move on, as this machine simply does not have the guts, storage or screen resolution to meet those needs. Do you need/want a laptop that can do some gaming? Again, I would advise against purchasing this laptop and moving on in your search for a machine with better internal hardware, screen resolution and storage space.<br/><br/>However, if you happen to be a student or worker who simply needs a laptop that is portable while you send e-mails, browse the web or work in the Office programs, then I think this is the laptop for you.<br/><br/>First let's get the obvious out of the way, this machine is not particularly lovely to look at. Obviously your mileage will vary in that regard, some will love the Magenta or Blue colors this laptop comes in, others will feel like they are operating a child's laptop. For my tastes I went with the Blue, but in all honestly I really wish HP would put out a version of this machine in a neutral color like Gray or Black.<br/><br/>Next, let me say that Windows 8 is a mixed bag on this machine. The debate over Windows 8 is played out at this point and I won't go into that topic as the proverbial tires are bald at this point on that topic. If you hate Windows 8, this machine is not going to change your feelings. The downside to Windows 8 with this machine is that I honestly wish it had touchscreen capabilities. While the Desktop version of Windows 8 runs fine on this machine, the start up screen/tile portion of Windows 8 is really pointless in my eyes without touch screen capabilities.<br/><br/>The storage on this machine became and issue for me. After getting ride of all the crapware that comes with this cheap version of Windows (titled Windows with Bing), I was able to free up a decent amount of space on the drive. However, add a program or two and it fills up fast, so you will definitely want to add an SD card to help out because the reality is with the Windows OS eating up a large portion of the SSD, you simply will not have a ton of room left over.<br/><br/>The screen is simply okay. It's matte and not Full HD and just generally forgettable. The screen isn't terrible by any means, but it's also not very attractive. Let's be honest though, you are paying $200, an amazing screen at that price point is hard to come by in general. The keyboard is solid, it's not back lit, but it's comfortable enough and the keyboard is spaced out well enough. The trackpad takes some getting used to, it's not great and can be annoying at times, but again...the price point needs to be brought up once again when it comes to this complaint of mine.<br/><br/>The performance of this machine is again, simply okay. You can look up the benchmarks and the like if you really want to get in depth, but in my own "real world use", the 2GB of RAM is just not enough if you are running a bunch of tabs all at once or on a number of graphically heavy websites. I used a number of different web browsers, FireFox, Chrome, Opera, I.E., Vivaldi and they all generally ran the same in this regard with myself spending the majority of my time in FireFox. Battery life is solid, but be aware that the promised 8-9 hours of battery life is only true if you are not maxing out the processor much and the screen brightness is low. For my purposes, I had to crank up the screen brightness quite a bit and in turn that obviously hit the battery life where I get closer to 6-7 hours of Battery life. Not bad, especially at this price point, but you will be scraping by in terms of Battery life if you plan on using this for an 8-9 hour work day.<br/><br/>I know my review can come off as negative at points and some of you who read this may be wondering why I gave it 4 stars with all of these complaints. Well the simple truth is that for all the faults that this machine has, it's hard to hate on it all that much. It runs Windows 8 which is still important to plenty of those in high school, college, etc. The screen is uninspiring, but I have seen far worse. The same for performance. You will get the free upgrade to Windows 10 which looks to have fixed the flaws of Windows 8 this summer. You don't have to worry much about banging this around much in your bag or backpack since the build quality is solid enough and you only paid $200 for it.<br/><br/>If you can afford a better machine, I would say go for it. You will likely get a superior screen, processor and storage space. However if you are a student or someone on a tight budget and just want a simple Windows laptop that will cover most everyday needs without breaking the bank, I say go ahead and buy it.
This review has been edited based on follow-up from HP. The original rating given was 1-star, and the new rating is 4-stars.<br/><br/>The original issue of a manufacturer defect and the subsequent poor support service has been resolved by Nicole, a Case Manager from the HP escalations team. I was originally told I would be charged a higher than average shipping cost for a covered repair, and never received a follow-up call from a Case Manager as promised. It turns out the charge was for expedited shipping (which I did not ask for) and the return call was just missed by HP for more than a week. It took a 1-star review on Amazon to get the issue resolved (so your reviews do matter).<br/><br/>It appears in my view that HP does not empower their support services call center staff to make decisions, and potentially they need more training to give accurate information to customers. Support of a product should and does factor into overall satisfaction, and therefore impacts customer reviews.<br/><br/>With that complaint aside, Nicole was very helpful. She addressed my issue quickly, offered to waive the charge for expedited shipping and repair turnaround time, and still give me those services for my trouble. When I ultimately told her that the issue experienced with the laptop (faulty spacebar key - plastic piece is slightly warped causing the key to not register when pressed) was fixed with a DIY method (bending the key in the opposite direction of the warp, and adding a small piece of padding under the ends of the key to bring it to a more flat state). The key now functions at about 90% (the far ends of the key still do not register a keystroke every time), however, she then proceeded to extend my original warranty by 3 months for the trouble I experienced.<br/><br/>With all of that now resolved as much as it can be, the actual laptop itself functions well for its use (browsing, some app usage, minor work, nothing intensive). It's relatively quick on boot up, aesthetically appealing for people who like blue colors, and handles the workload given to it as expected for it's price and quality. If you are looking for an inexpensive laptop for someone who does not need a lot of power, doesn't do intensive gaming, etc; you can't go too wrong with a laptop like this. It handles streaming content, music, videos, etc to a TV well via devices like Chromecast by Google.<br/><br/>In the future, I sincerely hope I have no need of HP support. Mostly because that would mean the laptop is working correctly, but also because I still do not have an overall positive opinion of the call center staff's services.
This is my review on HP Stream 11. I purchased the blue at Walmart yesterday. The first thing I did was to remove any items I did not need, which included the programs added by HP. All you do is go to the computer's control panel to remove these programs. I also had no problem with transferring any of my programs that I had on my other computer since Microsoft does that for you if you had a previous account with them. So, if you don't currently have an account, I suggest you open one before programming this computer. The program installed walks you through the steps and it only takes a few minutes to transfer your apps. It also transfers your favorites.<br/>I will say that if you don't already know Windows 8 this takes awhile to adjust to. I use to hate it when I first got it. I wanted to go back to Windows 7, but I could not because I used it for work related stuff and they wanted me to have it.. I have used it for over a year now and I love it! So hang in there and learn it. So, this review will be on the computer itself.I am typing on it now for this review and it is a snap. The keys are well placed  and there is no cramping. They keys are large so large hands should have no problem.The screen is beautiful. Don't believe what you read about it. I guess we have a lot of tech experts offering their opinions which can cloud things for others, but there is no problem with the screen.<br/>The mouse is kind of qwerky. After a day of using it, and going to control panel to adjust it my way, I am getting the hang of it and it is fine .You do have to place your fingers further back from the edges, corner clicks do not work well. Scrolling also is a little different but I am moving along fine now. I do like the up and down keys on the key pad that can also help you with the scrolling.<br/><br/>For those of you who like Kindle, it is a breeze on this laptop. You also have the ability for offline reading which I love. My previous tablet did not allow for that.<br/><br/>I do not do gaming at all, but I do have apps for puzzles, solitaire, word find, weather, calculator, calendar, etc. No problem with any of them offline also. I have plenty of memory for all my needs. I have not downloaded Microsoft office yet because I do not need it. I went to Windows Store and downloaded free WordPad and that works fine for my needs and less memory is taken up. So, for now I will continue to use this. However, if you need it for work or school, my laptop has plenty of memory for that and you can also purchase a thumb drive for anything additional you may need. It does have a memory card slot so you can get that extra memory if you need it.<br/>The laptop is very quiet and cool. No heating at all and that includes on charging. Some reviews said there was a problem and I would return laptop if that was the case. Mine is fine. I also ran Netflix and no problem there with sound at 77% it was plenty loud and not tinny sounding at all like some reviews stated. I had previously watched this same movie on my large laptop and the sound was way down and even with additional speaker added I could hardly hear the movie. No stuttering and no fan noise! A great experience.Battery life is also great. I have only charged it once and that was when I took it out of package and not since. With lots of usage and it is still going. Love it!!<br/><br/>I recommend this laptop and I believe you will love it as I do. It is light weight and easy to put in my purse. It will be great for travel.
I have always preferred to have a powerful desktop PC and a light, portable laptop. About 5 years ago I bought an Acer which finally began to die. This seemed almost too cheap to be believable but so far so good!<br/><br/>What I like<br/>Can't beat the price!<br/>Very small (this is, naturally, a matter of taste if you have really big hands beware!)<br/>Very lightweight<br/>Totally Silent, no moving parts like fans or a traditional hard disk<br/>Webcam decent for price<br/>Sound quality surprisingly good<br/>Card-reader is in the side, not the front as all too many are<br/>Decent selection of ports for light use<br/>Combined TRRS headphone/microphone jack (YMMV)<br/>Bluetooth stable in my testing<br/><br/>What I don't like<br/>*The screen is a little bit low-contrast; if you have low vision this won't work. Taking notes in a dim lecture hall? No problem! Good enough to watch TV or movies and moderate web-surfing but won't replace your TV or high-end monitor.<br/>*I hate all touchpads, but this one strikes me as worse than usual<br/>*The keyboard isn't the best. I wouldn't want to type lengthy documents on this; the lack of a numeric keypad is a necessity for the size but naturally precludes applications calling for heavy number entry.<br/>*The in-built storage is TINY. I ended up with about 5gb free and have had to be strategic about what files I sync to this laptop vs my main PC, however for light use and particularly if you use Google Docs or SkyDrive or something like that this will be far less of a problem; or you can buy a $15 SD card and just keep it in all the time, the SD card is very low relief so this approach could work.<br/><br/>I won't blame the laptop for Windows 8 which is borderline unusable out of the box (First thing I did was install Classic Shell to get a usable start-menu) but I will bring it up because it is not built to the supposed strengths of Windows 8 since it does not have a touch screen. And I have resigned myself to the fact that all mass-market computers will have a frikking ton of crapware but this was unusually high (and all the more pernicious given the tiny SSD it comes with) and PC-Decrapifyer couldn't cope with it so I had to do it by hand... this took two hours. For me? Fine, whatever. For Grandma? Probably not so fine.
Although I did not buy this from Amazon, I still feel like I need to review this computer.  Frustrated with having to replace my laptop every couple of years because of things happening (I have kids!), I decided to go with an inexpensive laptop this time. I've only had it for about a week, but so far this little computer is performing well. Being that it is in the $200-300 range, I knew going into it that it wouldn't be a high performance computer.<br/><br/>First, I took the advice of a couple of the other reviewers, and removed all the bloatware that came installed. While it did free up a tad bit of space, other people are correct, Windows does take up about half of the available space on the hard drive. If space is going to be an issue for you, then I'd steer clear of this computer.<br/><br/>Second, the reasons I gave it only 4 stars is like other reviewers; the touchpad is not as responsive as I'd like it to be. But having said that, the keyboard is nice, and the screen is ok too.  Again, not the best, but you can't expect much for a $200 laptop. The camera seems to be average, and works for our occasional Skype sessions. I like the fact that there is no fan, and it doesn't seem to get all that warm. One other reason for the 4 stars is battery isn't quite as long lasting as the specs say it is, but I'm sure with some tweaking of the settings, it could improve, just a matter of me playing around with it a bit more.<br/><br/>Overall, I am happy with the laptop. I use it only for web surfing, email, occasional word processing, and occasional printing. So for me, this little thing is perfect for my needs. I currently have an android tablet and an iPhone and missed some of the capabilities of a full size operating system, so if you are on the fence about getting a Chromebook vs. an inexpensive Windows laptop, I'd go with this one! Bonus: the pink one is super cute! ;P
I purchased this laptop to serve as a replacement for an older laptop. What strikes me most about this machine is that its solid state drive makes a HUGE positive difference in speed. This is because a solid state drives does not become fragmented, and all of the data requested from the drive (for instance, a picture file) is moved simultaneously into memory rather than in pieces. I have noticed also that, because of this solid state drive, this computer does not slow down over time like computers with hard disk drives do. In other words, two months into using it, with a drive full of software and data, this computer is zipping along just as fast as the day that I brought it home.<br/><br/>Another feature that I find amazing is its low-temperature CPU. The machine has no fan, yet it runs cool to the touch. Even when playing a fairly video-intensive game like "Drakenslang" for a few hours, the machine never gets "hot," just a little warm to the touch.<br/><br/>The sound system is quite impressive for such a little laptop. External speakers sound remarkably good, too, because of the DTS Studio Sound.<br/><br/>As for its physical construction, it is a sturdy machine that could handle lots of toting around in a school backpack without suffering any damage. It is quite eye-catching as well; in fact it could easily be mistaken for an expensive MacBook at first glance.<br/><br/>By the way, this thing simply blows away the Acer 720 Chromebook!<br/><br/>Of course, this is not a high-powered workstation, but it does play a lot of games well enough, and it will handle all your basic computer needs (web surfing, high-end word processing, movies, music, and what-not) very nicely. And it comes with a free one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 and a $25 gift card for the Microsoft Store, which is a great bargain in itself.<br/><br/>What else can I say about this computer except BUY IT! You will not be disappointed.
I bought the Stream 11 with minimal expectations -- I planned on keeping it near the sofa and using it for email, web surfing, occasional YouTube video viewing and a bit of work-related Citrix access.  In other words, stuff that's well within the capabilities of the Stream 11's Celeron processor.<br/><br/>Overall I've been pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Let's get the negatives out of the way first, though.  The Stream 11 is not a performance powerhouse by any stretch of the imagination -- but if you were expecting Core I7 performance from a $200 Celeron-based PC, your imagination may have become a little too stretchy for its own good.  As for the Stream 11's display... it's the most obvious sign that you're using a budget PC.  It isn't great, but it gets the job done.  There's an HDMI output if the screen just isn't cutting it.  Storage space is minimal, especially once you've installed Office 365 (and why wouldn't you?).  I can't speak for other users, but my unit had very little bloatware, which was a nice change from previous HP experiences.  Still, plan on adding an SD card and/or traveling with a flash drive or USB hard drive if you want to consume large quantities of media on the Stream 11.<br/><br/>Now the positives: the keyboard is much better than I'd expected -- it's large, responsive, and none of the keys are oddly placed (although the arrow keys are a bit small).  Performance is good -- the SSD compensates as much as possible for the Celeron's lack of oomph, and Windows 8.1 has matured to the point where it's quite usable, even without a touchscreen.  And it's an attractive computer -- I was drawn to it because it's such an interesting shade of blue, and the overall design is very pleasing.<br/><br/>Set your expectations appropriately and you'll be happy with it.
This HP laptop is small and convenient. I was able to take it on an extended trip without being weighed down by it, and I got performance and battery life out of it. That wasn't for video watching, and although the device is well suited for that, you will want to keep it plugged in for long periods of streaming.<br/><br/>The ergonomics for the most part are pretty good for a small device. I thought that a smaller keyboard would be harder to use, but it's close enough in size to a standard laptop keyboard that it wasn't a problem. The touch pad, on the other hand, fell short of what I expected. It was responsive enough to touch and directional movement, but without dedicated left and right "mouse" buttons, I found it awkward to use. An external mouse made things much more usable.<br/><br/>You get a lightweight item at the expense of having disk space. The disadvantage of lacking a hard drive can be made up for by using a thumb drive and by taking advantage of the on-line features of Office 365. Keep in mind though that only one year is included. If you keep this for three years or more, the additional price of software may make you want to consider getting a more robust HP computer with an installed copy of Office. Or you can use Google's on line suite of products for free.<br/><br/>This computer has Windows 8, which I find better suited to touch screen use than to use on a laptop such as this one. Microsoft's desire to make things look consistent across platforms fails to take into account that people don't want to use laptops for the same things they use phones or tablets for. Fortunately, I was able to get around the issue with a third party download.<br/><br/>For the most part, working on spreadsheets or word processing documents will not carry any penalty when you use them on line instead of locally. The size of the documents is small enough that file transfer speed won't be an issue. The problem I ran into is that in some countries, "free WiFi" means a free limited amount of data, and by the time the computer finished syncing with Onedrive, I found myself out of data. Fortunately that's not likely to be an issue in the US, even when traveling, but you should keep it in mind if you are going to travel.<br/><br/>You won't be able to store a collection of movies on this, but it will handle streaming cleanly and with very good resolution for the price. In fact, it handled all the tasks I threw at it quite well. Those were limited to the ones it's designed for primarily, but it's still important to know that you won't run into problems with the computer keeping up with your web browsing or editing.<br/><br/>I've used far bigger, more expensive and more powerful laptops that have gotten bogged down once I installed lots of software on them, but this is designed to be used out of the box. Given the limited term of the Office software, I'd recommend this primarily if the price is low enough.
The HP Stream 11 notebook computer has a number of attractive features: a beautiful blue case; an 11.6 inch screen that is clear, bright, and glare-free; 1TB of Microsoft OneDrive cloud storage for a year; approximately eight hours of battery life; and a subscription to Microsoft Office (an activation key is provided).  In addition, the keyboard is comfortable and user-friendly. The setup is not too difficult.  The package includes instructions with diagrams, and HP offers support if you need extra help.  The notebook is loaded with Windows 8.1 and 32 GB of storage.  At a bit under three pounds, it is not feather light, but it is extremely thin and portable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the track pad is a bit tricky.  Sometimes, I click on an icon or hyperlink by accident, and end up having to navigate my way back to where I want to be.  There are two USB ports, so you can plug in a mouse if you prefer. There are many bells and whistles for those who want to connect to other users and/or devices, upload photos, listen to music, and download television programs and videos.<br/><br/>On the other hand, be aware of that the HP has little memory, cannot handle heavy-duty gaming, and does not have a CD or DVD drive. If you want to watch DVDs, you'll need to purchase an external drive. Although HP throws in Office365 for one year, there is a catch.  After the year is up, the company will encourage you to buy a monthly or yearly subscription.  It isn't cheap.  Similarly, although McAfee Anti-Virus protection is provided for thirty days, when the month is up, you will have to decide if you want to purchase anti-virus protection from McAfee or another company.  Even with these caveats, this is a practical notebook that is good-looking, well-designed, and a practical purchase for computing on the go.
I bought this computer from microsoft.com a couple days ago and I LOVE it. On microsoft, you can buy the signature edition, which means you don't get any bloatware if you are a student(k-college), teacher, or parent, you can also get a 10% discount.
If you are looking for a basic (and light) laptop to do your work on (excel and word) then this is it. I bought this for work as I didn't want to use my personal laptop (which was a Mac and I would've had to purchase Microsoft office). No complaints
My wife has the blue one and I have the pink one and we love them they are light weight witch is good for me because I do have rheumatoid arthritis so the light weight is awesome and you can do so much with it I am a YouTuber so I just LOVE IT
I've had this computer for 6 months and I had to factory reset it three times. I am so glad that I bought the protection plan because I can't exchange or return it through Amazon. I've never had a computer with so many problems so early on.
I chose this laptop over the Chromebooks because it's actually a small laptop.  I own a Word program and only use it on one computer, but can use it on up to five.  I'm a writer and need to be able to just write in Word.  I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able to load Word on this computer. I didn't choose a Chromebook because I thought I could.  Now I see after a year I'll have to pay 100 a year just to use Microsoft online because there is no way to load Word on here.  I don't need an extra expense. I'm a struggling artist. I've only had this a day. I'm considering sending it back. I just need basic programs... Word being that basic program.  If I have to still use Chrome docs so I'm not paying a hundred a year... What was the point of paying more for a mini laptop?<br/><br/>Update. You don't have to use the online Office. If you already have a copy you can go to Microsoft's website and download the software.  I changed my initial rating from a 2 to a 5 star.  I'm a writer and just wanted to be able to work on documents.  It does everything I need.<br/><br/>Changing to a 1 star. After almost a year of use. The small hard drive I thought was fine because I've gotten in the habit of not saving to my laptop. I just needed a travel laptop.  The problem is just getting online and browsing makes the memory critically low, because this 18 gigs of the 20 are used by software installed on here.  There are tons of things on the computer I don't need. Now I've got to pay to have all the extra stuff removed.<br/><br/>Second, the right click doesn't respond all the time.  The computer is extremely slow probably because it has such low memory. There is no drive to play CDs/DVDs or add software.<br/><br/>The worst purchase I made in 2014.
Really like it it arrived quick no problems as advertised. Good price service everything they sai9d it was. I will be back. My granddaughter loves it uses it allthe time. PS don't get the EVE case for it from bluemall you may never see it.
Let's be clear up front about two things.  First, you are not going to be gaming on this machine--period. Look elsewhere if that's your thing.  Second, this is not a Chromebook killer, as some have suggested. Chromebooks are lean, mean machines that do exceptionally well on hardware that would choke on Windows.  I have a Chromebook with similar specs, and performance-wise, the Chromebook is far superior over my Stream 13.<br/><br/>OK, that out of the way...<br/><br/>I love this laptop! It does everything I need it to do at an incredibly low price (even lower given it includes a year of Office 365 personal--a $70 value).<br/><br/>PROS<br/>It's light.<br/>Battery lasts twice as long as traditional laptops.<br/>Keyboard and trackpad are very nice, responsive, laid out well.<br/>Screen is nice (not great), clear, and at 13.3", large enough for a laptop.<br/>The USB 3.0 and HDMI ports are a nice touch (note: there is no VGA port).<br/>It comes with a year of Office 365 Personal (Office 2013, 1TB Onedrive storage).<br/><br/>CONS<br/>Gets bogged down with a few apps open.<br/>2GB RAM. How much more could an extra 2GB cost?<br/>At 32GB, the drive is small. You'll want to shove a MicroSD card in there for additional storage. After Windows Updates, you'll have about 10GB free.<br/>You will almost certainly not be able to upgrade this laptop to Windows 10 when it comes out (unless HP does something on their own).<br/>Blue and pink? Whose bright idea was that? It looks like a LeapPad.  Give me black or grey.<br/><br/>Bottom line: buy this machine for what it is and don't expect anything more.<br/><br/>UPDATE: After using this machine for a couple of months, I'm back to remove two stars from my rating.  You really need to consider your intentions for this laptop.  It gets bogged down quickly. Two tabs open on IE or Chrome will about bring this device to its knees. Stay away from sites where there is other content loaded onto the page--your machine will become unresponsive. I have a Chromebook that blows the Stream out of the water when browsing.<br/><br/>WiFi throughput takes about a 20% hit on this machine.  No idea why.  Also, free space on main drive continues to shrink as Windows Updates are applied.  Finally, I can't tell (at this point) whether there will be a Windows 10 for this device.  You WILL NOT be able to do an in-place upgrade to Windows 10 on this machine due to its architecture.  I don't know how (or if) Windows with Bing will be provided to Stream and Windows Tablet users.<br/><br/>This machine is for the most basic, entry-level user only, who needs a Windows machine. If you don't run Windows apps, consider a Chromebook instead.
I wanted a replacement for an old clunky laptop that expired.  I wanted something that I could use for Word and Excel and something that would run Quicken.  The HP Stream 13 was my choice and it fits the bill quite nicely.  I purchased the Stream 13 from Microsoft because they provide the basic system with no added on 3rd party bloatware.  I got the 13" version for the larger screen and am glad that I did.  I set up the 1-year Office 360 and it works well.  Installed Quicken and Adobe Reader and still have about 1/3 of the 32Gb storage.  Also installed a 54Gb micro SD card.<br/><br/>The Stream 13 reviews were mostly positive.  There were a number that gave poor marks for not having certain capabilities even though the advertising and stats were clear.  It does not have any update capability for RAM or the internal memory.  You can add up to 64GB in micro SD format.  It does not have an optical drive.  I bought one that connects to the USB-3 port and works well.  That's in a different review.  It is not a sophisticated game machine.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>+ Reasonable price<br/>+ Lightweight<br/>+ Runs very cool and quiet<br/>+ Holds charge very well and is quick to recharge<br/>+ Connectivity - 3 usb ports, HDMI port<br/>+ HDMI connection to HD TV works easily and very well<br/>+ Easy set up; just follow the prompts<br/>+ Found my network and my wireless printer right away<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- It runs Windows 8.1 which I don't like but will get used to.<br/><br/>Would recommend this to friends and relatives for light usage.  I think it would be a good laptop for a student.  My granddaughter wants a pink one.
My kids are homeschooled so I got them these computers to do their work on. All I can say is WOW!  Ok I can say more...they play games on them constantly!  There have been no problems. And a stable hard drive to boot. A great bargain
Took a gamble on a cheap computer that I could use for traveling. Not crazy about the color, but this little machine was BY FAR the easiest computer set-up ever! I put in my Microsoft password and the thing practically set up itself!
Great for a college student on a tight budget.  My old laptop died after less than a year and was much pricier than this.  Since I hadn't planned on buying another laptop until after graduation I had to go for something in this price range.  I am very impressed considering what I paid.  It's great for writing papers, doing research, taking notes, browsing the internet, listening to music and I have even streamed some movies.  The movies actually buffered a lot less then on my 700+ dollar Lenovo laptop before it quit working.  The colors aren't as vibrant but you get what you pay for and I expected this.  This laptop actually surpasses my expectations.  Reading some of the negative reviews I think people need to remember how much this costs.  If you need a machine with more ram then spend more money.  If you don't want to use the free cloud space and the room on the SSD isn't enough spend more money.  If you are like me and need the basics to take to school or work and have a desktop with more ram and storage space for home then this is a great option.  I also love the battery life.  It's better than my Lenovo to.  I won't have to take the charger to school anymore.  The speed is good but I was shipped a Microsoft Signature Edition with all the unnecessary programs already removed.  Other reviews have noted removing these themselves so I had planned on several hours of doing that so it was nice not to need to. My only complaint is with the delivery.  I didn't have to sign for it.  If I hadn't been home and heard the knock there is a very good chance it wouldn't have still been there when someone came home.
Received my order very quickly. Less than two days to be exact. The hp stream 11 seems to be a very neat little machine so far, especially for the price. I'd say I'm pretty impressed overall with the product and with amazon. Thanks.
This little thing is tough, VERY light weight and great for any college student out there!  I charges quickly and keeps battery life for a very long time.  I'm in classes all day from 9am to 8pm and this thing is still going strong!
I received notice that my office 365 is not any good anymore.  I bought this computer August 21 so therefore it has not been a year.  Really!!!  How do I get this reinstated for the next 9 months?<br/><br/>my computer is great.
PC died after plugging in external usb drive.  When trying to restart light on power button would flash once and then nothing else would happen.  Touch pad was awful.  Right clicking was registered as left clicking half the time.
We bought this for my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it, however we ordered orchid magenta and received BLUE! Fortunately, my daughter liked the blue, but just beware when buying that they do send the wrong color.
I needed a laptop for school but didn't want to spend a ton. I had been looking at Chromebooks but didn't want to give up the Windows operating system. This was PERFECT for my needs, it's basically a step up from a Chromebook.
Fantastic little machine! Please adjust your expectations to what it can and cannot do. DO NOT buy this is you're thinking of upgrading the eMMC ssd inside. As I understand it, the ram, the driver, everything is soldered right into the mobo.<br/><br/>Take it for what it is. A super lightweight laptop that can handle web surfing, Office Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. Plays videos surprisingly well. I keep a 64 gig mem card in the expansion slot.<br/><br/>For kicks, I wiped the drive and installed Linux Mint--which runs quite fast indeed on this machine. If you're Linux friendly and want to do an install, you simply can't go wrong. Don't know about dual booting both OS though.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest drawback is the small capacity eMMC. 32 GB is so little room. I'm running Windows 8.1, Office Suite, and storing all my documents, music, video etc on a mem card, but again--this is not my main machine. It's not even my backup machine. It's my "whoops need a laptop gotta run out the door right now, bye!" machine.<br/><br/>Do not buy this machine with the idea of playing modern immersive FPS games. No Call of Duty here. Minecraft and such as would do fine as far as power goes. This would I think make a great computer for younger kids, before they step up to a more robust machine. But heck, I'm 44 and it does a fair amount of my work with no trouble.<br/><br/>Keyboard is a little wonky but overall fine. Construction feels solid. Nothing about the machine seems cheap or shoddy.  Good product. If the eMMC had been at 64 GB, I'd have given it a 5.
It's hard to review this without griping about things. The size of the laptop is actually great - it's so little, can cart it anywhere. The keyboard is good. The mousepad is meh - a lot of times it won't register clicks, whether tapping the center or actually clicking the tactile buttons. The power port doesn't match any other laptop - it's smaller, so if you have extra cords they probably won't fit this. I purchased it to use for school and did not opt to use the "Microsoft Office 365" 'app' - I use Google Docs, and/or SoftMaker because they are free.<br/><br/>The laptop came with Windows 8 installed, and shortly after MS wanted to upgrade it to 8.1, so I did. Now it wants to upgrade it to 10. I'm hesitant. Most of my gripes are about Windows 8, but I'll leave that out of here.<br/><br/>The overall available hard disk space is small compared to a lot of computers, but that's not a big deal - with most everything being online now, using the disk space is rarer.<br/><br/>The HDMI port works great - used it to watch Netflix hooked up to our television. Number of USB ports is good. Headphones do well. Webcam is sufficient.<br/><br/>Battery life is pretty good - I haven't tested it extensively but I can watch at least two full movies while also internetting with only one charge.<br/><br/>I use the laptop for school mainly, and travel - I have another more dynamic laptop for home use. That said, I find myself using this one more often lately just because it's so little and easy - it's almost as if it's a large tablet with a keyboard attached.
Great for the price. Have not had an issue with it yet, even though it runs on Win 8.1. Did not upgrade to 10 yet. Has a small storage, but that's OK. The Office 365 free for a year is very nice. Overall, very happy with it.
First let me say I'm good with the concept of a web based laptop.  Even though I have several laptop & desktop PC's my go to computer for 90% of all tasks the last few years has been a 16gb chromebook.  However I needed something that I could install a couple windows based programs onto for work.  I wanted these programs available to me at my workbench so when receiving a customer call I wouldn't have to walk to the front office to look up workorders or delivery tracking type stuff.  I already use network drives for all my files so it should have been easy.<br/><br/>I am used to advertised 32gb not really being 32gb but being 28-29gb.  The actual capacity this computer has is a 20.9gb hard drive!  That has got to be the  worst quality control I have ever seen.  Even worse than that is the operating system is so bloated that even after I've removed everything I can think to remove I only have about 2gb of usable space left.  I am now several hours into trying to make this machine usable & can't even install quickbooks on it.<br/><br/>Its not that the machine is really bad, or that windows is bad.  Its that the combination cant work for anything beyond webbrowsing, which my older chromebook with a slower processor & less memory does better & faster because the operating system is made to function in that environment.  I am not a tech person, but now I am going to have to find & install a different operating system if I plan to use this at all.  I am already out a couple hours on this thing & it will cost me several more by the time I'm done.
For several years my laptop of choice was a purple 11" Dell notebook. After multiple repairs, it was pronounced dead and a 15" HP took it's place. I am very happy to add this nice 11" HP to my desk. The HP Stream is so much thinner and lighter than the old Dell Notebook! I'm loving it!<br/><br/>My computer needs are minimal and my knowledge of the workings of them is likewise.  Much like my vehicle, all I really care about is that it starts and takes me where I want to go. I use them for online shopping, emailing, social networking, and info surfing.<br/>This little guy works just great for that.<br/><br/>It's nice to have pretty things, and while the bigger HP sports a silhouette of my dog, it just can't match this really attractive "Horizon Blue"  of the outside of the Stream. When opened the lighter blue has a geometric pattern  and white keys that make it look like fun!<br/><br/>And fun it is! It's like driving a fun little sports car. It's fast and super quiet (because there is no fan), and easy to park anywhere, your purse, a tote, or backpack. At a weight of about 3 pounds and a thinness of spiral notebook, you'll never even know you're packing it.<br/><br/>It has 2GB memory, with a 35GB flash drive. and 1 TB of Cloud storage. It also comes with 1 free year of Office 365. The battery life is rated at 8.25 hours and that seems to be about what I'm getting.<br/><br/>At a price under $200, this is a great buy for someone like me, with very little interest in computing, and interested only in playing around online.
Order arrived in Singapore 13 days ahead of scheduled date in perfect order. Laptop lags at times but can't complain. Sound can be improved but it's no hassle removing the hp software at all and installing classic shell. x
Got this for my teenage daughter.  Great price and super cute look to go with it.  We have only had it about a week, and other than adjusting to the new operating system it seems to be doing the job.  Great teen computer.
I'm totally impressed.  More than I thought it would be.  I love everything about it.  Works best with a mouse because the two finger swiping thing doesn't always work for me.  There is no right or left click on the pad.
This laptop is lightweight and good looking. Price very affordable. But you get what you pay for! This laptop is extremely slow and at the 3rd day I have problems to turn on this device. I will return it. Waist of money
Bought it for my wife mainly for Skye. Nice machine, lightweight and a good one for travel. Keep in mind it has no disc drive. We attach thumb drives or portable HDs through the USB ports. Decent sized screen for Skype.
This computer lasted for slightly more than 5 months; as of yesterday it no longer shows any sign of life.  It wasn't dropped, nothing was spilled on it, and there was no electric surge.  Too bad, my daughter liked it.
It's great,  although the year of Microsoft 365 kept asking to be purchased,  my wife managed to get it corrected again.  All in all its a great laptop.  The seller was helpful when we ran into some issues.  Thank you.
I am very happy with this computer.  It's a lot nicer than I anticipated.  The price was very good for what you get.  It's a total upgrade from what I was using before (an old Compaq Presario laptop).  My old laptop got HOT and didn't have more than like a 30 minute battery life.  So this was an outstanding upgrade for me.  It's so pretty, has an ombre blue on the keypad.  I do miss the number pad on the side, but I'm getting used to not having that.  For the price this is a no brainer.  It's very adequate for surfing the net, using social media, email, using word processor/office.  I am super happy with it.  I would buy it again and might buy another one if the need arises, maybe for my kids (Christmas).  It's solid, lightweight, doesn't get hot and is very quiet.  I can easily use it in bed, on the sofa, etc.  I don't really like the finger mouse pad, it's very difficult for me to use, so I have a wireless mouse, which isn't hard to use on the sofa or the bed, just set it next to you and it's just as easy as if it was on the desk.  This is perfect for a student, kids and adults of all ages.  I suggest you get this size over the 11 inch, I think this is the perfect size and can't imagine smaller.  At first I had an adjustment getting used to the keys, but now I type my typical 70 wpm and it's awesome.  I can't recommend this computer enough.  Yes, if you have $1000 to spend then get an apple or whatever, but for $230 you get a lot of bang for your buck here.  I also think the battery life is awesome.
The screen is very small.  So as an adult it is hard to work on.  But for homework it is great.  My kids are elementary aged and love it.  They are very light weight.  They run well and for the price are a good buy
Before the laptop arrived, I braced myself for being reminded once again, "You get what you pay for."<br/><br/>But that wasn't the case. With this laptop, you get a lot more than what you pay for.<br/><br/>I'm an Apple True Believer, but there are a few programs that require a PC--a couple of ham radio programs and the security camera program called Blue Iris. I tried buying an old, used Dell laptop but it gave me a lot of problems. (I had to wedge folded-up paper under the RAM to get better electrical contact.) It's nice having a new computer now with a fresh battery, no loose contacts, and no random failures.<br/><br/>This computer is so cheap, I might buy a few more before the price goes up. I might get one for the car, one for the security cameras, and one for the ham radio station.<br/><br/>Since it isn't my main computer, the 32 gig isn't an issue for me. That's plenty enough room.<br/><br/>The resolution of the screen isn't that great.<br/><br/>They keyboard is fine.<br/><br/>The trackpad, as everybody mentions, is a weakness.<br/><br/>I like how light weight it is.<br/><br/>Since it only costs $200 and I keep no personal data on it, I don't work worry a lot about it being stolen.<br/><br/>For my needs for a primary computer, this laptop doesn't cut it. But as a secondary computer used as an appliance, or as a tablet with a keyboard, it works great.<br/><br/>Why get a Chromebook when you can get this?<br/><br/>I've quite happy with my purchase.
After using a Dell Inspiron laptop for the past 6 years, this one took a little getting used to. I was initially researching Chromebooks, but since I'm in my last year of college, I needed something that allows me to operate Microsoft Office without the expense of a traditional laptop.  It didn't come with the software, but since I am a student I was able to obtain a free download of the products I needed.<br/>It doesn't seem to have a big enough hard drive size for storing everything that I was capable of storing on my Dell.  Granted these are designed mainly for using in the same manner as a tablet, but my phone has greater storage capability than this laptop.  Fresh out of the box, 13 gb of the 20+ available were already taken up.  For that reason, if you are considering this laptop, buy a USB drive to keep large files on such as pictures, homework, etc.<br/>It does come pre-installed with several options for cloud-based storage which is nice.  I'm not sure why HP thinks I needed three different cloud-based storage solutions, but they do.  I ended up un-installing two of the options, and left the HP version on since it came with 1 year of free cloud storage.<br/>If you're looking for something simple, this is a good option.  Once I do not need to have all of the Office products installed, I will uninstall them to free up the space they are taking up.  This would be a great laptop for a young student to start out with.  It's good enough for this poor college student also.
I juggle several jobs at any given time, and I need something reliable and decently powered. This laptop is a balance between being fast and usable, and being portable. It's not too heavy and is sized just right.
This is a great little laptop for doing light web surfing and checking emails.<br/><br/>I ordered this laptop so I could have something to easily grab and jump on the web while watching TV or if I'm in the kitchen and need to pull up a quick reference for something I am cooking.  It is not the most powerful machine but for $230 it is work it!  It has a hybrid drive and it is kind of small so don't expect to store a lot of music or pictures on it.  They way I got around the drive size was to get a 64 mb USB storage and I configured the machine to cache everything to the USB drive and leave the actual hybrid drive free of excess clutter.  The machine will boot up really fast (I'm currently running windows 8.1) and shut down just as fast.  The touch pad took a little bit of time to get use to how it responded but once I got the hang of it I really like it.  It is light and portable too - but probably not the sturdiest of laptops so don't drop it or leave it out in the rain (LOL).  I have had it about 5 months now and I couldn't be happier with it and I have recommended it to a couple of folks too and I'd never do that unless I really like something.<br/><br/>I have the 13.3" and it has a full sized keyboard and the keys are easy to use and feel very natural when typing.  The screen resolution is good and it has all of the connections you will need (USB, external speakers, etc).  Again, for the money I don't think you can buy a better machine for light everyday use.
Great product for light work.  Purchased this product to replace my wife's older laptop, but we didn't want to over spend.  This product arrived on time, packaged very well a great presentation.<br/><br/>Now to the usage, we do email, banking, shopping and our kids love to watch Netflix and ABC mouse, etc.  My wife uses it mainly for her school work, completing her Master's Degree so as you can imagine there are a lot of papers, research, downloading of articles etc.<br/><br/>It took a few days for her to get use to the new windows system. But that will come better with time, no big deal.  Now the issue, this new age of "The Cloud" this computer does not come with Office installed and the trail version is for the cloud version.  Not too bad if you are always at home or where a hot spot is, but at a play group or at the park is a challenge.  But no big deal, I loaded office on the computer and here is the issue after loading a few software options for her daily use (Office, Adobe, Quicken, printer drivers and hotspot driver) the memory is just about tapped out.  Which didn't leave a lot of room for anything else.  The good thing is the performance of the system was not slowed, still loads, operates and closes very quickly.<br/><br/>We will keep it, but just know this is a bare bones, essentials tool not a low priced luxury item. Worth the cost savings.<br/><br/>4 Stars as this meet our expectations and does the job, an upgrade in memory would get 5 Stars!
So far so good! One thing.....I ordered the signature edition to avoid unwanted things and didn't get it. So ive spent two hours uninstalling useless items. But good job on a user friendly bare bones notebook
comnpared to other HP laptops in the same price range, this one has better processing power and RAM. However, the blue color is quite off especially for a businessman like me who thinks that black is classy.
Excellent value and performance for the price.  Not having a huge hard drive is advantageous in that there is very little "bloatware".  Does everything it claims to, and sound quality is exceptional.
This is a great laptop for someone that just needs to use office, email, and internet. Although you won't be playing and fancy games on this computer, it works great for a simple office or student computer.
Works great! Very cute and compact, just what I was looking for. I wanted a small computer to use for little things like watching youtube videos and surfing the web. Does what it's supposed to do! Good buy.
My old laptop finally burned itself up and so I needed something new.  With a very tight budget, I thought I'd try something smaller, and hopefully quicker and let's face it low cost.  I stumbled upon this little guy and after only a couple day I have to admit I love it.<br/><br/>  - It is fast.  Boots from a shutdown in under 15 seconds - including signin.<br/>  - Keyboard.  Full-sized and great tactile feeling.<br/>  - Bloatware.  No not in favor of it - but really did not take that long to remove.  With Windows updates (which are needed for ANY new machine and removal of all the crapware, I was able to be productive in relatively short time.<br/>  - It does take some time to get used to saving everything in the cloud (comes with OneDrive, but I still use my Google Drive).  But it is seamless and works very well.<br/><br/>I found this machine to handle all my needs.  I am not a big gamer, but do play some online games occasionally and it handles multiple copies of them simultaneously quite well.  Certainly better than my old quad-core machine.  The screen is brilliant as well.  I have to admit it stream way better than most I have seen.<br/><br/>For about $200 - this is a steal - for you.  Well, it certainly was for me.  Note: I've even downloaded the desktop version of Office 2013 and still have plenty of local space to store stuff.  I do intend to get a large-capacity microSD, but so far the space hasn;t been missed.
I bought the 13.3 inch blue laptop.<br/>This is a great laptop for what you pay, and a great alternative to chromebooks.<br/>I got the blue laptop, and the color is very nice. The hp logo does show smudges very easily.<br/>The computer itself is pretty fast. As long as you aren't playing games that require more than 2 ram, this laptop can run just about anything. It does freeze when you put too much of a load on it, like having 15+ tabs open, or playing 4+ videos at a time. Otherwise, this computer runs pretty smoothly.<br/>The screen is HD and has a matte finish. It doesn't give any glare. The brightness is fine to me.<br/>Camera is ok.<br/>The keyboard is fine; it's a full size.<br/>Sound is a little tinny when volume is at the max. It also isn't very loud.<br/>One thing that isn't so great is the mouse. It is occasionally unresponsive, or registers a right click as a left. You also have to press pretty hard. I ended up getting a wireless mouse. No big deal; just another $10.<br/>I also dislike Windows 8.1. It isn't the best OS, and has a bit of a learning curve if you're used to Windows XP or 7. Windows 10 is coming out, so I hope it's better.<br/>---<br/>PROS:<br/>Price<br/>Appearance<br/>SSD (though only 32GB)<br/>Expandable memory (microSD slot)<br/>Microsoft Office for one year<br/>Lightweight<br/>USB 3.0 slot (1)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Mouse<br/>Windows 8.1 (Win10 is coming out, seems to be an improvement)<br/>2GB RAM (non expandable)<br/>Bloatware (easy to uninstall)<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great cheap laptop. It's perfect for school, work, for kids, etc. The cons are no big deal; what you pay for is what you get. And with this purchase you get more than you pay for, with the included Microsoft Office and 1TB OneDrive.<br/><br/>~~~UPDATE (3 WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE)~~~<br/>The top of my laptop has a scratch. It shows the white color of the computer. I don't even know how it happened, considering it was either on a table (unmoving), or in a padded case. Not happy about this.<br/>Something that also irks me is that the screen doesn't tilt very far back. Still usable. The hinges also seem a little weak to me, but they're holding up.<br/>Can't stand Win 8.1. This computer is eligible for WIn10 though. Make sure to install all updates, and then the laptop can have Win10.<br/>My rating has dropped half a star, a 3.5 out of 5, but I still think this laptop is okay. It'll be good for light users, school, as a secondary laptop, or kids.
I love it! But I wish I knew more about the storage. I cannot save and download a lot of things on it, because it keeps saying storage full. I guess I have to buy a micro card. Overall it's a great buy.
The sound blurs once in a while when you listen to music of watch videos. Came with antivirus for like a month. Very light and easy to use though.  Its okay. You get what you pay for. It is very simple.
A really nice computer for travel.  Keyboard not too small, and smooth feel.<br/>Very happy with it, as I need to work away from home a lot. Also, 11.6 inch great size...not too small, but big enough.
I bought this laptop just to do small things like resume's and look on different web sites. I really like the laptop the only thing is the keys don't feel as sturdy but works really well for the price.
This thing is the real deal.  $199 is a great price.  Great keyboard, great trackpad, great form factor.  Surprisingly fast after a few days of use.  I loaded Office on here, and it runs great.
I needed something small and compact to do my online college courses at home and while traveling. This has met my expectations so far and I haven't any issues with it yet. I absolutely love the color!
It worked great for a couple of days but then the screen keeps going blank every now and then even though the laptop is on. Have to power down and start up again. Seeking help with HP, no luck yet..
Computer arrived quickly and was easy to set up.  I do miss having the "right click" button on the touch pad.  I am still getting used to it but would rate it as a good value for the money.
REALLY GOOD PURCHASE FOR THE MONEY. I use it for streaming tV shows online, emails, etc. But nothing more, it is a secondary computer for entertainment in my case, Not for work.<br/>I got the Horizon Blue and the color is much better than I expected. I thought it was going to have a metallic finish but it is more of a royal blue on the outside and has a matte almost rubbery finish (it reminds me of the old Motorola V300 flip phone circa 2004) which makes it look less like a toy and a bit more mature. My impression is that it looks cool without trying too hard. It does have a faded darker to almost light blue (much lighter than in the picture) effect on the inside where the keyboard is and this one has a metallic finish with little dots there.<br/>As indicated in other reviews the track pad a bit flimsy, sometimes I have to click kind of hard on it other times super light does the trick -still getting used to it. That is the only negative thing about it, but i had read about it on the reviews so I am okay with it.<br/>I was originally going to get the new Microsoft Surface at the windows store but it was more than double the price, I know it is the latest thing, it has a touch screen and all (this one does not), but I did not want to spend that much money, so I am delighted with this one. Good product for the money.  Just in case you were wondering it has no DVD player
I enjoy this computer every day!! Love that it is lighter weight over the heavy laptops. Yes it does freeze up once in awhile but still not bad to use. This laptop is so perfect for the basic use.
I just received my computer today. I am so happy because it looks beautiful and fits my needs. I only use it for writing paper, surfing the internet, and watching some video. It works well so far.
I absolutely love my HP Stream. The colors are beautiful. My only complaint is the small amount of space and that the gift card offer that comes with it is not usable in my country (The Bahamas).
My main laptop is big and cumbersome for travel, so I purchased the HP Stream to give me mobility in the house and ease to travel because of its small size. The only purpose for this laptop was to be able to browse the internet, period. I did not install any applications, other than the ones it came with, and in fact, I removed some bloat-ware. I don't play games either. However, I couldn't browse the internet with this laptop.<br/><br/>The unit froze from time to time without any reason (the only application running was a lousy browser session), it consistently kept dropping the internet connection, and there was a constant and annoying buffering of video. I put up with it for one week until I finally decided to test this laptop against my main unit. I conducted several bandwidth speed test under exactly the same conditions, and the results showed my main laptop downloading consistently around 16.5 Mbps, while the HP Stream varied pretty badly from 0.5Mbps to only 12.6Mbps....this was a huge variation!<br/><br/>My big laptop would load the same internet pages pretty quick, while the Stream took much, much longer. Reviews on the internet confirmed that these HP Stream are known for their slowness, although few people seem to have better luck than others.<br/><br/>I was left with no choice but to return it. I will spend more money to buy something better.
Exactly what I was looking for. I needed to replace an old beat-up Dell Inspiron and debated for months whether I needed a new Windows machine or a Chromebook. I was attracted to the Chromebooks because of the price, weight, and supposed ease of use. After finally getting my hands on a friends Samsung Chromebook I decided I wanted something more feature rich. Now, Saying all that I'm going to review the laptop NOT Windows 8. First off this laptop looks great. The blue on the outside is a little darker than the picture, which is good. The inside has a nice fade from top to bottom which I didn't even notice until I used it for over a week. The contrast of the white keyboard on the blue background is really nice. The keyboard itself is very responsive and has a good feel when the keys are pressed. My girlfriend has a bit of trouble with the touchpad but I haven't had any trouble once I learned the two finger commands. The display is nice for everything I do with it and the sound is surprising from the small built in speakers. The battery does a lot better than expected. I don't use it every day and it will sit on the end table a couple of days without completely dying. The response of the touchpad is the only real complaint. It weighs a little more than the Chromebooks but still easily portable. Aside from Windows 8 which I am not holding against the laptop.
We own three computers. I run Window 8.1 for web site development and maintenance. This was purchased to replace my laptop for use when traveling. The unit bought is the 13.3 inch, non-touch screen, Windows 10 HP laptop. It had too many problems out of the box; I returned it. First, the sound was the worst I have ever heard on any computer, (very, very tinny), which I figured I could somehow fix later, so I continued the installation. It failed three times copying files from a remote server over the internet to the local hard drive; the failures hung the program, which had to be killed from the Task Manager. Three other times, when copying from a USB flash drive to the local hard drive it also failed, once giving the message "not enough memory," yet there was 12 GB free; that USB port, (the one on the left), was then dead until the computer was restarted, but the flash drive worked in either of the other two right ports just fine. Is it a problem with Windows 10 or the Stream or both? I don't know, but I am unwilling to spend more than the 7 hours it took to remove the bloatware, install the programs I use every day, and then remove it all before returning it.<br/><br/>The good news is Amazon's return policy; that is why there is a two-star review instead of one-star review.
This mini laptop is great.  The price is great for what it has to offer.  It is very light.  The battery life is amazing (CNET got it to run for almost eight hours in one test).  I added a class 10 SD card and a wireless mouse.  The touchpad is a little hard to use when performing delicate tasks like sorting pictures.  A wireless mouse made it all better.  I like the keyboard.  The keys require very little pressure when typing and do not make a lot of noise.  The display seem fine.  Some observations:  if there is an app for something you want, use it.  It will perform better than the traditional website.  I have noticed some intermittent audio distortion when listening to iTunes.  I tried this on both the speakers and headphones.  It appears to be related to the performance of the computer.  If you close out everything, it usually fixes it.  Internet explorer works better when you only have a few tabs open.  I haven't installed Chrome yet, but it will hopefully take up less system resources.  I plan on using this for traveling and random internet browsing in my house.  There is limited space on the solid state drive (32 gb) so I am trying to make the SD card more accessible but the card reader is slow.  I plan on supplementing the space with a thumb drive for photos.  With the right expectations, this $200 laptop could be what you are looking for.
I actually like this little gem; I also removed much of the bloat-ware and it helped somewhat. This machine could be "faster" but for what I paid for it: it performs exceptionally well.
Absolutely loving my new HP. I am still figuring out what to delete and what to keep in terms of apps but all in all super happy with my purchase. Think I might get one for my daughter as well.
It has it's little quirks, be super careful using the mouse pad or you'll zoom in and out like crazy, but the price can't be beat. For typing up lesson plans and checking emails, I'm pleased
so much more then I expected! for the money I was worried, I needed this for school and that is all so I did not want to spend too much and this little laptop has exceeded my expectations!
The photo makes the orchid magenta look purple but it's actually a bright, vibrant pink which is fine by me as I love the color. It's really light weight & works great. Happy I ordered it.
I've been buying devices off Amazon for years and I've never returned one until receiving this laptop and trying to work with it for 3 weeks. Beyond its spotty performance (audio stuttering was nearly constant - even when doing something as simple as surfing/listening to Pandora or Spotify at the same time), is the maddening trackpad, the settings for which I had to manually adjust to my liking only to still find it difficult to navigate with. But worst of all was the keyboard. I was constantly having difficulty getting the spacebar to function as I'm normally able to on any other machine or any other keyboard. It simply would not insert space with a right-thumb press, not without having to forcefully press the spacebar down. This made typing a major, major pain (I can't overstate this enough), and it was eventually the final nail in the coffin for this otherwise sleek, lightweight machine. I was truly disappointed to have to return it. I removed all the bloatware, adjusted the trackpad and tried everything under the sun to get it to fit my needs to no avail. I guess I shouldn't have expected much for just a little over $200, except that I even have a year old tablet within that price range, as well as a 2-year old Chromebook, both of which manage to function better than this thing. You can do better, trust me.
The laptop itself is actually pretty awesome, so long as you have an external hard drive to store all your information - or don't mind forking out some cash to pay for the OneDrive storage yearly. Otherwise, it has a decent amount of computing power for the price and size, but keep in mind that this is strictly a laptop that's meant for browsing the internet and a few other things, nothing hardcore like gaming or editing video. The only drawback is that there is another model, completely identical that is touchscreen - which I thought I was buying, but was disappointed to find on arrival that mine was not, in fact, the touchscreen model. However, that feature did save me $50 off the price and it's not something that I absolutely need in a laptop - that being said, it can get incredibly frustrating at time to navigate a lot of the Windows 8 features without touchscreen, since a lot of it was built for that specifically.<br/><br/>All in all, though - I'd say it's worth the buy, just pay attention to the specs and try and do you research before you jump in, I see a lot of reviews from people that don't understand what this laptop is supposed to do and imagine that it'll stack up to a MacBook or Surface - it won't. If anything, this is supposed to compete with something along the lines of the Chromebook.
The first one I bought was horrible.  The mouse froze and things would open that I did not click on. I exchanged it and the second one seems to be working much better. There is no dvd/cd drive so you will have to get an external one. It kind of looks like a toy out of the box. I tried to upload my photos from my phone and it would not work at all on the first computer. On the second one it was very slow and all the files would not load.
I gave as a gift and received for a gift. I am still becoming familiar with how it works but am very pleased with the HP Stream thus far. Really looking forward to access all it can do.
Love this laptop! It meets all my needs for word processing and web exploring. However, I was not able to get the Office 365 for one year as claimed. It is only free for one month.
After about 5 or 6 months, keyboard began double typing almost every letter. Very frustrating and time consuming.  Now after just 7 months,  keyboard stopped working completely. Will not type anything. Plus, this computer wasn't really used that much. It's like new. I could understand if product was used all day, every day and was just worn out. Not the case here. For it to just stop typing in just 6 months time is unacceptable. For it to not have, at least, a one year manufacturer warranty is unacceptable. I would NOT recommend this product. I've been in touch with others who bought this computer & have the same problem. Keyboard just stops working! Do not purchase if you want something that will last for more than 6 months! Unacceptable! Very disappointed!
My daughter has this laptop and uses it for High School.  She really likes It.  She does a lot of writing for the school paper and uses it for her advanced writing classes in English.
OK so this computer is everything I wanted and more. I wanted something small, light, efficient, and cheap. I got just that with this computer 10/10 would recommend and buy again 😊
Lightweight and compact. I have had no problems running any programs. Perfect PC to pursue my continuing education. Love I can carry ths PC in a sleeve and fits nicely in my purse.
Awesome little computer- perfect for school, web browsing, emails, and basic computing. But- NOTHING else. Which is totally okay- because this is an adorable and useful computer.
Good deal for the money.  Read other reviews for detailed plus and minuses but you will not be disappointed, a good travel laptop that you won't yelp too loud should you lose it.
I just got it today and it is so cute , I am in love with the color . It runs and works pretty well since I've been on it. I bought mine for basic student uses and so far so good
Just received this one a few days, ago, and already the keyboard has stopped responding. 1st day of class, keyboard wouldn't respond, are you kidding me.  Sending it back ASAP.
Meh.  Not great, runs slowly, too much junk and the key board and mouse are sticky almost all of the time.  Will give to my husband to take notes at school, big waste of money.
This cutie laptop is perfect for a portable & lightweight computer that fits my needs. I LOVE the cobalt blue, the non-slick casing, the rounded corners and the nice-sized screen (10x6).<br/><br/>I LOVE the wide & spacious keyboard - white keys, larger sized, that don't "rattle" when I type.  I have typed on several "small" laptops/notebooks.  The feel of the others felt cramped and not as responsive as these keys on the HP Stream.<br/><br/>This little laptop is so light in weight (4#?).  The clam shell case opens quite wide for easier viewing when I'm standing at a bar-counter height.  It efficiently handles the simple tasks I need for these short periods (email, searches)...very basic needs.<br/><br/>My husband said that the battery life between charges is impressive...he estimated approx 12 hours.<br/><br/>The HP Stream is not a "touch screen" and a mouse can be set-up as an option if desired.<br/><br/>My part of this review is from a non-techie wife who is gratefully married to a techie husband.  (He will handle that part of the review later)<br/>I'm VERY happy with this combination + seeing the color charms me (I'm simple and more artistic).  Love it!!
This isnt a powerful laptop, everybody knows it, but is perfect for microsoft office, surfing the web, youtube, skype, that kind of task.<br/><br/>So its good for the price.
I love this computer. It shipped incredibly fast. It was brand new I recommend this to all college students especially because I got a free one year trial for office 365😍😍😍
i absolutely love my new netbook!! it works great,is beautiful,and was delivered on time. i would recommend this for anyone with a need for a basic computer-thank you amazon!!
Great laptop. Easy to use. Heard about windows 8.1  not being very friendly to use but not having  any issues being hard to use. Very compact. like it a lot. Was only $199.00.
I have been trying to think of something positive to say about this laptop and I am struggling.  I have had ti a couple months now and it has been a disappointment.<br/><br/>I got this to replace a 6 year old Gateway laptop I had and it is not much better than that 6 year old dinosaur.  It came with a free year of Microsoft Office 365 which led me to believe it would actually be able to run it, not so much.<br/><br/>I suppose if the only thing you were going to do is surf the web it would probably be ok, but honestly it struggles to do even that.  Pretty much all I do on this is web surfing now, after having too many frustrating experiences trying to run actual programs and even still I will get warnings pop up that tell me the machine is critically low on memory and I need to close Firefox - but Firefox is the only thing running and I am not even doing anything that intense.<br/><br/>At the end of the day I wish I would have spent a little more money and got a decent machine.  I bought my kids Chromebooks and I wish I would have gotten one of them instead of this - all they do is surf the web and they do it better than this thing.  I give it two stars because it is so inexpensive (but you get what you pay for).
got it just now just set it up Iove it idk whats up with half these people on here complaining this is awesome very pleased thank you again I recommend this to everyone!!!!!
Small enough to use any place, power full for such a small laptop. It will not be replacing my 17" HP laptop for serious work but is much more convenient to travel with.
Good for school and writing papers but don't download windows 10 it will take up all your memory on the laptop and you won't be able to download the updates to your laptop
I just need it for shopping online, web browsing but very disappointed. Havent installed any apps but Its kinda slow, sometimes lagging. The touch pad isnt very responsive
laptop was delivered on time and in good condition. it took awhile for the unit to operate as it should and it has already frozen a couple of times. I guess I'll keep it.
this laptop is so slow that you will fall asleep. i am not happy with the laptop. i  do not know how come this laptop get great reviews. i am not happy with that laptop.
I had to wait a long time for this computer doing to it being out of stock for so long. I think it was worth the wait.  I love the looks, feel and weight.  The keyboard is perfect.  The touch pad is not as good as the one on my Toshiba.  Its kinda hard to describe but for one example when you go to move a cursor it may decide you want to swap to a previous screen.  Its a nice feature if that was what you were  trying to do, but frankly I cant think of a time I've actually wanted it to do that outside of testing out how it worked.  It also doesn't have a right click button and takes a bit of practice or attempts maybe to get the right click to work with the 2 finger touch.  If you are familiar with and like windows 8.1 and like using the tiles then I think it goes together very well.  For the most part I flip over to the regular looking windows screen and use a browser for checking email, shopping, and surfing.  I'm not currently into any games so I couldn't say how it would perform on one but for what I use it for its performance has been superb.  I haven't used Office much yet but so far it has been pretty awesome having office again.  It is definitely a good computer and a great price.
This computer was purchased to replace a relatively new, fairly expensive Lenovo laptop, which was falling apart (physically).  Since it seems to be impossible to buy anything in the technology arena that lasts very long, I decided to go cheap this time.  In the future, I will use my desktop for my more sophisticated computer needs and use this one, essentially, as an internet device.  For that, it is sufficient.  It is sometimes slow to reconnect to my wifi and to my personal cloud.  The color is every bit as hideous as it looks in the picture.  It almost kept me from buying the computer.  Had I realized that it was not possible to remove the recovery drive, I would have most likely not purchased it.  The available memory is simply too small.  I use a 128 gb SD card for memory and have only loaded minimal software and I am down to about 6gb.  After researching removing the recovery drive I am hesitant to do so.  Some of my research indicates that its removal  can cause the computer to not work correctly, since the system uses some of the files.  I have no idea if this is true, but am not chancing it for now.  It is light weight and should travel well.  It is about what I expected.<br/><br/>Update:  It is actually less than I expected.  I have, without adding any additional apps or software, begun to get notice that my memory is critically low.  The usable memory on this computer makes it of little value for anything except surfing the web.  Although I didn't expect much more, I did expect to be able to put a few basic apps on it and use them.  I have a 128 gb card to store all of my documents, photos, etc.  No data or documents are stored on the device.  It is simply too limited.  In addition, the track pad has begun to right click everywhere I hit it, except for the far left hand corner.  Very annoying.  I will be replacing it with another lower end laptop
nice computer with that price, affordable for the people who only want to do the basic stuffs with long battery life and light weight. I will definitely recommend this.
I should have learned my lesson on buying these little netbooks...I've probably bought 7 over the last few years, they always die prematurely or have some other limitation that makes them impractical.  I was excited to see this one running Windows, with the advertised free upgrade to Windows 10.  I bought it instantly, as the reviews were mostly great.  But there's one vast, HUGE problem that renders this laptop completely unacceptable for me.  You CANNOT upgrade to Windows 10.  It doesn't have the hard drive capacity.  I downloaded the update (after stripping off all the unnecessary bloatware), and when I went to install it, I was informed I needed 9GB of additional empty hard drive space, as Windows 10 needs 10.1GB of space on the hard drive.  Windows 8.1 is far better than Windows 8, but it's still not an acceptable OS for a fully functional computer.  It's fine for a tablet, but a laptop is not a tablet.  If you're accustomed to the burden of Windows 8.1, this will probably be fine for you.  But you cannot run Windows 10 on this machine unless you wipe the hard drive and install it from a flash drive onto a clean, formatted drive...entailing you purchase Windows 10 separately.
The HP Stream 11 Laptop by far is the easiest computer that I have had to setup.  I took it from the box and the computer led me step by step to setup.  This computer is great for those of us that are use to using apps since you can purchase apps to use on the computer. Many apps are free like Netflix.  It also has Office 365 Personal for One Year free for anyone that uses the Office Products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.).<br/><br/>Once I found my way around this computer I was so excited to share what all this laptop had to offer with my friends.  They all were amazed with how light the computer is because I carried it around very easily and even took it on a road trip.  It was great not having to have a huge bag to carry it in.  By the way Amazon has a AmazonBasics bag that fits this computer perfectly and the bag was under $15 when I purchased it.<br/><br/>This computer is great for those of us who like to take our laptops on the go.  It was very easy to get it going on the WIFI wherever I went.  It is very lightweight and even a child could use this one with ease.  I definitely recommend the HP Stream 11 Laptop to others.  I give this laptop a 4.5 stars.
Very bad laptop!  It practically shorted out the first week!!!! and now I can't get a replacement!! I wish amazon would send me a replacement:( Very disappointed!!!!
HP Pre-loaded with HP Juks. Can not get rid of it. Windows 8.1 is a Junk OP. Had its own mind. No wonder Windows 8.1 is a MS Failed O/S. 8.1 Sucks. I've returned it.
Alright, so this little machine really want a bad experience! I'll start of by saying that the keyboard is fantastic, it's got full keys that have a certain texture on them and once pressed down have a certain welcoming "clicky" feel. Needless to say if your not a power user and know the work around of how to properly use a subdued machine with 2gb of RAM, then this will do everything a celeron processor is aloud. When putting it into performance mode (which takes it window's fancy animations and things) then you can get a decent amount of RAM usable! After changing to performance mode and eliminating processes I want using at the time, without anything open I managed to get an average of 800 mb of usable RAM. And when I would open up chrome with a couple tasks, file manager, and subdued media player all at once I could manage still 400 or so MB of left memory. So needless to say, buying this laptop at bestbuy for only $180, was a steal! The speakers are pretty nice too. Heck, even using Windows Movie Maker was hassle free when i out together a simple video for YouTube! All in all, if you are the average computer user, this should dedicatedly suffice!
This product was delivered on July 17th and worked fine for about 4-5 weeks even after I suffered some of the same problems starting it up that others have described.  It was purchased for my wife who only used it to check emails occasionally or read the paper online.  Then her health declined sharply near the middle of August and the laptop (still working well) was placed aside on the charger.  For the next 6-8 weeks it was only booted up a few times a week to update the anti-virus protection, etc.  The last week I went to boot it up and it is DEAD.  Won't start on battery; won't start with power cord plugged in; just blank.  Power cord has been checked; power on switch has been checked; NOTHING.<br/><br/>There is no indication that it is getting power except that the bottom is very warm so power is going somewhere.  I don't know if this HP version has a safety cutoff switch or not.  I can't return it to Amazon because it didn't break down in the first 30 days; and, I don't know how HP will try to address this as a warranty matter.  I certainly don't want to waste a lot of time trying to contact them, but I guess I'll have to ... VERY FRUSTRATING.
I bought this with low expectations. Wanted something to browse the Internet, manage pics and iTunes with. This pos can't even handle that much. Very disappointed.
I love this little baby. The camera is amazing and the videos show clear. It doesn't have a lot of space, so you have to add an sd card. I love it other than that.
I love my new laptop!! It's excellent and easy to use. Very lightweight and perfect screen size. I do online classes for college and this is the best laptop yet!!
Lightweight, great for hotel rooms and airlines. Not bulky, works great, is cute, had lots of lookers and more who were surprised by how well it really did work!!
Man oh man do I regret this purchase!  No available memory. The apps crash more often than they work. Once you install windows 10 and Microsoft office, only 50 mb of memory are left. You get multiple notifications regarding the memory every time you boot up, every time you try to save a simple document, and every few days because of the temporary internet files.  "Oh well," I thought. I'll just upgrade the memory and install it myself. Nope.  Can't be upgraded.  It gets worse.  The video driver needs an upgrade. Not enough memory. About 10% of the time you switch between apps, the screen just blacks out, especially between PowerPoint and Microsoft edge. Sometimes just switching tabs on internet explorer causes the screen to go black. When it comes back on, I get a message that tells me to install critical updates for the video driver. Well I can't. Worse yet, about half the time that the screen goes black, it doesn't come back on so it has to be manually restarted. This stupid computer easily triples the amount of time that it takes me to do homework. Time to bite the bullet and buy a Mac or something else that actually performs.
I love this small laptop! It's so perfect for me, I bought this laptop because my other HP laptop was too big and heavy and the back light went out two years ago and I never fixed it. I wanted something lighter, thinner and wouldn't be a hassle to take anywhere. I was worried about the storage space however, since Microsoft offers you 1TB free for a year, you can save everything to the cloud and you should not have any problems with this laptop. I'm a (new) vlogger and I needed something to edit my videos besides using my iPhone, I actually downloaded Movie Maker from the Microsoft website and it works perfectly fine. I was surprised actually for the price for this computer and what it can actually offer you. Some reviews scared me but I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did! There are some moments where it may run slow but that's because you have a lot of tasks open. Just remember to delete the apps you don't need so you will have more storage space. The purple is soooo beautiful, I smile every time I look down. The picture on the website is nice however, you'll be blown away when you see it in person!! I will upload some pics.
Real OS is great.  (I upgraded now to Windows 10.)  An excellent value.<br/><br/>A very Big drawback is the lack of disk space. Buy a good USB 3.0 flash drive.
I received this laptop a few days ago. I love how lightweight it is! And the color is great! Pretty and pink! The only issue I have experienced so far is the screen. The dimming of the screen goes from bright to darker without me changing it. Its not a huge issue, but it can be kind of distracting. Also, the main issue I found that others are having are that there is not enough space. I just transfer my files to the cloud, or my Dropbox (for documents, I am a full time college student) and I also purchased a 64gb USB to store all my documents from my old laptop. As regards the "missing" CD-ROMs, I am not missing that at all. The lightness of weight I think is due to not having that built in. I utilize my Ipad for most apps and streaming so when I received it, I deleted almost all of the apps preloaded on the computer and will not be using the computer for that. If you are a college student like myself, that needs a very basic and simple computer to work on homework and online classes and that is affordable and easy to carry around, I definitely recommend. It may have some unlikable things but for the price you cant beat it.
This laptop has definitely underwhelmed me. I switched over to the HP Stream from a Samsung Chromebook in order to be able to use Microsoft Word and other programs with Windows 8, but 6 months in I wish I would have stuck with the Chromebook.<br/><br/>I have three major issues with the HP Stream:<br/>- The laptop consistently does not wake up from sleep. It often takes 15-20 tries just to get the laptop to wake up. The same situation applies to powering the laptop up. I spoke with HP about this and the best they could recommend was to do a hard reset of the laptop, meaning I would lose all of my files saved to a C Drive, which is not a problem when you have them backed up, but if not, it's not a viable solution.<br/>- I often have internet connectivity issues. It often takes 15-20 minutes for the laptop to finally plug into my recognized networks.<br/>- The laptop does not recognize my external hard drive.<br/><br/>With all that said, it is a bargain priced laptop, and you get what you pay for. But in my experience, I've had a myriad of problems with the HP Stream while the Chromebook worked almost flawlessly, aside from not being able to run Windows and Mac based programs.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I am downgrading my review to 1-star. The laptop continues to perform miserably, and HP Support is a nightmare to deal with. Stay away!
This laptop is great for the price, but the mousepad is terrible and the screen quality is poor. Can't beat the price if all you need is Word and the internet.
Bought this computer June 7, 2015 as a birthday present to my daughter in July (she is over the age of 35 not a small child or teenager).  I bought the protective case along with the computer.  In the beginning of Sept. the upper left side of the screen went funky, with just colors and weird lines, and you could not see anything in that part of the screen.  We got out a magnifying glass to see if we could find any punctures or dings in that are of the screen and could not find anything.  The computer was never dropped and always placed back in the protective case when not in use.  We contacted HP and they sent a box for us to return the computer to them.  They called within a week and said that the damaged was caused by the consumer not a flaw in the computer and they could fix it for $275.00 - Unreal as we paid less that $200.00 for the computer.  They said the damage was probably cause  by closing the laptop with something on the keyboard (I think we would have noticed doing that).  I have had bad experiences with HP products in the past and should have known better.  Will never purchase another HP product again.
This is a replacement for my 10 inch tablet that was used for on the go, minor photo organizing/editing while travelling, with something that has multiple USB ports, at least one USB 3.0, decent size keyboard and full size HDMI out.<br/>I can't stand Windows, so I've swapped it out for Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS 64 bit (due to the small size of the internal storage wouldn't recommend dual boot!). It installed fine from a USB stick, just had to disable secure boot and change the booting order in BIOS (don't forget to change it back after installation). Instructions: http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03724171<br/>Everything works fine, WiFi, Bluetooth, SD card reader (although it's quite slow, only got 23 MB/s, better off with a USB 3.0 external reader), ports, trackpad (even 'right click' and 2 finger scroll), function keys. The only roadblocks I ran into was the WiFi status indicator didn't show up in the notification bar (the WiFi worked, just no signal indicator in the notification bar), but running [sudo apt-get install indicator-applet indicator-network] in terminal solved it.<br/>And had to install "exfat-fuse" and "exfat-utils" from repository to read SD cards larger than 32GB. I used Synaptic Manager for that.<br/>The only reason I knocked it down 1 start, because it would be nice to have a quad core processor instead of the dual core and 2 USB 3.0 ports instead of 1 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0, but you can't beat this little, Chromebook sized unit at $179!
During Amazon's Prime Day I saw this laptop for sale in two colors one being blue and the other being a violet pink. I wanted the blue, but it was sold out immediately so I had to settle for the violet pink. It's very light, small than basic laptops, and is a very fast laptop to my surprise. If you don't like the touch sensor mouse that it has you can connect a mouse view usb or wirelessly to accommodate your preferences. I don't use apps as much on it, so a lot of space is just taken up from pictures on my phone while my music and videos are all separately put on an external hard drive. Unlike the later models this one isn't touch screen so your using a mouse all the time, but I'm okay with that. I still haven't gotten the recent update for Windows 10, but again I'm okay with that. Maybe it'll update somewhere down the line, but it's whatever. It's pretty convenient that it came with the Microsoft Office Suite for a year, but the supposed $25 gift card from Microsoft is invalid due to link being a dead end. Other than those few tidbits I'm satisfied with this purchase and use this laptop with no issues at all.
Wish it had more storage space on it's SSD(Solid State Drive), but I could have paid more if I had wanted more. Good laptop for small spaces, and very light.
Great little laptop for everyday use. The only thing that I find a little aggravating is when I unintentionally switch from desktop mode to the window mode.
Heats up quickly despite low power processor and flash memory, as has no fan. Trackpad clucks poorly and stopped working after a month of daily use.
Some of the negative reviewers need to put things in perspective.  This notebook is very well made for an entry-level windows 8.1 experience.  This is a perfect device for browsing the internet, checking emails, word processing, and any other productivity related task.  This is not a gaming machine, this is not a graphics editing machine .  Yes it only has 2GB of RAM, yes it only has 32GB of storage, yes it has a Celeron processor instead of an i7.  But for $200, this is the best windows experience on the market for that price range.  I personally am changing my long-term career from IT to Business.  Needless to say, I needed to start immersing myself in the windows ecosystem (reluctantly).  For those giving negative reviews for this product based on windows related annoyances, I get it...  When it all comes down to it, this notebook serves it's purpose for word documents and excel spread sheets.  Battery life is phenomenal.<br/><br/>I would like to recommend adding an SD card to expand storage space if 32GB is not enough.  Also consider getting a wireless mouse (preferably bluethooth).
Hey I have a question can you download iTunes on this computer I'm trying to purchase a laptop so I can connect my iPhone to it and use iTunes please help
I was able to get a refurbished one of these for about $160 and it was in amazing condition since it was factory refurbished. Amazing deal and amazing laptop given the price. It's super sleek and skinny and the keyboard is pretty good. The trackpad features are a little weird so I went into settings and turned off all the extras except for clicking and two finger scrolling. I had Win 8.1 for a little bit than freed up some space and upgraded it to Win 10, however I went into settings to optimize performance over appearance so it works decent given the hardware. It can't really multitask that well but for the price I don't really expect it to. I mostly use it for word and some basic internet surfing. I'd recommend getting the 13" since the extra room on the keyboard and screen is worth it. The best part is probably the battery life, it lasts a super long time for such a cheap computer. If you're worried about not having space, or maybe you don't like saving things on the cloud, than you can just use a memory card or flash drive if you want the extra space to save stuff physically.
I've only owned this laptop for about a month but I can say that I so far love it. I needed something a bit more powerful than my Samsung Chromebook, but portable and less of a hassle than my desktop, for blogging and photo editing. So far this has exceeded every expectation I had for a $200 laptop. The 13" screen size is just perfect, I've had many laptops in the past but ended up getting rid of them due to bulkiness, this definitely is an improvement. I use it mostly for internet and it's super fast and responsive, much like my Chromebook. Setting up Microsoft Office was a breeze and I am happy to have all the options of the software for a free year. I love the keyboard, and the sound quality and screen quality are pretty great to me. The only issues I ever run into are that the mouse could be more responsive, and getting used to the opposite up/down scrolling than my other devices is kind of weird. Very small issues to deal with, though. Overall I am very happy with my purchase. I ended up buying it at a local Office Depot as Amazon was continuously sold out after Christmas.
This laptop was worth every penny!  I use it every day for writing, checking emails, and viewing media, and have not experienced one problem with it yet.
Love my laptop, it's small and light, perfect for sticking it in a purse for class. Comes with a lot of features perfect for note taking and assignments.
I love the HP Stream. Light, nice looking, and the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop! Instantly weaned me off my iPad and back to a laptop!
For two days I have used this newly bought laptop, and I can only say good things about it. The battery life is good, may be not amazing, but good nonetheless (6 - 7 hours depending on wifi use.). The laptop feels light, but not flimsy. When I listen to music or a video, fifty percent volume is more than enough to hear my media clearly, and I only need the brightness on fifty percent as well. And, did you know that this laptop has bluetooth? This is amazing for those who are starting to purchase bluetooth speakers and earphones.<br/><br/>There is one item of annoyance, which I must note, and that others have noted as well. The trackpad is not the best. It has a loud click, and it take a little while to get acclimated to the swipe motions. For this point, if you have the same annoyance as myself, make sure to go into to the windows settings and change the mouse settings. Making those simple changes, will make the annoyance a forgotten nightmare.<br/><br/>Overall, for $200 I would highly recommend anyone getting this laptop. It is a perfect choice for young and old alike.
I got this for my daughter as a second laptop.  She said it runs excellent.  She loves it for just jumping on the internet for browsing, chat and mail.
Nice looking, modern, cool materials used - small, very light.<br/>I though it was a bit slow for a new computer, but what to expect from a Celeron...
Like most reviewers have already said, this laptop is great for the price! So long as you're not looking into heavy gaming or storing large amounts of data. It's small and light which makes it easily portable, has a sleek design, and does basically everything you need, from running Microsoft Office smoothly, to browsing the web, to streaming movies online. The keyboard is very good, better than most other laptops I've seen around this price range. The only real downsides I would say are the memory (around 30GB), and the mousepad. The mousepad is not the greatest. However, the memory issue is an easy fix! Considering the affordability of this laptop, I personally think that it's worth it to invest in an external micro SD card. I got one that was 128 GB for under $100, making this laptop now on par with most other laptops that will cost you $200+ more than this laptop. So really, the only downside is the mousepad. Overall, a great portable laptop for the price. Definitely worth it if you're looking for something light and portable, and can handle everyday activities.
SECOND PURCHASE  Have one Blue (for myself) and one Orchid (as a gift). Unpacked my new HP Stream 13 yesterday and spent about 5 or 6 hours configuring, loading up, accessorizing and enjoying the HECK out of this little marvel. Put it through the paces, and got a grasp on it's abilities & limitations.<br/><br/>First things first  this looks  FANTASTIC. The photos do not do it justice, it is absolutely beautiful to the eye and to the touch. I've read a few reviews complaining about the "toy colors", most of whom are not verified owners (many of whom are technical "experts" who own nothing but review everything). I brought this to a Coffee Shop this morning, fired it up and had several people come by my table to ask "Wow! what is that"  "Where do you get a laptop like that"  "Who makes it"  "Wow!".<br/><br/>It only took 5 minutes to KNOW, it would be my permanent chromebook replacement (have put the chromebook on craigslist). The complimentary year of Office 365, being able to PRINT... Read more
I bought the HP Stream 13 Signature Edition from the Microsoft store.<br/><br/>Let me start with the why of the purchase:<br/><br/>My oldest daughter is in 1st grade and has websites she needs to access to practice math and other things on the internet. I have gone back and forth between getting a Chromebook or not. I liked that it was fast, lightweight, and a pick up and go type of thing.<br/><br/>However, I wanted something that would be able to access things I do on my regular computers as well as any website that requires Flash, Java, Silverlight, etc. I knew getting a standard 8.1 version of Windows that there wouldn't be any software limitations holding me back (or my daughter) from accomplishing the tasks we wanted to do.<br/><br/>So I found this, saw it was a non-moving part hard drive (eMMC 32gb) and that it boots fast and has great battery life.<br/><br/>So I bought it.<br/><br/>It works great, you just have to use it for what it is made for. It isn't a heavy duty multi-tasker, the CPU and RAM will get fully used wit... Read more
I like it a lot. We just needed a basic laptop. With price and everything we are very happy. It came with free 1 year office 360 and that was a plus.
I was hesitant buying this because I was replacing a Lenovo Thinkpad x100e strictly for traveling consulting.  So we're talking airports, TSA, onboard use, etc.  WOW!  I took all of the reviewers advise and deleted ALL of the programs it came with.  Just kept the OS and the basics... everything else gone.  Kept the Office 365 and I'll reevaluate if I want to load Office 2013 and drop the subscription.  Loaded AVG as my virus software, Adobe suite, Chrome, and Firefox.  Loaded all my current documents which include a ton of Powerpoint and Word reports.  Bottom line is that I'm only using 60% of my C drive.  The Stream screams, boots up super quick, it's light as can be...silly light, full size keyboard which is fine (and I'm a typer from the old school... don't look when I type).  Fabulous!!!  A steal!!!  All that said, I would suggest anyone buying this machine practically wipe out everything it comes with besides the OS and remember this puppy is cutesie blue...gotta man thru that part when sitting in front of a client!!!!!!!!!!!  LOL  Enjoy everyone.
If you're looking for a cheap laptop to just browse the internet or do some homework, this is perfect.  The keyboard is a good size, and is not too firm, so it's really easy to press any key.  I have heard people complain about the screen being awful, but I didn't have a problem with it. It has a matte finish, so there is no annoying glare that other laptops have.  The speakers on this are amazing, so there is no issue with sound.  I still haven't installed the Microsoft Office suite, but it's great that it comes with 1 free year of it.  The battery life is listed at around 8 hours, but mine has roughly 6 1/2 hours of continuous use.  I do have a couple of complaints, though:  the screen does not fold back all the way, you have to double or triple click on some things (there are issues with the mouse), and I have had some problems with Internet Explorer not opening up some web pages.  Other than that, it's a great laptop for my needs.  As far as the shipping goes, it arrived sooner than expected and was nicely and securely packaged with all the extras.
This has turned out to be a great little laptop. It was a very value type laptop but it is doing it's job and working flawlessly. I would buy again.
Such a light, sturdy HP laptop--so much better than those smaller SURFACE tablets that refuse to run non-Microsoft products (including Adobe PDFs!).
Great laptop for a great price...I just use it for school to research and type papers on...I did purchase external hard drive for additional storage
I had to get mine at a different store, cause it was at my budget. The only thing this computer is useful for is gaming, except when it can't open certain files like JAR files. I've only had it for a few weeks. First problem, the storage capacity is AWFUL! It downloads a bunch of apps during the start up process that uses majority of the memory space. I went through and uninstalled/deleted anything I wasn't going to use, and I still only have 4.35 GB of memory when it's supposed to have 21.5 GB. So I can't download a lot of music and save a ton of pictures to it. Two, it doesn't come with iTunes, so you have to download it yourself (after it went ahead and wiped off all the music off my iPod). Three, and I don't know what I'm doing to make it do this, but out of nowhere, when I move the cursor to the right, it switches me out of the current app I'm using and goes back to my desktop. I open the program again and it does it a few times before stopping. It's okay, but it's not that great.
Very disappointed! My chromebook is twice as fast as this computer, the microphone didn't work, and I was unable to download Chrome. I returned it.
Perfect for a pre-teen needing a laptop. Not in love with the windows 8, but who is. Didn't receive a $25 gift card like it stated in the details.
Bought for each of my 2 kids, ages 13 and 11. They're great for their homework and Web access. They love them. No issues at all. Perfect for them.
Great computer for the price.  I love my Samsung Chromebook and this computer is good for the kids and I to access the Internet.  Would buy again.
Love my new Stream 11 Laptop!!  Although I only use it for fun and not for work, it has everything I want and need.  Would defininately recommend.
Perfect if you don't need a huge laptop with a lot of space. Have had mine for 6 months and no problems. I even use this for my work at home job.
purchased an acer first....  not good... 2nd acer NG.. replaced w/this HP... works wonderfully... and if the wife is happy, i'm in a good place.
The Stream 11 and 13 are great deals for those knowing what they're getting.<br/><br/>I purchased both the Stream 11 and 13, not knowing which would be best for my situation. For those without a primary computer, it'd be tough to recommend as there are some significant drawbacks, but at this price point, that is to be expected.<br/>These computers could no way replace my primary source of computing, however they're a substantially investment and good value for light/every day computing tasks. If you're planning on surfing the web, emailing, watching videos/listening to music or even playing light gaming, this is a wonderful value.<br/><br/>If you are planning to do some substantial gaming, look elsewhere. I fired up Starcraft 2 just for kicks and it couldn't keep up. Likewise with Marvel Heroes, even streaming from my desktop via Steam, I was surprised at how laggy it was, even with my desktop doing all the heavy lifting. This just reinforces that these machines weren't designed for this task. But if y... Read more
I love this laptop so much!<br/>I was looking for something that worked nice but I was really strapped for cash at the time.<br/>I was somewhat weary of purchasing this at first, because of all the reviews I had read about it, but decided it was the best choice for my price range.<br/>I've only had it for a little while and I have nothing but good things to say!<br/>First off, I absolutely love the color! The white on pink keyboard is amazing, also the size of they keyboard is pretty amazing! I've had no troubles typing on it at all. It runs smooth and is amazing for school work and surfing the web.<br/><br/>I obviously wouldn't recommend this laptop if you are looking for gaming. It's just for basic things. Ive read way to many negative reviews because this doesn't run GTA 5, Sims 4, and any other popular games. You cant expect to have $1000 computer graphics for this price.<br/><br/>Overall, I seriously believe that this was an excellent purchase and I would buy this for a gift if I ever get the chance again!
Hi everyone, I received the blue Steam 11 directly from HP today. I have only spent a few hours with it but I thought I would post a quick review. It seems like a lot of computer for the money, it has a very solid feel. The only complaint I have is my touchpad has a slight rattle, when you tap it lightly you can hear and feel a rattle. It is hard to explain but it does not have the same tight, spring-loaded feel of other laptop touchpads I have used. I usually use an external mouse so it should not be an issue.<br/><br/>I did not test performance other than playing some YouTube videos at 720p and the performance seemed good. I plugged in a 23 inch LCD TV to the HDMI port and that looked very good and the audio played through the TV speakers automatically and sounded good. I checked the disk with the Windows Disk Management Utility and it shows it has a 29 GB Hynix HBG4e with a 260 MB EFI partition, 21.54 GB NTFS C: drive (4.3 GB used, 17.2 GB free) and a 7.20 GB Recovery partition.<br/><br/>Changin...

It's cute, the price was right. But If you had a apple laptop before this one cannot compare to it but gets the job done for a College student.
This computer started out ok, but the screen started flickering after about two months. Disappointed, now I need to deal with HP's tech support
Buyer beware. Great specs for price but make sure you are aware of the drive size and that there is no ethernet port. Perfect for cloud users.
For the price this can't be beat. For email, web surfing & regular computer work this is a fast snappy performer in a light compact package.
Purchased the laptop for online classes. I cleared out some of the useless programs as outlined in the top review here. It is super fast. I can turn it on and be on a webpage in seconds. I can even have a few tabs open at the same time, and I always keep outlook open and signed in for my school emails. It does everything I need it to do. Do not expect this to be a powerful gaming PC. It's not, and you won't find that in this price range.<br/>The color is brilliant and beautiful (the magenta). It's a very cute laptop.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint would the lack of space. Of course that was expected with a 32 gb HD. What I didn't expect was for only 12gb to be available  (less than half) after removing the unnecessary stuff, and only 7 after installing Office. Upgrading to windows 10 did free up another 2gb, but I had to attach a flash drive to do it because the upgrade needs 10gb available, so I'd recommend doing the upgrade before installing Office.  I will be getting a micro-SD to expand.
I love this little lap top. Be advised that it doesn't have an Ethernet cable port, or a standard SD card slot. It has a little micro sc card slot. But it has plenty of USB slots where I could put SD card stick. If that makes sense. This computer is perfect for what I need. Shopping, Facebooking, watching movies, listening to music, and Online College. The sound quality and screen brightness is beautiful. Much better than my husband's mac book pro in my opinion. I can never hear on his computer, but this little pink beauty is super loud. The only think I wish were different is the keyboard. I really like the light up keys, but this doesn't have it. Next I need to buy the cute matching case. I really like that it doesn't have the fan on the bottom so I can keep it on my lap. Also, you can go online and get information on which bloatware to remove to speed it up. These lap tops normally come pre-installed with a crap ton of programs you'll never use. Great buy. Nice and light, thin and cute!
Love it!  Just the right size.  Not a fan of tablets and this is just the right size for me and fits easily into my purse to take ANYWHERE.
This laptop is absolutely fine for casual users. The 2GB RAM seems low but I've encountered no problems, even when using Skype and 8-10 tabs on Chrome at the same time. I've had it for a few months now.<br/>It's a modern marvel that this product is able to be offered at such a low price.<br/><br/>I have also dropped it several times without a case and spilled small amounts of water on it and it hasn't broken. It probably wouldn't survive a fall onto concrete but it seems sturdy enough for any situation that would reasonably happen during normal household use.<br/><br/>I think of it as a Chromebook for people who don't want ChromeOS. Sure, it's not going to work well for most gaming or professional uses, but it didn't promise that.<br/><br/>The only problem is that it came with TONS of bloatware. I can see why people think this machine is slow: there's tons of crap that tries to load on statup. It's very easy to uninstall all that junk though, so it's not a major issue for me.
This is a light (3.4lbs) and snappy laptop with a 13" monitor and full sized keyboard.<br/><br/>It has very little processing power and only 32 GB of storage but it has a camera, Bluetooth and Wifi.<br/><br/>It costs under $250 and if all you need is a way to surf the web and read your email, it is a very good deal.<br/><br/>Setup was fast and easy. This was my first experience with Windows 8 and I found it to be fairly intuitive and somewhat fun.<br/><br/>HP advertises that the battery will run for over seven hours without needing a charge. I got to six hours....which is certainly not bad.<br/><br/>This would be a good starter computer for a kid. It is the right size and weight to throw into a backpack and if it gets damaged, lost or stolen, you are only out a relatively small amount of money.
wow. so far so good! After my toshiba laptop had a mishap.  - it fell and the power plug got a bit messed up.  Either change the motherboard or scrap it.  I decided to get another laptop.  This time nothing so expensive.  I was not happy with the fact that i had to replace the whole motherboard for such a tiny thing (toshiba you suck).  This laptop fits the bill.  Its light, cool, stylish and I wont be heartbroken or pissed off at HP if something happens and I have to buy a new one in a years time.  Hopefully, it will last seven happy years like my last HP laptop.  I think im gonna stick with HPs in the future.  was not happy with my Dell nor my toshiba - nor their so called customer service.<br/><br/>But this is easy to use.  Great for just web surfing, which is what i am using it for.  Its not a huge powerful machine. but its only 200 bucks!  I have a desktop for heavy computer work.  I was going to get a chromebook, but decided on this HP..  Im glad i got this one!
save your money!!! My daughter just started using this, bought it for her birthday..she's 17....major problems, audio..cpu issues...ect
Great computer. Fast,light & does everything I need. Love the color. This is my second HP mini. I would totally recommend this product.
Shallow speakers, lags when you watch videos. Memory fills up quickly.<br/>About a year ago, I bought it for my college. Just to have one to carry around and take notes in classes. It is light so it's portable. and for the price, I really cant complain about the lagging and speakers.<br/>It has a mediocre webcam and a crisp keyboard. I cant type very fast on it comfortably.<br/>It also does not heat up easily.<br/>Before this, I used a chromebook and it only lasted me for 1.5 years. The screen started flickering uncontrollably after about 1 year. And the features on it were very limiting. Even for a student. I am not an art student, so I did not even do anything fancy on it. Just used google doc and other basic features. So I was very disappointed but still did not have a big budget, so I did not expect much when I got this. But it has been allmost a year since I purchased this and it is so far so good. Just a little slow when I have a lot of tabs on.
I bought it for my granddaughter who just started college. It's her favourite thing she owns, I'm privileged to get a great deal on it
this is a very good starter laptop but I necessarily wouldn't recommend this. The screen has bad quality and many ads. And very slow.
I only purchased this within three months, the network adaptor inside the laptop is not work anymore. How surprise is that.
Fits my needs perfectly. compact, easy to use, battery lasts a long time and fast start up. I have had this product approx 2 months.
We got this for my middle schooler for Christmas.  Loves it.  Installed Chrome browser and are able to access all school docs (school uses google docs).  I bought it through the Microsoft Store because all computers sold through the store only have Windows installed on the computer - NO BLOATWARE from manufacturers - which would slow down this machine considerably.<br/><br/>If you are finding your Stream is slow delete all the HP bloatware.  You will be surprised at how fast it is for a low spec computer. Basic use doesn't leave one frustrated by lack of speed.  Youtube videos play right away and isn't choppy.<br/><br/>The screen is adequate but not great.  Keyboard is better than I thought it would be and build quality is very high for this price point. Wireless has been non-issue. The touch pad is not accurate compared to a macbook so I added a wireless mouse which solved the problem.  Overall a GREAT little computer for the money.
I simply love this. It's big enough to see and watch movies on. Thin enough to fit in the backpack and small enough for u to enjoy.
Let me start out by saying this computer is a total piece of s***. I bought this computer because my macbook pro is too heavy to carry around with me everywhere I go since I have online classes I have to have access to my computer at all times. I spent all day trying to connect to my online class and it would constantly drop me out of the internet. And before you tell me its because of my internet let me start out by saying the internet at my house is fantastic we have all the bells and whistles so I know for a fact its this computer that is giving me trouble. I have tried to upgrade to windows 10 but it will just keep loading for 2 hours and then tell me that it can't download which hello, I should be able to upgrade this computer without having to jump through so many hoops. I'm definitely returning this computer its not worth the money just because it looks cute.
I was searching for a lightweight laptop running windows as a chromebook just would not do for my work and research. I found what I was looking for in this model.  It is lightweight, and in the three months using it I find it highly dependable.  Yes, it runs Windows 8.1, which initially resulted in a bit of ranting, but this is not the fault of HP or this model.  The three USB ports are a good asset, as is the HDMI port.  The laptop is completely quiet, a nice change from my old Compaq, and the battery seems to last as long as advertised- several hours.  The one complaint is the touchpad- it is just not responsive enough.  Sometimes I have to tap it really hard to get a response.  But, as I generally use a trackball when using this at home, this is not a major problem and perhaps it is just me being not used to the touchpad.  If you are looking for a reliable laptop at a very reasonable price, look no further.  You have found it.
After playing with these in stores and wanting a fanless solid state computer, I bought this in great hopes. I knew before buying that it was a low end system and that storage memory would be a challenge. All that said, once I got it home I noticed that the screen was too dim to use comfortably. It also poked along at a much slower pace than I'd expected even if a low end system. Last, 32gb runs out fast if you apply updates and don't clear your web browser cache on a daily basis. Within a week, I was down to less than 2-3 gb remaining space. Bottom line is that it disappointed even though I had done what I thought was thorough research. That said, it is a really well built machine, light, and with a very nice track pad. I really wanted so very much to like it. I now have a low-end Acer with a quad-core Pentium and that I replaced the hard drive with an SSD. At a total cost of about $375 it screams and has no memory limitations.
pros<br/>great computer low duty gaming like online games they have a store that you can buy apps and games<br/>also you can browse the internet but make sure you have virus protection cause mine got infected and i had to reset it<br/>for its price you can not complain i got it for my 12 year old son and he loves it hes always on it and such good computer for a kid but not a college computer/laptop also you can connect it to your tv with an hdmi cable and use a mouse and key board<br/>cons<br/>the mouse pad it kinda crappy it gets infected with a virus without the right protection i recomend mcafee or norton but it comes with 30 days of mcafee<br/>the camera isnt the best but not bad some time it has trouble connecting to the internet and you have to reset it<br/>dont use internet explore theres alot of ads so get crome or fire fox and get ad block<br/>conclusion great computer for its price you cant complain to much
I received my laptop and it's amazing<br/>It works great and it's the right size for me<br/>I will order another one for my daughters
I bought this laptop in hopes of having something simple that I could surf the web on, listen to music on, and occasionally send emails. When I received it and started to set it up, I was already experiencing some problems. First, the track pad was being quite unresponsive, and if you're like me and you don't have any patience, this can be quite infuriating. Second, the screen froze for a good minute upon startup, and then again when I was trying to search for apps in the marketplace. Third, I couldn't stay connected to wifi for anything. I would lose connection every two seconds, and by that time, I was very angry, and very done. So I just shipped this back to the seller today, and I'm getting my money back. Do yourself a favor, and just save up for a MacBook, or buy a gently used one, because those computers do not have problems like Windows does. I'm forever a Mac lover, and will never go back to Windows again.
I waited a couple of months to see how this would pan out. So far, the letter "f" on my keyboard started malfunctioning so I had to take off the cap for it to work now the keyboard looks ugly. This computer works well for what I do which is watch youtube, netflix, amazon prime video, play on facebook, google a bunch of stuff and manage my online etsy shop. I do not play games or use photo shop or anything like that so I think I am considered a light user. The battery life is amazing. It's compact so it's easy to handle. I like this computer. The downside is that microsoft likes to do random updates and it is slow in doing so. A little patience ( of which I have none) can take care of that though. It is a great value since I get to do everything I want to do in life on it. Buying a more expensive computer would not have benefited me at all. but if you want to get fancy with it, this might not work for you.
It is a very excellent devise.You can not  move  very quickly other wise you are on another screen  ,just have to get use to it.
HP Stream 11 is the best computer I ever bought. It is fast processing speed! I love it! Best computer for the money!!
Have had this laptop for a few weeks, so I think it's time to write a review.  This laptop is very good for the price, it is perfect for a college student or a professional that needs a device that gets the job done.  It did come with Microsoft Office product key for one year to use.  It does have some drawbacks, for example only two USB ports, but this can be fixed by buying a multiple USB adapter, they are pretty cheap on amazon.  It does not have a DVD/CD port, again if needed an external can be purchased.<br/><br/>For writing and projects this laptop is solid, light weight and holds the battery life pretty good.  It has windows 8, which does take some getting use to.  But the set up took about an hour, I did delete some useless programs it came with that took up space.  A solid device for a cheap price is worth it, specially to take with you on the go.  Plus it does not make much noise when starting up.
I received this laptop and I just have to say, I love it!<br/>I needed a computer to check my emails, surf the web, skype, listen to my music, watch movies..... This little guy does the job.<br/>I downloaded the MKV player from the store and the movies play very well. Of course, the screen resolution isn t perfect but I can hook it up to my tv and it s perfect!<br/>When it comes to memory, of course it very limited. Just get rid of the programs and apps that are not needed. It will save some space. I also I have an external drive where I have all my files saved (movies, music, photos....).<br/>I mouse and track pad work without any issue.<br/>the connection to the internet using wifi is fast and downloads don t take long.....<br/>I chose the orchid magenta and even if it s plastic, it looks great and fun!<br/>For a 200$ computer, I think HP gives a serious competition to the chromebooks on the market.
I bought this for my daughter who is 8 and now I am looking to buy it for myself. Its light and will fit in any BIG GIRL purse.
This is a great beginners computer for children that are just starting to work on computers in school. So I'm very satisfied with it because that is what I bought it for, my niece needed one for 5th & 6st grad and it worked out great. Her Social studies and math class was mostly computer work and at the end of the year she passed with an A in both classes. I will say after playing with it myself I can say if I was buying it for myself I would of been very upset. The Windows update needs to be turned off because before you know it your memory will be to full even for a one page essay. You should purchase a jump drive with this for your child's school work (they are very cheep here on Amazon) to be put on. there is not a lot of memory at all and besides the children are going to have to learn how to do this because some school will let them use it to make necessary changes to their work for a better grad.
I bought this laptop for work, since my main laptop is way too big and heavy to travel with. I love it! It's everything that I expected it to be and then some. It's pretty, it's lightweight, and I can slip it into one of my purses, which is a nice change from the massive laptop bag I have for my regular one. It does run fast but after getting back on my regular laptop again, I do notice the difference in RAM (this one is 2 GB, my main laptop is 4 GB). I got the Microsoft Signature Edition of this, so it didn't come with all the bloatware other people were talking about, but still - Microsoft Office and a few apps later, I have 4 GB left of storage. I bought an external hard drive to go with this as well as an SD card, which I highly recommend if you are planning to store anything on here.<br/><br/>One more thing to note - this laptop is QUIET. Love that solid state drive. Perfect for school or work!
My son Loves this Laptop. It's thin & lightweight. Great for teens. The price is very reasonable too. Awesome 3 tone blue too.
The HP Stream notebook 13 Computer is a great machine! I purchase one and I am very please with this computer. Advantages This computer is inexpensive. It comes with office 365 There is lots of apps for free in the Microsoft store. I got $25.00 in free software I got a free upgrade to Windows 10 This computer is very light. It has a large 13.3 screen It comes in different colors, I got it in blue ! It is a touch screen computer Hewlett Packard offer great support, They maintain the computer in perfect working condition ! Disadvantages The computer don't have a cd rom player The computer does not come with a briefcase. The touch scree function is a little uncomfortable If you are interested in this computer "click here"<br/><br/>
I bought this to get through my final semester of graduate school because my other computer died. It is definitely not a good laptop for college. It may be alright for junior high and high school, but it has a lot of difficulty keeping up with the papers I have to write. I also find that it is very temperamental as the screens jump back and forth for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>The other problem that I have, and is the main reason for the 1 star, is that the Office 365 was coming up as ineligible for my computer. I tried many times to make it work, and I had to contact Microsoft for assistance. Laarni was very helpful, but it took almost 2 hours for her to activate the Office 365. Pure aggravation.<br/><br/>This laptop is mediocre at best. For those with serious work to do, I would recommend investing in something else.
Awesome laptop!!!!  Very lightweight & nice 2 look at also.  My cousin followed my lead & purchased one also, she loves it 2.
As a Mac User who has gone through 2 Macbook Airs in the past 4 years (One dead and one stolen), I decided that I just couldn't fork up another grand for an air especially when the new Macbook is coming out for 1250 at approximately the same weight as the air. Therefore, I decided to bite the bullet and play with windows part time while still working on Macs at home. I bought this great little Stream for about 800 bucks less than the Air and it came with a free Office 365 subscription for a year, and Windows 8. Having left Windows during the Vista debacle, I was quite impressed with the gains made since then. The computer has a crisp monitor, and a highly responsible keyboard and trackpad. It's fast and multi functional. While I wouldn't make it my number one computer. It is a great computer to travel with, lightweight, and you won't have a cow if it gets ripped off. (well, maybe a calf.
Very happy with my itty bitty laptop!  It works great, haven't tested out the battery life yet, but it charged very quickly.
I really love this computer so far! The battery life is really good and it's perfect for writing stories and watching anime.
Keep in mind I'm all of a week into this product but so far it's doing everything I would need it to do.  I'm and old man so I'm not needing this device to be my gaming hub or start kicking out killer spreadsheets!  I'm using this for e-mail, light YouTube viewing, and resume building.  Is it little slow, sure, can I take a nap during the load times, no.  However, did you see price tag?  The year of office 365 personal a plus!  Did I mention I'm not killing zombies or building worlds out of blocks?  If you looking for a smallish device which is extremely portable, has good battery, and does not set your lap on fire, oh and right around $200 dollars, look no more!  Hell, the blue color is easy to get used to.  One thing that did take little getting used to, the track pad.  It's not horrible, but little tricky.  But keep in mind, I did say I was alive when Ronald Reagan was President!
I decided to go with Windows instead of a Chromebook because I wanted to be able to download itunes, video and audio editing software, etc. I thought 32 GB would be enough, since I could store most things on google drive and my external hard drive, but turns out that doesn't work for everything, and 32 GB does not go a long way, especially when it says there is only 21 GB available, and most of that is already taken up with I don't even know what. Rereading reviews about removing bloatware and such really makes me regret buying this in lieu of a Chromebook or spending more on a real laptop. This makes a good Chromebook alternative if you like Windows stuff, like their apps and cloud storage, but otherwise don't buy this as your main laptop, especially if you are like me and don't know what programs can or can't be deleted to maximize space. I really like the way it looks though.
Arrived in good condition with no damages the laptop. Easy setup and great deal with the year free Microsoft subscription.
Simple set up, online in minutes. Quick processing, with all the tools included, make this a great buy. Looks great, too!
The computer is great and perfect for travel size, but not very compatible with multitasking before getting slowed down.
This is a good computer if you don't plan on gaming or watching TV or movies streaming. It's fast enough for just browsing around the internet, but it doesn't like to load streaming services or shows. Also the browsing isn't as fast as I'm used to. This doesn't have as much processing power as a regular laptop with an optical drive would have.<br/><br/>I will say that the blue is a gorgeous color, and the keyboard is designed so that crumbs and dirt can't get under the keys. The screen on the 13 inch is actually a nice size, and definition is good.<br/><br/>Track pad does not have a scroll, so you end up using the arrow keys or page down and page up if you don't have a mouse. I highly recommend a mouse, because the page jerks up and down when you use the arrow keys.<br/><br/>Super lightweight, and good battery life. All in all, good but not great.
A handy little computer that has one annoyance and one flaw.<br/>Annoyance: The touchpad seems a little erratic. Sometimes overly sensitive yet other times seemingly dead. Resolved (mostly) by deactivating “taps”.  Could be some operator errors too so no demerit.<br/>FLAW: For a small portable computer there’s no easy way to recharge it – you’re going to need an outlet to plug in the charging transformer. The transformer supplies – and presumably the computer needs – 19.5 volts so you can forget any easy automotive connections since they are only 12 volt.<br/>The only apparent answer seems to be using a small inverter to transform 12 volts dc into 110 volts ac for the transformer so that it can supply the computer with 19.5 volts dc so that  . . . life can be more complicated than it needs to be.  Big demerit. And would welcome any easier solutions.
Only drawback is sensitive mouse pad.  Otherwise works perfectly.  Long battery life, quick speed.  Very user friendly.
I gave this three stars because I know that with electronics you might end up with a lemon.  I could look past all the popups that are around when going online with it.  I could also look past all the junk that comes with the computer.  The thing that made it just ok for me is the fact that it freezes up a lot and I can't shut it down regularly when it does this.  The control alt delete doesn't seem to work for mine.  Also there's a lot of the time where if it isn't frozen I have to restart for it to even open a webpage.  I don't find that very convenient since this computer is for college not for fun.  I don't know if I need to get in touch with amazon or if I need to get in touch with HP.  I really would like to just fix this one instead of having to return and get a new one.  That's a lot of hassle when it isn't my fault that it is the way it is.
I LOVE THIS HP LAPTOP, after i uninstalled and replaced a few pointless software it works wonderfully. for 200 dollars i am am completely satisfied. i got the blue 13.3 inch and it came carefully packaged. the camera isnt all that good but it isnt all that bad either. i love how my keyboard dark blue and fades into light blue. Easy for HDMI access which i use often. i use this for school, notes, gaming and ii watching movies on here. i use everything through the internet to store on here with no lagging or problems. i also purchased the 2 year protection plan and it got here a few days after i got my laptop (always better to be safe then sorry)<br/><br/>FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT PLAY PC GAME<br/>this laptop does not have a CD player so just be aware so you dont waste time or money<br/><br/>other then that 5 stars because its awesome all together
Good computer for a great price.  No real internal storage.  Mostly cloud based.  Does come with 1 year of Office 365.
I do with there was more storage on this laptop.  Other than that problem, there is nothing else really wrong with it.
I have exclusively owned Apple computers for the last ten years and my last experience owning a Windows based laptop was horrid.  But I'm in engineering school now and since Office for Mac is such a dreadful joke - no advanced data analysis in excel - I really wanted a windows based laptop.  My biggest decision was 11" or 13" - wanted the lighter and cheaper, but my crappy eyesight demanded the bigger screen.  I have downloaded Office, Mathcad, Chrome, and Citrix receiver with no issues.  The SSD is pretty much full from these applications, but that's fine because any fancier software would really require a more substantial processor.  The small drive keeps me from bloating it out and keeps this computer running snappily, and I'm storing my docs on a card anyways. This little computer is exactly what I needed for 40% of the price of my beloved but limited use ipad.  Well done Microsoft, I'm almost ready to trust you with my money again once I graduate and buy a bigger computer.
I purchased this laptop for a specific purpose. I use it to control my ham radio from remote locations using HRD and Remoterig. I had some issues getting everything working and I think for the most part it is the multitude of audio options that Windows 8 gives you and the drivers from Remoterig. I use it for work on occasion and some casual web surfing. I have Office 2013 Professional installed and it works fine.<br/><br/>I've had no problems with it and the amount of memory it comes with runs Windows 8 and Office 2013 with no problems. I added a memory card for more storage although I haven't really needed it yet.<br/><br/>I started to come up with a list of wants that I wish this laptop had but frankly, if you start down that road you will pay a lot more for a laptop. For the money I think it is a great value if your needs are simple.
Great little laptop purchased it for my daughter who is 13 and she loves it easy to use and has everything she needs!
this is a really light weight computer for school and other little works. I ordered it in February, by mid February it stopped working completely, just went off and never came on. I asked for an exchange which came in right after 2days, I was excited it came. I processed to return the old one...... Then the one I got for exchange also started its flaws, it would get too hot, the mouse will disappear and appear after 10-20 mins, it will get frozen which frustrated me because I was in the middle of the semester and had loads of assignments online. I decided to finally return it before it's due. My first shipment payment wasn't refunded to me cuz I paid to return it, then I was only refunded 180 after all I spent on it and didn't send it late....... Guess I'm just unlucky on this buy, but will surely order from them one more time soon
My daughter loved it, it's just right size for her. Got it for her birthday I'm pleased with it, she is very pleased
nice little computer does not handle falling 12 inches or more, however screen can be replaced for a mere 100.00 lol
Really this computer is fine for what I paid for it. Its reasonably fast, seems sturdy enough.  I love the color and how light it is.  What I don't like is that the space bar is terrible.  I have to hit it in JUST the right place or it doesn't work.  I've never come across a problem like this before, but its making typing a giant pain. Definitely no good for taking notes, which is unfortunately what I bought it for.  My only other issue is that I cannot upgrade to Windows 10 because right out of the box there is not enough storage space to even download it.  Thats frustrating.  Hopefully this will be remedied with practical application of a sizable SD card.<br/>So overall its lightweight, adorable, and quick but the space bar makes me want to throw it out a window and the inability to move to Windows 10 is irritating as heck.
I have two Samsung Chromebooks in my home.  My wife, daughter, and I have enjoyed them.  I was very interested to see how this new Windows-based "cloud' computer would compare.  I am very pleased and pleasantly surprised at how well this machine performs.  If you get used to using online storage, you shouldn't have any problems with using this laptop PC.  You can still download and install the Google Chrome browser if you want to.  I have been using Google Docs/Google Drive for a while so I don't need MS Office.  However, the availability of Microsoft's OneDrive is a nice option.  This laptop is great for creating and editing docs., Surfing the web,  Reading e-books (Kindle ...), Watching Movies, YouTube Videos, Simple Image Editing.  I really like the Money/Finance App.  I use it all the time.  Great job Microsoft and HP!
(Update Aug 16, 2015) Windows 10 upgrade became available, so I went with it. Btw, if you "reserve" it after notification and you "schedule" the upgrade (click "schedule"), that's when it starts downloading it. You think "schedule" means you decide which day to proceed on the upgrade. Not in Microsoft language. It'll take about 30-45 min to download necessary "stuff" onto your computer and another who knows how long (because I give up on observing it by this time) to install it. Only that it will give you an error message that it failed installation. This laptop doesn't have enough internal disc space for it (75% of promised "20GB" is taken up by various crap). Thia upgrade requires 10GB space, internal or external. Now, I'll need to purchase a mini SD card. Stay tuned...<br/><br/>(Original review) I had to rush to get this laptop because my main laptop got messed up and completely unusable after Windows 10 upgrade. This was going to be my 2nd laptop for portability. I'll update my review once this gets an upgrade to Win 10.<br/><br/>For the price, it's excellent. Can't complain. But still, I find some things to be good/annoying.<br/>Pros:<br/>- battery life<br/>- physical size (fits into my hydration pack+ I use during a bike commute. "+" for my pack to be able to carry more than a bladder)<br/>- quick startup because I have no software installed and I'll keep it that way.<br/>- very fuchsia<br/>Cons:<br/>- speed when typing. I don’t know why it glitches out. I am not a fast typer, but has a delay sometimes.<br/>- Windows 8... I tried to like it, but can't. Can't wait for Win 10.<br/>- very fuchsia
I was looking for a portable laptop for personal use to meet my needs - surf the web, do word processing, excel and print documents. I must confess I was drawn to the HP Stream 11 aesthetically due to its blue-based pink hue with clean white keys. It reminds me of a (now defunct) sony laptop which I was lemming for long ago. Since this is a 'budget laptop', I'm pleasantly surprised by the 8 hours battery life, sturdy build and that there's a light indicator on the caps lock button (useful when typing passwords), its fast to boot up as well and a breeze to use. I've no qualms with the matte screen and strangely, I find that this doesn't hurt my eyes (lasik done) unlike my sister's high end laptop with the overly lit bright screen. The memory storage is a pity though, I wouldn't have mind shelling out extra for more memory.
for the price its not that bad. in the beginning it runs slow cause of all the start up programs for being new, but after disabling some things, compressing some files, deleting some unwanted programs, it ran a little better. i bought this product for school use only, since im taking all online class, i would like to take my laptop on the go so i can get some work done. the memory is quite low, so updating windows 10 was not a option because i only had 9gb left of the 32 to it came with. it left me at 9gb. after deleting unwanted files it went to 10.2g just enough to download it, after the download it restarted the computer and had me re-download it again, only for it to use 2gb of my data and it says i need 10g of data for it again. So i recommend you purchase a thumb drive with it or a Full SD card with your purchase.
The pre-installed software is really nice. the hardware and other parts is also great. perfect for heavy duty use.
I love this little light weight thing🌸 super fast, easy to use. Extremely happy with it!!!! I use it for school .
The worst thing about this is that it is half laptop, half tablet.  I spent about 4 hours deleting needless aps I would never use, just to free up space.  I also highly recommend buying an SD card, as the device eats up storage fast.  So I downloaded Chrome as well as Skype and slid them over to the SD card to keep my hard drive free.  Many of the aps installed require subscriptions, so out they went.  Also, many (like the Skype) were outdated and needed to be updated.  For Skype, it required me to uninstall the one already on the hard drive and then download the new Skype desktop feature.  In addition, you have to be careful, as this computer wants to sync with all your other devices.  This is great if you are a basic user.  BUT....do not expect it to be suitable for folks who game a lot or like to download stuff.
I hate to be so negative, but this laptop has given me some troubles. First off, the mouse pad stopped working. At first, it would only click occasionally on things by itself as I was dragging my finger over it. For instance, as I would on a tab to I had open to view it, the mouse would click and hold it to where it was dragged as a new window. It began to get worse and worse until the mouse pad would just click on everything as I dragged my finger over it. So stressful. Now I have no choice but to use an external mouse which makes it almost useless as a laptop. Also', it's SLOOOOW. The only good thing about it is its long battery life and the fact that it's cute.<br/>I've only had it a little over a month, I shouldn't be having problems.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and save up another $100 for a better laptop.
I bought the HP Stream 11 for my mother as a Christmas present. Let me just tell you, she absolutely loves it! She says it's very light and a nice size which is important because she is always on the go. She brings it everywhere. She likes that the keys are white, she says it is easier to see them. She's always telling me how fast the computer boots up. As her first laptop she really loves it. It's actually very cute. I always see her watching Netflix and random YouTube videos. It's a great all-around multipurpose laptop, especially if you plan on traveling with it a lot since it's so small. I would've given this a 4 and 1/2 if possible only because she says the sound is not all that great. I suspect that is because she is around 20-40% deaf in both ears and her hearing aids are broken.
Great little laptop...perfect for my Son. The only thing missing is a CD port. But we are h as ppy with it. M
CONS: I am having trouble with the touch mouse pad. Drives me crazy. I am not very computer literate and things shut down on me all the time when I get too close to the sides of the screens with the arrow. My fingers are pretty flexible, so I don't understand why it is so hard to use. My cousin has MS and uses a regular mouse pad. I don't want to have to use a table to use the computer, hence, 'laptop'. TONS of ads. I wish I'd gotten something I could play cd's and dvd's on. I wish it would have come in another color at the same price.  PROS: Probably a good deal for the money. Very lightweight and thin. I use it mostly for email, facebook, youtube, looking stuff up etc. It's fine for my needs. If I knew how to manage that mouse thing, I would have given it another star...... LOL
My two boys and I own Streams. Can't beat the price. Great device for home, work, and school. Does the job.
At the current price ($209), this is a steal.<br/>PROS & CONS<br/>1. This isn't a computer for gaming or editing video, but for everything else it performs well. No problems streaming video, e.g.<br/>2. It has a very small hard drive. You're meant to use cloud storage, although if your needs are modest, you could pop a 64 GB flash drive into the port (there are 3 USB ports) and triple the amount of storage (to 96 GB).<br/>3. Excellent sound.<br/>4. Professional reviews indicate that the battery life is below average (about 6 hours), but this hasn't been an issue for me.<br/>5. It's cute.<br/><br/>No, it doesn't perform like my MacBook Pro, but it's a fraction of the price. It's ultra-portable, and for the price, it's a surprisingly useful Windows-based laptop.
The laptop is great and works great for work use. Definitely recommend for a laptop just over 200 dollars.
Great small laptop for school. I use it for my online college classes and regular web browsing, no gaming.
I love this laptop. I can play my fav game wiz 101. it is also easy for me to use bc of my  Cerebral Palsy
Anyone interested in getting an affordable laptop this is the one to buy. Fast shipping and amazing price.
It would be a fantastic laptop if not for the spotty WIFI! I have had more issues with Broadcom chipsets over the years. It always seems like the drivers never get updated and I wind up with a sub-par product. The intent of this device is to use the internet, hence the limited storage; however, it is difficult to access the internet if your web browser can't access websites! It is as simple as re-connecting the WIFI to fix the issue, but that gets old real quick. I have to recommend upgrading to Windows 10 Home as soon as possible. It is much more responsive in my opinion and it eliminates all of the bloatware. It doesn't solve the WIFI issue; it is broke no matter which OS you use. I've got a Nano USB WIFI adapter on order, which I hope will fix the issue.
Amazing value for $200. Not fast, so you have to be patient.  But blows Chromebook away in functionality.
Wonderful laptop at a great price...wish it had a disk drive...other than that, so far it's just perfect!
bought this for my sister who is a junior in school. needed something small enough to fit in her backpack but with enough features to be used in lieu of a pc. she loves it! her school has an app center so they can run programs remotely. her biggest concerns were matlab, autocad, python and latex not running smoothly. they run just fine and she never has any issues with her memory either. she watches netflix on it, does all her online shopping and video chats with her friends. says it stays charged her entire school day with heavy use and doesn't really heat up. she puts her assignments in her google drive so she doesn't care about the internal storage. came with a free year of 360 , which was nice. for the price it's unbeatable for a basic college student.
I'm not a computer expert that can describe the pros and cons of all of the technical aspects of this laptop, just to warn you. I needed a laptop for my job and I only needed to access and edit word and spreadsheet documents as well as download one program for my job. That is all I needed. This laptop is PERFECT for my needs. Yes, the storage is small - but I didn't need a lot of storage. No, there is no disc drive - but I didn't need one. If you are looking for a basic laptop to write papers or for basic internet usage, this is the best bang for your buck. If you realize that you need more storage, there is a microsd slot so you can add additional storage.<br/><br/>It is very lightweight and so far has a  great battery life. That's all I can ask for.
I was using a Chromebook before I got this laptop. They are quite similar in their intent mainly to be used as a cloud computer.<br/> I have had this notebook for a bit over a month now The difference between the two that I found is that you can do so much more with the Stream 13.<br/> The ability to do work offline and use actual programs on a laptop that boots up quickly is very nice. I carried around my HP Chromebook 14 for about a year and a half because it also had 4G connectivity and a majority of what I do like most people is usually done on the Web.<br/> I found it frustrating to not have regular programs that you could work with offline and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the Web equivalent was for what I wanted to accomplish.
I wanted a small portable computer for my daughter and when I purchased this one she loved it. I loved it so much that I am thinking about ordering me one as well. The computer does everything that my other computer does only thing it does not have a CD rom which is fine. The computer came with Microsoft Office 365 which was awesome and it also came with a 25 dollar gift card to use in the app store which was a plus. The computer stays charge longer then what I was used to and that was a big plus being that my daughter is always using the electronics without it being plugged in.  Also, this is a great starter computer for college kids as well as smaller kids. My nephew whom is 3 enjoys playing games on this system as well so it is good for all ages.
My old laptop that I just had, finally went to laptop heaven after 6 years, but I needed to find a quick solution fast, as college was starting in two days for me. I was originally going to purchase a lenovo laptop but I missed the sale on that one and purchased this one instead, and so far I am happy with it! it does not run slow (but I am on good WiFi) and the track pad is not bad at all, a few kinks could be worked out but its not enough to make me complain to HP about it. It also came with enough space on it after all of the hidden files (21.3GB) and I did receive my free 1-year subscription to Microsoft and my Gift card. overall I am very pleased, but I have only had this for 2 hours so things could change, I will update in a couple of weeks.<br/><br/>UPDATE: it has now been 2 months that I've had this laptop, and after about 2 weeks of use, it went awry on me. this computer literally has a  mind of its own now. I can no longer use the "1" key as for every time I type it, it back spaces what I am typing (not using it currently, using my boyfriends laptop to write this review) also when I go to use the internet it wont load the web pages on the first try. I have to highlight the link at least 3 times and hit "enter" in order for it to finally go through and shortly after it freezes and does it again. Now it won't let me click on anything, say for instance if I want to look at my calendar and I click the calendar in the bottom right corner it will not click it. I have to tap the "power" button and log back in to get it to click on certain apps. (I actually lost an entire report because I could not save my work because it would not let me click on "file" luckily it saved it and restored it an hour later) eventually I did a total reset on the computer (not a system restore, an actual reset) hoping to fix the problem at it did not solve anything, it took me an hour to log back into my computer under my windows account because it has a "1" in it and every time I typed it, it backspaced. after I finally got into the computer I was hoping the freezing and not letting me click on things would stop, NOPE. it continued. I have been in contact with HP but their customer service sucks, so I will take it up the street to my cpu store in town and hopefully I can get it fixed then, if not I will be cleaning it completely and selling it and using it to purchase another laptop.
This little laptop has been nothing but trouble since the day it arrived at my door. It is slim. It is compact and light. It is a good product, when it works. To this day, I still get the dreaded blue screen telling me that  due to an error, it will have to shut down and will restart shortly. Lately it has gone to  just a black screen. The power light will still be "on", but the screen will just go black. I bought this just to surf the Internet and watch Netflix and Hulu.  Nothing really taxing and I thought this little blue laptop would handle that without any issues. Imagine my surprise. You could say I am not "working from a happy place". On this computer, I am not working from any place. And I'm typing this review on a Dell.
The computers nice. Nice design. Lightweight. Pretty overall. But the updates can take up LOTS of space. I use my laptop for playing the Sims 4 which takes up 9 GB. I have the 21 GB computer version. After the sims was installed and I had added mods, I wanted to restart my computer but to do that I had to update. The update took about an hour. After checking my storage I had about 3 GBs left. To restart I had to go through yet ANOTHER update. After that installed I had 1 GB left. To restart AGAIN I had to install ANOTHER update. After checking yet again I had less than 600 MB left. The computer itself is fine. It's smooth running and has a nice processor. It's the large updates that make the computer seem bad. What type of update takes up 5 GB?
Laptop is okay but they have sent a defect one but they were also nice to exchange for another new one.
Bought for my 13 year old daughter, was required to have laptop for school. So far has been realy good.
Really smaller than I expected but besides that I love the look and the color and set up was real easy.
HP has done it again, a great device. This laptop is a gift for someone and they love it. It's perfect!
Perfect for on the go Internet use, or for home Internet use, but not for students. I love the ease of loading this into my work bag to log online to complete work online; however, it is not great for anyone who really needs storage. I use Dropbox but haven't had success with using it seamlessly with this netbook as it doesn't not recognize Dropbox as a storage hard drive- the hard drive is too small to load my drop box docs on so I have to switch to my real laptop for heavy non Internet use. Great for kids, teens. Please! Do not send your college student off with this. Also the keypad is aweful- difficult to scroll and the settings menu keeps appearing on my screen.
he laptop was a total disappointment! The (Enter) key did not work, and I had to get a mouse to get it to do the mere basics.<br/>After 30 days, it got possessed with bug after bug so that it was impossible to even access Internet Explorer, the one function I bought it for! I have a macbook pro, and I have to say, there is no comparison! As intuitive as the Mac is, as problematic is the HP! I wasted hours trying to do the simplest of things like just get on the internet!<br/><br/>Now I have an obsolete machine...absolutely useless, and I just realized that it can't be returned! I love Amazon, and have had good experiences in the past, but this was pure disappointment and total waste of money and time. I will never order electronics online!
this is  lightweight, solid, beautiful blue. perfect size an  i have large hands. the new format with apps and the way the windows and apps and screens can be accessed made me dizzy. i deleted many of the built- in apps that I don't need and random trial apps etc. And  after changing the setting for how the windows can be accessed, i was less annoyed.<br/>IT just takes playing with new devices to learn to love them, so I am on my way.  I just had an hp chromebook that I loved but that's crapping out after 1.5 year of light use, so i hope this HP does not disappoint.<br/>Being able to access iTunes and Skype (unlike with chromebook) will be great, but now I have to think of virus issues again with this operating system(not so much with chrome book)
This is a nice little computer especially good for school. I can carry it in my backpack and use it all day with battery left. There's one very annoying feature with the touchpad.If I accidentally move my finger from the right edge to the center (which will happen if i am moving the pointer on a page) It will take me to the start menu. This is incredibly annoying for when I am using the computer because it throws me off focus, especially when I am writing papers and such. Maybe there is a way to turn this feature off? The only way I have found to fix it is to get a usb mouse instead of using the touchpad. Other than that little thing, this is very fast and lightweight, Fun to use. I would definitely recommend it ESPECIALLY for the price.
"Don't like" is putting it very kindly!! I have been teching my computers since 1995 ... the 3 macbooks I picked up on ebay kill ... I work a 40 hour + on windows 7....it is tolerable....this windows 8 has to have been designed both layout and style wise, by a product of generation DUH ... the worst!!!!!<br/>I have tried to rid it of the spamware and every action is non intuitive and clunky.... I need to restore to factory specs but unlike Windows95 I can't just pop in the disk, clean off the drive and start from scratch.....I bought this for my brother and he sent it to me to "get it to be usable". I love Gates but Microsoft is sucking a lot lately....buy a Mac ---no virus alerts every 10 seconds. What a disappointment.
The Stream 13 at HP is thinner and lighter than the desktop replacement Dell Inspiron 15 Non-Touch at Dell it's priced to compete with. It measures about 0.77 by 13.25 by 9 inches (HWD) and weighs 3.33 pounds, so it's easy to carry around. It'll fit perfectly on an airline tray table or on your lap at the local Starbucks while you write your latest TPS report or term paper.<br/><br/>The Stream 13 uses a 2.16GHz Intel Celeron N2480 processor with integrated Intel HD graphics. That doesn't sound too impressive, but remember that the system's SSD helps speed things along. Reboots are quick, and launching most programs only takes seconds.<br/><br/>Find out more about comparable items:<br/><br/>- Dell Inspiron 15: http://amzn.to/1BucAfj
Works perfect for what my daughter needs it for.  Very light weight and a great little computer so far
everything came in perfect.....and very very fast shipping, my sister woke up to her new laptop thanks
This is the perfect, "back to school", laptop.  Bought it for the wife and she couldn't be happier. Performance is good (not amazing, but good), and so far, the batter is anything but a standard laptop battery.  Doesn't get hot and lasts a good 5-6 hours with constant use.  Obviously, if you're looking for a big hard drive, or on board accessories like a DVD drive or something like that, this isn't the way to go, but if you just plan on doing homework or watching Netflix or something like that, this is perfect.  I had bought a Chromebook for myself a few years back and I love it, but my better half refuses to use anything but Windows OS.  This is the perfect compromise.  Highly recommend it for parents to buy for their kids.
Awful piece of junk.<br/>Trackpad is by far the worst I ever used - sometimes it works, sometimes not. You just cannot get used to it, cause it seems to require different approach every time you use it.<br/>OS is awful - even more so than usual from M$ - it took me half an hour to delete a network connection with all the extraneous windows popping up at inconvenient moments (I guess compliments of crappy trackpad) due to incorrect password - and I've been using PCs since MSDOS days and administer a network of PCs (thank God I didn't update them to W8) and MACs.<br/>Screen is small and barely readable.<br/>Impossible to do any stuff on. Wish could return it but it was a present so we are past return window. Simply waste of money.
This laptop is not good quality at all.  I can barely type on it.  Every 5th or 6th letter wont type!
Came fast, and my teen son LOVES it. He is into coding and it works exactly for what he needs it for.
I absolutely love this machine. I spec'd out several different Chromebooks when I came across this machine. It had double the internal built-in storage as any of the Chromebooks I'd found, and it runs windows?! Yeah, for me, easy choice. Full operating system Windows 8.1, with office 365, SD slot, 2 USB's, HDMI out, awesome. I'd recommend this to anyone who needs a lightweight, yet powerful machine. I'd also add the battery life is amazing! I usually get around 6 hours of use between charges, that's with web surfing, Netflix usage, and watching movies on SD cards.It's also worth mentioning that any Windows 8 machine gets upgraded for free to Windows 10 when it's released, so support for the HP Stream will continue for some time.
The wireless receiver apparently is known to be bad in this particular model. There is a whole forum about how the wifi goes out routinely. The fix is reinstalling the wifi network card's drivers which the customer shouldn't have to do. Amazon shouldn't sell cheap faulty low-quality hardware like this. My wife's wifi went out less than one week (I do tech support so I know that it wasn't a simple user error) and even after trying to reinstall the drivers for the wifi network card it still wouldn't see a wifi signal.  Everything else on the computer is decent (you get what you pay for I know) but the wifi should last more than a week.  Very disappointed. I'd recommend spending a little more $ and buying a higher quality machine.
Love the color and the size is perfect for the working mom<br/>in school.... ;)
Laptop works great just buy a good anti virus system but it will do any thing you need to do with it
Just wanted a basic laptop that could "keep up" with my internet clicking.  Straight out of the box this computer struggled to keep up. I found myself doing the click, wait 5 seconds, click, wait 5 seconds etc thing way too much for a new computer.  My internet speed was 15mbps, so that wasn't the issue.  The most frustrating thing was time lag when clicking between multiple intern tabs, minimizing windows, closing windows, and launching new apps.  Oh ya...one more thing that drives me nuts are computers that lag when you try to scroll up and down on a webpage. This computer lagged pretty bad when trying to scroll up and down.  It's just under powered.  My VERY used Galaxy S3 phone is WAY faster than this laptop.
Office works like a charm and so does windows 8, but the computer itself lacks greatly. When watching videos the picture drags. When using Oovoo and Skype the picture quality is very low, but also the sound goes out when I try to turn it up. The sound goes up to 100, i put it on 80 to listen to a video and the sound went out after making a loud rubbing noise. It makes this noise and then I have to restart the computer in order for the sound to work. If you're a college student who just needs to type essays and do research, you'll be fine. Anything outside of that, you may run into trouble. I carry it around with me everywhere because it is so lightweight and I use it in class, but I will be looking for another one soon.
I was really thrilled when I received it, and was convinced it was a great purchase until I tried to watch Netflix. The sound quality was bad. It was laggy and just made it annoying to watch anything. I tried YouTube--same problem. According to the HP support website, this is a somewhat common problem with no known solution. I was not willing to spend hours researching and figuring out if it could be fixed, so I returned it.<br/><br/>That said, it gets 3 stars because it's good for the money and because and if not for the sound problem I'd probably still be using it happily.<br/><br/>Based on my experience and the reviews I've read, it is a good product IF you get lucky enough to receive one that isn't defective.
I really like the ease of set up with this computer. So far it is great! Arrived way ahead of time.
I ordered this laptop due to the rave reviews which state it is ideal for students or those looking to use Office to perform basic tasks. Even without uploading any media onto the computer--so, basically just having my word and powerpoint documents---the memory is totally gone. This impedes the speed and I constantly get annoying messages about the memory. I don't know who I would recommend this to other than grammar or high school students who need to type maybe a page or two every other month.<br/>Additionally, the "Studio Sound" is terrible. I get a scratching noise. Skyping with the machine is impossible because the sound fades in and out. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is the price.
I absouletly think this was the best deal I've ever purchased from Amazon overall great package!!!
I cannot express enough my satisfaction with this laptop. My only complaint is that the resident storage of 32GB is insufficient.  However, with a microSD card and little support I was able to expand the memory and install many applications locally. As a power user, this is by no means a replacement for my workstation or even my primary, not so portable power laptop. However, it fully takes care of my computational needs while I am on-the-move. It is quite cool looking, extremely inexpensive, easily portable and HP Is going out of its way in customer support. As a note, beware of fake support sites on the web that try to gain access into your PC.  If you call support make sure you know you are calling HP.
I love the laptop I'm so glad that i bought it  i use it all the time and the color is very nice.
This laptop is lightning fast. Just what I needed to pay bills and send emails. Highly recommend.
I use the computer for updating my son's school website, printing coupons & creating word/excel documents. I hesitated on buying this because I'm not interested in leasing Office 365 & having to pay for a subscription next year. I have now boycotted Microsoft Office completely & use Google Drive for doc/excel. It runs quickly & the battery lasts for the few hours I have it unplugged. I'd definitely recommend this computer if using outside storage (USB's).<br/>Pros: wireless printing, battery life, speedy, 3 USB ports, HDMI port, small/lightweight<br/>Cons: not enough hard drive storage(16 or 32 go I believe), no cd/dvd player, screen zooms out while I'm navigating sometimes & I don't mean for it to
I got this lap top delivered in three days I might add; about a week ago.  I wanted to wait to write a review until I had set it up and used it.  I am very happy and delighted with my purchase.  My husband bought me a Cricut Explorer for Christmas and my old computer would not allow me to use the design space so it was either take back the gift or get a new computer.  I chose to get a lap top because I thought it was something the entire family could use.  It performs wells, and after learning how to put the apps on the windows screen I am happy with windows 8.  I will say that all the ads and pop-ups that come with any new computer are a pain in the @s* but that comes with getting a new machine.
I love, love this laptop. :D I am currently typing this review using the computer, and all I can say for the price it is well worth it! This laptop does come with a one year subscription to Microsoft word, excel, powerpoint etc. One year subscription free?! You can't beat that! The keyboard is nice, so I have no problems with it, and the mouse pad is not slow as some reviews stated. The display is also good. The battery life is super! I also like the quick access to apps. I recommend this laptop to any high school or college student like myself that wants a comfortable laptop that is not bulky and perfect for backpacks. It is not heavy at all, another plus for me! Also, the delivery was fast! :D
has an unbeatable price and good performance for what it offers. I recommend one hundred percent
Beware the advertisement for a FREE Windows 10 upgrade - this computer does not have enough free space to upgrade to Windows 10 unless you have an external hard drive to use in conjunction with the PC. That said, having Windows 10 is not that important to me.  I only purchased this laptop for school work when I am away from home, or just being lazy and want to do my work from the couch.  I mainly just use the internet (all of my classes are online) and Microsoft Office; mainly Word.  This PC is great for that.  However, if you have your heart set on Windows 10, either purchase an external drive or a different computer, because there is not enough memory on this computer to complete the update.
Preface:  Purchased as a gift for my 70+ yr old mother<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/>1)  Cheap<br/>2)  2GB Mem is plenty for emailing, social media, and daily word/excel tasks<br/>3)  Keyboard is responsive, and mouse pad is resonable<br/><br/>Con's:<br/>1)  Color Choices?  Would have prefered black/silver<br/>2)  None that I can honestly think of for this price point.<br/><br/>Conclusion:  My mom needed something new for her old 7+ year old ThinkPad.  Picked this up in the mid $200 price range, thinking it would do everything well enough for her.  It does ... She doesn't do any heavy computing ... Mostly Emails, Booking Flights, Browing the interwebz, etc...  Does the job and does it well.
Nice laptop. Cant get much better quality for the money. Would recommend to friends And family.
It fit the bill for cost and performance. As for office 365 I don't think she is even using it.
This was bought purely to be a computer that was used for online colleges.  I have had some difficulty with it from the start.  I couldn't get the Microsoft 365 to register but it didn't matter since the college also offers one year free.  It is slower then well slow, especially if you have average internet service.  I installed McAfee but I am still having problems with pop-ups even though I have them turned off.  The worst problem is that from the beginning, I constantly getting proxy server issues.  This has yet to be resolved.  My only other complaint would be that if you are buying this for school work, opt for one with a bigger screen unless you want to have eye issues in 6 months
Well, i started thew laptop and noticed quite a bit of CRAPWARE and I downloaded Google Chrome and it took awhile but the page loaded. I removed all the junk and the pages loaded 10 times faster.. Just a WARNING: This computer is NOT FOR GAMING what so ever. This laptop has low storage and you're probably going to want a flash drive. The Streams built in trackpad (Mouse) is pretty sucky, your going to want a new mouse. I do like the keyboard and the color. the battery life is pretty good and the built in dts sound is okay.. Overall the HP Stream is an okay computer for maybe homework. It is HORRIBLE for gaming. I guess I expected more out of this laptop but for the price its no too bad.
For the price, you can't beat this little guy. I really don't understand why anyone would want a Chromebook over this, considering this can do SO MUCH more (from the average user's perspective).<br/><br/>Again, considering the price, this is absolutely deserving of 5 stars. However, here are some of my nitpicks:<br/><br/>- Screen is pretty bad. It's dim, washed out, and has weak viewing angles. If you're not comparing it side-to-side with something else, though, it's bearable and you get used to it. Hard to complain at this price point.<br/><br/>- Built-in storage is paltry. You're really going to want to invest in a MicroSD card.<br/><br/>- I really can't stand Windows 8/8.1.
You get what you pay for. The good: nice and compact- seems sturdy enough. Keyboard is decent for the price. Display ditto.<br/>The bad: Wi-Fi is a joke- my router is in the next room and this machine barely picks it up- I have to carry it in to the room and sit next to the router. I ended up buying a Bear Extender USB WiFi booster- and it has helped quite a bit, very nice addition. But I should not have to do that. Yes I did all the updates.<br/>The touchpad- really bad- no other way of saying it. Get a wireless mouse.<br/>I was not expecting a lot for $200, but these 2 problems have me NOT recommending this machine. And I do like HP products as a whole, they make great printers.<br/>UPDATE: 08/08/15- I have been on the road since 07/06 with this computer on a planned year long international trip. So far it has survived many flights in my carry-on. The #1 problem still is the Wi-Fi- it just does not work unless you are next to the router. I have not contacted HP yet about this. The trackpad is just useable but a mouse will eliminate many frustrations. Will update again at the half way point.
The perfect little laptop for a student or someone who wants a laptop for simple everyday use.
I received it yesterday and I must say I like it so far. Is very fast and the quality is good.
I purchased this as a second laptop for my daughter (college age).  She only needed it for travel, portability and convenience. The year of Office 365 was the clincher.  She has been home on winter break and found herself hospitalized. I have had the opportunity to play with her laptop so I thought I would chime in with my thoughts.<br/><br/>  Lightweight, compact, comfortable full size keyboard.  Nice display - love the color and sharpness.  Speed - No, it isn't a $1000 gaming computer. It is great for checking email, social media, writing papers for school or bouncing around the internet.  It streamed movies from Netflix without a hitch and I am very pleased with our purchase.
I am not a techy, so I can't speak for all the fancy aspects of this cute little blue laptop.  But I will say that it has been a WONDERFUL little school computer for us.  We homeschool, and my 4th grader does computer-based curriculum for Science and HIstory/Geography.  We've fully installed both subjects in their entirety, as well as the Teacher portion, and the computer never slows of stutters.  The keyboard and touchpad have both been flawless.  It is light and easily portable, and the battery holds longer than we've ever needed at this point.  It connected easily to our home network and we haven't had any issues.  I am very pleased at what we got for the low price we paid!!
Completely worth the money.  I've had this laptop for a week or two.  I love it.  I took all the bloatware off and installed Avast and CCleaner.  I think it is a great little computer for the price!  I love the pink color as well.  I've had multiple tabs open and programs open at same time,  does not slow down.  I use it for browsing and streaming of Netflix,  Hulu,  and Amazon Prime  I also have had no problems running torrent programs and tormenting.  But the hard drive is not very big. I suggest you buy an external hard drive or a sd memory card to add onto the computers space.  I bought a 64 gig sd card for it.  I'm extremely pleased and glad I purchased this little guy.
I love this laptop because I can take it anywhere and contact my main computer from anywhere.
I returned this lap top 1 day after I bought it. I am in grad school and I'm a teacher. I needed a basic lap top to do research/work on. Because of the price and relatively high ratings, I decided to give this one a try. However, minutes after using this laptop, I was told I couldn't upgrade to Windows 10 because there wasn't enough storage space available and the only thing I had downloaded at that point was Skype! Not a lot of storage at all. This lap top seems more suitable for kids/teens or someone who is just looking to browse the internet. I ended up returning this and buying the new Acer Aspire 15.6... which is cheaper than the stream and has a 500 GB hard drive.
Like all the other reviews said, determine what you need for your use and get rid of all the crapware. otherwise a great little laptop.  get yourself a mini  32gig sd card  and tell the computer to store all your pics & videos to sd card.Very fast computer for everyday use once cleanded out.battery seems to last forever, definitely a big plus. Also if you buy a soft case for it, get a case for a 13.6 laptop, more room for power supply and cord. I purchased one made by a company called PLEMO  on amazon. very happy with the speed for every day net surfing.Use it for traveling on motorcycle trips. Hotels always have wi-fi. Windows 8.1 is a great improvement over Windows 8. Update 3/12/15  Took on first roadtrip. connects flawlessly to wi-fy . also automatically picked on wireless printers on its own.some may like that some not. just remember to get rid of the printer stuuf when you get home. lots of comments about the track pad. simple fix, get a MINI-MOUSE. also fits in case mentioned above. I stress again, read reveiws on how to get rid of crapware. The good thing about using the mini SD card, it can fit into your phone, camra, etc.  all new ones come with the adaptor for reg. SD card  Thanks I hope this helps some one out.
I love it still playing with it to figure it all out but I love it small just what I needed!
great value for the price. got it for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!
Inexpensive Laptop is what I needed.  No whistles or bells, does what it is suppose to do.
Really love this mini laptop. Its quite light and  comes in handy when traveling for work.
Works very well. Got for my 11 year old Grandson he can go to all sights. Even loads fast.
Purchased this for my sister, she is totally happy with this. light super fast due to SSD.
Exceeds expectations.  Purchased the Stream 11 from the Microsoft website which meant no bloatware on the computer from the beginning.  I use it for business and I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat.  It was on sale at the time and paid $175.00 for it.  The only issue is that the hard drive is rather minuscule so I can't download all my Dropbox files.  As a result I'm temporarily using  One Drive and also accessing Dropbox via their website.  Waiting for a 64GB SD card to come in and that should solve the problem.  Computer speed is fine, boot-up is quick..no complaints here.
I returned it. It could have just been a product error but it was too slow for my liking.
Awesome laptop for the price,  battery does not last long but what do you expect for $199
really nice, work  great, just what I NEED,,,,, PERFECT FOR THAT PRICE......SUPER CUTE...
Fist thing to be aware of, this is a non touch screen laptop. Second thing, you only have 32 GB at flash storage (but in this day and age of cloud services, does 32 GB of on board storage matter?). This thing, even though it's an Intel chip, it's just an Atom chip.<br/><br/>But I'd still buy this over a chrome book any day. You can still have actual programs / files on the computer and not completely be delendend on being connected all the time. And for those who like mine raft, it can run it, but you need the optifine patch installed - Google it.  Also includes sd card read so you can expand you memory. Battery run time is pretty long too.
This is a wonderful product. I prefer an HP desktop computer, and have had one for five years with no problems. I needed to downsize my office space, and this is everything I wanted in an HP product.<br/><br/>It's small with a big personality. I have a wireless mouse and printer, and the Stream works with ease. I never thought I would be happy with a laptop. I am sold on this one, however.<br/><br/>The only thing lacking is disk space. I am in the process of looking for an SD card to maximize storage.<br/><br/>I would recommend this to anyone who prefers HP and Microsoft Word since there is a promotion for a one-year Word subscription.
my only disappointment with this product is how poorly it was advertised by HP.  I didn't even know this laptop existed.  What a gem, so light, small enough to fit in my backpack  easily for flights yet the screen is ample, the laptop speed is fine, it's not meant to store things, but while on traveling and logging into my office, this is perfect.  It can does it all, Skype, internet, work, I think it would be just perfect for kids in high school and college bringing it to classes, full wifi, full keyboard, it's a real computer, not a tablet, all for $199 !!!!  Who needs a tablet, this is does everything I need, and incredible battery life.
Bought this for my wife to replace her Dell Inspiron. She' said happy, happy, happy Gal.
Purchased for a friend. Very nice color and feel. Light weight and good lasting battery.
I love my new computer it work great for online class writing papers and watching movies
All of my products I brought are great. Iam very satisfied with your service. THANK YOU.
Until today I would have said we loved it. My 8 year old son has had this laptop for 2 months and 11 days and the display is going. Last night I logged in under my sign on so he could watch a movie on Flixster. After he was done we shut it down like normal and put it away. He is only allowed to use under supervision so you can imagine my surprise when we went to log on today and found 1/4 to 1/3 of the display gray and the password bar is hidden under the gray area. I have an HP laptop which I love so I was both happy with the features on this unit and the price however now I have to find a repair shop. I expected more from this product.
So far I absolutely love my new Hp Stream Laptop! Its so simple and easy to use. I bought this because my old acer laptop was dying and I needed something a lot smaller and easy to take with me when I go away. I love the fact that the battery lasts a long time! I was so used to having a laptop that I needed to charge every half hour, it's great knowing I can go away and not take my charger and still be able to use my laptop. I also thought getting used to Windows 8 would be very difficult from reading a lot of other reviews about it being hard but its surprisingly very easy to get accustomed to. I would definitely recommend this product.
The HP Stream 11 is a very good laptop for the price. Build quality is sturdy, screen is easy to see, keyboard is functional for touch typing, although function key labeling is a little small. Performance is fine for web browsing, document editing, Skype calling, etc., and battery lasts 6+ hours. The fanless design makes it quiet. There is about 20 GB of free space on the internal SSD (after uninstalling the trial MS office and McAfee software.) There's a headphone jack, SD card slot, and a couple USB ports for external devices. It's a great choice for kids/teens, or for adults that want a small/light laptop for travel/vacations/backup.
This is a great buy!! I get compliments al the time because it looks stylish. It does everything a computer should do in my opinion fast web surfing, great speakers, easily portable, and straight foreword set up. I have a mac/apple computer for over 5 years I just needed to utilize windows 8 for my job and I am impressed. I wouldn't recommend this computer for gamers or people who download a whole bunch of things on the hard drive. The storage is limited, but its cool because you can store 1tb in the cloud for free.<br/><br/>Oh and make sure you order a mouse with the purchase also because the track pad can be kind of slow at times.
Met our expectations! Very sleek and light! My daughter is enjoying every moment of it!
Amazing laptop! I love the size & the battery life! The prefect laptop for internet use
Great computer if all you are really looking for it browsing the internet and using office 365 programs. Other wise you have absolutely no space to download other programs or even store files as the computer comes with basically half of its space already taken up. It is easy to connect a external hard drive and you can pick up ones with mass storage space for not much money. The color is lovely, I have had no problems with the touch pad but also bought a wireless mouse just in case. There is no disk drive and very few usb ports to plug things in so it can be difficult if you need to have many things plugged into it at the same time.
Great computer for my 10-year old son.....would be great for anyone unless your'e a Mac addict like me. I had to remove a few adware programs, but for the price it was worth the time. Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but if you are at all computer literate, it is simple to navigate. I have to add a student version of Office as this is what he will be using it for, PPP and such (it only includes a trial). However, he has watched many movies and played several games this summer and the display is just fine. I recommend a hard case for protection if you're going to be mobile with it. Great purchase and definitely worth the money.
I bought this as a gift for my wife. Fresh out of the box and on the first bootup, I noticed there were already viruses and a trojan horse. There was a music app and a separate help app that were both pre-installed and causing constant issues with crashes and pop-ups. I was able to stop the viruses and pop-ups, but then there were alerts stating the memory was corrupt. It's possible this was just a rare occurrence, but it was enough for me to take it back and exchange for a different computer after just a couple of hours of usage. I have other HP products and have had good experiences in the past, so I was a little disappointed.
I bought this laptop to use for online classes. Have a desktop, but wanted a light weight laptop to use when I didn't feel like sitting at a desk. I don't game, so don't need any thing very powerful. This laptop is perfect for my needs. It is faster than other laptops in this price range that I tried. Great for web surfing and email too. I installed Office 2013 and it runs great on it. Its very light, and even though it does not have a fan, it runs cool no matter how long I am using it. It is a great value for the price. As long as you are realistic, and don't expect it to run like a five hundred dollar laptop, you will love it.
This laptop serves my needs very well.  Is great for light to moderate computing work.
Item came brand bew. The computer is great for the price and for average computer use.
good price, nice machine does everything I need it to do big screen, would buy another
Bought for everyday stuff, works great for that, small and light can take it anywhere.
Great PC and decent too for daily use.  Wonderful tool that certainly value for money!
I've always been a Mac person but I love this little computer. I agree with previous reviews about the trackpad not being sensitive enough but I circumvent this problem with a mouse. There's not a whole lot of storage so it couldn't accommodate syncing with my very large dropbox. One of the reasons why I never liked PCs in the past is because they were not user-friendly. This one is user-friendly in that you can call to get help with the Office set up and it's easy to connect to just about any Wi-Fi. I use this laptop mostly for Microsoft Office Access, web surfing, and Netflix.  Works just fine for these three functions.
So far I am really happy with this computer.  I had a laptop that was getting really old and slow, so it was time for a new one but I'm not very IT savy and I was afraid to spend too much for something for the wrong product.  How can you go wrong by spending a little over $200 for a laptop!  The only problem I am having so far is getting used to Windows 8 with all of the tiles instead of icons and personalizing the desktop and browsers to what I want.  I'm sure I will get the hang of it soon.  The laptop is really light weight and the battery lasts quite a long time.  It looks very much like the pictures on the website.
Great laptop, but as mentioned in many of the comments, remove the "crapware"
I love this laptop. Also, I love the color!!!! This laptop is a great size. Perfect .
Very functional basic machine that does a lot for the money.  With a little tuning, it runs windows 10 without any issues and, with the Micro-SD slot, makes it easy to upgrade the storage capacity. The display is crystal clear and vivid, it has a nice keyboard and touch-pad, and all the basic peripheral connection ports a laptop needs.  Although I wouldn't use it as a primary machine for heavy office, graphics or development use, It works great as part of my portable voice-over studio and personal travel laptop.  And, unlike my more expensive gaming/development laptop, I'm less concerned about it being lost or stolen.
For a $200 computer this little guy has done very well. Boots up quick, very easy to type on keyboard. Ample RAM (thought I did get a 64GB SIM Card just to make sure I had enough. You do need to get use to all web based applications.<br/>Only "need to improve" items:<br/>Back lit keyboard would be great to low light work areas<br/>Power cord is cumbersome to wind up (wish they would take page from Apple playbook).<br/>As other comments have mentioned the track pad is cheap and often difficult to move pointer around the screen.
I purchased this for my 8-year-old girl. It's just enough computer for her although she needs to tone down the graphics requirements for games like Minecraft. The trackpad can be infuriating and the screen is a bit washed out and not very crisp, but for a laptop running under $200 with Windows, I wasn't expecting perfection. Web browsing became much smoother when I installed Chrome. There isn't much bloatware on the system, but there also isn't mush hard-drive space. A micro-SD card helped. All-in-all, if you're not really expecting much under the hood and really just want a girly laptop with Windows - here it is.
This is a horrible computer. It does NOT work as advertised. I received this item in a nonfunctional capacity. Was told I needed to send to HP for repair on a BRAND NEW COMPUTER. HP sent it back...still non functional and will not return my calls or emails. It will not connect to the internet or allow my teenage daughter to do anything that HP advertises the computer to do! I have always been a fan of HP and have several other HP products. They are completely unwilling to help me in any way in getting this computer fixed and it is BRAND NEW. I have never been so utterly disappointed in this company and product. :(
So I've been using my laptop for about a week now and I have 0 complaints. This laptop is sturdy and is not cheaply built. The screen size is perfect and this laptop is easily portable. I do find that if your at a weird angle the screen gets dim and pixelated, but just tilt the screen and that's fixed! I've had no problems with the battery life. I am able to watch videos from anywhere and any site I please. This laptop is perfect for everyday use and for students. This is not the laptop for heavier business working people if you need a lot of heavy duty apps. Overall this laptop is a win especially for the price!
Got this for my 7 year old for Christmas, he loves it, and learned to use it quickly
i am fifteen and I am starting high school in about two weeks. and I wanted this laptop for my birthday. it is really a great laptop for the okay internals. it is really fast on the internet and I love that it came with Microsoft personal for a year. the keyboard is very pleasant to type on and this computer does not make noise at all. I have experienced some warmth off of the bottom, but it is not that bad. I would recommend the 13 inch over the 11 inch model because it is obviously bigger and I am a big guy so I didn't want the 11 inch model. I would recommend this laptop for school! great buy for the price!
I am a college student. This laptop is so lightweight I bring this laptop everywhere now. Words of warning: This laptop is for light use only. I can have about 10 chrome tabs open at a time before the 2gb of memory filled up, even after I had removed the all of the crapware. I do not recommend opening two or more youtube videos at once. This laptop will give poor performance for gaming. I believe the crapware is the reason why the price was so cheap when I bought the laptop for $234.77. I take the laptop on road trips and use google maps on 4g when I want to find a restaurant or hotel. I'm highly satisfied.
Sent it to my brother from Amazon as a gift for his 18th birthday and it is damaged
I bought this laptop for school and I absolutely LOVE it. I definitely recommend it
Love it. Convenient and easy to use. The matte finish on the notebook is beautiful.
Bought this for my 11 year old daughter. Mostly for school work, and for her general online use her Internet games and makeup and dance video watching. She loved the color scheme, it runs quick. My gripes would be the OS takes some getting used to, my daughter had frustrations with the scrolling shortcuts which aren't as intuitive as my wife's MacBook but she is getting used to it. It didn't have too much bloat ware installed just a lot of shortcuts probably because of the limited HD space. The actual computer is light and does feel a bit flimsy but like ANYTHING you will always get what you pay for.
Best laptop for everyday use (internet surfing, emails, office work etc).<br/>Comparison between Acer Chromebook and HP Stream 13:<br/>Chromebook is faster at surfing around the internet video streaming etc. When I received HP Stream 13, I already knew this computer is going to be very slow since the startup. Webpages load much slower, YouTube videos are very laggy at same quality in the Chromebook.<br/>But since this HP Stream 13 is a regular windows laptop, there are more things that you can do compared to the chromebook.<br/>Well.. the good thing is that I got the pink one and its super cute.
So far, so good - runs quietly, starts up and shuts down fast, multiple windows work well, and Windows 8 isn't as awful as I'd heard.  Very few complaints about the computer (sound quality not so good, the limit on the volume is irritating, running Pandora and using complex websites occasionally causes the music to 'skip', wireless connection sometimes closes for no apparent reason), we just keep reminding ourselves that it's hard to compare this fairly to our main laptop, a MacBook Pro.  Nice, small, portable computer to use for casual web surfing, music and videos, light weight is good for travel.
$199 piece of junk!!!! Save your money. Operates like a turtle..Slowwwwwwwwwww!!!!
All my expectations have been met and then some for my son heading off to college.
This computer is a great size and weight for people on the go.  It draws a lot of attention because of the color.  When I tell them the price  they say, "I want one!! Where did you get it?"  One word of caution.  Like so many computers today it is filled with crapware!!  It was so slow when I got it, even moving the cursor was slow. After removing the crapware the computer really speeded up.  It has Windows 10 which has been a huge disappointment to me. It has crashed several times like used to happen with Windows,15 years ago.  I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.
I bought this for a research project that I feared would expose my very expensive laptop to malware and viruses. It's a great little laptop. Now that the project is done, I find myself using this laptop much more than my "real" laptop. It's so light and slim. I mainly use it for surfing and MS Office, but recently installed a version of Photoshop and run that. I think the pink is a fun color. It is an awesome value. The only downside is the HD space. But if you're okay with using a Passport or jump drives, or don't plan on installing a lot of programs, or storing videos/photo collections.
Great machine for the money, but don't expect it to be fast. This is perfect for a kid (I bought it for my 13 year old niece) and works perfectly for web browsing and office apps, and can be used for most casual games. However, the lack of memory and storage (and inability to easily upgrade) limits its usefulness for higher end scenarios... but then, given the price, that makes sense. Much better than similarly priced options with hard drives instead of solid state storage like the Stream.<br/><br/>Well made, feels like it will stand up to a lot of abuse. It will be obsolete before it breaks.
Not a bad unit for the price but there are a couple of glaring deficiencies. No HD light to let you know when it is working. There is no indication when it is charged. On a Chromebook for example the power light changes from red to green when charged. It needs more RAM but all in all it seems to work OK. If it's strictly an internet device you want, a Chromebook is the only way to go.<br/><br/>I upgraded to Win 10 with the help of an external HD. An external optical drive is needed if you intend to install programs.<br/><br/>Take off as many apps and bloatware also helps quicker response.<br/><br/>A month later. I was wrong about the charge light, it does change color when charged.<br/><br/>Upgrading to Win 10 was a mistake, what on earth was MS thinking about with this OS? Also, this computer is really a let down both due to the small SSD and the OS and it is slow.
Not bad at all and a great price. Exactly what I needed for work and school only.
Works great; great price and easy to carry around. Battery lasts for a long time.
I got this laptop and I've never been happier! The main selling point to me was the color, I'm a girly girl so I love pink...But I've found out it is also fast, lightweight, and very easy to use. Great machine for someone who just mainly uses it for internet and doesn't want to pay for all the extra bells and whistles. It is also a great price, I priced the same one at BB for $20.00 more, and mine came with a $25.00 Microsoft gift card, one year of Microsoft office, and virus protection and I don't think the one at BB came with that. The screen is also the perfect size and has great color.
My 9 y/o loves this computer however he ran into its very limited storage space the first day.  Although Microsoft claims the newer versions of Windows have a smaller footprints, we found there was not much storage available<br/><br/>This are some of the areas where the 32GB was consumed:<br/><br/>  8GB Recovery Partition (you are no longer able to delete this partition)<br/>  9GB Windows directory<br/>  5.7GB pagefile.sys + hiberfil.sys<br/>  2GB+ Microsoft Office<br/><br/>In addition there are many other Microsoft and third party applications accounting for more lost gigabytes.
I'm not a heavy computer user. I just needed a new laptop that could run Microsoft Office, and after trudging a very heavy Dell around campus for 4  years, I wanted something very lightweight. This laptop has been amazing so far! The color is gorgeous and I get a lot of compliments on it. It's as light as I could hope for. I debated getting the 11 inch HP stream, but I'm very happy that I spent the few extra dollars and got the 13 inch because the size is perfect, any smaller might have been disappointing. The free year of Microsoft Office 365 is great perk! I'm thrilled with my purchase!
This is a small little laptop, super lightweight and cool looking. That may be all that it has going for it. I haven't had this thing for very long(a few weeks) and I already pretty much hate it. It is SO slow and I haven't even put anything on it yet. The clicker is horrid, you have to press it really hard for it register, sometimes even then it doesn't. Save your money and buy something else.<br/>I'm disappointed because the last laptop I had was only $200 and it was going strong after four years until I dropped it and shattered the screen and made the mistake of ordering this pile.
Great laptop for the price, I use this for school and it works perfect for that.
After having the laptop for a month and a half I have gotten a blank screen.  The laptop will turn on but all you see is a blank screen.  After further research it turns out this is may be a potential hard drive issue.  After a month and a half there should not be a hassle of hard drive issues on a new laptop.  The instructions on HP website are to reset it by taking out the battery.  But this has an internal battery and getting the case off is a chore, I still have not gotten it off yet.  Also afraid of breaking the case because it's plastic.  Not sure what to do with thus brick now.
Not a lot of hard drive space, and Windows 8.1 does add a lot of apps that you don't need, but can easily uninstall. Start menu is a lot like Xbox's menu. This is not a touch screen, so make sure you don't need one. Some internet based games play okay, and others (like Dragons: Rise of Berk) don't play all that well. The touch pad is a little small, but can't expect a big pad on on small computer. It only has 2 USB ports, so if you need more than that, either get a hub, or get a bigger laptop. My 22 month old son has sat, stepped, stood on, and played with my computer, and it held up.
Got this cutie for light productivity/college use. Runs smoothly. Track pad, in my opinion, is great! Keyboard (typing), brightness level, and sound are nice. No complaints so far. Will update if any of this changes! So far so good!
Fantastic. I am a first year graduate student whose laptop had finally died and I needed something quick and on the go. I was very hesitant because it is small and only an intel celeron processor but boy did I get a good deal. This is perfect for school work on the go especially since it come with Office 365 for free.<br/><br/>The other worry I had was that it would be slow but I haven't seen that at all. I have already wrote a paper where I had 10 tabs open, microsoft word open, 2 pdfs open, and it hasn't shown it's slow side yet.<br/><br/>Great investment, I'm telling you.
Worth buying. This lightweight notebook is perfectly portable, anywhere you go.
I purchased this laptop less than a year ago and its already failing as a computer.  The 32gb hard drive has no storage space and more than 50% of it gets taken up by windows and windows related updates (which are nearly impossible to remove).  Because of this, the system gets bogged down badly all the time and freezes constantly.  The integrated wireless card is crap and keeps dropping the signal to my router, necessitating a router reset, despite the fact that all of the other wireless devices connect fine.  Save the money on this paperweight and apply it to a real computer.
Just recently got lap top for my sons birthday and it was to be used as a school tool, however just after a week of lite use it doesn't even turn on anymore . Checked power cord , seemed fine but no power, no light indicator that there was power. When it was up and running my son like it, but when it's the end of the trimester and papers are due , this had been very inconvenient, not to mention having his birthday present fail, ugh !<br/>Nice looking computer, appeared sturdy, but something wasn't right. Returning computer, which appears to be a simple process with Amazon .
Received this laptop yesterday. I like it well enough - I got the purple and it's pretty. I also like the white keys, although I'm not sure I like how they feel and their alignment. I deleted some of the crapware I knew I wouldn't use. Comes with McAfee virus protection (free for awhile). I left that on until the free subscription expires, then will remove it. It's a bit slow and it may be due to the McAfee. I'm a fast typist so it can't seem to keep up with me. I mainly bought it for the lightweight, price, color, and it's basic which is all I need. I'd probably buy again.
Run from this HP Stream 11.  Complete waste of your time and money.  Research additional reviews on line.  I have had nothing but problems connecting and staying connected to the internet.  I have tried multiple ISPs.  I spend more time resetting the wireless adaptor than anything else with this computer.  I updated the drivers multiple times.  I called HP customer support.  After speaking to three associates still no help.  I spent $200 on the computer.  I spent more than that on software.  Waste of money. The old adage is true, you get what you pay for.  Buyer beware...
It is a very basic laptop. It really slows down if you have 2 or 3 pages open.
I love this laptop! I bought this for working from home and it's just perfect.
Great first computer for our son. Keyboard size is perfect for 7 yr old hands.
OK. Let's realize that we're paying $199 for a fully functional laptop so you have to understand that. Also, the laptop is very lightweight and awesome looking. But that's about where the positives end. My main issues are with the trackpad. I once had a old netbook and had to stop using because the trackpad was so unresponsive and difficult to use. The laptop is also super slow. I'm returning to get a refurbished but more powerful laptop for the same amount of money.<br/><br/>So... bonus points for portability and styling. Negative for trackpad (it's awful!) and speed.
I now own two of these, the purple and the blue, one for business and one for school. Nice and lightweight, almost as thin as my Dad's MacBook thingy. There are alot of options for attractive (and cute) sleeves and cases. A few folks in my classes have commented about how it would be too small for them, but it works really well for me. The only tiny complaint I have is the small internal HD space, but that's easily solved with an SD card, flash drive or external hard drive. I also got a wireless mouse, just to make things a little easier, but the touchpad is just fine.
Jury still out on this. We bought for the cheap price as we needed a 'kid computer' for schoolwork and such. This was a present for my son for his birthday. He loves minecraft and I researched to make sure this would work for that game. I thought it would. However, Minecraft stalls and has many hiccups when he tries to play. I deleted unnecessary programs and also programs that steal space like spotify and iTunes and it still stalls when he plays. Still trying a few things to make it better. Internet is fast, but the one and only game we wanted on it runs poorly on it.
My tween niece as one and I have one, too.  It runs smoothly and the battery lasts for ever. I use our big laptop for storage stuff but I use this for internet, Cloud and Google Docs stuff - it's light weight and the screen is a perfect size.  My husband complains about small keyboards and he has used this laptop many times and has yet to complain about the keyboard - which means it must be 'normal'! What I love most about this laptop is the price - it is WELL worth it.<br/>I highly suggest this for someone in school - as long as you have internet, you are good to go!
I would give this two stars if I had to live with Windows on it. Instead, it gets five stars for value and size.<br/><br/>I installed Linux Mint on mine. If you're hoping to get one of these to install Linux, know that Windows has moved away from traditional BIOS. It's not impossible to remove Windows and install a less restrictive OS, but you'll have to work around UEFI, turn off secure boot, turn on legacy boot and manually navigate your USB's files to find the UEFI boot files. It sounds difficult but if you can deal with traditional BIOS, you can deal with UEFI.
I couldn't use my Acer Chromebook for work because it was incompatible with their software  and needed a Windows PC. I bought this HP as an inexpensive option. I've had this computer for four days now. Overall, I'm actually shocked at how poorly HP Stream performs.<br/><br/>First, this laptop is much slower than my Chromebook.  To the point, that I actually prefer to use my Chromebook over the HP when I'm at home.  I also notice the battery life isn't very impressive for a new computer.<br/><br/>The trackpad is clunky and doesn't respond as intuitively as I'm use to. If you move your finger too far left or right on the trackpad, it shrinks your windows and goes to Windows 8 main menu. VERY annoying quirk.<br/><br/>Aesthetically,  it's an attractive design and color. However, despite that it's about the same size as Chromebook, it is much heavier, making this laptop less comfortable to transport.<br/><br/>Bottom line, don't be fooled by the HP Stream's flashy appearance; it's a bad computer. Do not buy.
Had this cloud commuting system for about two months and its great! No virus!
Extremely light, very portable design, and really high quality for the price.
Only had a couple months before screen started flickering and turning colors.
Awesome laptop!!! Fast and conveniently small to take around with me all day.
Quick shipping!  Very compact. I love this laptop would definitely recommend!
Love the size, color, and functionality! Would highly recommend this product.
I purchased this computer back in September i believe, and i was very happy when it arrived. shipping was great and was packaged nicely I used this computer for Netflix mainly and obviously for social media. i had no issues with the computer until one night i went to turn it on and the screen was blank i tried turning it off and back on and still a blank screen. the light for it when it is on was bright and flashing but still a blank screen to be honest i was very unhappy with it and i returned it as soon as i could. Won't ever buy another HP highly disappointed.
Adobe crashed repeatedly after loading Firefox. I also can't seem to disable McAfee and put Windows Defender back in.  Otherwise, it's fine  for my needs. I had to do a system restore to original settings and uninstall Firefox to stream Amazon videos through Internet Explorer.But I was able to load Start is Back  without any problems.<br/><br/>If anybody knows how to keep Flash from crashing in Firefox and how to reinstall Windows Defender, I'm all ears. You'd think a computer with the word "stream" in its name would be able to, you know, actually stream.
When I watched other reviews I took note of the downsides but also the upsides. When I got it, it was better than I honestly expected. Sure its not the best laptop/netbook out there, but with an Intel 2.16Ghz CPU, 2GB of RAM, and a 32Gb SSD, what more could you want? Its mainly for office essentials and surfing the web, thats what I bought it for. Screen is good enough, not the best, but its pretty good. The keyboard and touchpad are pretty nice also, although others will feel differently. Overall its a nice netbook for the price I paid, and I'm happy with it
Got it for my son for his birthday and now everyone in the family wants one!
It's OK.  It's very pretty but can be slow at times.  It was expected though
I am currently a college student and a full time worker with a laptop that was on the edge of extinction. I bought this laptop because I was desperate for a new one since mine had died a week before a summer class started. I am very happy with the results! This laptop is thin, light, but durable. I only use it for Microsoft word and the Internet so it's great for someone like me! I love the blue color. The only complaint I have is - I need to buy external storage because it has very limited memory. Other than that I'm happy!! The set up was super easy too.
This is absolutely the best computer for my daughter. She will be heading to college soon. She wanted something light enough to carry around to classes, which this definitely fits the bill. I comes with one year of Microsoft Office so she's able to do all her assignments on Word and Excel. This laptop also comes with HDMI and a coupole USB ports. She absolutely loves it and it's an approved laptop for BYU so she can easily have it maintained on campus. The colors and clarity are beautiful and sharp and the color scheme of the laptop itself is really nice.
Great looks.. My wife is fond of the aesthetics of this laptop. Performance wise I am quite satisfied, given the price point for the item. However, Two things, firstly the storage of 32GB seems really insufficient, particularly the OS and basic apps taking up 50% or more of the space. It could have been 64GB at least to give the user little space to feel the air. Secondly, I didn't like the screen resolution at all. That's the main reason I have deducted a 'star' from the rating. Nowadays, notebooks in this price range itself comes with a better screen.
So far so good! I bought this recently due to i will be traveling international and this seems to be VERY convenient. I like the fact that it is windows 8, I can use all the apps specially the messaging app as long as i have wifi.. well all airports have wifi, then i can just call or text someone to pick me up! LOL no hassle. Plus it looks very cute! I love the keyboard design. There is no lag in speed even if i open more than 5 tabs. I watch youtube and netflix, the quality is great for the price.<br/><br/>I recommend this laptop if you travel a lot.
You definitely get what you pay for. It claims to have a 32GB HD but when you take it out of the box and fire it up, it's already like 80% full of stuff that comes preloaded and installed. So right off the bat you'll run into problems trying to download programs because your already out of space. The touch pad isn't very accurate and is annoying to use. Constantly having to restart the computer for various error messages that pop up. Not worth the money, even at this price.
This lightning-quick, whisper-quiet laptop is the best $200 bucks I ever spent on a computer. I can't imagine being this happy with a Chromebook. Boot-up time is about 20 seconds. With the bloatware removed and the solid state drive optimized, performance is snappy and smooth. I'm really impressed with the fanless dual-core processor for everyday computing. This machine performs on par with my last laptop, a 2nd gen i5 with twice the RAM that weighed twice as much and took at least 2 minutes to boot up. Also Windows 8.1 is much better than I expected.
I've had this laptop for 8 months now with very light use- maybe once a week for a couple hours.  I find that the main power button does not work all the time.  I have to keep pressing it over and over, but it seems that the connection inside to laptop is bad because the power doesn't turn on, even when plugged in or fully charged.  I don't know if this is a flaw with all the hp streams, or just mine. Also there is little to no storage capacity for pictures, videos, etc.  Double check the specs to make sure this is what you want before you purchase.
I am extremely disappointed with this. I bought it in april this year because my old laptop seemed to be on the way out. When it finally died yesterday after 7 years I finally used the HP and was enjoying it. Until it refused to even switch on today. All I get is a blank screen with the cursor....I switched it on and off several times and still have to endure the blankety blank screen. Of course amazon warranty has long expired so what I am left with is JUNK. I can only hope either Amazon or HP values its customers and offer some restitution......
It is what it is and it works perfect for me. I use two programs daily which are fire fox and excel for my taxes which this computer handles flawlessly. The worst part of this compute is the track pad / mouse. It has all these functions to switch from app to app with a drag to a corner. I found my self constantly  activating these features by accident. On preferred settings I could turn off the advance swiping actions and this completely solved that annoying feature. And don't except perfect screen resolution.... Remember it a 200 dollar computer.
I am happy with this purchase. I have had it for two days so far and it is just what I was looking for. Iit is taking a bit for me to get used to not using a mouse but I may invest in one for when I will be at the table or desk.. I find it to be very responsive and like the feel of the keyboard. I have not downloaded office on it yet so I am not sure how that will go but so far this is perfect computer for me, I just wanted a basic portable laptop that I could surf, mess with pictures and do simple office tasks on and this seems to fit the bill.
The price was right.  A totally affordable, functional small lap top.  The years worth of Microsoft Office makes it more so.  However, I didn't pay for, or receive, an outstanding piece of hardware.  The touchpad is difficult - poorly responsive.  I have taken to alway using a cordless mouse which takes one of the two USB ports.  I have yet to figure out how to keep the cursor from jumping so I need to keep my eyes on the screen rather than anything I am trying to read while writing.  Overall a worthwhile purchase that takes some getting use to.
I really, really wanted to love this laptop.  It was the third I bought (one for my daughter and one for my son as well).  Unfortunately it just feels SLOW.  I'm fairly well versed on computers and cleaned it up, figured maybe I'd done something wrong so restored it and tried again.  It still was slow just to load basic webpages.  And it was just this laptop, not my phone, Dell or desktop.  Thankfully Amazon is wonderful and I was able to return it.<br/><br/>It is very well put together, very pretty, feels great just lacks performance (to me).
I love this laptop! its brighter than the pictures made it look and being a girl I need bright colors. I got the magenta one and its purple/ pink and I love it. Its super fast and I love how the mouse pad is a solid strip and it gives the laptop a cool look. Its really good for students especially online ones like me. I need blackboard and this computer actually runs it. I love this computer. It has good storage and great picture quality. The sounds aren't the best, but it makes due and still works. I highly recommend this computer to everyone!!
unfortunately i read the positive reviews and ordered this product with good intentions. worst decision ever. the computer is brand new and slower then my 3 yr old laptop that i had. it would take forever for any website to load with only one tab being open. immediately returned. not happy with the product and will never by an hp product again! my acer laptop i never had any problems with. unfortunately the screen broke so i had to get a new one. buying another acer!
Prefect computer for school and gaming I love this computer worth my money
At this price point and entry into laptops this unit is worth the investment. Shoot just the cloud storage is worth almost as much as the machine.<br/><br/>Our high school student uses it for her online classes.<br/><br/>It seems to be a solid piece of equipment. It has held up well to a couple of drops that made me cringe.<br/><br/>Would recommend for those that are not looking for a really fast or for a lot of games. If you are looking for a basic unit to use for school or to be online for Facebook, emails. etc.. this is a solid unit.
For what it is, this is perfect: a lightweight notebook ideal for school, writing, streaming TV, and light (as in Zynga) gaming. The battery life is very good, the screen resolution actually isn't bad at all, it connects without any problems to WiFi even if the signal is relatively far away, and as far a "writing" computer, it's ideal.<br/><br/>The casing feels a little cheap (not entirely sure why - I can't quite put my finger on it), and the sound is, naturally, far from spectacular, but as a school computer, this is a good one.
When I  first  got it it was great,,  notwithstanding the limitations I knew going into the  purchase  i..e. limited  hdd  space, memory, etc. Recently the charger stopped working properly. Now I have to play around with it until it is in an exact position for it to charge my laptop. Even worse, all the keys on the bottom row, from left shift to / stick from time to time and I have to continuously keep tapping on them until they start typing again. Very frustrating!  Other then that, great little laptop. Unfortunately I guess I got a lemon.
I own a dance studio and have 4 studio rooms for classes. This year I decided to place a small laptop into each studio room for the convenience of my instructors to utilize our studio software more frequently while they are conducting class. No need for Word or any other programs since our studio software is all online. These are small and convenient. Fit perfectly into our metal file folder holders that are secured to the wall. Out of place from "little hands" (students). We loves these laptops! Fast and they get the job done! A+
I am absolutely in love with this laptop.  The price - can't be beat.  For $200 you get a fully functioning laptop, a year of Microsoft Office.. I couldn't be happier.  The only issue I've had is clicking using the built in mouse pad - - it can get frustrating.  I picked up an inexpensive mouse and my problem is solved.  I save documents to my Google Drive but you ARE able to save to your laptop.  Obviously, just not as much as a more expensive, bigger laptop.  Looking for a simple laptop? THIS is the one for you!  You will not regret it.
This is probably a good laptop for the price, but I was surprised that only 8GB of disk space was available after the install, and my son wanted to load a game that requires 9GB.  Looks like Windows takes up at least 9GB and then some 7GB is reserved for the restore drive.  We bought this to replace old laptops that take a lot of parent time to maintain, and we've spent several hours trying to tune this to free up disk space so that is disappointing.  Thank you to "formortals" for the detailed tuning instructions and link to a micro SD card.
Great little laptop.  It does what I need, comes with a year of free Office 365 and 1T of One drive space (15G of One Drive is available free forever).<br/><br/>Once you install apps and programs there is almost zero storage on the actual device. I believe I have about 6 G of storage, so you definitely need to take advantage of a cloud storage.<br/><br/>Follow the instructions from the top reviewer to clean it up and get it running it's best. It's a light, quick, and responsive little machine. The blue is very pretty too.
At first I thought this was an amazing deal for a small laptop which included office 365 free for one year and 1TB of cloud storage. It has been very effective for my business, however a month and a half later, my computer is completely unusable and the screen is displaying half grey and half black. I suppose it is true, you get what you pay for. 30 minutes on hold with HP technical support, and I certainly hope they are able to correct the issue.
Got for my daughter. She loves it. No Cd/dvd drive but she didn't care!
I love how this laptop is lightweight and a on the go size laptop. It has a nice matte blue color with a slim and sleek presentation. I use this laptop to edit videos and browse the web. if your looking for that kinda laptop this is the one. it's not really fit for gaming but is perfect for school too. It has 2 GB but if you use more than 2 GB like more buy a 32 GB SD card or USB, but i prefer a SD card so it wont take up space for my two USB ports. overall perfect laptop to travel with, lightweight and awesome for school.
This does everything I needed it to do and more. I was a bit skeptical about windows 8 but I've managed to pick it up rather quickly. Beautiful color, nice keyboard. Definitely the nicest laptop I've ever owned. It doesn't have much memory and there's no CD/DVD drive but I was able to pick up some externals for fairly decent priced. Would be best for internet browsing and school for those of you who are students, however if you're looking to game I'd suggest something else. Overall a wonderful computer for a great price.
This is not a bad laptop, but it is very basic.  It does not have a CD player which I donot remember reading was not included in this laptop before I purchased it.  There is nothing wrong with this laptop.  I think it would be great for a child in elementary or middle school who needed something for homework.  If you are looking for something with more bells and whistles, this is not the computer for you.  It's fine for me, but not for someone who is computer literate and looking for something a little more high tech.
This is my first laptop. At first, I was scrolling through Amazon and thinking about a Chromebook. That said, I'm very glad I chose the HP Stream 11, because so far it hasn't lagged on YouTube, OneDrive is absolutely amazing, & the internet runs pretty quickly. I love the color, the keyboard, and the windows setup. So far, the battery life lasts all day & I charge it during nighttime. You defiantly can't purchase as many apps as you can on iPhone's, but that's expected. Defiantly suggested for anyone considering! (:
Good laptop, great value! Perfect for junior high/high school student!
Great Laptop for back to school use and light work online applications.  Only cons would be local disk space 32 gigs and upgrade restraints on components as memory etc.  This can be fixed by adding external storage for more space or utilizing cloud storage which for temporary time free 1 Terabyte of storage.  Also Office 365 for free 1 year reg when purchased this.<br/><br/>Summary: Purchased for kids back to school work and wife use at home work with companies websites.<br/><br/>Everyone is please as of now.
Always have stuck with HP for my computers and have never been let down, this one continues in that tradition. I communicate a lot with my computer but don't store a lot so I didn't need a lot of memory, if I need more I'll buy more.Have had it 6 months no problems at all from functionality to lack of problems and  Hp quality. I have had computers [HP] that did a lot more and had tremendous memory but i discovered I just wasn't using enough of the features to justify the higher price, so for me this is perfect.
Nice netbook replacement. I bought this to replace a old netbook that died. Once I received it I backed up the system so I could install Linux. I tried LXLE because that is what I have on my desktop, but I was unable to get the proprietary network driver to enable. So I installed linux Mint 64-bit instead, it was a easy and painless install. With linux running it tells me I have at least 8 1/2 hours of battery life. This is not a powerful laptop but it is good for general surfing, coping photos, and printing.
Received this for christmas and was enjoying for a couple of days. The touch pad issue mentioned in other reviews is spot on. It seems to have a mind of it's own. Tapped, nothing. Tapped again, nothing. I thought I could live with this until I got the "failure to connect to the internet". My chromebook, Ipad air and Iphone have never displayed internet connect issues. It may be best to spend a bit more for a better machine.
Very disappointed I could not get this computer at the same price in blue that was identical, and  advertised on tv for the lesser price. Was unable to post original review, but this is for a man, and not a masculine color. My husband needed something new and affordable to continue his education, so I had to settle for this purplish color. Don't understand why the same exact computer was such different prices in different colors??
If you do a lot of Microsoft Office, Blackboard, e-mail, basically light work stuff and you're comfortable leaving all of your data online, then this is a very viable machine.  The long battery life makes it extremely convenient for coffee shop use.  I'd recommend it to another teacher as a convenient way to work on the go.<br/><br/>I'm sure it can't play games, or do heavy computing, but that's not what it's for.<br/><br/>Windows 8 takes a while to get used to, but nobody should be surprised by that.
I sort of have to disagree with some of the praise being heaped on this computer (while being mindful that it is a budget laptop).<br/><br/>Cons: It is heavier than I was expecting; it is relatively slow; it has relatively little memory; the touchpad is frustratingly not responsive<br/><br/>Once again, I understand this is a budget laptop and also can't match the chromebook in speed due to Windows OS. But I would really recommend someone strongly consider a higher grade laptop if they can afford it.
Great value, fast enough, keyboard has good feedback and is much better and roomier than what I expected (and the main reason for purchasing this) ... lightweight, sleek and bright blue looks great, like something worth multiples of the price ... This has a matte screen, they cut down on glare but aren't as clear as glass screens.  Get a mouse, trackpad is weak like most laptop trackpads.  For me, it's better than a Chromebook: it's easier to use if it's not online and I can run Java based applications.
I bought this from Amazon. My first attempt at a laptop. It is easy, up to date on all programs and the free stuff, like office, cloud, and the extra deals you get from Hulu,and Netfix are really a nice plus. I had a hard time figuring out the Windows 8.1 screen, but I believe part of that was the fact 8.1 can also be used on a touch screen. Looking for help with Windows simple questions is a bit of a pain, but even being a novice I figured it out.  A great buy, but it still is a great quality machine.
Great laptop!  They even sent it abroad ! Worked great for my needs!
I like this laptop because it is compact, small, and has Windows 10.
Love it!!  Very light and met all my expectations for a great price.
A decent little computer. Light weight. Runs MS Office. Some statistical programs (r). It is relatively easy to move files to and from this computer. I used it (with a bluetooth mouse) to easily prepare two presentations and a number of documents on a recent trip. Audio is poor. My headphone port does not work, nor can my Bluetooth headset connect. So assume you are not going to be watching videos or listening to music.  This is an inexpensive MS Windows computer, not a gaming or entertainment device.
Save your money and get a good laptop. This laptop was working fine at first despite a few small problems. The mousepad on it barely works so you need to use a different mouse. Second, it forces you to use bing, AOL and everything else that is loaded on there. It takes up space and you can't get it off. Speaking of space, you get 2GB of space. That is 14 GB less than most phones and definitely not enough for a student with many documents. The free Office trial worked but that is the only "free" program that actually worked. The cloud storage was non-existent. I also got this with a $25 gift card that it never let me use. The Wi-fi constantly gets disconnected making it impossible to get anything done. After about a year of having it, it basically stopped opening most webpages, printing, saving documents, and staying connected to the Internet. Although it seems like a good deal, don't get this laptop because you will lose $200 for a piece of junk.
I've been having this laptop for 2 days and I love it!!!! I personally didn't buy it off amazon because I wanted it quick and now I am seeing that getting it couple days earlier helped. First it's 200 dollars, it's a fan-less design so no noise, 11.6 is a great size to view videos, it gives you so many free stuff, it's kinda loud for a 200 laptop,and it is easy to setup and to use. I'm a junior in high school and I'm for sure going to keep this until after college. I highly recommend this product.
I got this for my 13 year old daughter and she loves it! It comes with a $25 Microsoft gift card and a full year of Microsoft Office. I definitely recommend this to people who have children in middle school. Definitely worth what I paid for! It has a beautiful color and contrast, It has the perfect sized keyboard. The most thing my daughter likes about this laptop is the keyboard because she said it fits perfectly for hr hands and she learned how to type with out looking...she's only in 7th grade!
Very good product. A complete team for daily and uncomplicated use.
This is my laptop.  It took a few days for me to "learn" it but it handles everything I need it to handle.  I do a great deal of my work on it when I work from or at home and it handles every application and program I need it to.  It is lightweight,  The little mouse pad on the computer was far too sensitive for me so I purchases a wireless mouse and that problem was solved pronto.  The many adjustments available allowed me to alter its screen brightness and other visual attributes.
Great laptop for the price. Sound quality could be better with streaming videos. A little sensitive to the touch with the screens jumping from one to the other, if your hand is laying on or putting touch pressure on the mousepad. Registered with the Microsoft 365 Personal (for the free year that came with it), but when I took off the automatic payment renewal it de-registered and I had been a little bit of a pain to get straightened out. Other than that, great purchase...very happy with it.
I got the blue laptop, I can't remember if that's the default color they send you or not, but the color is absolutely beautiful. The top and cover of the laptop is this beautiful deep blue color that softens and gets brighter once it hit the keyboard to the bottom of the laptop, it's gorgeous! I bought it for my sister for Christmas and she loves it! I love it! I wish I bought one for myself! Haha, happy holidays!
Great little computer, and when I say little it really is little. And it's so weightless!<br/>This computer came here so fast, I got whiplash!<br/>The computer is true to it's color, very blue...lot's of character. This computer is great for school, and social websites but has limited amount of memory. But that works for me since I only plan to use it for school and facebook.<br/>It is working lovely after my friend installed the windows 10, added google chrome, and such.<br/>4 stars!
You get what you pay for.  This is a very cheap laptop and operates as such.  It is good for minimal use (watching movies, listening to music, web browsing) but is a bit slow.  I also dislike that the operating system was designed for touch screen use but the computer itself does not have a touch screen.  The operating system is very user un-friendly in general.  Speakers blew out after a week or so (now there is a constant crackling noise whenever I play music).  Kind of slow in general.
I regret to disagree with the many fine reviews but I found the installed software too complicated and convoluted to use, ease of use  requires too much time involvement.  to simply do want I wanted to do.  It is no wonder that HP decided to discontinue this product.  Also, windows 8.1 is a total disaster in my opinion.  I really suggest that one thoroughly examine the ease of use and software before investing in any HP  item or Windows software.  Me, I tossed this garbage in the trash.
So far it seems like a decent hybrid of laptop and chromebook. It is not blazing fast, but you are not lugging a heavy/ huge computer either. I bought it for my 14 year old daughter to do her homework on and it works great. She loves the Windows 8, but I'm not a huge fan (that was me throwing opinions in).<br/>She has experienced no bugs or major flaws. The mouse feels flimsy but I have her plug in a regular mouse which is easier to use anyway. All in all, I am happy with the purchase.
hard ti beat for $200  Got for my daughter as a college computer.  Works fine for basic use, web surfing, writing and watching movies.  Keyboard seems to work fine.  Full windows is nice vs limited operating systems in others computers in this price range.  Speed is adequate for this type of use.<br/><br/>No its not for video editing or lightning speed of much more expensive computers. However its unfair to expect that for this price range.<br/><br/>Very pleased, got what I hoped.
The only thing I like about this computer in the color...so far I cant use it for the purpose that I bought it which is to download games and use the internet. Every game I've downloaded wont play or there's an error message that says there's been an internal error. I've even installed a game via a flash drive from the HP  to my old laptop (sony) and there was no problem installing AND running the program. I'll be returning this piece of junk and get another Sony like my last laptop.
I was looking for a reasonably priced, light weight laptop for business and this laptop did not disappoint. What put it over the top from the other offers was the ability to upgrade to Windows 10 and the year of free Office 365. My main focus was web browsing, email, Skype and MS Office (Power Point, MS Word) and so far, this laptop is handling everything. Warning, there is not a lot of memory for this laptop. It doesn't matter to me since I use cloud storage for my documents/files.
I got this for my grandson for middle school graduation, and he loves it.  The laptop came with Office 365 and 1TB of storage for one year.  Even if they do not continue with the cloud storage, you can get an external drive for less than $80.  The school conducts schedules and homework on Google Drive, so it was almost critical for him to have something he can access without waiting in line for the house computer.  He liked it so much, he talked his friend into getting one as well.
we searched and waited for months until we came across this laptop. the reviews were super helpful. our high school teen has exactly what she needs for school. it is true about the trackpad. that is solved with a wireless mouse with USB connection. it's just easier to maneuver. the size makes it portable and when you open it up, the pixel display is so sharp that we forget about the screen size. this device was answer to prayer. we are considering getting a second one for our home.
PROS:<br/>-Remarkable quality for cash<br/>-Eye-getting outline<br/>-Packaged with Office 365 Personal<br/>-Magnificent battery life<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Unspectacular HD display<br/>-Slightly iffy touchpad<br/><br/>The main region of genuine concern is the screen – its somewhat dull and difficult to utilize outside. This much is normal in most circumstances on such a modest portable computer, but there is an alternative that resolves that problem: http://bit.ly/1xP5kdt
Its only been three months since I bought this laptop and I am already having issues with it shutting down on its on and the screen is already going out. I did buy a warranty so hopefully they should be able to fix it other wise I am going to have to buy another laptop. I do believe that it is best for students that have to carry a lot of books. I had a deal where I was able to get Microsoft office 2013 which is the biggest reason I decided to buy this laptop. hope this helps.
I'm an aspiring writer and i bought this laptop so I could have something nice and portable to type my novels up on. The year free trial of Microsoft Office was a major selling point for me. The laptop itself is great for the price, though I do take issues with the touch pad. I really hate the new style of touchpads where instead of having two buttons, the pad itself acts as the buttons. It's kind of inconvenient and annoying to use, but it's nothing buying a mouse can't fix
Best deal I've seen in a while. works great and arrived on time.
This is a fantastic little laptop!  And I usually use MacBook Pros and iMacs. I bought one of these for my wife and it performs excellent. Thre are two things that make me only give it four stars and if hp would fix these they would sell this thing like hotcakes. a. The display is not as good as it could be. I am not expecting an AMOLED or retina display, but it could be better. b. Just a little more storage and no crapware. these two things would make this a killer laptop.
Great little laptop for its price. If you are looking for a device to use social media, do minimal work on Microsoft Office and stream basic things such as Netflix this is a great purchase for the price.<br/><br/>It has very little memory and low Ram so sometimes can be a tad laggy when streaming or doing multiple things but that was to be expected with the Specs<br/><br/>If you need a laptop to do more than the things listed above you should find a heavier duty laptop
When my tablet started acting up, I decided it was time to go back to a laptop, for my uses of surfing the net and email, I did not want to spend an arm and a leg. I surveyed what Amazon had to offer and after reading MANY reviews (thanks to all who take the time to post, as I do, reviews help me tremendously) decided on this laptop. It is not the speediest thing and the screen is small, but I love the small size and it's lightweight and no fan. It does all I ask it to do!
I use my laptop to surf the web, download music, watch youtube and less usually for the microsft suite of apps - word & excel. The limited storage capacity is the main detraction but I get they are trying to move you to cloud atorage.  I don't care for the having to sign into microsoft to access the apps.  It crashes alot but that is probably because I've maxed out the memory.  Either I have to change my thining towards storage or I'm goimg to have to get another laptop.
I recently purchased the HP Stream 11.6 inch laptop.  This laptop fits my needs almost perfectly.  There are times when wi fi connection is a problem but not often.  The problem is that by the time your applications are downloaded and Windows downloads its updates there is very little storage left.  I am extremely disappointed and I really wanted to keep this laptop but was afraid I'd end up with no storage....so I have  to return to get another laptop.  Does anyone know of an alternative for more storage? If I get a memory card will the Windows updates download to the memory card and update the computer? If that is an option what size memory card should I get? Would appreciate anyone's help on this!  thank you....
Received it on time. It's really pretty. Works really well. The only problem I would say I have is that I can't redeem the 25 dollar gift card that came with it. I tried everything. I do live in the US so I don't know why it wouldn't work for me. Overall a great purchase. I highly recommended specially for those that are in school.
It worked the first time I used it.  That's it.  Now I get a black screen after log in.  I could see that as an issue for an older machine, but not a brand new one.  I haven't decided yet if it's worth the hassle of HP repair or if I will just return it.<br/><br/>***Update*** The issue was resolved after restarting in safe mode and then again in normal mode.  So now I am cautiously optimistic that all is well.  But I'm still concerned that this occurred in its second use.
I got this laptop for my 8 year old son and he loves it.  He watches videos and plays windows store games without any drama.  The computer is capable of far more and he'll be able to grow into it.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/>Easy upgrade to windows 10<br/>Fast<br/>Great price<br/><br/>Cons -<br/>None with this laptop specifically, with windows however I'd really like to see the ability to migrate and install apps on an SD card without having to resort to registry hacks
Words cannot even begin to describe how happy I am to have this awesome HP machine! It shipped fast and arrived on time for starters. Also, that $209 price was a true winner for me! Even more, it's perfect for college which is why I bought. It runs smoothly and fast, it gives you windows 10 update for free. It has so many  interchangeable options to truly make this laptop your own. the keyboard and screen are just the right size. This was a definite win win in my book!
Gets the job done for working on the go.  Battery life is GREAT
The HP is very nice; small but not too small. Good price, also.<br/>After using it, I find it is very slow. I hope to upgrade it.
I love my laptop. From the look 2 the performance its the best.
It does what it say it will. The color is pretty.  I bought this for my dad as his very first computer.  I don't find the micrsoft windows  user friendly for him so I will make desktop shortcuts.  I didn't like that it doesn't open smoothly but I believe I got what I paid for.  When he gets more comfortable I will upgrade this for him.  I don't think that it would be good for a college student  because it's a little slow but I think it's ok for new computer users.
This was the biggest mistake I ever made in terms of a computer purchase! The memory is absolute crap, it locks up or shuts off every 10 minutes, and is completely unreliable. I bought it primarily for web surfing and MS Office applications and it isn't even good at those few tasks. If anyone is thinking about this purchase please think again and spend a little more for a better product. The only satisfaction I will get from it now is smashing it to pieces!!!!!
Nice Laptop I love it pretty fast just wish it had more space.
A good workmate with low price.<br/>I was astonished after unwraped it:perfect looking,so light indeed.<br/>With camera and a USB3.0 port，also equipped with 32 GB SSD.the no-fan design,which makes it so quite.<br/>But the original installed system was win8.1 with Bing,with no local group policy nor app locker.<br/>The disk contains a approximately 8GB  for system backup,which makes it less disk space for using.<br/>Anyway,it's good enough for daily use.
I love it! Have not bought a new laptop in a while sense Windows 7 came out. It`s nothing like the other laptops I had. It`s much lighter like maybe about 1/2 Ib or 2. It dose not get real hot or a annoying fan. It comes with a HDMI cable so you can plug it in your T.V and watch your screen on there. The only thing I don`t like about it is theres no DVD/CD player in it! I can`t install some of my programs onto my laptop. So now I got to buy a portable one.
I bought this computer because I needed something to do school work on. This was a good choice for that. However, there is a serious lack of storage. When I went to download Windows 10 it told me there was not enough storage, which is frustrating because I hadn't download anything on to the computer,  not even a single picture. At the end of the day, it does what I bought it to do, but I wouldn't buy it if you want a reliable computer to do everything on.
Last computer I bought was an Asus; Problematic as it was a desktop and tech support in India. This computer even worse. DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHG THEY PROMISE. Slow and full of bugs, pop-ups trying to sell you everything and anything, only good thing is that it was cheap, will throw away as soon as possible. AND DO NOT BELIEVE ANYONE WHO SAYS UPGRADING TO WINDOWS IS FREE AND EASY. Ten hoours later, all I can say is it is downloaded but will not run or start.
Pros:<br/>Adorable<br/>Perfect size<br/>Lightweight<br/>Speakers are great<br/>Battery life is great<br/>Cons:<br/>Extremely glitchy<br/>I had problems with it from day one.<br/>It's completely online based. As in, when you download a file to your computer and then try to open it but you are no longer connected to the internet, it won't happen because it's in the cloud...which can be extremely irritating! My husband swears it's slow. But he has a top of the line hp so that's his point of comparison.<br/>Overall, for the price, it's great.
I got this for school, because I do my classes from home and it was great because it had word and I could download the things I needed. I installed windows 10 right away and it took the entire day, which was annoying but expected. The only problem was that not all programs support windows 10 yet because it is so new so Blackboard Collaborate was a struggle and I had to go in the system and change things. But other than that everything is running smoothly.
I got this laptop a few months ago and it was a 5 plus star until just this past month. At first it just started being very very slow but now the keyboard barely even works. It takes me like 5 minutes to move around and now I can't even shut my laptop off without using the button. I'm VERY upset. I barely have any apps downloaded and I treat my laptop very nice so this is NOT my fault. I really can't believe something I loved so much just turned to crap.
I Had a Google Chorme ,but I was limited it ,I decide it to buy this Hp stream ,perfect I can download I tunes .and other stuff .it comes with a free windows gift card ..the laptop is no for gamers .yes u can play games ,but don't expect  Hd performance. is a nice laptop you also have windows office . You can make videos most of the things you can do in a desktop ,I like a lot  mine is pink ,is the perfect laptop to take on vacation or anywhere  you want
Until I connected a mouse to it, I did not like it. The touch pad does not respond to my liking and it does take some time to adapt to the different format, but now I enjoy it. It was frustrating to have to keep tapping the touch pad and NOTHING happened.  I like the split screen very much and how you can make your starting screen your own. I was so excited to get this little laptop and told my husband this was all I wanted for Christmas. Love the color.
this was a great chap pc. I only had this for a few days before i returned it. But i did not return it for its faults. The only fault i could see was that the screen was very cheaply made. There is a different version of this computer sold in stores that has the touchscreen feature. The touchscreen version has a much better constructed screen and even though they have identical pixel density the touchscreen version looked clearer and had cleaner colors.
A great computer for a great price. It is fun and easy to use
Very happy with my laptop and ease of set up.  This laptop really isn't meant for gaming, videos, photoshopping etc. But It covers my basic needs which include web browsing, emails, and working in Microsoft Office.  Great laptop for doing work at home. I would recommend this for students and anyone going off to college!!  I did buy a wireless mouse as the tracking pad seems a little sketchy at times, but once that was done I had no problems or issues.
I bought this as a gift for someone since it was pinkish purple and said it has an optical drive.There is no optical drive or cd rom at all.Bummer now she can not burn cd's till we get a side drive for her.Well atleast its a decent computer other wise but thats a big deal it says it has an optical drive.The pictures kind of line also does not come with a finger scanner like the high end 500$ computers have which I kind of figured that at the price.
This laptop arrived quickly and is very compact. It is light and the color (blue) makes it a little bit unique. It runs quickly and the operating system is head and shoulders above my old HP (2009). Unfortunately the first thing I did when I got it was download a virus, but the computer is so user friendly that I was able to find the source and uninstall it within an hour. I am very happy with this purchase and I dont think you can beat the price.
Actually pretty effn rad. I've alway had a mac book. But my current one is starting to mooove realllly slowwwwww. So I wanted something simple to type docs, browse internet and stream some movies. It has a micro usb to add external memory so I can save all my pics, docs, music, etc. You can't save programs tho...or maybe u can and I just don't know since I'm pretty pc illiterate.<br/><br/>Color is really pretty too. Who doesn't love periwinkle!
The keyboard is nice and big, but the OS stinks, the track pad has too many built in odd behaviors, it has so little memory I can't even do the free upgrade to Windows 10, and it's bundled with a bunch of junk. Worse still, the free year of Office 360 included overwrote my login with my Microsoft ID from Office 360! How dare any piece of software reset MY login to MY laptop?! It works for my writing, but there are a lot of frustrations included.
Love the laptop. Does exactly what I wanted it to. Don't plan on downloading too much on it, but the memory is so low I had trouble even downloading one additional app and unable to remove some downloaded items that I do not plan to use.  Just by downloading Microsoft Office I'm restricted from downloading additional items. Typically save things on a cloud based storage so definitely able to cope. The laptop itself is perfect, size, speed etc.
I have a HP Elitebook that broke and when I contacted the support in 1 week an HP technician came to my house and changed almost all parts, motherboard, screen, processor. The note was like new! My wife needed a note to study and I did not think twice and invest in HP Stream 13 Laptop with Free Office 365. She loves it. Supplies all her needs.It has a great cost-benefit. It is fast, lightweight, portable, beautiful and with a great support hp.
I first saw this computer at BestBuy. I was looking for a computer that can be used daily for surfing the web and occasional MS Office use. I was instantly drawn to the blue and the quick response of the clicks. While the new windows sucks hands down in terms of user friendliness, the computer itself is fast and efficient.<br/><br/>Given the price point this computer is a BEST BUY. It was on sale at amazon for $200 so can't beat that price.
I got this laptop cuz it has exactly what I was looking for, a powerful comp, small, gorgeous looks!!! I needed it for school and accounting!! So far everything has been great!! The online office and the online storage work perfectly. The only problem that I have with mine, I dont know if someone else has it too, is that the screen is to fragile perhaps too thin, everytime I move it closer to me the image blurrs into a lot of lines, but not when I push it back!
I'm not used to using Windows. As a Mac fanatic since 2007 I haven't touched a Windows computer. However, I bought this for work, mainly used to scan & email documents. Also my girlfriend uses it for her online homework. We have actually really enjoyed it. While it is hard to get used to a new system, the computer look so expensive and ran fast! Works great for what we use it for & is very light weight when we need to take it with us places.
Can't download Microsoft 10, not enough space. Called HP, on on the phone an hour,  then they give me Microsoft's number. I call Microsoft I was on hold for half an hour and that was enough for me. I don't understand how they can give you a free upgrade if there isn't enough space on the computer. I purchased a 16 gigabyte thumb drive and I'm going to attempt for the fifth time to download it. If not I'll have to pay someone to do it for me.
Great deal I love how the keyboard fades to different color
Minus the bloatware and its the best laptop for the price..
very happy works great and best deal for the cash real fast
Bought for use as my travel laptop.  I travel rarely but when I do I work.  It has been great and I have absolutely no complaints.  Just moved and using this one now while the other is packed away.  Would really be great for a college student, teen or responsible kid. Very lightweight and easy to use.  I had to uninstall some security programs because popups were constantly interrupting me and pissing me off.  Otherwise, awesome computer.
The sdhc port does not work; I have passed hours with people from HP accessing remotely my hp stream 11 without success. I have tried 3 distinct sdhc cards from Sandisk, brand new, class 10, and the machine does not recognizes the cards. HP says the driver is up-to-date.<br/>The hdmi port is another frustration. I have purchased an expensive hdmi-to-vga converter, does not work either. I live in Brazil and there is no local support here.
This is a great laptop.  Not only is it great for the buck but it compares to some of the other much higher priced models.  Due to the low price tag, I was concerned that gaming would be difficult.  However, my kids are able to play Minecraft and Roblox with no problems.  The wifi signal is strong.  Switching from apps and searching the web are quick and having Microsoft Office for a year is a big plus.  Very satisfied with the purchase.
I am disappointed in this product.  At times, it would take over ten minutes to start—I would turn on, leave the room, and upon return, the little circle would still be rotating.  I would attempt to turn off, and it would not.  At other times, when it would turn on, it would constantly freeze.  When I would shut it down, it would not turn off.  It moved very slowly.  Maybe I received a lemon.  There were so many positive feed backs.
The memory is SO small it won't even update to windows 10.
This is a very nice starter laptop. Good processing power.
Computer works great for the kids school work...good value
I like it really, it's what I needed: light and functional
It's great for the cost, it does what its made for which is school/work related tasks. its not for any kind of gaming, however, it surfs the internet and streams videos fine. the only negative which caught me off guard, "since I didn't see it in any reviews" is that the SD port only supports up to 32gb SD cards max. I know the focus of this laptop is cloud but it would've been nice to have the option to use a 128gb SD card.
For the price you can't go wrong. We just needed a laptop to stream the news, check email, and for the kids to use on school projects. The price was perfect and it suits our needs. I wasn't a huge fan of Windows 8, but we are slowly getting use to it. If you are looking for a super duty fancy laptop; Don't stop here. If you are looking for an affordable and practical laptop that you can have fun with then I recommend this for you.
I didn't realize it uses cloud memory so the Memory is low. The laptop's instructions came with a free upgrade to Windows 10.  However when I tried to upgrade the laptop did Not have enough memory to upgrade.  I was on the phone with Hp and Windows neither one seemed to know how to resolve this issue  and I have yet to upgrade to Windows 10.  They did however ascertain there wasn't enough memory on the hard drive. for Windows 10.
Updating after a year of use.  In today's world it critical to have memory and the 2GB is gobbled up after opening 5 tabs in Firefox.  Then you are very slow.  4 GB of Memory, in today's market, would have cost HP chump change.  I would not buy this computer again after using it.<br/><br/>A year ago, I wrote It is all about value, bang for the buck.  $200 UltraLight laptop?  Yes!  This is direct competition to the tablet.  Great feeling keyboard, 9 hour battery, a SSD drive (howbeit, very small size but you can use a 64GB 3.0 for storage) and an OK Celeron processors all in one package, for the price! Wow.  I do lament that the 2GB memory is not upgradable.
It's small and cute but it's seriously the slowest laptop I've ever used. I am a student and only use it for homework. I have only had it for maybe a month or two and I have added only one folder with 10 or so word/excel documents and the computer can't handle it. I do not have pictures or music downloaded either. I am not sure why it's so slow. I will probably try to trade it in at Best Buy and buy something more with my money.
I love this computer. Very lightweight, keys are similar to a Mac, as others have stated. This is definitely a good buy for the price. I did read one review for purchase that advised the touch pad was slow and unresponsive often. This is true, but I purchased a wireless mouse and it has solved that struggle. Also, sometimes the computer itself is a bit lagging, but I can not say for sure it is the computer, and not the Wi-Fi.
works great, inexpensive laptop that can handle the work.
I wanted a smaller laptop to bring to work and when I travel. Something to write on, watch Netflix, etc. nothing fancy.<br/>This laptop is exactly what I needed. Great price for a simple, smaller, laptop.<br/>The color is beautiful. Bright blue, the induce along the keyboard has an ombré effect that starts at the blue color, and fades to a beautiful Aqua. I love the color! A friend has the pink one, it's also very pretty!
We have actually purchased two of these now, and love them!  One was for our teenage son and one for our pre-teen daughter.  It is light and small enough to fit in a book bag. Even with it being smaller, the screen is still big enough to see while surfing the Internet or writing a paper.  Be sure not to throw away all of the papers that come with it.  The code for Office is one of the papers that look like advertisements​.
so cute and lightweight Just what I wanted for low price
Love this lil machine for basic getting on the internet!
Bought this PC for my college freshman.  She needed a lightweight laptop to tote to and from school, but wanted something small enough (and cute enough) to stick in whatever bag she chooses to use.  We just bought a small Kayond Cute Leopard Canvas Fabric cover for it....fits perfectly and so adorable.  The computer is fast on the internet which is where she does most of her work.  Love it! Such a great value as well.
Cons:<br/>Feel like cheap plastic.<br/>Track pad  button is hard to click so I just use double.<br/>Half the hard drive is full by time you turn the computer on.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>It's cheap and works<br/>Cheap feeling but also feels like it will take a fall or smack and not be damaged.<br/>Speakers are loud<br/>Hardly bigger then my ipad.<br/><br/>Over all I like the computer for my travel/work computer.
I needed a computer on a very very low budget and so i researched and found the HP 13" Stream. It does everything any other laptop can. The pink/magenta color had gotten me many compliments. I love! Only thing is, i returned two others before settling for my current one. The first had an electronic issue and the second had a minor scratch. Amazon replaced my order swiftly and i've enjoyed my laptop ever since..
got this for the grand daughter for her birthday.  this is her 1st year of high school and since we are in the technology age and the kids are using computers more and more for their classes.  this helps for she has a separate thumb drive for each of her classes.  so instead of luging a lot of books to class.  she carries her laptop, fan,mouse and thumb drive to class.  the whole set-up weighs less than 5 pounds.
Love this better than my surface pro 2 - Great for kids
perfect for my daughter, but i wish it had a dvd drive.
Gave this to my 11 yr old and she is never with out it!
This is an outstanding little machine given the price -- not as quick as the HP 14" chromebook but, given the fully functional OS and improvement in weight (it's noticeably lighter) I was thrilled to start working on this guy.<br/><br/>The track-pad is the only con (it's terrible) but given that you can get used to it, I didn't think it worth dinging the score a full star. All in all 9/10 would buy again.
Every one should buy this pc and I love it it's perfect and has everything at first at I did not know cloud now I would never use anything else it's wifi and fast lots of nice features clear screen with adobe and 365 everything Microsoft windows I am on the computer every day for hours and is all good.  Buy this laptop and you will not be disappointed and will never want to use anything else ever ("-")
It's a great product and I am pleased with it.  It's light weight, portable and has met all my work needs so far.. The only down side is that everything has to be stored on onecloud because there really isn't any memory space but even that issue isn't that bad it has easy acccess to the cloud. I would buy it again as a matter of fact I am for both of my teenagers high school on line work is a must these days.
This laptop is royal blue color, I fell in love with it at first sight, but unfortunately it is really slow about everything, can not browse websites fluquently, even can not play small online games, froze up time to time. I had to return it even if I love the color. Don't waste your money! I have to looking for another one functional.
This computer has almost NO memory. With all the BIG programs, it just doesn't perform well. It's cute and small, but has no power or  potential. Please don't upgrade to Windows 10, or add ANY programs -- no games, fun stuff, NOTHING. I did upgrade to Windows 10, then had to go back to the beginning and just add Microsoft Office because I NEED that one (but ONLY Word, but you have to add all the other crap).
I was in the market for a new computer. I needed something basic, affordable, but had more capability than a Chromebook. This works on all fronts. I had to remove some of the unneeded apps, and I have to use my external hard drive for extra storage, but I'm please with my purchase. It's cute too! A great computer for people who don't need a bunch of storage, but still want a simple good old fashioned laptop.
So far so good. Still trying to get used to the Windows 8 but so far no complaints.  This Laptop is really nice. I a student and use it mostly for class work typing papers and online surfing.  A few good apps in the Windows store too. If you are a heavy gamer I would not recommend as this comp 1. Has no cd\DVD drives and 2 does not have a lot of memory. You can add a SD card which is really cool. Fast ship.
Operating system takes up so much room and after at least 70 up dates there is not much room for other things. Added Chrome so very little room left. The SDHC card can be used for down loads BUT still uses up whats left on the hard drive. I only bought this to sit at the kitchen table to play around with. Works kind of good as it is wi-fi on a Black Hawk router. Also SDHC card can not be used for more ram.
Got this for my sister in law. She loves it. Performs well for a laptop that looks good and is compact [she prefers smaller] especially for the price. Beats netbooks and chromebooks in versatility IMO.<br/>I bought the 13 inch for nearly the same price for another family member, which I personally think is a better deal, but like I said some people will want the smaller form factor.<br/>Highly recommend
This is an awesome laptop...the pictures actually doesn't do it enough justice. When I opened the box which was neatly packaged...I was blown! Easy and user friendly,keyboards are perfect. Windows 8 and can update to Windows 10. I mean what more can anyone want in a brand new laptop? I love the color,it's very attractive to one's eye. Thanks for this and it's actually a gift to my uncle! He would love it!
A little under powered for anything with video content
works great. I use it daily to watch hulu and Netflix.
Does anyone have any issues with the keyboard not working?  Multiple times throughout the day the keyboard will stop working and I have to log out or restart my computer. Other than that I've had no issues. I only use this computer for work because it is easy to carry around, but I am getting sick of having to close my programs and restart my computer when I need to type and the keyboard is not working.
So far so good. I purchased this a month ago, being that it comes with cloud it hasn't taken anymore of my storage on here. It performs well, no fan so you don't get that annoying noise to go with it. Doesn't get hot where the battery is either. for 200.00 its a great buy!! Everything was shipped out and arrived on time. I would buy another one and recommend this to anyone needing a laptop on a budget!!
Cheap, fast, and sturdy. I recommend getting a separate USB mouse (about $10 on amazon for a good one). Great for word processing, excel, powerpoint, browsing the internet, watching youtube, and going on Facebook.<br/><br/>If you want to watch redbox DVDs, get an external DVD reader (about $35 from amazon). It works well. I use a desktop Mac as my main computer, and this is my travel/backup computer.
I purchased this laptop after watching Lon Seidman's review of this product (and subsequent review of this product on here). It is a good laptop for the price. It is a bit slow, but it works well and has great battery life for a cheap, windows laptop. I can get through a full day on one charge. For the rest, I will just defer to Lon's review; if you haven't read it/watch the video, I suggest doing so.
It's a great laptop for the price. It runs Chrome and Office really well. Don't expect to play any games on it order anything really intense. The hard drive is very limited, I wish it was larger. The screen could be better, it's a little dim and has poor viewing angles. The keyboard is top notch though! All in all, it's not a bad laptop, great for people on a budget or anyone looking at a Chromebook.
I almost hate this machine. It is incredibly cute, but I don't know if it's Windows 8.1 or me that makes it work horribly with anything Google. I must find a tutorial or wait for Windows 10 because the screen shifting, not knowing where or if downloads work, and not find the apps that are common on GooglePlay, like the bank, password storage, etc. that makes using this thing a headache every time.
I'm not tech saavy so this won't be one of those reviews. I can say that it gets the job done. I'm a mac person so I'm still trying to figure it all out....but I'm sure I'll get there. Lol. If your looking for something to do simple paperwork, and to do simple work-from-home and need use of the internet, this isn't a bad laptop....I probably would only save documents to a mobile hard drive though.
I couldn't regret more.<br/>My wife has been using this craputer for less than a month and it is already freezing.<br/>Hard drive barely handles de OS. After Windows 10 and office trial version installed C:\ drive has 1.5GB free.<br/>With that amount of free space, and 2GB of ram, you can figure how terrible idea this is.<br/><br/>Another lesson learned - better buy an used mac than a new HP
this laptop is a joke. You have to slam down on the keys for them to work. The mousepad is delayed and desensitized. Takes me double the time to get things done. Thought this would be a good school computer but writing papers takes a noticeable longer  amount of time due to these issues. Was thinking about giving it to me nephew who is 9years old but I don't even think he would have the patience.
The laptop looks very nice on the outside. However the mousepad is difficult to use- not very responsive and doesn't register my clicks sometimes. Furthermore, even browsing the web is comparably slower than my  older HP laptop. When I open up more than four tabs on Firefox, the laptop becomes laggy. I would not recommend. I wish I had bought a Chromebook or at least a refurbished better model.
Thanks to the top rated review on this item, my dad knew everything to do to get this lovely little laptop ready for me to use! It's light weight and so far it's great. I use google docs on it for my school work and I also use it to read my e-textbooks. I can have two windows open side-by-side for easy note-taking while I read the text. Great for a student on the go. Plus, it's a pretty color!
Bought this for my mother as she wanted a laptop for herself for email/web.  Works alright for that limited purpose, but feels sluggish opening applications.  The color is vibrant, which she loves.  I bought a 64GB microSD card to add more storage space which is a must since the OS + common software will pretty much fill the hard drive unless you want to use Microsoft OneDrive for everything.
So far so good for the price. I was a bit reluctant due to the mixed reviews. The track pad did stop working for 1 day, about 4 months after I purchased it. I had to go out and buy a $10 mouse. And I've also purchased an external DVD drive for like $30. Not too bad when added to the price of the PC. The track pad inexplicably began working again and the PC runs smoothly with no other issues.
Great for surfing web, light weight, packaged well, arrived quickly, the only thing is sometimes the mouse sticks a bit, but not bad. Would order again as we like HP computers.  If you don't want it linked to your online login you will have to go to settings and have that part turned off.  Same with any windows 8 product; I'm guessing it will be moving forward.  Fairly easy and no big deal.
So far my daughter loves it. Great size for college.
Great little laptop. It's perfect for managing my finances, checking my email, and browsing the Internet. I was looking for something small, portable and lightweight that could fill in the gap between my desktop PC and my tablet. Windows 8 takes a little getting used to but I'm getting the hang of it. Very pleased with the HP Stream 13 laptop and the super low price made it a great buy.
The down-arrow key in the first one that was delivered is broken.<br/>So I replaced a new one.<br/><br/>The cons I felt personally are as follows:<br/>1. The battery is not removable.<br/>2. The memory of hard disc (SDD) is not exactly 32 G, it is only 21.1 G.<br/>3. Drivers is not newest. You have to update them yourself.<br/>4. Just looking at homepages makes this laptop hot.
Although we were disapppinted that it wasn't a touchscreen, I searched touchscreen laptops this popped but MY fault for not reading the description as it does not specify it is a touchscreen,  my daughter feel in love with it. I am not very savy with the details but love the free software, it starts up fast, isl ight but not cheap feeling and was a quick setup. Color is beautiful also
Had no problems at all and received it in two days!
Should have paid attention. ..Theres no cd/dvd rom.
The only problem that I have had was upgrading to Windows 10 but thanks to other reviews I knew to add some extra memory and the problem was solved.  The machine has worked flawlessly and is performing the function that I purchased it for without any problems.  Just be aware that this is not a gaming machine but it plays back Netflix and other streaming videos without any problems.
I actually purchased this at Walmart for 199.00-- when I saw the price I immediately pulled up amazon reviews and was pleased at all the great reviews so I bought it. Happy to report this is a great little computer. I'm a SAHM and will mainly use it to upload photos of my kids and edit documents for my husband. I just needed something lightweight and dependable and this is perfect!
It's alright.  I needed a laptop for doing photo and video, so at a very basic level this work for that.  I was not used to the format (it's windows based but functions like a chromebook) so my learning curve was a bit high.  I'm giving this a 3 because it reminds me so much of a chromebook (which I also own) and I purchased this so I wouldn't have to deal with the chromebook.
I love love love my laptop. It's so freaking cute!
I bought this for basic use and to be able to use Wix. I was originally going to get a Chromebook, but I read that the Wix building tools don't work on Chrome OS. It isn't the fastest and doesn't have tons of storage, but I don't hoard documents and I use cloud storage anyway. I like that is has a solid state drive and has no fan. Simple and basic, and CHEAP! (in a good way)
pretty sweet package for the price.  Bought it for the girlfriend, windows 7 was the biggest hurdle but shes getting used to the layout of it. Color design of computer is a cool gradient of blue/green. Build quality is solid, it feels like an apple. for the price its a steal for someone who wants windows/office.<br/><br/>otherwise do yourself a solid and buy a chromebook.
Love the fact that this computer is really portable and not heavy weight<br/>And I love this color really well<br/>But I think it needs improvement with battery life<br/>Also love the features it has within it<br/>It's really nice and amazing<br/>Suggest anyone that need a traveling portable laptop with cool features<br/>Should check it out<br/>Because it's amazing
Love everything about this cute little laptop! It's light in weight, the battery life is incredible, and the bright pink is a showstopper! That being said- the only downfall about this laptop is the mousepad, but I knew that before I bought it from reading reviews about it. So I also bought a Microsoft wireless mouse and a laptop sleeve to protect it. Over all I love it!
Nice computer without all the bells and whistles!
excellent .....package nice I just happy with it!
I have to admit I'm impressed at what hp was able to accomplish in a budget laptop but unfortunately win 8 is so awkward in a non touch device I never use it over my tablet/Chromebook. It's too bad Microsoft didn't build windows 8 to recognize the hardware it was on and build the interface accordingly because the desktop half of the experience is fine on this thing.
The mouse pad is ultra sensative which makes navigating a little more difficult.  Connecting to different networks gets frustrating because the side bar disappears and you have to keep starting over.  Otherwise, I like the size, the weight and it definately serves it's purpose of being able to pull out the laptop while I am in my truck and work on something quickly
Laptop is light in weight. Beautiful appearance. Unfortunately, it was never mentioned it was an opened item. I attempted to set up laptop. Next thing i know it is asking me to sign in under a username i myself did not place there. I now am unable to even see what this laptop has to offer to say the least but unable to surpass the username mode.<br/>Very unhappy.
Gave these to my grandkid's..They were thrilled.
Love it love it love it!! It's the perfect size! I have he 13.3 and it's not too big or too small it's perfect! Very light weight! I'm in love with the color. It's very fast and keyboards are perfect to be touch. I also purchased an additional 16GB for additional storage since I ended up with only 8GB remaining. It's Ike I purchased a $600 laptop for only $200!
I purchased this little laptop to replace my old laptop that was solely used to run a few programs my macbook couldn't, and to watch my shows hooked up to my tv via HDMI. As of right now the HP Stream performs all of the above seamlessly. I don't use it solely for school, and will probably not due to lack of storage, however for the money it does perform well.
Update 2; Quickly went from 5 stars to 1. I've had it for around 2 months and it's suddenly having a million issues and shutting down randomly. Seriously pay another 50 or so bucks and get an infinitely better computer. I feel robbed by HP for putting this kind of laptop out.<br/>UPDATE: the review below was when I first got it. Now I've had it for twoish months and it freezes a lot more than I'm okay with even though I'm not doing anything crazy on it...so I'm a little upset with the purchase but we'll see. It seems to freeze when it wants to update.<br/>I've had it for a little over a week and love it. It's quite small and the battery life is great. There is definitely crapware on it but that seems to be the case with most computers. It's perhaps more obvious on this one since it's only 2 GB ram. That being said I found it quite easy to uninstall apps I didn't need and now it works great. Perfect for school.
Very good buy.  Setup was easy.  Keyboard light and responsive. Touchpad good response.  Only drawback with Windows 10 on a small screen is getting brightness and contrast correct for good text and realistic photos.  With time and tips from on line the text problem was fixed by using the internet options to do it myself and dropping auto text from Windows.
If your looking for an affordable and a great quality netbook look no further! I normally don't go out my way to write a review about a product, but i loved this notebook so much I had to. I travel and take online classes, and I'M SO GLAD TO HAVE this netbook. It is very light, The layout is very nice, you can use the desktop version or the tablet version.
Its super fast and functional I love my laptop!
So far so good!  I've had it a bit over a month and it works great.  I seem to like it more every day.  It is a second computer which I use for traveling (very lightweight and fits nicely in a purse) and for my embroidery files (my sewing machine needs a computer hooked up with a USB to get my embroidery designs).  No more lugging my heavy laptop around!
this has to be one of the best cheap laptop's out there. And I am writing this review one the Hp Stream 13. It can play minecraft with low settings. It is fast, responsive, and light. I can lift with one hand with ease. the one done sider is that it has 32 GB. I suggest getting a micro SD card. It is fast on  searching the web. And it runs FULL windows. The computer will say I have 17 hours left when I only have 5 hours left.
I would really like to give this product a 5 star but I can't.  The Laptop I have now loses the connection every time I get on it and until I rebooted it the computer was going so slow.  So I am going to send my back.  But when you get your's try to work with it for a minute.  But the laptop is nice and I like it I am just not completely ok it this one.
Cute, light, and has all functions of a regular sized laptop. I got this so I can have something to play with besides my phone and ai live it. Its fast and sooo cute. I got the leather 12 in case for it and uts so much lighter than my husbands laptop. And the battery life is amazing.
Oh so AWESOME!  I bought this because I needed to access my job's network while I was on family business.  It was an expensive solution to a problem.  I've often wondered about these tablets...so little space.  But to my amazement, its fast and oh so efficient.  Internet connectivity is flawless, its fast, and the big plus was the one year free Office.
I bought one 6 months ago and came back for a blue as a gift for my husband. I'll also be getting another one for my son really soon.<br/><br/>It was super easy to set up and it was able to recognize, and install my printer's software.<br/><br/>The mouse pad and keyboard take some getting use to but it's not that big of a deal.<br/><br/>Great buy
Awesome laptop for the money. I would call it a "best buy" in the small laptop category. I had a Google Chromebook for 3 years, but it eventually died on me. The Stream is much faster and more versatile than a Chromebook and won't set you back more. The only drawback is the lack of space, but it's really meant to be an internet machine anyway.
I just got my HP and I feel in love with the dark blue and light blue stream. This computer is very portable, since it is small and I can take it anywhere. Especially at this price, I was so glad I could something for myself that was handy, and durable for all my courses. Although there is no cd-drive or Ethernet socket, this computer makes up for it.
I love this laptop. The upgrade to Windows 10 went well and it runs so smoothly. I can't believe you can get this nice a computer for such a low price. It runs for 8 hours on battery, it's just amazing. It may not have all the top of the line capabilities but the price point makes it so much fun. My wife got the touch screen version and loves it too.
great size great color gift for mom!
This is a review based on first impressions, and on the use case for which we got the laptop.  I'll update if warranted.<br/><br/>We got this as a secondary laptop for use by a teacher at an elementary charter school.  She will be using it for Internet browsing, email, and working on Word docs.  Possibly Excel docs in the future.  Nothing too demanding.<br/><br/>Once I cleaned off the extraneous junk programs and got Office 365 installed and registered (free for a year), things worked well enough though slowly.  The keyboard is good.  What's left of the 32 GB SSD storage is enough for our purposes, especially if docs get stored in the cloud or on thumb drives or memory cards.  2 GB of memory is a tight limit; you won't do much multitasking.  But for browsing, email, and Word it's good enough.  The cheerful bright blue will fit in nicely at the elementary school.<br/><br/>EXCEPT:  the touchpad is awful.  It simply does not respond properly to clicks and gestures, at least half the time.  We'll use a mouse instead.<br/><br/>Windows 10 is an acquired taste, which we are in the process of acquiring.  At least it's better than Windows 8.  The jury is still out on the Microsoft Edge browser.
For this price, it's hard to complain. It's a great backup/travel computer but it is noticeably slow. I find myself having difficult with the touchpad and the scrolling. But it has good sound and we watch videos on it while in bed.
Good for the price except its ram memory. You always get a message that the program you are using is consuming large amount of memory, even when using only Internet explorer.
It had so many software issues.
Love it
It took me an entire day to get all the bloatware off and to set it up.  The next day my wife checks her Facebook and it screams a warning screen.  I call the 800 # and was told that the computer had a virus.  I quickly set all the manufacturers settings back and shipped it back to the seller.
Great purchase!
The HP Stream actually exceeded expectations.  I had done extensive research and so far, we have experienced none of the heat issues or any other drawbacks mentioned in many of the reviews.  It has turned out to be a very versatile machine.
very good laptop for a child
I love my steam. I wasn't expecting much because of the price, but it does everything I need it to. It's fast, it's lightweight, my favorite color :-) I have a few games on there m the graphics are good and it doesn't run any slower while trying to play. The free Microsoft office is a plus because I'm a college student. I'm very happy with my steam
POS. possibly the worst laptop ever! No storage! I crochet and didn't even have enough space for my patterns, plus forget about working on my webpage. My grandkids can't even play FarmVille or any of their games. Flickers and freezes. My husband won't even use it to surf the web!
Great little computer for working on the road.
A neat little machine just right for a particular need. We have always found HP to be a fine maker of good products and our purchase was made because of their reputation. HP has not let us down  here or otherwise. This product is not made to solve all your computer needs but it is just perfect for us right now. You can't go wrong on this purchase.
take off all the stupid bloat ware and its not too bad! Its no powerhouse but if your surfing the web, streaming, netflix , pandora. facebook.<br/>no problem. it  would be faster if i knew how to remove all the bloatware. got some off but not all. added a 64 gig memory card our daughter uses it for school and studying initially bought it for her.
It works, however f there is an auto update, screen will go black and freeze you out to do download and update...this can take up to 5 or 6 hours, and there is nothing you can do about it, since this does not have a removable power pack you can pull to stop operations.  VERY SLOW on update downloads ,,, for being brand new, has a lot of updates.
The HP stream 13 laptop is amazing. It is fast and it is  great quality laptop that's only 219 dollars. I bought this laptop for my 11 year old daughter she loves it and it helps her with her school work she can also download games on the laptop that she could download on her phone. Overall this is an amazing laptop that I recommend for anyone.
There appears to be a battery heat problem. The underside became too warm and the unit failed. It did not reboot after an update and only two hours of use. The power supply remained cool. This unit performed well until sudden failure. Only the power button light works now and yet the battery  still heats up after shutdown and cool-off....scary!
I love this laptop. It is very affordable and it the quality is very nice. HP is a good brand and I would recommend this laptop. I use it for the internet and using Microsoft office. It is perfect for students. It is great if you're looking for an affordable laptop for simple everyday use. I also love the color, inside and out. It's so pretty!
I purchased this for my 12 year old granddaughter.  She loved the fact that is is blue and she was so excited the first few day.  There is so much unnecessary "stuff" on it.  Pop up ads, etc......that is is almost un-usuable.  Please someone, tell me how to get rid of this "stuff" so that she can enjoy her computer......Help.
Very fast and powerful machine for the price.
Man, I am still getting used to this. It just seems very under-powered, like tablet trying to run Office Suite. And it will update things without warning, to the point where I've had it just suddenly log me off. However, for a lightweight, easy-to-use laptop for regular Internet use and word processing and such, it's a nice little package.
I just have about three weeks with the computer, and to this moment, I'm very pleased with the results. I use for my heavy work an iMac, and wanted to have a computer just for meetings, conferences or presentations, so I didn't needed much really, and I purchased this model. It works great for what I need. I totally recommend this product.
This is a nice, functional, basic laptop with good battery life and is excellent value for money. The free year of Office makes it a no-brainer and makes me wonder why anyone would prefer a similarly-priced Chromebook. My one gripe is with the trackpad which I find to be temperamental. The addition of a cheap USB mouse solved that problem.
This is the best laptop ever, Phyllis.......I recommended to HP Feedback line that the next version to come out really really needs more USB ports, Patricia don't ya know....it has 3 and one HDMI......need more, Sally.......and lastly, for Pete's sake, get the keyboard done with backlit lighting, Theresa, ....2 great ideas, right, Margie?
I loved this computer at first!!! However, after 2 months it went black screen on me & I had to send it in for warranty repair that I had to pay $25 to get repaired. I have since found that this is a pretty common problem with HP computers. If I knew then what I know now, I would have spent a little more on a different brand of computer!
I bought this laptop used and I'm glad to say it's in perfect condition just like new! This laptop is great for college or regular internet usage. It's small and portable and has become a favorite of mine! It has windows 8 which I think it a little tricky to control but other than that if you want a cheap little laptop then this is it!
I liked the laptop much. It has an elegant design, I bought blue. HP seems a good brand and has improved a lot in their processors. Really, I am satisfied with the laptop. There are great and it gives the advantage of lighter weight and easier to transport. Nor is so small to work, it's not uncomfortable. Recommended equipment for me.
Looking for a laptop that is going to be used as a secondary computer, this is the one. It is a windows 8 but has windows 10 update. It works great for school work. You will have to purchase word and office though. You can print also . I highly recommend this computer for young people to adults, even Grandma can navigate this laptop.
I was leery about this purchase, but I was on budget and needed a new laptop and quick.  Best decision ever.  I have since bought the magenta one for my girlfriend.  Navigating on the cloud and setting up the machine the way I wanted it (not a fan of Windows 8) takes some getting used to, but once you get established, smooth sailing.
Compact, fast and easy to use - great price.
Not bad for the price. I use this laptop to occasionally browse the internet when I get tired of using my phone. Bought it for my daughter to do homework on but she has yet to use it. I hate the touch pad, its so sensitive. Things are always popping up if my finger touches a certain spot and it's annoying. Other than that it's fine.
The HP stream 11 laptop is great,it came what I expected but the mouse pad is a little mess up or probably i need to get used to it, but other then that the laptop is fantastic need to add more GB ,it's great on the go especially for a college student that need to finish a paper or a PowerPoint ,or business people with presentation.but the only problem with this product is the speakers. when I hear music I don't get good quality. if I increase the volume it gets worse, especially when I put my earphones I, at first I thought it was my hear phones, but its not.
There is no 3g or sim slot on the laptop which i have received per description of the product. Not sure whether this laptop is original or not. Very much disappointed. Be aware while purchasing it online as the product is not same features what they have mentioned.
Not as durable as I hoped. Its very soft and I can't see it protecting much fron a fall or drop so I kept the styrofoam inside that came with it. It gets dirty rather quickly so I wouldn't get it in a color,  I should've gotten black. Overall just a regular carrier. Something I should've gotb from 5 and below. NOT WORTH 25 DOLLARS!
Unbelievable. I love everything about this laptop. Lightweight. Nice white keyboard. I like Windows 10. I am looking forward to trying Microsoft Office 365. I have always used office starter 2010. I am extremely happy. I received it the next day with Amazon Prime trial membership. I definitely will purchase from Amazon again soon.
I bought this computer because I really needed and I'm not very pleased with it. If your going to invest into a laptop please invest into something that would be worth it. It runs slow, and the mouse pad is hard making it difficult to use. The color is very nice though and it is very lightweight making it easy to carry anywhere.
Much better than a chromebook in my opinion
Shipped quick.. My 13 year old very happy..
I bought it for my 8th grader who LOVES IT!
It's okay. It's a little slow and I'm sure it's because of all the unnecessary apps on it. I'm sure once I get rid of them it should speed up. I plan to get rid of McAfee; never did like it. And I'm not too fond of Office 365 either. Other than that it's okay and I'm sure after I modify it to my liking it will be even better.
Good for everyday use like business stuff: excell, autocad etc. but the cover of the laptop feels a bit cheap and it does not look like its going to last long. Was expecting a bit more from HP but before it cracks, it will serve some time hopefully,,,
Light, thin, compact, fast. Great performance and technology for the price.<br/>Recommended for specs and performance.<br/>Per photos, I expected the blue outside color of the computer in the inside as well.<br/>The inside color though gradually fades from the outside blue color to a light and metallic blue color.
This seems a little slower than our Chromebook that is several years old. The keypad is really sensitive too. I always accidentally touch it and the cursor moves all over the screen. I need to figure out this new Windows, I feel like I'm 100 years old trying to learn how to find different things on the computer. Meh.
I purchased this computer for school thinking 2 GB of RAM would be enough for just using Microsoft office and the the Internet, but it was still not enough to run them at the same time and switch back and forth. Returned after 2 weeks and purchased an HP with 6 GB of RAM that runs perfectly for what I need it for.
Very nice machine.. my wife loved it.. the only "con" would be the small memory (32gb solid state drive).. you need an extra sd memory to be used comfortably as a laptop.. i bought an extra one of 128gb.. that should do it.. other than than is very nice and well built..NO TOUCH SCREEN... but i already knew
The wireless adapter is not found by Windows, only bluetooth shows up. Other reviews mention that their wireless adapter failed after some time, or just received a weak signal in general. It's a pretty cheap laptop, so I recommend spending the extra money to buy USB wireless dongle, if you can spare one USB port.
We bought these in each color for our kids for homeschooling. They are used mainly for the internet and documents. No gaming, so I can't rate that. So far, they're holding up as expected (we love HP) and work great without any problems. I expect these to last a long time. I'll update as they get more use, though.
I so love this, now I can sit in the comfort of my bed and do my homework for my classes. I have a desktop PC but lately it has been uncomfortable sitting for long periods of time, lower back issues. But this 13 in' laptop is so perfect. It's not too big in size, or heavy in weight, and the color is just lovely.
I love it, easy to po...I mean videos on!
Very slow looks nice but does not perform
The hp stream11 laptop is great best ever
Love it, just what I expected and needed.
I bought this for my kids use for school & work mostly, and it gets the job done with ease. The material feels nice. The keyboard is responsive, and the screen is wonderful. I've used google chrome so I don't have any complaints about the software. The battery is pretty great as well, this product is fantastic that I had to buy it again lol
Junk. It arrived with one of the function keys already fallen off and rattling around in the box. Upon booting up, it immediately began a long update process which ended up bricking it. Couldn't even do a system wipe/reset from the recovery partition. Amazon's return process was simple and hassle-free however!
Expected for category (netbook/laptop): 8.1 OS (still can upgrade); no touchscreen; limited disc (solid state); slower than usual laptop.<br/>Also, the trackpad requires the thumb strength of Larry Graham doing slapbass to engage the padbased mouse clicks.  So, in general, this category can't get above 3.<br/><br/>For this category: 5<br/>Fantastic value.  Better value than even Chromebooks.<br/><br/>On balance. 4
Best laptop ever! I got the 13.3 inch once, and I couldt be happier! Upgraded from an 11.6 inch Acer Chromebook so Im not looking to fill it up with junk and slow it down, mainly use chrome browser and itunes, thats it! Fast, touch pad is fine, you just gotta get used  to it, and it comes with a $25 giftcard!
Laptop functions OK.  The trackpad is godawful, lots of ghost clicks and a tad bit awkward.  Battery is completely dead after 8 months use.  Talked to HP support and they are actually going to make me pay for the shipping for their defective product, they even tried to "Upsell" me on faster shipping.
Great Lap Top. I am writing this review on my new HP Stream. It has an Android meets desktop feel to it. Works quickly. Doesn't lag or glitch. Color is a little different form photo. Very light blue that fades to darker blue under mouse pad and key board. Bought the magenta one for my wife who also loves it.
This computer is super awesome!! I work in customer service at a large company  from home so I needed a really efficient computer. I previously was doing my work on my all in one HP but got tired of being locked down in one place. This computer is super cute and is able to handle my work needs! A great buy!
This computer isn't a powerhouse by any means but for the $217 that I paid I couldn't be happier with it. The SSD allows for a 10-second boot even though it's only 32GB. HP compensates for that with a TB of cloud storage. Very light weight yet solid and sturdy. The nearly 8 hour battery life is a big plus!
I have owned two hps before that ran well, but this machine leaves a bad impression. in less than a month. all of a sudden the wi-fi stopped working.  now in the (hassle) process of trying to get it fixed. i guess i learned my lesson not to buy such an inexpensive machine.  you truly get what you pay for.
Got this for my seventysomething parents who didn't need a lot of bells and whistles. It has a big-enough 32GB solid-state drive, so it boots up fast. With 2GB of memory and a Celeron processor, this laptop isn't for serious gaming or video editing, but it's perfect for email, going online and using Word.
Great computer for what I needed it for,
Good quality. Fast retrieval in internet
A little slow if you are used to even a mid level laptop but it works good for a travel computer which is why I bought it. Nice and light in my back pack. I do not use 365 or the cloud storage just for checking my travel maps, emails and making hotel reservations while on the road. Wish it had Windows 7.
It is so beautiful, small and very light. I can carry this everywhere with absolutely no hassle! It works amazing, although I'm not a huge fan of the new windows update. I strongly recommend this laptop for those who are under a budget, especially for college students who need a laptop for school work.
Very nifty little PC.  I got it for my 6 year old, and she loved it... up until I upgraded it to Windows 10.  We will be going back to the original O.S., because it was much more kid-friendly.  As for the PC itself, it does what we want, has decent speed, and the expandable memory card slot is awesom.
Got delivered safely and quickly. This computer only had one problem. The speakers are very poorly. I can't listen to music or play a movie because speakers start to make a static noise. Not a big deal for me but still. DNT like it but needed it for work so whatever. Nice and cheap but has it's flaws.<br/><br/>UPDATE!<br/><br/>I had to return this laptop because the mouse pad stopped working. I was able to get a refund and I reordered this laptop hopping it was just a defected one. I know have the second one and it keeps shut down. Screen turns completely black for a few seconds and I have to relogin all over again. I'm very fustrated  and I don't understand what's wrong with these laptops. I've seen in other retail stores, it's sold at $99 and $119. The must not be working correctly for them to sell it soooo cheap. I will not be buying the same one again after two times.
Bought this to replace a special friends old busted laptop for his birthday. Works great, slim, and easy to carry. Since he is in the military, it helps him get all his paperwork done too. As well as his college work. Looking forward to buying him some accessories! Thanks HP for another great product
a perfect laptop for anyone on the go! It boots up in less than 10 seconds and requires no "maintenance" like Windows laptops do. The keys and lettering are large, making it especially great for the older generation or those with less than perfect vision. It's an all around amazing invention!
I've had my hp stream for 5 months and it has been great so far. Easy to carry around and I get lots of complements. It doesn't have alot of storage room, and when you download too much it starts to slow down. The one drive helps with that and it would be smart to buy a personal removable hard drive.
Ordered for my daughter's online tutoring.  It's perfect.  Smaller size makes it easily portable.  Only issue we have is that we can't get DVD movies to play on it with an external DVD reader.  It will load software from the external drive, but not play movies.  Haven't been able to figure out why?
Overall it's a good laptop, but the storage capacity is too small, even for a net book. The color combinations are perfect, white key pad make it look sophisticated. Its very functional, the size just great, not too small and not to big, easy to carry even though it's little bit heavy for its size.
This does everything I wanted it to do.
I bought this for my mom. She loves it!
I love my little HP laptop. My previous one was too big and bulky, although the touch screen was great and the picture was amazing. The Stream 13 is smaller and easier to carry around, and I got a mouse to use with it, so it is as convenient as a touchscreen. It does everything that I want it to.
Love this laptop. It is just the tool for my internet needs. Definitely get an SD card to expand the memory. The apps will eat it up quickly.<br/>It was easy to set up and I was able to get it in my favorite color.<br/>The size is perfect. Bigger than a tablet smaller than a full size laptop.
Bought it for my parents.They love it. It's much faster than conventional netbooks and Win 8.1 allows you to get a lot more out of it (compared to traditional chromebooks). Added a 128GB micro SD card for additional storage to supplement the 32GB internal SSD. Works perfectly! Highly recommend.
Everything is fine for $200 dollars. The only bad thing is the memory, you MUST buy an external memory when buying this laptop. I updated my laptop to windows 10 and I was left with 2 GB of memory. But the rest is ok.<br/>PS: some people complain about the touchpad but it's pretty good for me
What is it?  What is it not?<br/><br/>Let's start with what it's not.  This is not a gaming PC.  Sure, you can probably play browser-based games on it.  You can probably play Facebook games on it, if that's what you're into.  It's not suitable for other types of games, for four reasons.  1. The CPU is underpowered. 2. It only has 2 GB of RAM.  3. It's only got 32 GB of hard drive space, and a big chunk of that is used by Windows and the recovery partition.  4. The graphics card is just too weak to play games.<br/><br/>It's not a workhorse.  It's not a desktop replacement.  It's not for serious number-crunching.  It's not for Photoshop.  It's not for video editing.  It is not a good place to store photos, or music.  iTunes will fill the hard drive if you have more than just a few songs, and you can forget movies and TV.<br/><br/>So, with all the things it can't do, what is it?<br/><br/>It's a great computer for browsing the web.  It's a great computer for running (the included) Office 365.  It's perfect for streaming Netflix, or Amazon movies and TV.  The HDMI port will allow you to connect it to a TV, and while I haven't test it, I'm sure it works well.  The keyboard is not bad at all.  You could type on this thing for a few hours, and it would be fine.  It's a little smaller than a full-sized keyboard, but it only took my about 30 seconds to get to full speed.  (If you switch keyboards often, you know what I mean.)  It's got a webcam for Skype or Google Hangouts, or your favorite video chat app.  It's got a USB3.0 and a USB2.0 port, and a full-sized SD card slot, all of which mean you can expand your available storage, if you need to.  It's got enough horsepower to run a VPN connection, if you need to login to work, etc.<br/><br/>It comes with $25 in Microsoft App Store credit, and a full year of Office365.  You'll have to pay for Office365 every year if you want to keep it, but you can at least try it.  I don't use Office, but I installed it to test it.  Runs great if you run one app at a time.<br/><br/>What else is it?  It's cheap for a full-function laptop.  It's lightweight.  It seems durable enough to be tossed into a backpack.  It's not so expensive that I'm going to cry if it gets stolen or damaged.  And, it does the things I need a laptop to do.  I can write on it.  I can run Chrome.  I can stream a movie.  And that's all I need from it.  It does all of that really, really well.
Five stars for value, three stars for performance.  It's remarkable what a couple of hundred dollars can buy these days:  here, it gets you a nice-looking, well-built, and reasonably functional intro-level Windows machine for students or home users who need to run basic internet, MS Office apps and normal social media/communications programs with a minimum of fuss.  Build quality is good, with minimal creaking and flexing, and the keyboard and touchpad are pretty good.  Overall weight and balance are comfortable.  In short, I think this is a very serious high-value computer for use by young students (especially if you want to give them a machine that doesn't encourage excessive gaming), and as a secondary machine for home or light home-office users.<br/><br/>All this said, this isn't a miracle product, and you need to have realistic expectations.  Processor speed is limited by modern standards (especially multi-core) and graphics power is very limited.  Don't plan on using this for gaming!  In my experience, even relatively nontaxing games like Minecraft push this hardware to its limits.  E.g., Minecraft Pocket Edition runs MUCH more smoothly on a $179 tablet than full Minecraft runs on this computer.  Also, the screen isn't top-notch:  it looks "fine" in actual use, especially for the intended Office, email and internet apps this machine was designed to run.  However, its color, contrast and brightness will suffer when viewed head-to-head with better notebook computers or modern tablets: the screen looks best head-on, and if you move your head left/right or up/down the screen shows color shifting and brightness dropoff much more quickly than better screens.  But as I said, this is being kind of picky: the screen is just fine for intended uses.
When I received my HP stream I was amazed at the quality of the product. I am still using it today. My friend was looking for one so I ordered him one in blue. I would advise anyone to shop on Amazon.com for a laptop or anything that they need. I would recommend this product to anyone to use.
It's good if you are browsing the internet and checking emails. Not for gaming or for alot of programs. When I got this, I had a lot of space. Then it updated and now I have only 3GB left. It took all of my space! So I can't hold too many photos and I can't even have iTunes to transfer music.
This was the perfect laptop to introduce my daughter to technology. I was able to set up a child account to keep tabs on her- I always supervise my kids, but there are times when the phone rings or one has to go to the kitchen, and kids can be sneaky (my kids are great kids, but not saints!!)
Better than a chromebook, by far.  Comes with Microsoft Office....key downfall of the Chromebook series.<br/>My children need office programs for school assignments, as the google platform is not always feasible for school assignments.  My 9 & 7 years olds operate the system with no issues.
Like another reviewer wrote, it is just ok and The track pad is very low quality. Buy a mouse.<br/>Otherwise, it's a nice little lightweight computer for the price.<br/>I will be exchanging mine though, it has a default in the screen display that makes it look like someone keyed the screen
Pros:<br/>- very fast in booting<br/>- very responsive and fast after removing some software that was installed<br/>- wonderful color !<br/>- very light weight<br/>Cons (they are already described in the product details)<br/>- low ssd storage capacity. Windows 8 takes most of it<br/>-
Only had had this for a week and only used it a few times and it won't turn on. I've tried charging it over night, tried different outlets but it will not turn back on. It was amazing while it lasted but very disappointed. This will be the last HP product I buy I've had no good experiences.
Bought this for my daughter as it was pink and seemed to have enough features so she could play games. Took over an hour to do the setup and then even more time for the upgrade to Windows 10.<br/><br/>Shutting Down takes 30 minutes. Very frustrating and I cannot find out why this happens.
i  got tbis in march and it worked great for 5  months. i have anti virus  protection and ran full scans weekly. a few dags ago i was looking for amovie to watch on netflix and out of no wbere i get the windows face of death. its useless i cant even turn it on. it on.  1 star cuz i have to.
Decent laptop. Hard to see screen from any angle except straight on, and despite getting rid of bloatware, still stutters when streaming video. I find myself not using it for more than internet browsing. Also, the mouse pad is complete crap. Get a nice wireless mouse and you'll be happier. Also, just got a notice about 'low memory' and the laptop barely functions. Piece of crap.
My daughter its very please with her new hp laptop she loves the color everything even the video & camera its really good because it captures everything very clearly im very please also with the price cause in other places its more expensive so im very happy with the purchased...!!!😜😏😝
This computer is working great, but I went from a 22" desk top screen to the 13" laptop.  Kind of wish I had gone for the 15".  But it is doing everything I ask of it and I'm happy.  For the price it was a good deal.  My desk top was an HP and I am comfortable with this brand.
I bought the 13.3 inch two months ago and it's been giving me problems ever since! I have problems accessing the Internet, it blanks out and shows a black screen and the Windows system takes almost the whole system. I would not recommend it as a good buy because I'm now $250 in the hole.
Bought the signature version without all the extras and I love it! small easy to travel with, does everything I need it to do.  Plus it came with 1year of 365, and a giftcard, which all basically paid for itself, you can't lose when you only spend $200! can't wait to check out windows 10
This laptop is perfect for my editing and book needs. It's the first one I've ever seen with a glare-free screen. This means I can work out on the deck in the bright sunshine, instead of being cooped up inside all summer. The kids won't have to wait for me to watch them in the pool. Win!
I find the battery life is not as long as I expected.  It will often cut off without warning losing important procedures and test.  I got this laptop to help with my college classes but have trouble navigating the curser to keep up with my professors.  Sorry not very happy for the price.
It met my expectations and then some! I bought this for my husband for his Valentine's gift and he is really enjoying it. He has a HP 17.3 laptop but really likes the size and weight of the Stream 11, so easy to take with him when he goes out. Thanks for a great deal on a great product.
The computer is compact and easy to use.  I only wish that it had come installed with Windows 10.  There is not enough disk space if you happen to install Outlook 365 before you install the Windows 10 update.  A simple brochure outlining this glitch would make the computer much better.
I bought this baby because my old laptop was going slow as a turtle. At first it didn't seem faster at all. But after a few updates it is performing much better. Considering the costs it is a pretty good buy. I only use it for checking email and visiting a few sites. Gets the job done.
Amazing little machine.<br/><br/>I was worried that the screen size might be too small for me to work or view media comfortably, but it doesn't take long to get comfortable with the dimensions. It doesn't feel small at all; it fits the compact feeling of the entire device. The machine itself has a mostly plastic casing which I thought would feel cheap but feels surprisingly light and makes the computer very portable and comfortable to move around with.<br/><br/>Windows 8.1 Bing edition is alright. Like most consumers, I prefer Win7, however I have had a few years to get used to it so working with Win8 is natural to me now so it's easy to navigate this computer. It comes with a little bloatware which is simple enough to remove, but ultimately the system runs great. Fanless is a god-sent. My old PC was so loud my skype partners said it sounded like a airplane taking off. Heavy use doesn't even leave the computer hot. My old HP PC got unbelievably hot with intense use. It could honestly burn a person.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the keyboard. Obviously, a thin computer can't have much travel, but the keys feel a bit too mushy for my taste. The space bar in particular has me missing presses every other paragraph. It's probably something I'll adapt to, but for now it remains an annoyance.<br/><br/>This computer is literally perfect for students. It's about as portable and simple to use as they come. For those who aren't prepared to make the leap to Chromebooks because they live offline or need more programs, but still want a compact PC with a lot of punch, this computer is about as good and easy as they come.
Perfect for 100% online grad school!
Works great met all my expectations.
Very nice product!!! 100% recomended
Bought this for my parents as a gift since they wanted a laptop just for browsing the internet, boots super fast, works as expected for the processor and amount of ram. It was cheap and works great, I love the finish on it, it feels super sturdy even if it were to be dropped.
Having a few problems with Google Chrome and it's Shockwave right out of the box but the rest of the computer is pretty speedy and great. feels good in your hands. Good buy for the price. I recommend to anyone just looking for a laptop for casual social networking or school .
Not satisfied with my purchase.I bought this item as a gift and after only 3 months it was unusable and needing repair. Had to pay additional money to send notebook in to manufacturer. Never experienced this problem before. Don't think I'll buy electronics from Amazon again.
Good computer so far. Screen resolution is fair. No problems on the Internet or playing a few online games. Great for social networking, checking out the net. Good for a student or anyone but might not be enough for a business person. I like it and it is great for the money.
Pretty good for $ 200. Updated to Windows 10 and works nicely. Actually wakes up from sleep in few seconds. Still cant beat my Chromebook but much much better than earlier Windows PCs. Screen is very good for $ 200 device. Going to try Adobe Light room and will update soon.
I have had a lot of problems with this computer.  I knew that it would be small, but I was hoping it would be small and powerful.  Instead, it freezes so often and it is nearly impossible to stream live TV on this thing.  It is affordable because it has so many limitations.
Great product for more than just the price.  Easy set up- just plug and play.  Microsoft Office included.  Much better than a tablet for the usage ease and price.  If you need a lite weight Windows based laptop in place of an actual bulky laptop this is the product for you
Small and portable, could be even more lightweight.  I found a matching portable wireless mouse by Logitech.  Good enough for travel (it's inexpensive so not as much worries of getting stolen while on trip).  I will wait till Windows 10 is released before my next upgrade.
It's quick.  It's light.  It runs Windows.  Screen is very nice, keyboard is OK, sound is very good.  It's instant-on.  It has a micro-SD slot. It comes with $25 gift card to microsoft.com. Chromebook killer.
Nice laptop for the price. Bad news is the second night my daughter was using it something called crossbrowse got installed and now it's basically unusable, jam packed with adware and malware. Never happened on our macs, guess I'll just install ubuntu when time permits.<br/><br/>Update: Took a while, but was able to uninstall everything and upgrade to windows 10. Works great now! I also had to uninstall chrome... It used too much cpu/memory. Pleasantly surprised with MS Edge.
nice small computer,my son loves it
great speed and size for the price.
I ordered it it came. I was happy!!
I didn't receive the laptop that was advertised. It said it had a fingerprint reader for security, it does not. It is a good quality laptop, better for high school or college, but would not recommend for work. I needed a secured system and this is not what I expected.
Okay, here's the problem, I bought two of these and one worked great with no problems and the other died after 2 months, when I called AMAZON for help, they referred me to the company who made it. LET ME REPEAT THIS; AMAZON DID NOT HELP ME WHATSOEVER, AND I WAS VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED WITH THEM, that's when you know a company has gotten too big for its britches, its stops caring. It's ironic because that's exactly the reason I stopped using EBAY and only use AMAZON, well when the NEXT "AMAZON" comes out, I will seriously be looking at them. When I called the company, I was talking to someone in India, with a very think accent that I could not understand, After talking to him for 15 minutes, he transferred me to another debt, and they were unable to help me as well. I was going to have to find a repair shop in my area and turn in it for them to ship to the manufacturer. There were none in my city and I wouldn't even find one in the state. I called Best Buy but even thou they sold the same model they would not look at it without charging me money. It was a $199 Computer, and it would have cost me more to fix than to buy a new one -which is what I did. And not that model and not thru Amazon.
This is an amazing little laptop. I bought a cd reader and was able to install my Microsoft office stuff for school. It's battery is amazing, lasts almost all day. I just don't like the built in mouse, too hard to click fast. Overall a good buy and it's worth it! :)
I was really impressed with the speed in which I got the computer and was impressed how well it was packaged. My son was thrilled to get this for his birthday. It has a great battery life and it came with microsoft office which is super helpful with his school work.
Great!!!<br/>Only bad thing about it is the processor can't handle video games that well.<br/>Excellent school computer.<br/>Fast boot time dude to SSD.<br/>Good specs.<br/>Rather lightweight and durable.<br/>Not a lot of RAM but I suppose you could add more..
Hard to get used to the mouse pad and keyboard at first, but really convenient set up. Also hard to get used to the new Windows 8 layout. Not a lot of hard disk space, but great for browsing the internet and checking email while traveling! Great battery life so far.
I was expecting a pretty, purple color. When it arrived it was like a hot pink that is extremely bright. I was a little bummed because I'm not a big pink person so I'm getting a skin to cover most of it.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Not purple like the picture, hot pink.
Bought this laptop for my mother...she absolutely loves it because she can carry it anywhere without breaking her back or straining her shoulder. It is beautiful and functional and has everything she needs without the heavy weight. Now, we will be able to SKYPE. :0)
I love this soo much, this is my first computer with windows 8 and its great. The color is very beautiful and eyecatching, the texture is so sleek.I absolutely adore it. The only downside is the storage capacity, I probably uninstalled some programs I shouldnt have.
A perfectly fine laptop if not for the bloatware. Like the top review, I had to purge this notebook before using it, and it has run perfectly well ever since. If only manufacturers caught up with the idea that sometimes, we don't need their apps, it would be great.
For the money, it's unbeatable.  Bought mine directly from Microsoft and it has none of the bloatware that others report on.  It is quick, simple and an easy-to-love internet centric machine.  I bought two (his and hers) and would do it again in a New York minute.  We've been using the pair for half a year with absolutely no glitches.  I cannot recommend this computer highly enough at the current price point.  It does a fantastic job as an Internet appliance, and I actually use it for more "heavy lifting" with Excel and Word bundled with it.  I will re-subscribe when the renewal comes up for Office 365.  It's powerful, and for value received, it's an honest value.  I think these "light" computers are the future of personal computing.  n.b. I bought a micro-sd card to give me more storage, and scarcely use it.  My big, heavy uber-reliable Lenovo gets used for some heavy work (cleaning up digital audio and editing digital video, but for everyday computing, I'm glad to put the mileage on the easier-to-lift and easier-to-replace (financially) HP Stream.
My husband and I use this computer to surf the internet, check email, pay bills and keep track of our monthly expenses.  It works extremely well.  I am very pleased with it.  Keep it mind that it does not have a CD drive.  But for the money, it is very functional.
My kids absolutely loves them. Perfect size, weight and price. We put in a 16 g card for them to store on and not slow down the computer.  I'm  sure we'll have to get a 64 g, but for right not the 16 g works. Oh, of course it looks cool!  I recommend this product.
I am very happy with this product.  It's lightweight and compact. Very easy to carry on my bag. Everyone loves the pink colour.  Most importantly,  it works great. As stated, I have Microsoft 365.I use it to work on my PhD thesis on the go.  I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS.
Love! Just what I was looking for!
Very good laptop and works quickly
This is a good deal for the money.
I love this laptop. It's so cute, and works very well. It's fast, light, and beautiful. Windows 10 is wonderful, and so is the free 1 year Microsoft subscription. The only downside is that there is no disk drive, but I can always buy an external one if needed.
I got this for my girlfriend, she loves it. It's perfect for school because of how slim it is. The battery life is great and it feels extremely well made. Plus it comes with 1 year of office and 25$ credit for the App Store, which is a nice little extra bonus.
Very happy with this laptop.  I use it for writing, so included Office 365 is perfect, and it is very thin and light.  Keyboard has a great feel.  Screen is terrific for my needs, which are admittedly not that extensive.  So far my favorite purchase this year.
So far so good. Bought for my daughter as a birthday gift- it does not have the disc player so bought an external one. Not sure if it is the computer or the player, but the disc driver does not want to install. Otherwise, awesome little machine for the price!
it is good product I like the color but the only problem is office is only in internet if you not intenet the computer not work , it is very good product but they should add the office program in it
I bought this laptop about a year ago! I absolutely love it! It's small and light so it's easy to carry around everywhere! I don't have a tablet so this is perfect! I mainly use it for streaming movies and it works great! I would recommend anyone to buy it!
I bought the Stream 11 a few days ago, and so far, I really like the little machine. Our home is rife with devices, Moto x 2013, S4, Nexus 10, and the home-built gaming PC. I felt that we had room in our lineup for a low powered laptop, for web  browsing, and some light productivity. I feel that the Stream 11 excels in both categories for us. Its light, the battery lasts all day for me, and I can still play some low spec steam games on it with no problems. The keyboard is great, and I really enjoy the throw of the keys. I have fairly large hands, and I have ha no problem with the keyboard at all. The only caveat I've had so far is the trackpad, with some swipes and gestures not registering as quickly or efficiently as I had hoped, but its not as big of an issue as one would imagine, and it may just be that I need to get used to the pad a bit. Overall for 200$ its a great device, and I'm positive that its going to be a must have for people that are choosing between this and a Chromebook, It was for me. The cost was spot on for our budget, and the fact that I can use standard windows software with it was a deal maker for me vs a Chromebook.
Nice basic computer for basic functions such as surfing the web and email access. Maybe good on the go or to take notes in class. After you uninstall all the preloaded junk it turns out to be a decent computer. Installed office 2015 and it works just fine.
If your looking for a cheap gaming rig this is not it,but it's perfect for my wife.She mostly uses for web surfing and streaming movies.Battery life is insane.She used unplugged literally all day and there was still 30% charge left at the end of the night.
I bought this rebuilt computer in March. It has several  issues:<br/>Touchpad seems to misread screen ratio. (I'm not a techie, so kindly forgive the lay terms); Hidden icons at both edges of screen (such as clock and settings icons)  unnecessarily follow cursor movement, constantly pulling edges of screen toward the screen's center. It is as if I am placing the cursor at screen's edge, but this actually happens with cursor in the middle of the screen. I can move the cursor slowly, yet it still happens.  I do not use a mouse, preferring a touchpad since I take this laptop with me everywhere, and streamlined portability is important.<br/><br/>It also has "frozen up" several times while viewing videos, opened to blank admin message pages while online, and, a couple of days ago, stopped opening videos, and then files entirely. I had to reset it to factory default.<br/><br/>I keep a consistent eye on the memory, and have not come close to using it.<br/>On the positive end, it is very lightweight, and I appreciate the long battery life. The HP help apps are friendly, but although I adjust the settings, I cannot seem to remedy these issues.  .  It is still a sweet little computer, but I am stymied as to how to make it work consistently and without all the interruptions.<br/><br/>That said, a long phonecall with the tech department was met with "well, ma'am, that is just how the operating system works. It is what the people demand.".<br/>Hm. Not sure what to think.

Bought this as a gift for my husband's birthday and he says it's a really good little computer.  So much so, that he is buying me one for my birthday, the pink one!!  Just a good basic laptop, runs well and just the right size for what we will do on them.
So much better than a chromebook!
Great laptop! Everything I need for college in the Fall. I ordered it thinking it was the 13.3 but when I got it I was only dissapointed because it didn't have a DVD drive, but that's my fault. Aside from having to buy a external DVD drive, it's perfect!
Like all of the reviews state really, touch pad is well.... Touchy, get a mouse and voila! Problem solved. Great laptop for the price, fun color and great resolution. Doesn't have a cd-rom which I knew before I bought it but would have been nice to have.
The computer is great came on time,however the $25 gift card that was suppose to be in there wasn't, and amazon gives me a $25 gift card to amazon that only counts toward certain things, and that's not even what I I wanted, but other than that very happy
I love HP products and I love the price on this.  It's great for surfing the internet and reading emails.  not very powerful; really slow downloading files.  took forever to open a powerpoint file.  It's light and small - very convenient to take with you.
Came on time for delivery.  But the shape the shipping box was in when it got to my house horrendous. Luckily my pic was in a separate box from home with proper foam around it or it would be history. Other than that great little computer! Worth the mone
Love this laptop. It is nice and slim and not heavy like some lap tops. I would have liked more of a hard drive space though. I use an external one. When I updated to Windows 10, I had to use an external hard drive because of not enough space to update.
This laptop works very well, I purchased this one to Amazon but it wasn't new, camed with a user already registered, I had to format the laptop because I didn't know which was the password. I didn't return the laptop because I needed for a presentation.
I bought this for my 6 year old and it is perfect for her.  This is a great laptop for kids or for anyone that will not be downloading a ton of stuff.  I bought the 2GB size but other than that, it is a great laptop!  I completely recommend this laptop.
So far I'm loving my new computer!!! Its super light and works fast! The color is even better than what is shown in the picture. the keyboard is a gradient pink, going from light pink to purple! This computer is great and exactly what i need for school!
For the money; in the basement to check emails and surf the web, it can't be beat.  But, nobody told us that the 32GB SSD is too small for Windows 10.  Yes, you could load a ICO on a thumb drive but it just isn't worth it.  So we have to stay on Win8.1
my 13 yo uses it for school & entertainment purpose. we have had it a month now and no issues . long battery life no space issues yet although we did get him external drive for additional stuff...he hasn'tused it yet though. would definitely recommend.
When i got my laptop it was very easy to set up .It did not take long and I was able to use it in like 15 mins of opening the box .I don't get why people say the touch pad is horrible I find it to work just fine . It is perfect for what Im using it for

I bought this purely for school use. The type pad and screen are a little smaller than I prefer and the touch pad not quite as sensitive as I would like. No place for a disc. It is great for what I use it for and I would buy it again for this purpose.
Love this computer!  Looks great and perfect size for my simple needs. This is really a no frills computer, so if you're looking for serious use look elsewhere, but for Internet access and some light office/app use this is great and outstanding price.
I love love love my new computer! All I need mine for is to surf the web, make minor photo edits and create document. And it works perfectly! I haven't had any troubles and I get tons of compliments on how darn cute it is! And the price was excellent!
I'm a college student and don't have much money and at such a low price this laptop is perfect. It is fast and works great and it's also so cute with it's pretty colors. All my friends are jealous and compliment me on how pretty and cool my laptop is
Bought it for the wife, she was ecstatic, I'm actually somewhat of a power user, so I was ready to delete bloatware and tidy it up after we received it but it was already clean and ready to rock from the moment she turned it on. Great little computer
Really slow and glitchy upon arrival. The track pad was also super unresponsive as mentioned in other reviews. I really only wanted this laptop for web-surfing, netflix-binging, and skyping. It couldn't even manage that, so I returned it immediately.
The computer is inexpensive which I realized however the mouse pad is so unresponsive and poorly designed it makes the entire computer frustratingly unusable. It is inconceivable why a company would produce a low end product that is so dysfunctional.
I like the looks of it and all, but the min. I turned it on, I started getting all kinds of pop ups and virus warnings. I dont know what to do?  I'd like to keep it, but not like this....too much trouble, and no warning as to the problems that arise.
Great Notebook Laptop for the price! Great for someone who is a student or businessman who simply need to use it for Microsoft office, Netflix, steam music, and other simple things! Bought it on Cyber Monday so it was well worth the price I paid for!
I love this laptop. Its lightweight and small so it makes it easy to carry and store anywhere. The graphics are very clear and connection speed is fast. I would recommend this for anyone who needs a laptop that's portable and easy to take on the go.
Very good laptop for kids. Good wifi reception, very good keyboard for the size, enough fast to run web applications and some installed programs. Limited on disk space, but not big issue with the online applications that today exists on the web.
I bought this as a secondary laptop to fulfill orders in a warehouse situation. While the price is great, the screen is not as bright as I like it to be, even at max brightness. I have to tilt the screen a certain way to get maximum brightness.
This does the job and my daughter seems to like it.  It was a graduation gift so we just started using it but no problems starting up.  I looks brand new and came well packaged.  I would recommed others to buy form this seller and this product.
I'm still wondering why this laptop got so many flowery reviews, which encouraged me to make my purchase. Its very slow, the track pad is not good and the display quality was below average and its not like I was expecting it to be high quality.
I do not like particularly this laptop but matches perfectly my needs. The technical characteristics of this product are very well described and many info are available on line. What you receive is exactly what you expect. Good value for money.
This is a great laptop! Lightweight, long battery life, sturdy, built in camera, thumb drive, etc.<br/>Potential problems for others:<br/>1. Screen has a lower quality so it looks a bit grainy sometimes.<br/>2. No disc area to insert a DVD.
Nice machine but had a lot of trouble getting my bluetooth mouse to work properly. Kept cutting out after a short time of working properly. Turns out  it was a bluetooth setting that came already on the machine. Took me hours to track it down.
So far so good. I love the lightness and color. The double clicking and copying is kind of tricky intially, but other than that. I am quite pleased with my purchase. I needed something with Microsoft Office that was portable. This was perfect.
This is great for surfing the web and facebook and emailing, I generally like the machine and continue to find things it can do. I am not computer literate, so if I do need help I call my son in law!! This would be great for a student also!!
Built in wireless adapter sucks. I can get a perfect wifi signal on my iPad and open up this laptop and it won't even connect. Not worth it unless you install repeaters throughout the house, just buy something with a better wireless adapter.
I sent this to my 6 yr. old grand daughter. She loves it . I am a desk top guy . But if I decide to do some traveling ,I think I will get one for myself .Computers can not get more powerful, Only smaller , .And this is the size of a pad.
Had the laptop for a couple months now. Still trying to figure it out. The biggest problem I have at this point is with the keys and how they feel. It's hard for me to type on it. My 15 year old daughter doesn't have any problems though.
Just an incredible value. We are very pleased with it for a web-only, work from home laptop for Citrix. The bloat ware isn't taking up much HD space at all. Quiet and Cool Running, feels solid, looks great, but has a very average screen.
It's very lightweight and a beautiful design cosmetically! The only downfall is the storage space... I've had it for two weeks and already need storage. I only use it for school work as I am in college. Very good economic choice though.
Bought this for my daughter but I am using it more than she is!  Very responsive.  Not sure how long keys will stay white but for 4 months not looking too dingy.  Light weight and does not overheat as quickly as conventional hard drive.
I love this laptop! My only complaint would be that it doesnt have a ton of memory, but I bought a memory card.So problem easily solved. I am in college so I use it daily, miscrosoft office is free for the first year which is amazing.
Too weak to do much of anything useful - just painful to use.  Not really able to do a good job with Skype, which was the main thing I hoped to use it for.  Bad display, horribly slow, bad camera.<br/><br/>OK Keyboard, light weight.
So far have to give it a 3/5, its a great little computer but have been have major issues with it so far.  The biggest one being that sometimes when I try and log on it will just get stuck in loading and will never actually log me on.
i love this lab top but i would have love to have about 4gb of memory or higher and the hard drive space is really sad i put 5 programs on this lab top and there is no more space for me to do anything i want.but it is a great lab top.
So far so good. The McAfee antivirus let in 19 pieces of malware that I used webroot to get rid of. Runs as one would expect. Using to browse web for pharmacy purchasing. Had to have IE for one vendor or would have used a chrome book.
This computer is great. It has everything I need, including a wonderful office subscription and lightning-fast processor. It runs smoothly even on my university's normally slow Wi-Fi. I would buy it again if I ever needed another one.
This is a really nice small laptop.  I am impressed with its features and ease of use.  I have recommended it to my granddaughter who has already bought one with her Christmas money.  Only caveat is to get an optical mouse to go with.
Do not buy this  if you are looking for function.  It claims to be upgrade-ready for Windows 10.  I added nothing and when I attempted the upgrade, I received an error message that I did not have enough memory.  It will not run two simple add-ons (a projector and an external DVD player).  It is a cheap back-up in my home now for internet access and nothing more.  I haven't tried to add a printer, but I have no confidence in this machine to handle that simple driver.  It took three weeks for my order to ship on Prime (the projected ship date changed twice), and that was only after I sent Amazon an email asking for cancellation.  I had contacted the seller, but received no response.  Once I asked Amazon to cancel the order, the status of my order was changed to "in transit."  Shifty.  On the plus side, it is light and portable because it has nothing to weigh it down.  However, its plug and play capabilities are nonexistent, so do not do as I did:  I bought it and an external DVD player, and it can't be made to function.  Good for a student who needs nothing but personal internet access and wants to stream videos.  Do not try to add software or hardware, and take care with the seller.  The price changed by $20 between the date I placed the order and its shipment:  it was advertised at $159, but I was charged $179 by the time it shipped.
I seem to have a love/hate relationship with this lap top. Love the price and trust me it's worth it for the price you pay! However the mouse doesn't always work great. None the less work light work, student, etc I would recommend it
Bought as a gift for our daughter, she loves it. Lightweight and easy to use and fun ombré blue colors. Might add a mouse later to make desk work a little easier. Has a pop up that we have not gotten rid of that is a little annoying.
Unfortunately my screen broke when the multimedia barely touched it. Heart rending and now i'll have to replace the screen. It still worked though I had o connect it to the multimedia and navigate my way through the projected screen.
Portable, concise and elegant!
Perfect for what my kids need.
Just needed a laptop to do email, pay bills, and create documents. This thing is perfect!  So lightweight!  Easy to take anywhere and has a great screen size. No dvd/cd drive so I bought an external one. Thrilled with this laptop!!!
Just as the top review for this product says, this thing comes with a ton of bloatware and I would recommend following what that review says and remove all of it. Also, contrary to the answers I got, this will run Hearthstone fine.
Got this laptop for my girlfriend and she loved it. Although I think it's alright for the money it's great for browsing the Internet and such but lacks space, it only comes with 32 gb of storage and Windows 10 takes up most of it.
The second day I had it, I believe my husband put a virus on it to mess it up lol, but we fixed it that same day. I love the size of this lap top how easy it is to fix. this is for my schooling so its just the best gift I needed!!
I purchased the stream 11 with very high expectations and it exceeded all of those I love it so much. It still has 50% battery and I charged it a few days ago. I definitely recommend it to everyone looking do a well priced laptop.
Nice laptop for students. If you want to play game or watch videos then I'm not recommending this product but if you want to use it for word, web surfing and bring it to company or school then it will be perfect laptop for you :)
Love this thing. It does all I want and more. For those wondering (maybe you'll have the same needs) I use it mainly for writing using a word processor. But it run on the internet as well or better than anything else. Very handy.
Love this lap top. It's maybe a bit slow, but for my needs (travel use) it fits the bill perfectly. Easy to carry, easy to set up and the price is right too. Had a couple of minor glitches at first but they were easily corrected.
I just got my hp today and I love it already, I'm still getting use to how small it is but I absolutely  love the color. The one thing I don't like is like half my space is already taken up from all the downloaded things on here.
This computer is great it's fast portable and the hue is beautiful. Equipped with windows 8 i don't see how any one could hate it
Great little laptop. Don't expect it to run complex computer games or anything. But it's perfect size for bringing around when  you need to type up something or do a little online research. Also works well for streaming Netflix.
I got this for my husband to use for schooland it's done the job. I do wish it jag more memory though. It's almost full with system apps and we can't save to the hard drive. Fortunately we have cloud based places to save things.
great  for  my  granddaughter
Has  slight stalling problem.
beautiful color, nice set up.
wow i got this product at low cost from here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NSHLUBU/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B00NSHLUBU&linkCode;=as2&tag;=amazonbfc-20&linkId;=6JHZOUFGXPLVX3UF
I love this laptop for general internet use, blogging, writing, using Word Processors and other basic computing needs. My only gripe is that it regularly has problems streaming video through services such as Netflix and Hulu.
I just use the laptop to surf the interwebz. Has a very fast processor so many sites load fast. Good deal for the money and very useful. It doesn't have a disc drive so anything more than what I use it for is not recommended.
Computer was in very nice condition and works fine. However. 32 GB . . This rating is for the computer capacity does not provide enough capacity to download Windows 10. This rating is for capacity only, otherwise seems fine.
I LOVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEEE My new blue laptop! It runs smoothly and its everything that I've ever wanted in a laptop. Most of all, I love the small size. Its my favvvorite laptop of all time!<br/><br/>Thank You So Much :)
This is an excellent laptop! The price was so affordable! Easy set up! I was shocked! The fact it came with Microsoft Office was a big plus for me! It is lightweight and I love the blue color! Buy it! You will not be sorry!
I wanted something smaller than my laptop, but bigger than my Kindle.  This is just perfect, I can carry it in my back pack or purse and it fits, but has all the options of a regular sized laptop.  I'm more than satisfied.
I really like the laptop. the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars was because the 1st one I got the screen went out within a few hours of me having it but Amazon replaced it with no problem and it has been fine ever since.
Good laptop for the price. I am not able to download windows 10 due to there not being enough room and I am NOT at all tech savvy. Windows 8 really sucks lol. But otherwise it works good especially for such a cheap price!
It's an alright device, for the reasonable price. It does its job, but I am buying sd memory card just in case. All in all I am satisfied with the device, it's good for the students who do most of their schoolwork online.
This has been a great little laptop. It's lightweight like a tablet, but has all the capability of a regular laptop. I do a fair amount of entry through the keyboard, so this was a better alternative than a tablet for me.
Nice laptop for someone who plans on just using it to check emails and social networking sites, shop online, use Microsoft, listen to music etc. In other words simple things. I bought it 5 months ago and I'm very satisfy.
I purchased this for my daughter to take to school.  It's lightweight and so far, very reliable.  She loves the size and color.  The plus is that it's a solid state drive.  It came with Windows and it was easy to set-up.
Great laptop for home use.  It took a little while to get use to the new windows.  Every time I touched the screen I moved to a new screen. But I finally got the hand of it.  Amazing price.  Lots of features.  Great buy.
great laptop for on the go once or twice a month. If used regular the keys stop working, in less than 6 months i have to buy an external keyboard because half of my keys don't work. great with specs poor quality hardware
This was a gift for my mother in law, who is recuperating from chemotherapy.  She was thrilled!  It is very pretty blue and the screen colors are vivid.  I am so glad I found such a nice lap top for such a great price!!
You get what you pay for. I'd expect this to have dropped in price down to $150 by now. It is a good cheap laptop. The price is only worth it if you use the free microsoft OneDrive and Microsoft Software Suite, I think.
Great little computer for checking E-mail and surfing the web. Orfice 365 lets me keep track of the books and accounts aas well.  Great service from vendor and delivery service.  Delivered several days ahead of schedule
I had to return my computer to HP for fixing. Sound makes a stutter noise a lot and some of my keys are not functioning right. Regret buying this computer. Wish my older HP still worked. Wayne better quality than this.
This laptop is a life send.  It's perfect for us as a family.  Lightweight, and a spunky color.  My daughter loves to do her online school with it.  The camera works great, and we got such a great deal on this! Thanks!
Great computer for the price. I added an SD card to get extra space. It is fast and functional. Also very light in weight. The mouse pad is a little annoying to use, but it is manageable. Very happy with this purchase.
I bought this for my granddaughter. She seems quite happy with it. I did not look close enough at the ad before purchasing to see that it did not have a compartment for c d, s. But she uses a thumb drive so it is fine.
SSD dead after 2 months use.
Excelent product, I love it!
I love mine!!!!!I got mine at another place for a cheaper price,and the fact that I can use it anywhere in the house is awesome!!!And the built-in camera takes nice pictures and video.Highly recommended by me!!!!! :-)
I really love this laptop! It's really simple for school use. The only problem I had was that it got alot of viruses in one week with the couple times I used it. It  became really really slow but I got it fixed after.
Great product. It's small, thin design allows me to travel with it. It is small enough to fit inside my purse. I was a little disappointed that the computer lacked a CD drive, but I have made another order. Thanks hp
This was a great laptop for the price.  My Mom needed a new one and doesn't require a lot of memory, etc.  This was a birthday gift for her and it meets her needs for creating documents, internet and checking e-mail.
Bought for a special boy who LOVES it!<br/><br/>Plays all of his flash games and such with ease.  Not a monster machine by any means but it is a great starter laptop for any kid in the 8-12 year old range IMO.  A++
Boots up fast, Easy to use except touch pad is either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. My first laptop. Still getting used to Win 8 after years of XP. Downloads fast, video is good, sound just OK. Great price!
I bought my daughter this as a gift for her 16th birthday. She is absolutely in love with it. She already knows it inside out, good thing I got it for her and not me. But I might consider buying a personal one soon.
Original product. I buy this one as a gift of my sister. When she receive this laptop, she run at me and hug me. Don't know why? I think she like this things. Very strong and great quality with a low price. Thanks!
Disappointed with this laptop. I got it brand new and it takes forever to connect to the Internet when I turn it on and the computer moves extremely slow. I should not be having this problem with a brand new laptop
I like this laptop for going to the internet and glad it has a larger screen. It's pretty light weight. I did a lot of research before buying it. PC Magazine gave it a high review. I did not want an Ipad or Tablet.
Like the laptop but having problems with the MS Office subscription.  Had to get tech support and after 30 days it expired.  Away for the summer and left product code at home.  Will need to call again to get reset.
Fun color! Get tons of compliments on how fun it is. Works for basic needs but not multi-tasking. Email, research and web use is all I use it for and it works great! Anything else would slow this little thing down.
Bought this as a gift and that person loves it!  Size of a large tablet with the functionality of a normal computer, can't go wrong with this.  Oh yeah, it is half the cost of a full size tablet with more features!
I have it for about 1 month and am still struggling to connect to the internet. Since all my other devices connect without problems, it can only be a problem with the computer. Other than that, it is working fine.
All these people talking about getting 9 hours of battery life, I'm lucky to get 5 hours and it is sitting idol most of the time. Use it to check e-mails and facebook mostly. No high battery consumption stuff.....
Purchased this for our Executive assistant who needed something to take notes in meetings and occasionally work from home. THis is an excellent laptop for that sort of scenario. Or for a child to do schoolwork on.
It may be low in memory, but this computer is a great value for the price. It is very quick, and has enough USB ports to attach as much peripheral memory as you want to make up for its relatively small hard drive.
I only use it for school, but boots super fast thanks to the solid state, upgraded to windows 10 and it's so much better than 8! Obviously not made to be having tons of programs open at once but great for school!
to be short on this review this is an excellent product but with limitation, it is great for students. if you want to work in office, connect to facebook or shot around or browse. best slick laptop for the price.
So far I'm very happy  with this laptop, especially considering the price. It is small but that just makes it easier to transport and use anywhere. It feels durable and is a nice color, while not being obnoxious.
Quite great and very cheap.
I am in love with this laptop!!! I didn't give it five stars because there was supposed to be a case included which I didn't receive. Also, there is a bunch of adware. I don't know what's adware and what's not.
I bought this laptop a few days ago and I have to say I'm impressed. For the price it runs well and it looks nice and the display is crisp. I have a few complaints, but for $200 these complaints are by no means a deal breaker at all.<br/><br/>1) The touchpad could be better. Sensitivity-wise it's decent and obviously that can be changed to fit your needs, however I've noticed missed gesture and it misclicks a lot unless you press at the exact right spot (or use touch sensitivity).<br/><br/>2) Bloatware -- there's some that you probably should get rid of, read the top review here for more info.<br/><br/>3) Limited color options! The blue is fine I guess, but more options would be nice.<br/><br/>4) OneDrive. It's a cool service that I'm never gonna use and there's no way to remove it, that I've found. Not a big deal, but it's kind of annoying seeing it there when I'm not interested in it whatsoever. (I have a flash drive and a 2TB XHDD.)<br/><br/>All in all, well worth the money. I love how quiet it is due to the no fans and the SSD. I'm super pleased with it, though I'm not using it for gaming much (beyond Hearthstone which runs pretty well), which I doubt it could handle at all.
I've had this piece of &^%$@@ for six months.  In the middle of a project it just stopped working,  There is no return policy and that bites.  It's not used for internet surfing or anything that would expose it to any challenges and it's not even six months old!!!!!  I liked it 6 months ago and I rarely use it but six months later it's costing me money.  DON'T BUY THIS LAP TOP!!!!!  Save your money.
IThis is OK to be used in the U.S but when you consider to use it in South Korea<br/>The memory is very limited as every websites in South Korea request additional safety program<br/>I am sorry to return it.
was delivered on time and was exactly what we expected..  the processor isn't very fast but its what you expect for the price.  great for general use and web browsing/emails which is what we were looking for.
UNABLE TO UPDATE WINDOWS 10 unless your some sort of computer geek uninstalling and reinstalling and uninstalling... windows update kills the storage space. Out of box after updates i have 10gb of space left
Love it!!! This is a great buy. I have more than a couple of others that I have referred to purchase. Great color, weight, size, just GREAT all around. This is great for a college student or even a teenager.
it is great......I love this computer, I got the pink one, well its purple and plink......the color is awesome....over all the product is great, easy to use, and good on battery. u should diffidently get it
I started it up right away.  Windows 8 takes some time getting used to.  The key board is white and easy to see.  I love it, my first laptop.  My kids have me a speaker  so I can enjoy the tunes much louder
I'm verry happy with this product !<br/> Of course is a computer of $217 so don't spect a super pc.. The color is beatifull !! And run pretty well.<br/> If you need something basic, this is your computer!
Portable computer with great performance, at a value price. Most helpful review before my purchase was from formortals. Made many of the recommended changes by this user, after receiving my Stream 13 by HP.
Love this laptop. Perfect for college students and the blue makes it pop. Only 4 stars because it has very little memory. I recommend getting an external hard drive but other than that I've had no problems
Excellent product, as long as you remember it's limitations. Hard drive is the big issue, could not put Windows 10 on it. No matter how much I deleted it said I did not have enough space on the hard drive.
Great for the price for sure, it comes with a $25 Microsoft apps giftcard and a free year of Office 365, which is alone probably worth the price. Navigation can be difficult though and hard to figure out.
Looked like a nice computer but something was wrong with the built in network adapter. Constantly  disconnected from wifi, causing none of the programs to function properly. Might be worth it if it worked
A great little computer.  The only complaint with this order is that I clicked "Buy it Again" to give to a friend as a gift and this time around it cost around $30 more.  Why the price difference?
Simple. Cost effective. Works great. Have one for me and one for my wife. She uses hers for personal stuff and remote work. Mine is plugged (HDMI) into the TV. Took my big screen from smart to brilliant.
Bought for my son to use in school (High school) vs the chrome book he is given each year. Works well - durable - rugged. When you get it you won't believe you paid what you paid for it. Highly recommend
So extremely happy! Was very excited to receive my laptop in the condition that it was said to be in. Love this product! Delivery was very fast and efficient and I am so pleased with my brand new laptop!
Good value for money.
Great Computer and Seller!
Excellent & Inexpensive. I feel like I got more than my money's worth with this computer. Highly recommended for students or anybody who needs a  medium/small computer for on the go browsing or working.
Exactly what i needed its small light and easy to carry around. Although you do have low memory but that is expected. Also put up a firewall as soon as possible these computers get viruses very easily.
I am very happy with this laptop, I was only looking for something to go online to my blackboard for school and do my papers.  It's perfect, I haven't had any problems with it and would recommend it!!
Love it, love it, love it!! This laptop is perfect. I love the color and the design. I only gave 4 stars because the top was a little uneven. Other than that, it was great. great for college students.
Works great so far! Once I got rid of all the unnecessary programs, it actually runs pretty fast. I got it for school work and apperciate the Microsoft 365. All I need to do is buy a CD/DVD player now
It's just what we needed it for.  I bought for my son to use for school. He needed to download school software on through an external cd drive and likes Microsoft word.  The gift card was fun to use.
Had a lot of problems with it and sent it back.  It was a great size and lightweight.  I just had processor errors with it and for being new, it was best to get rid of it and try something different.
I'm using it right now to post this review! As this product was described and looked it arrived just is. I couldn't be more in love with it! It was sold at a great price and I couldn't be more happy!
This is cute, compact, and does all the basic things I need it to do. The only drawback is that the touch pad isn't as responsive as the touch pads on other laptops I've had, but that's a minor issue
This is one awesome stream book. I am happy with my purchase. Who needs a bulky laptop today when you can have this lightweight sleek HP stream book and get even more out of a product for less money.
Good price, Perfect for my high school student, included Microsoft Office and also plays movies. Fast and has plenty of memory. Haven't had any issues with the laptop and have had it about 9 months.
This is my wife's first laptop. She is having problems but it looks okay for windows 8. I am not a fan of the cloud it just makes all info available to everyone. I think I will stick with windows 7.
This laptop is worth the price...it freezes sometimes (rarely) But besides that it's super fast! I was not sure about buying this laptop because of all the negatives reviews. I love this laptop :))
So far, loving everything! The biggest problem I have is that it comes with the free windows 10 upgrade, but it doesn't have enough memory to do the upgrade so we had to buy a hard drive to fit it.
It's a little slow than my main laptop,  it takes a while to open up new tabs or to turn on. But it's perfect for a light little laptop to bring to school and type papers or for casual web surfing
More than awesome.  Highly recommend.  I got it for my 65 year old dad and he loves it.  If all you need is a simple fast computer to surf the web and make documents, than this is the one for you!
This is a great computer at a great price. Notwithstanding the fact that I'm a Mac guy and despise Windows, this is an awesome computer for a great price. If you can't get a MacBook Air, buy this!
I bought it as a backup for my HP Pavilion 11" in case anything should take it out of service. I really like it alot, and would not mind using it as my daily use unit. The price is spectaular!
works great for the price
It's awesome I love it 😊
It's an alright laptop considering the price.  I would only use this device if you couldn't afford anything else.  Browsing the internet is sluggish at times, even compared to my Acer Chromebook.
This has been a great little laptop for me when I'm going to meetings or traveling.  It's a bit on the slow side compared to what I'm used to, but it does everything I need and is super portable.
My daughter needed a laptop for school and this was one of the two that the school recommended. I bought a memory card to add more memory. It works great for her first laptop. I'm very satisfied.
Very very happy. It works better then my $400 one. It's a lightweight design not to mention it's pink!!!!!!!! For $200????? Well worth it it came with free office word which is 100 dollars alone.
Not enough space for Win 10. Follow all info I can find to create more space.  But no luck.  I did read in the HP forum that a update shoud be available on the 19th of August.  Hope that 's true.<br/>Update I was able to install Win10 but not no space for anything else.  Reinstalled Win8 and giving up
Needed something for school - mainly paper writing. Doesn't have a whole lot of memory, which is ok since i use a cloud-based back up service. Overall good value for a basic Windows-based laptop.
Nice system for my 7 ur old for school work. The mouse pad taking time t9 get used to. Very easy to accidentally change the screen size...which is my only complaint. ..but great first time system
I had a hard time deciding on what lap top to buy. I read a lot of reviews first and I also compared this one to the other ones and I am very happy with my decision. This is a very good lap top.
This is a gift for my granddaughter. It works wonderfully, she loves the color. It is a full laptop and has all the goodies and wireless internet.  There are matching accessories in pink for it.
We brought this  laptop  for my 8 year old  daughter  for  Christmas! She loves it & i can use it for school to do homework and to follow up on my class work in class! This  is a  excellent buy!
I wish I would have purchased something with a little bit more hard drive space. Not used to Windows 8 which is a little bit confusing for me.
Great little laptop! Works well right after the guided set up. No issues here! Got this for my hubby for college, along with an optical drive and an external hard drive.. Perfect for his needs.
Great computer for the price.  However the trackpad isn't that great.  The ASUS chromebooks have the same price and much better trackpad.  But if you need Windows, can't go wrong for the price.
The hp pink laptop have all  the necessary material for a student that  need to do research and to type assignment at an affordable<br/>cost
Great little computer for my high school daughter.  She uses it for online school work, as well as watching movies etc.  The track pad is clunky, but other than that we are very happy with it!
very happy with this :)))<br/>screen is like one of those plasma type screens on the older computers ... works for me ... I'm a happy camper  :)))<br/>worth the money for a cyber Monday deal
Received the product on time. I brought this laptop for school. Not only did I receive the right color (Orchard Magenta), but it works great. I have no complaints about my laptop. I love it!!!
for the price, it is worth it! I prefer it over many other tablets and chromebooks.  You can spend more to get something with much better specs.  It meets my requirement for what i need to do,
Windows 8 is annoying, and it will suck when all the add on subscriptions expire. Other than that I'm quite pleased with the computer. It's really nice to have a fully functional laptop again!
Love the laptop, easy to set up.  Advertised with a $25 MS gift card but when I went to activate it I got a message that this HP stream didn't qualify for the free gift card.  Not cool Amazon.
Nice for a simple computer to surf the web.  Haven't tried the office 365 since I have all I need on another computer.  Would be nice to have an ethernet port but the wireless hookup was easy.
great pc, bought this for my husband and he just loves it, sleek design, light weight, and easy to use also can not beat the price, took only 2 days to get to us also the fastest shipping ever
Its a really good laptop and i have had a good time with it but the track pad on this thing isn't really good but that can be fixed easilly with a mouse. Other than that it works pretty good.
This Is the best Computer I have ever had, I love it. Super easy to use and handles all my needs for running a small business. Plus its purple and pink blinded in the inside. its a great buy!
Ok, 3 stars because windows 8 is not my Forte and to my not very user friendly. But it came in my favorite color and it's got an awsome battery life. Pretty durable with a curious 6 year old.
I use this daily for random internet searches, Facebook, and homework. We have a desktop too so this is just a nice addition for portability. Liked it so much I bought another for my husband.
Love the slim sleek design, only bad thing about is the amount of GBs, I have Microsoft office installed and iTunes installed and now I have no more memory! Sucks but it's okay for the price.
Purchased in January as a birthday gift & it stopped working.... Charges but no longer comes on...been without since April....friend also purchased same product and had the same thing happen
love the size and weight but when i got it the cursor didnt work, hours of trying to get through to hp and still isnt fixed, i have to use a mouse that plugs into the usb. very disappointing
Unfortunately this laptop is little more than a tablet. The memory space is insufficient, it's very slow, and the sensitivity to the mouse is very low. Opened applications constantly crash.
Pros screen good size,  User friendly easy to carry.  Cons- Long time to turn on. Touchpad touch repsonse laking.<br/><br/>Overall i love my laptop it was a lot better than my acer i had.
Not having had any training in this type of unit, going has been okay, BUT a manual would be nice to help with explanation's.  It was hard to even find one on line that made any sense!  ADC
After deleting the bloatware and optimizing it for windows 8 it runs as advertised. It is also a good idea to find a browser that utilizes less system resources then IE, FireFox and Chrome.
Awesome. It moves a little slow sometimes and it takes a few minutes after turning on to hook to home wi-fi but overall great machine and great price. The free year of 365 was nice as well.
Nice little laptop for the money. I use it as a dedicated laptop for my wine cellar and it is perfect for this use. Has a lot of capabilities for being so inexpensive. And it's pretty too!
AMAZING PRODUCT! I was in need for a easy to use, lightweight laptop for school and this was great! Ive had it for about a week now and im super happy with it! Definitely recommend buying!
I have tried my hardest to get this laptop to work. I have deleted everything I could, I have begged my husband to work his tech-magic, but no matter what we've tried to do the entire 21.5 GB has been eaten and refuses to be spit-back-out. I can hardly have one tab open, let alone the three-six I normally need to have for college, or simple browsing. I hate this little HP and unless someone tell me a way to fix this I'm going to keep resenting it. The only things I like about it right now is that it's small and lightweight. I'm not wanting to be hateful, but $200 of my scholarship for college supplies went to this, and in my opinion it was wasted. I could have bought another Toshiba Satellite or an ASUS like my husband suggested. Instead I bought this and I can't even use a Microsoft Office Word for thirty minutes before the alter that I "my computer is low on memory".<br/><br/>I don't know what happened, but if someone can fix it and get me a long-term solution I will be more than happy to change my opinion. Until then, I suggest no one buy this.
Love it so much I got 2!
Good product Great price
Actually my daughter paid for this (I fronted her the money). She loves this laptop. It's fast and can handle whatever she asks of it. Great laptop at a great price. Perfect for students.
It was a gift. But I love it so far. I mainly use it to do homework on Blackboard. Very slim and lightweight. I still have to get use to the latest Windows software, but its a great buy.
The laptop is really good and really useful but it is not great because sometimes it makes loud noises or the screen freezes or the buttons don't work but for the most part it works well
Excellent for travelling. Why take you expensive mac on a trip? I take this on my trips and because it was so reasonably priced, I don't worry if I have to lock it in a safe in a hotel.
I purchased this laptop for my son whom is currently in college. So far we are very satisfied with this product and I would defintely recommend it to anyone looking for a budget laptop.
This is a general post about HP Customer support. I've had an HP for 4 years which I have taken really good care of both in equipment, upgrades and protection from viruses and malware. It still works fine and more powerful than some new models.  I had an issue with a Windows upgrade that corrupted my boot sector requiring an original installation disc to repair. Since my PC came preloaded I contacted HP to obtain an original installation disc. They declined to assist me saying my pc was 4 years old and obsolete. I'm sorry it is up to me to determine whether it still has a useful life. I reminded them that they are still selling PCs that are less equipped than mine with Windows 7 as the OS and that I just wanted the disc they owed me.  Nevertheless, they refused.  This is not customer service in any fashion. I now, in good conscience could never recommend HP as as a company to do business with.  Good companies take care of their customers when they can not make excuses why they will not.  They have lost my business forever!  BUYERS BEWARE.
This is a good computer that is inexpensive. Used it to research and write papers. Not a lot of storage space so you should get a sd card, that it has a slot for and you will be great.
I bought this laptop for my son-in-law and daughter for Christmas.  They are very happy with it's performance and have not had any problems with it.  Great little laptop for the price.
The lap top showed up very timely. It was a gift for my sister. She is 50 yrs old and absolutely loves it. The speed is very good, quality of picture is amazing. The price was perfect.
The computer itself is excellent and as soon as I find the best Start menu options and other ways to work around Win8.1 I will be totally happy. I am using it with an external 1Tb HDD. I put all large files and backups on the external HDD and am going to load Office 2007 on it tomorrow. I can stick the small HDD to the case with Velcro if I don't want it dangling on my desk.<br/>3 weeks later - I am so happy with this. It is a replacement for my venerable Asus eeePC because I needed something that fit on a small bedroom desk and also an airline economy seat tray. I use Classic Shell (free) and ModernMix ($5) to make it act and look close enough to Windows 7. If you can stand Windows 8 you will be happy right out of the box. I did not find a lot of junkware and it all removed easily using CCleaner. On all my PCs I disable lots of stuff in the Startup menu and anything that updates itself automatically - they are memory and time hogs. I replaced the clunky Mail app with free EM Client that easily imported my contacts.All in all, setup was medium-easy. Not Mac-easy, but you don't need to be a coder to do it either.<br/>I had what might be a common mechanical problem with the spacebar but fixed that myself (contact me to learn how).<br/>Strongest points - decent speed and multitasking, excellent MATTE screen, good sound even with speakers and I like the single jack for mic and earbuds a lot. Long battery life - almost made it all the way from Tokyo to San Fran watching onboard streamed videos. Great wifi - I get 5 bars where I could only get 3 with the ASUS. Excellent white keyboard easy to see in dim light, and a responsive touchpad.<br/>It's east to understamnd hating this baby if you get a dud, and the low price seems to go along with poor quality control..HP is pretty to get responsive service from (it's relative!) so if you have received a lemon, return it! The good ones are great value.
Camera is kinda bad but everything else is ok. A regular laptop is to big and bulky and most tablets are to small and not worth the price.this is in between and works better than both.
My teenager had been using this for homework, games, Netflix, and web browsing for a few weeks now without complaint. Absolutely loves it. Holds a charge very long. And is Tardis blue!
I have a dell laptop that's about 4 years old so I was looking for a cheap up to date laptop that wasn't to expensive and wasn't a chrome book. And this blows away my old laptop hahaha
Purchased this as a Christmas present 2014 and in August 2015 the keyboard is shot.  $85+labor for the part and to fix it, not worth it.  Would think twice before buying this product.
If / when you upgrade to windows 10 - note that it saves the old windows for 30 days - which almost maxes out the drive.  I deleted the old windows (I also bought a 128 GB SDXC card)
Computer keyboard does not work how it should. I did research and it seems many others have this issue. This was bought for school work and it's very frustrating and almost unuseable
It certainly met my expectations. A true life saver considering the fact I needed to purchase it for my classes. Super fast and light weight.The size is convenient for traveling too.
Wonderful laptop for teens and their schoolwork .. As well as streaming movies and playing games. We purchased one on Amazon (The Blue color) and another at Walmart (the pink one)...
Runs fast and smoothly but is missing a disk reader and has very little space. It's worth buying for casual use and if you're OK with little storage or buying an external hard drive
This laptop came right on time!  It's perfect for the online college courses I'm taking.  A moon even has textbook rentals with great prices.  I think I will be a customer for life.
I love this computer.... I do all of my work for college on it and I can also play some games as well. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reliable computer.😁😁😁
I can use this computer all day and only have to charge it once. If you are in doubt of how much storage you need go a little higher. This is a great computer. Only issue is space.
it's worked great since i bought it but so does every HP computer i have purchased.  i had 2 dells broke down right away, a gateway that was junk.  i definately would recommend HP.
I bought this notebook to use when I travel; mainly because I have a bulky fully-functional HP laptop. SO far so good; however, I do wish the screen tilted a little more backwards.
Really like my laptop, do wish it had a Ethernet plug though, I have had a few situation at work where the WiFi was down and sadly that meant that I could not access the internet.
I love my laptop I use it for my online classes, it is the perfect size. The one thing that disappointed me is they sent me the wrong color but I didn't have time to send it back.
I was looking for a basic laptop that would allow word processing and web surfing for my kids' school papers and daily household uses -- it's perfect!  Light, fast....great value!
Had this computer for about 2 months and the mousepad has stopped working when I tap it to select something. Otherwise I love the lightness and user-friendliness of this computer.
I got this when the price was still $199, and it was a steal!<br/><br/>Perfect for my needs, which include surfing the web, playing older games, and some light audio processing.
Perfect for what I need. Lite weight which makes it easy to carry while traveling. Speed is not as fast as my other high end HP but this serve the persist for using the internet.
Gave this gift to my sister who needed another laptop. She absolutely loves the portability of it, and she says its easy to use. I'm going to get one for myself. Great for gifts!
I removed Office Suite and other software but still it doesn't have enough memory for what I wanted. I will use it for internet and streaming though and less for writing fiction.
this 11-incher is more than what I could expect from a laptop of its specs. Perfect for the basic computer. Celeron is wickedly powerful, even for a PC that is small like HP.
Very happy with this product.  Great for surfing the net.  Not a lot of space needed for what we o and we can store in the cloud if we do need to store.  Great for the price.
At first I was skeptical after reading so many reviews on this one and many other laptops, but finally I decided on this one and I very pleased and feel I made a good choice.
Great product! Does the work well.. If you don't have heave use of laptop then buy this one instead of chromebooks. More features than chromebook for the price of chromebook.
You get what you pay for and I got exactly what I wanted!  Perfect for work and school and I am going to order another one for my daughter in college, who also approved it!!
Great value for price.
My daughter loves this
Very simple, lightweight, and compact for doing the basics like using word, email and Internet browsing. Which is all I needed it for to perform my job duties. Setup was fast and easy but they did not send any software with the device. Once setup was complete I was unable to connect to the Internet. After about an hour of troubleshooting, my boyfriend figured out that the network adapter driver was not installed during setup and was missing. He googled the problem and was directed to the HP online help center where he found this is a common issue with HP. After 2 hours of research and several failed attempts to find the correct drivers he eventually was successful and found the right ones. He downloaded them onto a flash drive and then downloaded them on to my device. I now have Internet connection and my device functions just fine. I found it rather disappointing that a device manufactured to have only 2-3 functions failed at 50% of them right out of the box.
Didn't come with Windows 10 installed, but that is an easy upgrade.<br/><br/>This is a great light weight notebook.  If you are considering a Chromebook, this is similar.
Shipped quickly.... arrived perfect no problems!!!! Will look to buy again closer to Christmas time..... good computer for smaller kids that use the computer for school!!!!
Alot wrong with this laptop.....the space key sticks as some of the letters. you get on a website like Amazon.com and it goes off. Very frustrating. Do not buy this laptop.
My girlfriend loves it! And my brother took all the excess junk off it so it runs faster now. Still not sure about the cloud storage but has more memory than a chrome book.
No worries so far,<br/>The size of a netbook with the full functions of a laptop. I would recommend this CPU to anyone loooking for power, speed, and awsome battery life.
Product arrived quickly, some of the keys are not aligned properly. I opted for the service protection program, thankfully and suggest doing the same for potential buyers.
Purchased this computer for my fiancé to have for travelling (she typically depends on an iPad alone). It was very easy to set up, and the free Office 365 was a nice perk.
The only thing I don't care for is the screen resolution and the touchpad.  It feels as though the mouse lags.  Great for the price and easily fixed with a wireless mouse!
Great on the go laptop. Fast enough to access emails a browse the web. However product was tampered with and the free office was used and has to by separate at full price.
Had a virus, but it was fixable, its cute anyway. Good for small personal use, but that's about it. I liked it though, wasnt asking for much and the price was reasonable.
While my wife is not a computer person, see is telling me it's slow and sensitive to the touch.<br/><br/>Would have given it four stars, but I hear this everyday or so.
It is a shame corporate America thinks it's ok to rip off others.  State computer could be upgraded to Windows 10 with a 32 gig drive when the operating system needs 22+!
Love this little cute thing right here. It does everything I need it to do. Just what I been looking for and I can pack it wherever I go.  It can even fit in my big purse
I love my new Chrome Book. It is light as a feather which makes it very portable and it is something I have been wanting for a long time, I am happy I made this purchase.
Came in a timely fashion, super pretty blue, super fast start up and great features. It's just small. Storage wise. I am ordering a low profile flash drive to keep in it.
When I got this computer the mouse hardly worked, I had to plug in my own separate mouse. I've barely had this Laptop for two weeks and the mouse doesn't work at all now.
Just got it, seems to be perfect for my online schooling. Deducted a star because the mouse pad is not user friendly at all. Definitely purchase a mouse to use with this.
OK I held off reviewing the laptop as a wanted to get a feel of the product so I could write a worthwhile review of the laptop so here goes it:<br/><br/>The appearance of the lap top is amazing very pleasing to the eyes the way developers allowed the two shades of blue to flow into each other is really appealing. The set up of the laptop was an easy 123 for me as I also have a windows phone so I already had a Microsoft account and so my files on my phone just synced no problem. The other reviewers got it right I had to install Google Chrome and the CCleaner as they were the best alternative to Internet Explorer and McAfee that came per-installed on the laptop (PS buying a Samsung 64 GB memory card is a good bet as well)<br/>The processing speed on the laptop seems to be ok as I don't get any delays when i'm downloading files of browsing the internet. The start up time of the laptop is really impressive as well in less than 10 seconds and the laptop is on and lets not forget what a great price this laptop is going for.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>The webcam is really awful I don't even bother to launch it but no worries that is not the main reason I bought the laptop.<br/><br/>The $25 gift card that you get with the laptop was a nightmare to add to my account and don't even waste your time calling Microsoft for assistance as you will only get yourself even more frustrated but thank God for Amazon they did pull through for me in the end.<br/><br/>The lock screen photo when i try to use a personal photo its very distorted and ugly so im stuck using the one that are per-installed.<br/><br/>The track pad is a little delayed in responding to your taps so just buy a Bluetooth mouse and save your self the hassle<br/><br/>Things I bought for my laptop that I would recommend you take a look at:<br/><br/>Samsung 64 GB SD card<br/>Keyboard protective film<br/>Screen protector<br/>Wireless Bluetooth mouse<br/>Protective hard case
For basic stuff, this is good. The Microsoft Office does not function as it should, and space is limited on hard drive but overall it is a good buy for just basic stuff.
Love it!  Easy to use. Very Light and compact. Easy to activate and register products. I was able to load several apps as well without any memory issues. So far so good.
As others have said, the trackpad has issues.  It's far too sensitive and causes the cursor to jump all over...but....it's a $200 laptop.  For the price, it works great!
My daughter now treats this little notebook as her treasure. She even reads book there before bedtime. The battery runs very long, maybe because it is so thin and light.
We are having issues with the setup of the profile. It is just a green screen. Otherwise, it is super! Great deal for the price. Lightweight and perfect for student use.
Super cute. I didn't realize how small it was and at first I was a little disappointed but it's so lightweight and very convenient to take with you on trips. I love it!
Bought 2 for my kids. They're great. I had to uninstall quite a but of nonsense, but over all they're just what we needed. I do wish they had more storage. Great price!
Very happy.  Fast basic computing.  Office works well.  Windows8 has taken some getting use to....otherwise....this works great for daily comp chores....would buy again
I love it. Its sleek , lightweight, and very easy to use. I haven't had any problems so far. Just remember you will need a micro sd card eventually so get it from now.
This was a gift for my mother in law. She seems to be really enjoying it as it is very easy to use. She is 80 years old and not very computer savvy, so that is a plus.
this mini laptop is amazing!<br/>Looks great!<br/>Works great!Super light and with a really good design.<br/>Doesn't looks cheap! i will bu this again and again!!!!
Bought this for my daughters-<br/>Pros- works well, easy to set up , seems durable, great price.<br/>Cons- track pad is poor and makes it a little tough to navigate.
Nice little laptop for a teenager or if you just want to do simple things like check e-mails. Only downsides are it doesn't have a number pad or a place to put a disc.
It was more like a new student's computer. It was a very nice computer but I needed a bigger computer for the work I needed to do. Thank you for your superior service.
These little machines are great for travel!  Everything you need - full version of Windows, cloud storage.  Color is really nice too.  Not too pink looking.  Love it!
if looking for the best 11.6 inch laptop, this would not disappoint you. the screen resolution is great for anyone who would be interested in simple office computing.
Its great...love it..
Just need more memory
I Love My Laptop, My boyfriend did a great Job He bought it as a Gift for Me to use For school and it Works wonderfully. Love the Color and all of The qualifications
"Tapping" to click on the track-pad mouse has stopped working after one month. Since the mouse has no buttons, this had made clicking difficult, and right-clicking a sad, sad game of Russian  roulette. I wish the screen-hinge had more range of motion, and it needs a keyboard light/backlight, other than that (and the fact that Win8 blows) works perfectly.
I was excited to find a good laptop 💻 with a good operating system and nice color too. I am so very very satisfied with this product I would absolutely buy again!!!
Good design and light weight. The size is ideal for to be transported. The quality of the material is very good. The student has an excellent product in this laptop.
I Love That It Came In Pink Although Green Is My Fav. It's Easy To Travel With About The Size Of A Composition Notebook. Came Very Fast. I'm Happy With My Purchase.
Great computer, especially for watching YouTube videos.  Very lightweight, portable and fast response.  Solid state drive allows for moving it while it's turned on.
Very decent quality for the price. I have not had any problems. Screen resolution is pretty good. The actual product color is a lot more pink then in the picture :)
This is a GREAT laptop! I absolutely love it. I can not wait to use this for school! And its PINK! EVERYTHING is BETTER when it is PINK! That is just default... ;-)
My wife likes this computer, I hate trying to help her with it though because the windows 8.1 OS is ridiculous. Also the computer needs more RAM to be truly useful.
so far this computer is all I need I really needed the windows 365 to go with the class I have in school!! now I can complete my homework at HOME!! thank you amazon
Teridfic computer for my step daughter for college. She absolutely loves it. Light, perfect size, and speed are all great. Highly recommended for college students.
I just bought this computer for my daughter. IT so nice looking practical and work fabulously. She loves it so much that I am happy that I got it for her birthday.
I read the reviews before I bought the laptop.  Very good reviews.  Bought for my Son's B'day.  He is a student and his wife told us he needed one.  Hope he likes.
Lightweight, holds a charge well.  The space bar key sticks and the mouse pad has some issues.  The computer doesn't have much available memory on the hard drive.
touch pad reaction is so slow. soft touch is not so good.<br/>but good price for me. so fast on simple use.<br/>additional micro sd is needed. 32gb is so small.
I am a grad student who needs to carry my laptop everyday, so I bought this one, it's light and it works well except the touch pad, sometimes it does not respond.
This was a gift for my niece and she loves it! Its fast enough for her to search the web and write her school reports this came with 1 year of office 365.
If you are going to surf the web and use it to write documents, this is a good computer.  Otherwise spend an extra $200 and get your self a real computer.
Great computer just wish my 1 day shipping didn't take a month. I ordered another and it came the next day and very happy. Sorry I had to return this one
Quite happy with this computer. It works well for only 200$. The only real complaint I have is that the sensor pad is difficult to use. Invest in a mouse
Was a Christmas gift for a 54 year old who never used a computer before. She loved it, easy to navigate for her or anyone. She especially love the color.
The colour is fabulous but honestly the system itself could be faster. There isn't much storage on it but there's room for an SD card so that's helpful.
For all the people who say I doesn't come with a 25$ gift card, look at the instructions, you have to go to the site an activate it on the hp stream 11.
This is a conveniently sized, light weight, stylish laptop. I take it everywhere. Very pretty Ombre Magenta. Purchased one in blue for my niece as well.
The perfect machine for the money.  I use it for video capture and it works perfectly.  I admit, I would not try to edit on it.  The keyboard is solid.
It is beautiful, lightweight and slim, with a bigger screen (and better keyboard) than tablets have. Although, I do wish it had a ten key (number) pad.
It's a little slow but if you are willing to be a little patient and to use the cloud for storage then it's a great deal. The battery lasts many hours.
Unless you are willing to deal with the slowness of this computer, don't bother buying. It's so slow. I should spend a little more on something better.
Bought this Item for my granddaughter for Xmas & her BDay. Where is Gift Card that was advertised to be with purchase of this Laptop. Wasn't in box.???
Great laptop for just using the Internet.  Purchased for my mom and she loves it.  She does not need word or other software so this laptop is perfect.
I brought this laptop for school. HP offered a free Windows 10Upgrade. There is not enough room on this laptop for the upgrade. Truly disappointed me.
I really have a hard time using the touch pad. I constantly loose things I'm working on. It probably is my lack of knowledge, but I find it difficult.
The computer is pretty decent I own a MacBook and this hp is alot slower then the mac, I use it just for work and it serves the purpose for the price.
Perfect just what I was looking for!!! The color is beautiful , and the laptop is light weight. I only use it for school purposes and surfing the web.
Excellent value  Bought 6 to have for presenters.  Performed perfectly every time. I also bought the cases in the bundle deal and was equally pleased.
Great little laptop. My 8 year daughter loves it. She uses it for watching movies, playing games and word. I've had to order another one for a friend.
Laptop works great. Super fast. - I wouldn't expect to do any serious gaming on it... but for a work computer, you can't go wrong at this price point.
My daughter bought this laptop and she loves it, dosent have a lot of space on the hard drive but it does just fine for what my daughter needs it for.
Very good computer, recommended for kids or teens who just want something to browse on or write papers. I find it convenient and perfect in every way.
Very satisfied. Purchased to do work when I travel or work from the beach.<br/>Pluses: 13.3 inch screen is large enough for me to use and small enough to carry around. Powerful enough for home/ office use. Rapid start up due to solid state drive (SSD). Slim design and good battery life.  Purchased with windows 8 installed, upgraded to Windows 10. Clean install of Windows 10 works fine on this machine and actually frees up some disk space.  Near full size keyboard is a plus.<br/><br/>Drawbacks: no way to expand SSD or RAM.  You can put in a 64GB card to increase storage, but that is not the same as having a larger SSD.  Windows 10 upgrade requires extra steps due to small Solid State drive. Non-touch display is very legible, but nothing to write home about. Touchpad is usable, mouse works better.<br/><br/>Recommended.
usually a Mac person; trying out this HP/Windows device b/c it's 1/4 the price of the Mac alternative. Windows 10 is gonna take some getting used to.
My daughter loved this gift for her 11th birthday. The only thing that I didn't realize was that it does not have a CD-ROM player. But otherwise good
Decent laptop, sleek size, good battery life. Only downside is storage space is fairly limited but that's to be expected. I just use external drives.
I have had it for a few days and it is really nice for the price. It is easy and fun to use for occasional internet, email and Microsoft office use.
I love this computer.  It does everything my other computer did except it is much lighter weight,  As I get older, I find it easier to carry around.
I like HP laptop i got for my husband, but he hate microsoft not working so good like google. Google with my chromebook is lot of better. Thank you.
The battery life is tremendous.  It feels solid, makes no noise at all. After removing all the bloat ware and overkill HP software, it's actually surprisingly smooth and quick. I browse with 10-15 tabs open, I switch in and out of mail while having a few PDF's open and it never one froze or hesitated so far. The speakers are plenty and they keyboard is tight but feels good. The touchpad is OK, the gestures are great, just like a touch screen device. The soft click sometimes doesn't react right away but you get used to it. The screen is mediocre, but it gets the job done. The only complaint I have is that the keyboard isn't backlight and it's hard to see in dark rooms. The battery charges super fast and it wakes up in less than 3 seconds from sleep. For $200 I was blown away, this little guy is my new best friend!
Great product. I really just got this laptop after my old one broke, I needed something convent for school and other things and this did it for me!
I like this lap top but it was full of pop ups when I got it. There are a lot of things to removed. One person's review helped guide me through it.
My daughter needed a decent laptop for playing internet games and for school work. This laptop is a budget friendly solution for just those things!
Does everything as advertised, but it just seems a bit sluggish next to my similarly priced Chromebook.  Web pages seem to stutter when scrolling.
Great tablet for on the go.  Well it does everything for me.  Most the applications I access are wen based so I am not overloading the processors.
I bought it for my father who basically uses Microsoft Office, Internet and Skype. Couldn't be a better fit, besides and excellent price! Love it!
Its pretty good.  The windows 8 is super annoying though, Also, the touch mouse pad is not the greatest, but you know,  it's alright for the price
I am so happy with my purchase. It works perfectly, and Amazon shipment was smooth and fast. We are so happy with our hp stream 11 we got another!
The mouse pad on this laptop is not as great as other laptops I've had, but this is a quick fix by just connecting a wireless mouse to the laptop.
Gosh I love this computer. Its kind of small, but i like that in a computer. Litle slow at times, but all in all, good price for a good computer.
I could update Windows 10 with this PC successfully!  But due to the memory shortage of this PC, I had to use USB memory stick for this updating.
Very good for my purpose. A bit slow but was expected. I sometimes use an external keyboard because this laptop's KB is a bit too tight together.
Awesome laptop. I brought it as a christmas present for my little sister as an award for being on Honor roll twice and she loves every bit of it.
So far the HP stream 11 is so much fun and so easy to store everything. I'd definetly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a fantatic laptop.
I bought it for my granddaughter to use for school and she loves it, of course she is always on it , I would recommend this laptop for everyone.
It definetly gets the work done. Its pretty smooth. My only issue is the wifi keeps kicking off but its great for browsing and movies and stuff.
Not as I hoped. Really slow in its processes. Just using it for word processing, everything else lags more than you'd expect for a new computer.
Pretty decent machine. You get what you pay for. Works fine. Use Google Docs and Office Online for your files and you shouldn't have any issues.
We really enjoy the Stream. It's light weight, functional and looks good. So far it does everything I need and if I need more I just add an app.
I have for years thought I would hate having a laptop, but finally caved in.  I love this computer and it has been easy to learn how to operate.
When I received it and tried to download my data from Carbonite, it stopped working.  I did return it and received a prompt refund.  Thank you.
Bought this for my daughter to use at college, she loves it. Works great for her needs, note taking, writing papers, research and social media.
Bought for my 8 year old. He loves it. Just remember that this computer hardly has any memory. Had to purchase a portable hard drive for games.
Works very well. Fast running. I have some connection issues, but overall it's a great first starter laptop. I would buy it again for a friend.
Buy and use a mouse with this laptop and you will LOVE it. Don't buy a mouse and use the ridiculously performing touchpad and you will HATE it.
We have been loyal chrome book users for a few years now but ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!  The apps, speed, and dependability are spot on!
good for the price
Like the light wgt
I love it so far..
This product is like a toy.It's not what you see that you get. Don't even bother to purchase unless you are giving it to a kindergarten child.
Not at all what hp or Amazon promised It doesn't have enough memory to download Windows 10 let alone office 365.Wasted time with this product.
Huge disappointment. Money wasted. McAfee pestering me non stop. Extremely slow from the start. I haven't downloaded anything, memory 3/4 full
Windows 8 sucks- the computer in itself is ok but I can't even use it half the time because it keeps updating. only good for internet browsing
if you are looking for something basic but would not make your life basic, try this baby out! It's got everything you need in a small package.
The price was great and I love the color.  The mouse is a little slow and can be difficult.  We love that it is light and can be used anywhere
I love it. Light weight. Long battery and excellent price.<br/>Sometimes it's little bit slow but can't complain in view of the budget price.
Very happy with this product. Purchased for my daughters 10th birthday and she loves it and our works great.  She especially loves the color.
Excellent quality at an incredible price. Just what I was looking for. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Would definitely recommend.
A really nice smaller machine that easy to handle and works very well for<br/>Surfing,,,net,,,pic and music.an More...<br/><br/>Love it...
It's just like my desktop because I'm a casual user and only really organized my photos music and do Facebook so it does what I need it to do
Arrived very quickly.  Was very easy to set up.  A great little computer for what we need.  Liked it enough we decided to order a second one!
What they did not say was that office 365 is cloud based and requires a subscription. They did not lie, just did not disclose the fine print.
It's only been 2 months since I bought this product. barely used and it sit not charging. And now I have to pay to buy a charger. I hate HP.
Bought 13inch notebook for my teen daughter. I did not spend long hours deleting bloatware. It did not have any! Maybe HP listens to people?
I bought this for my son and I'm kind of regretted that I did. The track pad has low quality, the laptop performance is slow and unreliable.
Great little laptop, I would buy another. We use for our trips in our travel trailer. It is small and compact and does what it says it does.
It's ok but should spent more money and got the next size up. Dumped the office 365 deal and installed Apache Open Office 4.0.1 from Amazon.
im in love with this, have it for about a week and I have no problems with it... highly recommend it to people, its cheap and very efficient
Awesome lap top, fast, easy setup, slim and very user friendly ! Have recommended this laptop, to friends and family ! Very b ood purchase !
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She love the speed, color, easily connects to wi fi, keys are easy to use and she loves the size.
I was pleasantly surprised at how it performed as well as it was balanced when holding it. It works great, arrived on time...no complaints.
Good laptop for the price. Not much memory and too many apps on it already that are not needed but for the price guess you can expect that.
Gave me issues the very first day it would but turn on it took hours with HP to fix they were useless and kept transferring me. Never again
Love this little computer.  It does run low on memory a lot but great deal.  I think I will buy another for my daughter (11) for Christmas
Color is more pink than purple, not a lot of memory. For day to day use, it is sufficient. I am able to type papers on the go comfortably.
Very unimpressive,even at such a good buy.. thinking about returning after Thanksgiving.  Will have technology support over the holiday .
Greatest gift that could be given to a graduating teen.  The ease of use and the smile on her face is all I needed.  Spendidly wonderful.
Its beauty, brilliant color,  not heavy,  fast..<br/>I love it.  But the only think its had a litle capacitive in DDR..  BUT ITS AMAZING
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this. the perfect size for what I was looking for. I was able to immediately load windows 10. Just perfect for my needs
Came to me very fast, but the computer is very slow. The price is great. But it is so terribly slow that it is almost impossible to use.
I have had this for a few months now. It was super fast when I first got it. Now is very slow, almost painful. You get what you pay for. The hard drive is too small. After about 8 mts of windows updates the WinSxS directory is 9 Gb, you can't clean it up. Shut Windows Updates off! HP has no answer for this problem. I figure in another 6 mts this pc will not function.
I really like this little laptop.  Light years better than the ASUS.  Very easy to deal with and does what you need without much fuss.
Very convenient to have. I use it when I'm in work and i bring it with me anywhere I go. It's easy to use and I trust it to be durable.

Loved the light weight and durability of the unit. Compact, small enough to carry in backpack, and satisfied with the computer overall.
Bought this specifically for an online school platform, works great.  Touch pad is sketchy but buy a traditional mouse and it is great.
A wonderful laptop that I use for work when I am out of the office! LIke the Wizard Of Oz, it is a great and powerful little computer!
Again this item was purchased for my eight year old grand daughter.<br/>Ithis model was chosen by her father,and was a gift from me.
Just loving it.  So nice to sit in the living room and play my games and also check people on FB.  LOVING IT best money I ever spent.
great little computer, one drive is a bonus.I do use a wireless mouse as the touch pad is a bit flaky. but otherwise well worth $200.
Hard to beat for the price. Lightweight, quiet, and plenty of power/speed for general web-based use. A "Windows Chromebook".
Excelent, all my expectations were complied. Good Price, balance between performance and resources. Totally happy with the purchase.
It is such a very beautiful computer. I opened my package & noticed it was ombré as well! It's extremely light weighted. I love it!!
Low hardrive space is an issue. although you can save documents and music to a cloud, programs need to be stored on the hard drive.
love this laptop! I bought it and the VERY next day my parents went out and got one too! I got this because it was small and light.
Got this for my 13 year old for school work. She loves it. Screen could be sharper in my opinion but it doesn't seem to bother her.
Exactly what i was looking for in a laptop and price. Just not an apple, but I'm totally content with that. Just needs more space.
Best laptop that ive ever had . It arrived the same day that i ordered it and came in good condition . Its so slim and very nice .
It came in like-new condition, it has a very quick resume and power up time! The battery lasts a good 7-9 hrs. on one full charge.
It's a very nice laptop, easy to setup, just couldn't get used to it on lap. Always had desk. So I returned and got a 9" pad.
As long as you remember that it only has 2gb ram, it's a good value.  My only complaint is that the touchpad is a little glitchy.
Gave this as a birthday gift to my husband. He loves it. He likes the size of it and the white buttons are easier for him to see.
My first HP. A good purchase if you're looking for something very basic. I've had no issues with it and I'm happy with the price.
Great Computer , bought for my 12 year old Granddaughter for Christmas, great for the price but won't know how long it will last.
I don't like that you can't add more RAM...the Windows program seems to take<br/>most of the space and power of the laptop.....
This new laptop works just great and is so attractive in my favorite color; all my friends tease me about it but it's very nice.
Love this computer for the price. Works great. Ideal if you don't need lots of storage and want a portable easy to use computer.
Perfect for web browsing. Battery life is good. The body is sturdy. I only wish HP had chosen a slighty better LCD and trackpad.
I needed to purchase a PC to use my accountant's tax software (.exe file) and this fit the bill: low cost, but good performance.
This product does everything I need in a personal computer; web browsing, word processing, emailing and watching videos/Netflix.
Cute laptop. Very sturdy and well built. I bought it as a gift and it was PERFECT. I was impressed with how nice it actually is.
great little computer for the price.more than i expected.replaces my tablet because of the keyboard and mouse that i like to use
Nice and compact
Very nice laptop
Very good laptop.It's fast and I've had no problems with it. Love the bright color. It's great for getting my school work done.
I love my little computer.  The track pad is awful, but I purchased a wireless mouse. Everything seems to be working very well.
Love this computer however there is no memory on it.  I can't save anything to it because with nothing saved it is running slow
Great when it works but has a tendency to shut off doing updates then refuse to turn back on. Probably my last hp product ever.
This computer is amazing, even with such low specs. It plays most of my Steam games flawlessly I would recommenced it highly!!!
Great for what I'm using it for. Not as fast processing but do able. Good for students just needing it for papers and internet
It's a cute cheap laptop. Works pretty slow though. Good for people who just need a computer to pay bills and browse facebook.
Great little laptop. Purchased for my mother and she loves it. Very lightweight and great for basic use ..Facebook , email etc
Just recently bought this laptop and I  have to say for the price it is seriously worth every buck, amazing affordable laptop!
I realize this is a low cost laptop but I returned it. The picture quality is horrible. Otherwise works great and lightweight
Great Laptop! perfect for basic actions. Great look great price, keyboard takes a bit to get used to. But Window 8.1 is cool.
Bought an HP laptop and it started having heat problems. Took it in for warranty repair work for the same problem multiple times and it was never fixed. Now the warranty is up but it is still having the same problems. HP tells me they want to help me but all they do is offer to fix it for me for $200. I bought a lemon for $700 and HP could care less. HP essentially stole $700 from its customer. Do not under any surcumstance buy HP computers. They have horrible customer service and have no remorse when it comes to ripping you off. This is literally no different than having someone steel $700 from my wallet. As far as I'm concerned HP is a thief and a bully. DON'T BUY HP!!!!
It's exactly what I wanted. Reliable, affordable, and it's easy to use. I got it for my Mom and she is really happy with it.
don't buy it! nothing loads, nothing runs, if it was any slower it would be moving in reverse.  cute but not a good computer
Great computer! Like it better than my old computer. The new windows is great! Faster speed and the the battery last longer.
Bought 2 HP Stream 13 laptops for Christmas presents for my teenage granddaughters.  A BIG hit!  Fits their needs perfectly!
Beautiful laptop. Love the size and the color. Runs very smoothly. I would highly recommend for anyone wanting to buy this.
My son loves loves his computer. This purchase was perfect the computer even came with Mircosoft Office. Thank you so much.
Great product for the price.  However, be prepared spending time taking off a fair bit of crapware the computer comes with.
I've had this less than 6 months and have already had to replace the screen twice, and neither time due to physical damage.
It really needs to have more memory....<br/>but it is a good little computer. its perfect size, just needs more memory....
1. Lightweight<br/>2. Fanless<br/>3. Long battery life<br/>Helpful short video review:<br/>https://youtu.be/BFwj_YodkAw
Love it.  Its very light, compact and the keyboard is easy to use.  Better to have a wireless mouse for navigation however.
This item arrived right on time and my son had the biggest surprise now knowing that he is able to graduate from college!!
This computer is pretty. And light weight. And cheap. If, however, you are looking for a computer that will actually work and work well, this is not the one for you. It has to be within about 5 feet of my router to pickup the wireless signal. I have added my printer to the devices at least 40 times (in 2 weeks) because the computer just keeps forgetting it for some reason. The mouse is barely responsive and then too responsive all in a matter of minutes. The operating system is horrible. I bought this for my kid for school work and it's not even working for that. Shame on me for thinking a $200 computer would be usable. Saving up again to buy another mac.
I purchased this for my wife, and she likes it very much. Good price. Great for students, lightweight, easy to transport.
Love it... Love the color... The light weight of it is refreshing after using my heavier one... Love the ease of keyboard
Compact and portable.  Was easy to connect to home system.  Battery lasts for 8 hours.  it does everything as advertised,
Excellent Seller and excellent piece of advise everyone by this seller and give it the full five stars of a well worth it
great feel & look!  i'm a busy professional taking online courses & could not be happier...preactical & gets the job down
I loved it! It' so good! Loved the color and the system is very good and it's so cheap , it just doesn't have much memory
I bought this for my daughter to use at school and she loves it.  It is the perfect size and performs well for her needs.
I love it so much! It worlds so fast but you might want to by a mouse! The mouse pad on it sucks and freezes way to much.
LOVE the color!
touch pad awful
Like it so far!
Bought it for my husband, and he likes it very much. Great price.  Perfect for students, lightweight, easy to transport.
This is a fabulous machine and I just recommended it to a friend of mine, who is going to purchase one for her daughter.
My husband and I both have these computers and absolutely love them! They are super light, compact but also very usable.
Although I'm still becoming acquainted with this device (specifically Windows 8), I love the size and ease of using it.
I love this lap top.  The audio and video glitches.  I plan to return it for a replacement.  I hope the new one works!!
Really great little unit.  Windows based so no learning curve.  Probably never buy a full sized laptop again after this
Love the laptop. I only wish it had a better screen display..but that isnt the seller's fault... but its good for $200.
I loveeee this laptop very affordable and perfect for a college student like me!!
track pad is pos. click gives my fingers pain. bought Amazon wireless mouse.suggest other manufacturer for this laptop
Very happy with this laptop.  I write a lot so the keyboard is an important feature to me and this one does the trick.
Works for me. I work full time and am a college student at night. Works well. Starts up fast. Runs what I need it too.
Very nice laptop. My only complaint is the buzzing sound every once in a while when watching Netflix or playing games.
It works good. I bought it for my parents and it gets them online. That's all they needed. Basic computer, good price.
Love the color, not a huge fan of the mousepad. But besides that it does what it needs to. Great laptop for the price.
Awesome price, great product. Does everything I need it to do. Lightweight and Colors pretty exciting too! Five stars
Very good. Only thing is I wish it had more space on it. I need edit for school and it definitely serves its purpose
Totally satisfied with this laptop. It was on sale. My sister bought 3 & I bought one. They work great. No problems.
that good enough if you dont use a hard program (ex.photoshop )<br/><br/>but sometime played vdo on youtube is lac
Perfect. I paid 200 so not expecting the best computer ever. I got what I paid for and the value is through the roof
Nice product for it's price; getting used to new operating system and features (my other systems are WinXP and Win7)
I bought this product specifically for internet use and downloading my Rosetta Stone language system.  It runs great
Great price. Easy to navigate...even for a beginner. Seller shipped quickly. Excellent deal for a really good brand.
This is a nice laptop. It came even before the delivery date. It is a breath of fresh air when you open that hp box.
Great little laptop, could use a little more speed but does pretty good for the money. The battery life is amazing!
great $200 machine, would buy these repeatedly as they fit the bill for a portable lightweight inexpensive machine.
Omg Perfect little computer for me to carry around with me. And did I mention it is PINK! I am happy with it so far
Wonderful buy for the price it suits my needs and is extremely lightweight totakr anywhere I need to be . I love it
Absolute piece of crap! Can't even hold Windows 10. Don't waste your money I can't believe Amazon even sells this.
I like my laptop of course there are pros and cons. Like sometimes the audio skips and studiers. Not enough space.
Love this computer i am writing my review from it! Only wish it had a cd rom port but other than that it is great!
If I could give it 0 stars I would.  This unit will not download unless you have hours to spare.  I have Broadband
A good laptop at a great price.  Strongly recommend as second computer to help speed through various work projects
I love that it is very light and compact. It runs a little slower than I like, but is still perfect for the price.
I got it yesterday and just set it up but so far so good. Good value and works well for what I need in a computer.
I got my HP Stream very quickly and I'm loving it. I love that it's very light and the color purple is very nice.
I love the colors and the keyboard is soo cute and the 11.6 inch is perfect! for college and easy to carry around
It's a good little laptop. Very cheap and the mousepad isn't that great but to pay under $200 you can't complain.
This Hp stream is so slow and does not process quick at all. I would not advise any one to purchase this product.
This product always has pop ups all the time. Its really annoying and I wish I could replace it with another one.
Great laptop for the price!! Very happy with it The design. Lightweight, easy to use all for a great price too.
It's not the fastest or has good resolution but it is able to handle my schook work with multiple screens ope.
I like the laptop but it does his own thing, so i need to return it and get me a replacement of the same value
Love it. Small on data. Have to uninstall some preinstalled apps but other than that its awesome and I love it
Wow, shocked how well this laptop works. No complaints smooth operations and added devices worked Immediately!
Perfect for my son to web surf and play games. The memory sucks but the price is great for basic internet us .
Good laptop for the money.  Cheap, portable - works for me.  I added 64GB micro SD card to expand the storage.
I bought this little laptop for my school work and it's fast with a lot of features and the price was awesome!
This laptop is portable, inexpensive, and has everything I need for my daily use.  I love the cute blue color.
Love the laptop, its excatly what I need for school. The fact that it comes with the Microsoft 365 is perfect.
Purchasing this computer was clearly a mistake for me.  It is hoped that I will learn to like it, eventually.
Using it now to write this review. Enjoy the light weight easy use laptop. I added a 32bit card. All is well.
You get what you pay for, so no real complaints.  I really wish I had invested a bit more in a laptop though.
I love this laptop! It's a convenient size, works beautifully, and the battery stays charged for a long time.
Very light and easy to use. A must get netbook. Works with all hp printers and doesn't need a CD installation
THIS IS A CUTE PRODUCT. IT IS FUNCTIONAL IF YOU ONLY USE ONE PROGRAM. IF YOU TRY TO MULTI-TASK IT WILL CRASH.  I HAVE 2 OF THEM. THEY ARE OK FOR SIMPLE TASKS.  HOWEVER, EXTREMELY SLOW WITH LARGER FILES OR PROGRAMS.  I HAVE ADDED EXTERNAL MEMORY AND TRIED EVERYTHING, BUT ITS JUST CUTE.  I TRIED TO RETURN IT AFTER TRYING EVERYTHING AFTER ABOUT 20 BUSINESS DAYS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE EVIDENTLY 2 DAYS PAST THE DEADLINE.  WAY TO STAND BEHIND YOUR PRODUCT. ITS A NICE TOY.  I WILL GIVE IT TO MY NIECE AND ORDER A REAL COMPUTER. I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE HP SINCE I CAN'T REACH ANYONE NOW..
I bought this laptop for school to replace my bulky gaming laptop and I love it. It's light. Batteries last about 5-6 hours if I'm just writing papers and listening to music. 3 hours if I'm watching netfllix. Slick design. Not much computing power compared to my other laptop so it lags a little when you have multiple programs running, but that's to be expected.<br/><br/>I thought the Win8 touchpad shortcuts were strange and when I turned them off my experience improved.<br/><br/>Would recommend for everyday college students. Not so much for gaming, video and graphic processing.
I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!
Good afternoon I received the laptop hp but I had problems with it, goes out alone, restarts and gives error
This is a great computer for the price and size. I bought it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it!!!
Good price.. i love this.i blught this for my sister coz she need it to her school and she just love this..
hated it. hated everything about it. bought it used, it sucked. might be okay for a child but not an adult.
This computer works well. Lovely color. My only disappointment is that this does bot have a cd compartment.
It works great and shipped fast. It does everything we need it to do to watch movies on the living room TV.
I like it, i just learned that I'm not a fan of windows but if you are then this laptop is perfect for you.
It's fine for simple networking but it slows down pretty fast without using an external drive for storage .
Bought it for my granddaughter (age 8). She's very tech savvy for her age.  She loves it and it runs great.
Looking for a cheap PC for the cabin. Works great for emails,,surfing the web which iall I do at the cabin.
Nice visuals, keyboard very friendly to see and use. Lightweight for easy transport.  Definitely recommend.
Fast, easy, light weight.  I purchased an Acer at the same time -- this one is much faster, more efficient.
I love this laptop. The seller did excellent. And I like that I don't have to use cords to get on internet.
Its okay, but its taken me a while to get used to the different way things work... But then I'm old... lol
Great for teenage home work etc.... Same concept as chrome book but windows and upgradeable to windows 10.
It is easier to handle in a meeting take notes on it . Use flash drive transfer everything later. Love it.
Purchased as a gift, and it was well received. Not the most powerful, but very, very nice, and affordable.
Love it. Perfect for what I need. More than a tablet, but not really a full blown pc, great for the price.
I love the size, weight and color. So far easy to use, also a great price bought my son one for Christmas.
The touchpad sucks, but damn this thing is fast and the battery lasts forever.  Get a mouse and be happy!
small but terribly great! lets me accomplish all the things I need to accomplish! incredibly fast laptop!
Great laptop!
its very good
Quick and easy to set up. Used only for gaming and pic editing, this is perfect for our almost teenager.
Great laptop for the price. Being a broke college student this gets all my hw and didn't break the bank.
Great price, perfect for a high school student to get the internet projects done and check social media.
I bought this for my daughter. She loves it and with the office software included its great for homework
Horrible, computer's hardware shutdown within 2 weeks, I would not suggest anyone to purchase this item.
I was nervous to switch to Windows 8 but I LOVE THIS COMPUTER! It is very light weight and is very fast.
cute kids laptop that an adult could use beneficially. cheapest  great deal on  the market in computing.
Horrible. Came with 20 GB SSD and only TWO GIGS were free/available. HP was kind enough to offer Office 365 free for a year. However it it will not install because there is "not enough disc space". Called Microsoft- they said I was out of luck- even though I put in a 132 GB micro SD card- because Office 365 needs to install to C drive. Called Best Buy and they said the SSD could not be replaced/upgraded because it is soldered. Plus the machine will only recognize 64 GB of the SD card. Bad on HP-- they must know they are selling a useless device.
Love it! Great deal and price. It works very well for my online classes and it's light and easy to use.
My daughter loves this notebook, it is very light weight and does everything she needs while at college
My son fell I'm love with this tablet great sound n pictures quality easy setup best birthday gift ever
I am very happy with my stream laptop! I received it when they said I would. For the price it is great!
I would recommended this to anyone who is looking for computer to carry anywhere.  I love this computer
The netbook is pretty good but don't expect to start loading programs onto it. I tried to load the full MS office and the drive was so full I thought I'd wipe it and get the full 32GB back to install a clean version of Windows 8.1. Well that ruined the netbook, it wouldn't boot without virtual memory issues, and I had to pay HP $45 to get the restore software.  Buy is if you're only going to consider using it as is, with the web and office360 (if you still get that offer). It's painfully slow using it with programs but good for surfing the web.
Nice little computer only problem was wouldn't down load the free windows 10. Couldn't get it to work.
this laptop from HP is simply too good to to ignore if you're just going to use it for document works.
For the money, this laptop cannot be beat - however, it does have a very delicate, fragile feel to it.
For the money, this laptop cannot be beat - however, it does have a very delicate, fragile feel to it.
you cant redeem the gift card ive had it for 2 months and I cant redeem the card besides tht its great
Crashed multiple times and HP support was terrible.  The Amazon seller was great handling the return.
Should have known with only 2 GB...not worth the bother. It's gone down within one year of owning it.
Mom totally loves it, it comes with the office license, charger, manual, etc. A really good purchase.
Absolutely love this laptop! Perfect size for what I need. Very easy to navigate and very responsive!
the hp stream laptop is great i love it. It may be to small for some people, but for me it was great!
Perfect Laptop computer for traveling AND for using as my music player for the dance classes I teach!
Good baterie, is perfect for torrent download all night, this tablet have a very slow power consume ,
Not for anything heavy duty but it's good for my military email which is the sole reason I bought it.
Great laptop replacement for light duties but need a better tracking bad and removal of junk software
Absolutely love it.  Much more user friendly than my 6 month old Chromebook.  Sorry Google, HP rocks!
Slow some what hangs up but the price was right for a 12 year old and it is fun enjoy his frustration
Great laptop for the price. Touchpad doesn't work very well, so get an external mouse to go with it.
Very happy with it. He uses it for school everyday. It was the best present he got for his Birthday.
Lightweight, with a long-lasting battery and plenty of power for things like watching Amazon videos.
The first one that was sent to me didn't work, but Amazon overnighted me another one which is great!
Arrived in good time.  Works great for everything I need it for.  Lightweight.  Love the blue color.
Good "starter" computer for 6th grader who must submit typed papers at school.  He loves it.
No complaints At all . The blue is really nice I bought this for my little sister and she loves it .
bought three for my grandchildren they have not put them down yet!!! great deal and a great present!
Bought this for the wife as her holiday/work gift.  She's happy, I'm happy.  She's very, very happy.
I like this laptop. Been having some issues with it connecting to wifi, but overall I am satisfied.
Internet connection is not stable on this system even when you are sitting right next to the router
Awesome ,Very Lightwieght, For Ease Of Travel, And The Colors Fabulous, Very Pleased at Performance
Orhid magenta looked more desireable than what i saw when opened, pink. Other than that, i like it!
Was a gift for my daughter she is very happy with this laptop.  Using it for college and loving it.
I have already bought four laptops like those for my kids and they are very happy with the product.
I am really enjoying my computer! Its my first one and I am finding it very easy to use! I love it!
I received a laptop that had a Spanish keyboard. I am very irritated. Also the system is very slow.
nice laptop, it's just that you will need seperate usb or something since its storage it very small
Good laptop as far as what's advertised but not good for anything but Internet usage and Microsoft.
Awesome laptop for girlfriend who doesn't play games just uses it as a Facebook and Netflix machine
Satisfied so far. Took a while to figure out Windows 10 and navigating screens, but happy with it.
Bought this laptop for my son and he loves it, no fans to clean. The laptop is a really good deal.
This is by far the worse purchase I have made on Amazon.  Maybe I am not tech smart enough to remove all the stuff that was added, but this computer runs so dang so and I haven't added a thing to it and barely use it.  I want my chrome book back.
Works great ,the load speed is fast exactly what we needed works great for travel also ,good price
My Daughter loves her laptop and has not had any issue with it!  Thank you for the quick shipping.
It was very good deal. It's small and easy to carry it with me. Little slow other than that great.
This was a gift for my son, he absolutely loves it! He set it up all by himself, very easy to use.
Awesome P.C. Everything I need. Does everything the Big Boys do. I'm  hooked on H.P.and Microsoft.
It's Perfect
A little slow at times but good inexpensive basic laptop for surfing Internet and checking email.
Looked even better than I thought it would be . We thank God . This was a good item. Thank you!@!
Size and weight are great.  Wish it had more memory, but is easily solved with external storage.
Everything is working great and came on time. I would definitely recommend this seller and item.
I think it will do just fine for Skype n runescape. I bought a new one. So I hope it works well.
Great for first time laptops to study and view movies. Bought for my teenager and it works great
Wonderful little computer for the house and for a busy grad student - love it and so lightweight
Out of the box it looked like a winner - great battery life, lightweight, good value for screen size. One week after purchase -  it would no longer connect to the Internet. Appears to be related to the operating system and an issue with automatic settings to a proxy server. After several attempts at fixing, reviewing for spyware, resetting, returning to factory settings - just threw in the towel. For $200 purchase price it wasn't worth the time to try to fix anymore. Will stay away from hp on next purchase.
Not worth the money. Had it 2 weeks and already had problems with it. Screen keeps going blank whilst browsing even though the computer is still on and takes a good 10-15 minutes to reboot it. Can not connect phone via a cable to download music. For me the worst purchase I have ever made and I certainly would not recommend it to anyone.
This is a great, inexpensive computer.  Purchased for my son and it's been great.  No problems.
This was a gift for my granddaughter for collage.  She loves it she always has it with her.....
Great little laptop for my mom who is a senior citizen. It is a little small but will do nicely
Delivered earlier than I have expected and in very good condition. Good laptop for kids. Thanks
Our children have found that the system is efficient and adequate for all their many inquiries.
Birthday gift for my son- HE FLIPPED! GREAT Deal, quality  and cool blue color!! Thanks Amazon!
Unresponsive touchpad. Much like working on a toy computer,  but I guess I got what I paid for.
So far I love it. And love the software it came with.  I run a small business and it's perfect.
Bought for my daughter to use in nursing school. She loves the size and ease of use. Very fast.
Great Little machine. I bought this for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.
We bought this for our 10-year-old and are very pleased. Great laptop and an even better price!
Mines is blue but this is an alsome laptop and i recommend It to all of u.Hope yall buy it👍👌
These packaging was appropriate.  The product was as described.  The product quality was good!
Wife plays games and all her email and fb stuff on here, Keeps her quite during football games
Purchased for my Daughter, freshman year in college, seems to be working fine, she loves it...
Nice little machines. The HD is a little too small, but given the price, I am not complaining.
Love my HP Stream. Great to take anywhere and reliable. Perfect to surf the Web or to do work.
I love the computer I haven't had one  that work so fast.<br/><br/>  Thank you<br/>  Lewis.
Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  Super light.  Love the color.  A non-techie's perfect computer!
It brought big smiles for Christmas and birthday gift for my daughter. Great gift right price.
It's great, small, compact and very stylish. Great value for the bucks, nothing compares to it
Perfect for my use as a college student, the size is perfect for someone as on-the-go as I am.
bought this for my daughter,she loves it ,she takes it to work with her every day...tks...Pat
I love this computer. I use it almost exclusively for work and it is perfect for what I need.
Love it love it. It's perfect size allows you to put it anywhere without taking up much space
Great computer with all the up to date bells and whistles.  It's the only computer I use now.
Best computer I've ever owned. I get tons of compliments and it's super fast! Will buy again!
Would like to say Thank you!<br/>Works GRRRREAT!!! Tony the Tiger voice Frosted Flakes voice
I love this laptop. It came earlier then I expected, I would most definitely order this again
Bought these for my kiddos for X'mas and its there first laptop and  there gonna loveeeee it
Good laptop, with Windows 10 the computer operates slow. The computer is a good value though
Exactly what I hoped for. A small computer for my husband to use for web surfing and e-mail.
This is a great little laptop, I'm going to college online and this is what I've been using.
This was a perfect small computer for my daughter. Very simple to set up and for her to use.
Perfect for kids in school period.<br/>That is my case.<br/>My daughter love this notebook
bought for my college age daughter and she loves it . works great  for her college classes .
This is a terrible product.  Every time I turn it on something else is wrong with it.  We only use it for Facebook, citric and web browsing and it doesn't work well with any of them.  Constantly having to clean up and refresh the thing.  HP tech support was NO help.  I'd like to just throw it away and buy a Chromebook.  And windows 8.1 is a nightmare as well.  If HP and Microsoft are trying to drive business to apple they have succeeded.  You will be sorry if you buy one of these.
The Laptop works well. I had it now for about a month. It works well for what i need to do.
its okay. keep in ind there is no memory. good product though. i am satisfied for the price
Laptop was practically in new cosmetic condition and is working perfectly. Excellent value.
I received my laptop with a deficiency... left corner of my laptop was jammed. Not Cool yo!
CD drive would have been nice. I assumed it had one, but the merchant was honest. My error.
Great laptop. Only issue is the mousepad is very touchy. Other than that it's a great deal.
I LOVE this laptop, it can be a little slow at times but it's perfect. Color is also pretty
Kids use them for school and gaming.  They love their computers.  Daughter loves the color.
This is an awesome laptop i would recommend this to anyone.
Excellent item as described. Fast shipping. Great Seller. Good value. Buy with confidence.
cant really save things on this computer. should buy an external hard drive or flash drive
The laptop was received as it should, however, is very slow and is always getting stocked.
hp bloatware is too much. this is a good laptop, just make sure to run a deep clean first.
Love how light it is... picture is bright.  It is a little slow in loading, but that's ok.
Better than a Chromebook because it has a Windows OS and hard drive and comparably priced.
Does everything I thought.  My seventh grader loves it and I use it every once in a while.
holds charge for hours and hours ..stays cool..light weight..perfect for surfing the web..
Great computer for the price, just needs a bit more space and it'd be perfect for my needs
Lightweight and works okay but the screen is crappy, which is on par for this price point.
Great little computer just have to buy a dvd/cd external drive but other then that love it
The computer is fine.  I'm not crazy about the touch pad but everything works as described
Great computer. Highly recommend this to everyone. Fantastic price!!! Shipping was quick.
Prefect beginners laptop should had brought 64. My daughter is using it from home school.
Bought this for my mom and she loves it. Fits her needs perfectly and she loves the color
Not a big computer guy but this laptop is amazing and does everything I want beautifully!
Perfect for my daughter. Loves the size and ease of setup. Great laptop at a cheap price.
First laptop I've owned & it's perfect for my needs.  Family is also getting lots of use.
I love this laptop. It is so small and lightweight which makes it easy to bring to class.
Arrived on time and packaged well. I like HP products and so far it has not disappointed.
Decent buy ok deal I'm just comfortable with amozon could of bout this cheaper else where
There is a ton of adware on this laptop and my screen cracked really easily after a week.
Overall, I love the laptop. When I got it, I had to uninstall a few things I didn't need.
Love Windows 8  this is so easy to use--and so Light weight---great color alos  thank you
The laptop was everything it was described to be and is very adorable and size convient !
My 10yr old enjoyed herself, so easy to create pictures and school assignment! Great deal
Love it so far only had it for a few days. I might be back with a different review later.
I bought it for my Grandson.  It met all his expectations and he is really happy with it
Bought for my great granddaughter and she loves it. Does a lot of her school work on it.
I am very happy and delighted with the speed and service !!😃😃 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Worth the money. I'm glad I bought it and the laptop arrived much earlier than expected.
Good little computer. If you don't need anything fancy or with 1000 programs, go for it.
Great Buy I am very happy with my purchase and am completely satisfied with the product.
I received the labtop in excellent condition and my daughter is enjoying it . Thank You
I'm very disappointed it's not working right it freezes too much and the computer sucks
Its the perfect size I am very comfortable carrying everywhere and it has decent specs!
cheap, cool, easy to use, but does feel a bit cheap. I guess you get  what you pay for.
This was for a gift and she loved it. The color is very nice. Its light and comfortable
I bought this for my 12yr old daughter and niece for Christmas and they both love them.
Bought as a gift for my younger brother. He is highly satisfied and loves it immensely.
Love it. Money well spent. Fits my needs as a full-time employee and full-time student.
This is really good product, portable, better & stronger than I expected, so I love it
I love the sizes of my laptop and the color.  Will really come in handy when I travel.
Excellent service laptop is ok but for a value priced item it is probably exceptional.
Other than it is windows 8 - good little laptop. Perfect size to carry into exam room.
Love it! It's going to be great for schoolwork and surfing. Very thin and lightweight.
Nice laptop for price, but the font is sort of small, but other than that we love it!
Laptop is slow and runs out of storage quickly just from the OS alone. Waste of money
Bought this for my granddaughter for her first year at middle school. She loves it!!!
Great computer for the money works great and is easily upgraded for very little money
I love this purchase.  It is all that I expected and more, especially for the money!!
Fast shipping!.. Great inexpensive computer for my daughter's first year of college..
Great laptop for the price, I use it as a college student and I love the convenience.
why settle for a chromebook when you can get a windows 8.1 laptop for the same price?
This is overall a pretty good laptop except the windows OS for this thing is garbage.
Its OK. Great for typing papers, buying more stuff on Amazon.. Not great for Netflix.
very nice!  My kids love these laptops.  great laptops!  very happy with my purchases
Great product only thing  I don't like is that it doesn't have a lot of memory space
Excellent computer, I recommend getting an external hard drive to supplement the ssd
I love it, its almost everything i need in a laptop except for the space its perfect
My daughter loves her new lap top it was a perfect gift for my daughters 18 birthday
I love the light weight the most. No more carrying a heavy laptop to school anymore.
my daughter has not put this down since she got it, though i found it a little slow.
awesome portability and light weight for people traveling but a full service product
Really nice looking. Just bought it for my mom. Seems like a good one for its price.
Good laptop for personal use, very nice disign and very light weight. Great choice!
Couldn't be more pleased with this laptop. For the price, I am extremely satisfied.
It does everything I need it to do and at the price with windows you can't beat it.
there is not enough storage space to get your "free upgrade to Windows 10"
I got it for my mom and she loves it. It was bigger than expected which was great.
Takes a while to get used to the lack of storage if you don't already use a cloud.
I have never loved a laptop the way I love this, small ,portable and nice looking.
This laptop is perfect for my freshman college student to do papers and research.
I have had this a short time and although I am connected I can't open any program
A couple of the buttons don't work sometimes. But otherwise it's a nice computer.
As expected - very slow and cheaply built.  But it is doing what I wanted to do.
Completely unreliable. First OS crashed, now battery won't charge. Don't bother.
Fun little browser/word processor.Great for students and technically challenged.
So far so good. It runs really well. However, I wish that the volume was louder.
I'm not a computer geek. I wanted a simple computer system to keep finance transactions from general purpose Macintosh where I am all over the internet. Not sure if virus software caused the issue but consistently dropped internet connection while screen feedback declared "connected". No problem with 4 other mobile devices in home.Trashed it and bought a Chromebook ASUS which I will add my other 4 stars to.
UPDATED:<br/>It has a nice keys and cool colors, it would be a perfect laptop for those looking for a computer to browse the web and maybe house some LIGHT music. NO MEMORY. If you're looking to play a game like the sims 4, save documents, or have a real in-depth music collection you're out of luck here. This is a nice little computer, but it just doesn't have enough room for lots of applications or clutter. When I received the pc it was already half full with the standard apps that it came with. Also, for gamers or movie buffs, there is NO DRIVE. Meaning, you can't put in any discs at all. Just keep those things in mind before you pick this up. If you don't care about memory, or the missing drive I'd recommend it.
After upgrading to Windows 10 laptop no longer works. Laptop only 4 months old.
It's a beauty and I love it!! I can't wait until I get the Pink one for my mom.
Awesome computer. Great for everyday use and school! Would recommend to anyone.
It's not a toy like say other people, works very good all office and window 8😃
My computer came on time with everything to go with it. I love my new computer.
Very good computer!! Gets a little lagy sometimes, but so far it works great!:)
Easy to use. Small but mighty. I use this for school work. I am very satisfied.
very nice! very portable and light weight! great price to for including office!
THIS WAS A GIFT AND THE PERSON WHO GOT IT LOVES IT
This is a lovely light weight, fast laptop - it has renewed my faith in Windows 8!  Let's face it, Windows isn't as flashy or fruity as Apple OS, but in the HP Stream 13 I have finally found a laptop that zips along happily and allows me to use the trackpad without missing my mouse at all.  Especially if you just need something to do a little word processing and web surfing, this laptop is just the ticket!
Suits all of my needs.  Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. Thank u!
For $200 you cant go wrong. Use it for light programs and internet. No problems
I have had this computer for a month and I am already having problems with it.
Very good for its size and price.Only drawback is there is no dvd player slot.
HP's best budget laptop. Has all the specs one looks for in a mobile computer.
works well as intended, a little slower than I would like but constructed well. Everyone likes the color..
Brought for my littles, 13 and 14, to share. They love it. It is very portable
Great speed, wonderful color, suggest you also buy memory! Low storage ability. Downloaded Sims, no memory abd deleted 89 percent if apps.
I made this online purchase on behalf of a co-worker. Her and her son love it.
Love this lap top well worth the money I would buy another one if I needed on.
It's a amazing laptop. It is the best choice for 2nd laptop or for light uses.
Wife loves it! Couldn't be happier! Made her X-mas day! Arrived when expected!
Very light, functional, and productive. You should get one for work or study!
It is for my daughter. She loves it. Perfect for her school and her drawings.
I love it! Its lightweight and small enough with a screen that is big enough.
I think it'll be a lot better with windows 10. Mouse pad is extremely finicky
I like it only problem is the memory storage.  This doesn't have much memory.
Great computer for the money.  It works great with my Cricut Explore machine.
This laptop is awesome & I've recommended it to many people since my purchase
Very satisfied with the prompt delivery and handling. The product looks good.
Nice little laptop if you're not looking to download movies or play 3D games.
I love this computer! Lightweight,fast, and just as good as my old HP laptop!
Love it... Everything I wanted and needed. Great for school and everyday use.
Everything I wanted and needed. Easy setup, light weight, so far works great!<br/><br/>Edit: I started to use the laptop more now that class has started and I have found some negatives about the product:<br/>The memory sucks. Yes I knew there wasn't much memory on the computer when I bought it which didn't bother me; however, even when I completely cleared the computer there was not enough memory to download the new windows. This is a major negative to me.<br/>Second, the speakers are terrible. At first I thought it was my headphones so I bought a new pair; nope there is still cackling coming through and it is not much better when I use the external speakers.
Great deal my granddaughter loves it. It has everything a person should need.
Very pretty computer, solid. Easy to start-up. Perfect for my little student.
these were Christmas gifts for my granddaughters.  They absolutely love them.
Great little computer. Well worth every penny and more. I would have normally spent more on a computer cause " you get what you  pay for". I got a ransom virus on my old computer at a time when money was tight. I won't buy a brand I don't know and I have had HP in the past and have been wonderfully impressed. This one is no exception. And to top it off it came in pink and arrived early!!
Good laptop for young teen - but don't try using Adobe CS on it or anything.
The mousepad is sticky. It locks up alot. Other than that it is what it says
Is slower than I expected. But also smallest I've ever gotten so could be me
why don't they tell you have to have a mirco sd card to download windows 10?
Bought for my granddaughter and she is thrilled. She got what she asked for.
Perfect for my teenage daughter great for school projects and just for fun .
HP has put out a great product once again.<br/>A nice compliment to my Mac.
Nice computer but unable to get on amazon site With my regular password HELP
there are a lot of useless application. Remove them. Everything is perfect.
Just what we were looking for, the computer is amazing for on the go stuff.
Casing broke/chipped easily - software does not work well with Ugee Tablets
Better than I expected for the price! Set up was easy, even for an old guy!
Good price but you get what you pay for. This computer is slow and glichey.
Maybe i was having a bad luck but every laptop I received had issues w/ it.
I got it for my fiance. Not much memory, otherwise a great little machine.
Bought this for my 1820yrs old grandson. He loves it as his first computer.
Out of the box trackpad and wifi not working. Walked through hp troubleshooting and hardware drivers not installed properly. Not worth the time or trouble.
IT IS GORGEOUS!!!! And so light! I absolutely love it :D :D :D :D :D :D :D
No problems. Keyboard is excellent! Buy the blue case to protect the unit.
Very good, so far working great, I love batteries time usage frame. Great.
Light weight and works great.  Perfect for a mom and student on the go....
So far so good, just got it yesterday. Haven't did any homework on it yet.
I love it! Very easy to set up and use. I am very happy with this purchase
Bought for my daughter for college. She loves it. Will be buying one for myself  today!
I wanted something to replace my tablet and this little laptop is perfect.
Really can't beat it for the money. Bought two of them. Gets the job done.
Nice machine, very similar to a tablet but with more options. Easy to use.
Super fast shipping it is just as I imagined gorgeous color. Very content.
Just as expected for a small laptop, perfect for what I want a laptop for.
Wow I love this laptop it does what I needed for !!! I'm happy with it !!!
its great
Muy bueno
VERY GOOD
Perfect for my Grandson fits in his school back pack and easy to operate.
I use this for school and have no issues. Great laptop for a cheap price.
Perfect laptop! I have had it for 2.5 terms and it is still doing great!!
This was a gift and my Stepson appreciated and enjoys using this product.
The computer is good but is to small. I like it but I won't buy it again.
Great, inexpensive laptop.  Only thing lacking is an integrated CD drive.
LUV it ! Great for study and my modeling and even a little social hehe :)
Has everything i need. I can do school work and it has great battery life
very fast shipping... stylish and light-weight. my fiancé and I love it..
It's awesome I love it, I'm very happy with my new laptop. It's very fast
I love this laptop. keyboard easy to type on. The sound is great, The speakers are like high quality speakers, you can hear every little thing through them. I have watched movies, done homework, played games1 I have used this laptop for everything. For the price, you can beat it. It is fast and works effortlessly in between different functions. Gonna buy more for my kids!
You get what you pay for in this case.  Low on quality and features.
I bought this for my ex because it's so easy to manage and make updates.
Fabulous laptop! bought for our sons 11th birthday.  Wonderful system!!!
Perfect for what i wanted it for. Compact, durable well worth the money
Horrible!  NOT what I expected. SLOW and will not hold all that I need.
broke after 13 months, which just so happens to be out of the warranty.
Love it. Great product. Fast processor, clear screen, long battery life
Good quality all the way around. Would recommend it all the away around
I love this computer, easily portable, lightweight great little netbook
Great computer for a teenager to complete homework on and surf the net.
Loving this lap top, don't use it much so it works well for when we do.
I hate this. It's such a crap laptop.. If you could really call it that
It was a father's day gift for my husband. He loves it. Even the color.
A great laptop for general web browsing and everyday entertainment use.
Laptop arrived, turned it on, and keyboard did not work. Had to return.
This was for my gran daughter she loves it and thats what counts for me
I love it!  I like the color.  This is an awesome laptop for the price.
This computer is great for school and the color couldn't be any better.
Works well for me - would like the fonts to be a little bigger in size.
Love it. Light weight, arrived when suppose too. Office 365 works great
I bought it reluctantly for access to Explorer although I am a confirmed Mac user.  Am reluctantly getting used to Bill Gates' Microsoft again but as far as the HP Stream device goes; it is lightweight, so pretty to look at, and the small size is incredibly convenient.  Storage on OneDrive makes saving anything large no problem at all. Would definitely recommend!
An amazing laptop. It's perfect for me to do my homework on and I can Skype friends to work together on homework which is great. In order to share screens on Skype you have to download the desktop version of skype because the regular one that is already installed on the laptop does not have that feature yet. Overall it is a great laptop and I love the size of it.
it's good for you if you want to watch netflix or just doing some work
Great buy given the price and what it has to offer a school age child.
I like it except that it was hard to get used to screen size and print
For the price can't go wrong. Keyboard feels a bit cheap but it's goo.
Everything was fine, I will used amazon again. Keep up the great work.
Took a little time to get used to operating, but a wonderful computer.
Nice color. Light weight and good compact size. Downloads pretty fast.
Great computer just dont buy the spy ware that comes with the computer
Great portable notebook. The keyboard is great and comfortable to use.
Great product for the price.  I'm obsessed over the color and key pad.
This computer is great for basic use. It's very quiet and lightweight.
I had to return it, because it crashed, after I installed Windows 10.
Great price great laptop ! I recommend it ! In Love and I love pink !
Useful , strong, shock resistant case and sustainable color over time
It was everything I expected. Great color, works fast. No complaints.
My daughter absolutely loves her laptop my son also has the blue one!
arrived exactly on time! really as pictured. very fast, nice keyboard
Nice entry level laptop.  Lives up to all expectations and then some!
I would recommend my friends to buy it. It meets my purpose I bought.
I love it it's the perfect size and it's very light to carry around.
I bought this for my son for school.  A great buy for a great price.
Cheap, very slow only using it for research. Can barely handle that.
Perfect for my 6th grader! She loves it!<br/>Connects quick to WIFI
I love my new computer! its look and runs great! thank you amazon/HP
For the price works great, I only use it for school and it's perfect
I bought this for my 6 year old daughter as a present. She loves it.
It's an ok laptop, good to take on trips due to it small and compact
no issues, quick set up. great for a cheap word processor for school
Purchased for my 5th Grader.  Perfect for homework and web browsing.
What a great laptop/notebook for the price!  We had thought about buying a Chromebook, but are glad that we have this one as well.  Since it is a notebook and not a full laptop, it is mostly used for Internet access in our house.  Although we have yet to install Office 365, we have been using Google Docs in the meantime for my son to type an essay- this is a good option if Office 365 weren't an option.  Although it's not nearly as nice as my MacBook Pro, that would really be comparing apples to oranges, especially in the price department.<br/><br/>So, in all fairness, here are the pros and cons for the price point:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Inexpensive<br/>Great first laptop for an older child/tween<br/>Fast, especially on the Internet<br/>Durable<br/>Cloud storage and using a zip drive make up for lack of a hard drive<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Lack of a hard drive<br/>The display is not exactly amazing...the image is a bit blurry and undefined<br/>The mousepad can be uncooperative<br/><br/>We like this laptop and will use it for travel, when we don't want to bring more expensive or bulky laptops.
It was a gift for my step Son in Peru . He is very pleased with it.
I can find it possible to upgrade to Windows 10 with the small SSD.
I love the color. It's the perfect little computer for what I need.
My wife really likes it and it is easy to use.  No problems so far.
The size is perfect and the software that was included works great!
Nice little laptop for a good price. I've really enjoyed it so far.
Works like a dream so far its good for school and many other tasks.
It does exactly what it's supposed to do and it looks nice as well.
Bought it for my granddaughter. She loves it, especially the color.
Purchased this computer for my wife who was looking for a small laptop she could use for getting work done on outside of our house. I really wanted her to get a Chromebook but she was nervous about making the switch from her ASUS Laptop running Windows 7 to Chromium. As she really wanted a smaller windows laptop to do word processing and web surfing, I figured this laptop was a good compromise.  I actually purchased this computer as a Microsoft Signature Edition through Microsoft (little to no bloatware, etc) during the holiday sale for $199. I felt good about this purchase as this laptop was what my wife wanted (even if I didn't want it).<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- Battery life<br/>- Price<br/>- Size (bigger of the smaller units)<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Even with the signature edition, Windows is a HUGE resource hog. Computer was slow and would become unresponsive (crashed). Neither Microsoft nor HP could help or offer a solution.<br/>- Windows 8 not designed for laptops<br/>- Out of the 32 GB storage, little left after the Windows 8 install. Purchased additional microSD card to increase storage.<br/>- Windows Defender uses processing resources to run in the background<br/><br/>After using it for a week, my wife decided that she could not deal with the computer constantly slowing down or freezing.  Much to my joy (I'll admit), we purchased a Chromebook (Samsung Chromebook 2 XE500C12-K01US)  with almost identical specs as far as I can tell, I might be wrong so feel free to see for yourself. My wife still had fear of the Chromium, but after testing it out for three days we found the Chromebook far out performed the HP Stream 13.  It loaded pages quicker, opened word documents faster and it has been running flawlessly. For what my wife needed, web browsing/document editing, I believe the Chromebook was a far better purchase for the same price. The Chromebook was $240 but when you add in having to buy a microSD card the cost is not that much more than the HP Stream 13. I have returned the HP Stream 13 for a full refund to Microsoft.
Love it!
perfect!
Bought it for my son and it was totally worth the value. Thank you
Not enough power to even download a solitare game..  Window froze.
I like it! It performs everyday tasks such as surfing the web fine
Love it.  The size,  the color,  the functionality.  It's perfect.
Very nice computer for the money....Can't go wrong with this deal.
love it so glad I bought it does everything I need it to best ever
Incredible! I love it! I'm currently using it to write this review
very good attention and fast when making the shipment. I recommend
Really enjoy my small pink mini laptop. Fits just nice on my lap.
Can't wait to see my son's face when he sees what it is thank you
Most affordable laptop that is actually worth more than the price
Great PC for the money. But the screen resolution was quite poor.
I love it! Came on time, it's very compact and perfect for school
i love the big buttons and small size of this computer runs great
solid computer all around  Nice batterly life and functions well.
automatic virus as soon as opened. Slow.
Bought this little cutie to replace my old laptop. It's cute, sleek and simple!<br/><br/>PROS: you can personalize it, very portable, CHEAP, and has such a vibrant color. :)<br/><br/>CONS: It's kind of slow.<br/><br/>I mean, it works well, and is pretty fast so it's probably my internet..<br/><br/>I would recommend this.
Got this computer for a gift to my brother kids they love it !!!
I love this computer os helpful but it does not have much memory
Great light computer.  I am really enjoying my lap top computer.
Was a gift for a family member, works perfectly for their needs.
Love it, perfect for school and compact enough to bring anywhere
I love my HP Stream 11.6 notebook it's convenient and awesome!!!
Love this little laptop. I am even getting used to Windows  8.1.
It's ok.  Kind of cheaply made.  Wish I had made another choice.
Easy to set up, very user friendly.  Would definitely recommend.
Works great for me. Lightweight and easy to carry to my classes.
Bad, bad, bad.  I can not return because I live outside the US.
Lover my labtop great color and Internet speed...great for work
Great basic school computer for a college student. PRETTY COLOR
I am so happy with this computer, Easy to use and light weight.
best laptop ever so fast and the pixles are grood for the price
It was perfect for my 14 year old grand daughter. She loves it!
Very happy with it to bad it doesn't come with its own case tho
I was disappointed to find that I haven't been able to use this to connect to my TV to stream movies. This is part of why I purchased this.  I like a lot of the other features and it's super quick and compatible with a lot of apps. I just have to watch Amazon prime on the screen instead of casting to much 40" tv.
Difficult to set up.  Documentation leaves a lot to bedesired.
it is great but the mail dropped it in the dirt  and left it .
Not much space on computer. Get yourself a external hard drive
Not very easy to use when downloading pictures from a SD card.
Perfect laptop for a highschool graduate very light in weight.
works great I still gotten the hang of the different key board
Enjoying this product everything I expected it to do and more!
My granddaughter was very pleased. What she needed for school,
Inexpensive but does the job. Wouldn't ask for anything more.
It was exactly what i expected and shipping was great timing!
I've had this almost 2 months and it perfect for what I need.
for the price this is  surprisingly very capable...I love it!
Perfect but it takes about 10 hours to get W 10 loaded on it.
Perfect computer for me for simple task. Surf the Web. etc. .
I like the laptop however I hate the trackpad. I got a Mouse.
Laptop speed is good and very responsive battery life is good
Very fast for a laptop. Only thing is it don't have a CD-ROM.
Very slow, freezes up frequently. I expected more from an HP.
Daughter loves it this is what she been wanting awsome laptop
Great for simple use.  Could have better sound quality though
Great laptop for the price.  Does what i need it to and more.
Great quality for the price. Does everything I need it to do.
Got these for the grandkids for Christmas and they love them!
Happy, happy, joy, joy. This product is affordable, beautiful, and just the right size. HP superseded my expectations. 2 thumbs up. I loved it so much I told my sister about it and she also bought one. She to was very happy when her notebook came in. I am pleased and would recommend to my friends and family.
So lovely color :)<br/>Compact and light. I really like it.
functioning effectively, forwarded as a gift to someone else
Great product as advertised, fast delivery will buy again...
Incredibly slow. I guess you get what you pay for! Returned.
liked it but wouldnt hold charge and my movies kept freezing
Do not like windows 8 too hard to learn. I'm old school.....
Nice laptop. Keyboard has a nice feel to it. Would do again.
Good size.. Fits in my purse nicely.... But its a slow comp.
I'm a very happy customer very satisfied with my new laptop.
I got this for my mom and she loves it!!! Works great too!!!
I use it very little, but the little that I use it is great!
I've had this laptop since January and it was working just fine until recently and all hell broke out. It freezes up a lot. But since I mainly use my iPhone for a lot of things I'm not worried about it. I only got this computer because it was cheap I can type on it and do presentations that's about it
Shipped fast, love my new laptop! Super cute and affordable
A few problems with the touchpad, otherwise great computer!
Everything you need in a basic laptop. Also extremely cute!
Arrived on time, works amazing. Perfect size, light weight.
great product battery last very longtime best for the money
Exelent
I had my laptop in great condition and thanks for the gift
Well with the cost, it works great as a Mobil work device.
Is excelent, but I don't have the Office 365 for one year.
seems to work well for my college freshman grand-daughter.
The laptop itself is great and i will definitely buy again
Its amazing!<br/>And it's so lightweight and easy to use.
Excenlente product with good characteristics and low cost.
Incredibly nice and perfect for that price, I recommend it
Great really  enjoying  them  it has everything  i  wanted
I love my computer it works good for school and everything
A good experience with GNOME Ubuntu<br/><br/>First of all, thanks to Kyle. Your comments are really helpful.<br/><br/>I have wiped out the whole system and installed GNOME Ubuntu. The whole process generally went smoothly. I did not have those troubles that were mentioned in Kyle's comments. Maybe they have updated since then. In general, it is good under GNOME Ubuntu,<br/>applications runs smoothly. It is not fast, of course, and you can feel noticeable lags for the first time of running chrome. However, after the first few execution, chrome runs smoothly. I think it is because chrome synchronizes my profiles and plugins at the first couple executions. After that, it runs well. Again, it is not fast, but good enough.<br/><br/>I have also tried libreoffice, kile, textlive, and jabref.  For libreoffice and kile, they also have some lags for the first time, but after that, it is good.<br/><br/>There are several bugs, the trouchpad generally works well, but you cannot push the touchpad. Once you push it,, it may freeze the UI. But you can recover it by close the lid and open it again. You may also loose connection of WIFI, but I think it is fixable by writing "options iwlwifi 11n_disable=1" to /etc/modprobe.d/iwlwifi.conf (not fully tested yet).<br/><br/>For other things, battery life is about 7-8 hours, a little bit heavy, heavier than my Lenovo t440s. keyboards are comfortable.<br/><br/>In general, a good one, but it has flaws.
so far i like this device perfect size and very nice look
Just what they needed for Homeschool. No problems at all.
Awesome computer! And came within 24 hours! I was amazed!
The item was well package and my daughter love this item.
Fast delivery.  Perfect size. Works great. Great product.
Does what my wife wants it to do, email and web browsing.
It is very compact. I use it everyday. No issuses at all.
I bought this for my 9 year old grandson and he loves it.
Lightweight on my lap. Fully functional to meet my needs.
Great little laptop, except it is a bit slow when typing.

I love this Laptop. I have a desktop that has windows 8, but this one is so much easier to use. It is fast and I like that it doesn't have a fan, and does not get hot, no matter where I use it. Love this very much and would honestly say, its the best laptop I have owned.
Literally the worst..cannot even browse the internet.
This latop is perfect for me, I am satisfied with it.
Fabulous buy. I look forward to several years of uso.

It's great; does exactly what I need it to do.
we were not able to get the office 365 to work
excellent product, excellent seller, recommend
It would have been better if the audio system was working. I purchased this laptop as a Christmas gift brand new but the sound is not working all hp the tried troubleshooting it still to no avail no sounds. Im not happy at all.
I received the item with a lot of DEAD PIXELS.
Love the color and size. Perfect for school..

Good Product I would recommend this seller !!
Much appreciated, but happit with Windows XP.
Excellent product and  excrllent transaction!
Very good windows based laptop for the price.
Everything good but the storage 32GB not good
I'm extremely satisfied  with the laptop. ...
This is an excellent laptop at a great price.
THIS COMPUTER IS A COMPLETE DUD, EXTREMELY SLOW AND IT CANT MAINTAIN A WIFI CONNECTION. I WOULD SPEND A LITTLE MORE TO GET SOMETHING MUCH BETTER. AVOID ANYTHING WITH AN INTEL ATOM CHIP, THEY ARE RIDCULOUSLY POOR PERFORMING
My high school daughter loves it! She can take to school because it's much smaller than her full-size laptop, but the keyboard is normal size. Very happy I purchased the HP Stream 11 and would highly recommend to others!
For the money, it's not bad. If you want a laptop for just entertainment, then this is a good one. Windows 8.1 requires some getting used to, though. I'm not a huge fan of it. It's not awful, just not what I'm used to.
Very easy to operate. Has everything I need.
Do not care for it I hope I can get a refund
Got this for a gift for my BIL, he loves it.
Great computer for school. I love it so far!
The shipment came just as it said. I love it
works great, very satisfied with this laptop
I love it works great for what i beed it for
Exactly what I wanted. It's really cute too!
Amazing came so fast! And its looks amazing!
Excellent, very good buy. I highly recommend
It was given to me as a gift.  When it arrived there was a large crack in the screen.  Over night without being touched the crack continued to grow to the point where I couldn't even use the computer in the morning.
I originally bought the laptop so I could use it to go to school. I love it, it has everything I need & since I got in on the Black Friday sale it was cheap. I works perfectly & Im going to buy my mom a laptop soon.
The computer looks nice. It'd be better if it actually worked. Couldn't stop the popups even after installing a security program. Then when I updated it like the computer instructed me to do it didn't turn back on.
Not bad, kind of flimsy, gets the job done.
Order for gifts and I would order it again.
very good product. an excellent HP product.
This is amazing computer totally recommend,
best lap top i have ever owned!! thanks! :)
This is a really great laptop for the price
It is just perfect for purpose of buying it
This is nice it's cheep something for a kid
Great laptop for the price. Can't go wrong.
Very handy, yet much heavier than it looks.
I love it very much it fast and easy to use
I bought the Chromebook At first sent it back the following day . the computer it self didnt have Microsoft software or Any Office programs . I highly recommend this laptop it came with a yr of Office for free
I purchased this computer as a replacement for my 4.5 year old macbook which died suddenly.<br/><br/>Pros: I like the pink color. The laptop is very light and it was very easy to set up.<br/><br/>Cons: Overall, I am very disappointed with this product. I know that I shouldn't have expected that much from a computer that cost under $200. The computer also lived up to expectations (... complaints) that I had heard from others regarding HP.<br/><br/>It was very difficult to do anything on the computer without it slowing down. I bought an extra memory card but it did not seem to make a difference. Windows 8 was not the best, and anytime I tried to multitask or had too many browser tabs open, it slowed down immensely and told me that memory use was low.<br/><br/>Aside from the computer itself, I was very dissatisfied with the customer service from HP. About 9 months after purchasing the computer, I had an issue where the screen started blacking out and the machine would shut off, but still indicate it was charging. After attempting to contact HP for over 15 minutes on the phone, I was informed that even though my computer was under warranty, I would have to pay for shipping (and by shipping they meant that I had to pay them to send me a box that I would send back to them). I did that and a few weeks later received a call telling me that my computer issues were not covered under the warranty, but that I could pay to have them shipped. The caller did not give me his name or phone number, and of course we were disconnected. A few days later, I received my broken laptop back in the mail. The entire customer service experience was awful and something I did not experience with Apple or Toshiba (my prior computers).<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend this computer. Pay a little more and don't get HP!
So I wanted to love it but it should really come with a second micro sd card in my opinion. I deleted a fair amount of the bloatware and have found that there is not enough space for adding Office 365 to the computer. Needless to say I was disappointed.<br/><br/>Pros<br/>It is lightweight and portable. So for light browsing, small sized projects it is good. I also like that it has a good set of speakers included.<br/><br/>Keyboard and mousepad very responsive and typing and manuevering is as good as with any other windows machine. Quick sidenote about windows gestures  in general some of them are overly reactive to the user. So sometimes I do find myself switching between open applications without trying to which can be annoying but after you get used to it its not too bad.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>Storage it is limited. If you plan on adding and external hard drive to save files to or buying a micro sd then you should be okay. But make no mistake this is a machine that is not designed to have a large internal memory so keep that in mind if you decide to purchase.<br/>I'll be honest I havent been using the 1 TB Cloud Storage that it comes with via OneDrive. Maybe I'll give that a try and then update this review because so far disk space has been a little frustrating because I'm not used to syncing everything via OneDrive I guess.<br/><br/>The camera is average and the image is far from hd but you get what you pay for here. And for the price I can live with it. I can always record higher quality video on my phone.<br/><br/>Last but not least no CD drive... I know we're generally moving away from CD drives but I just bought a DVD for the first time in a while and I can't watch it on my machine like I used to. Annoying. But not a deal breaker if you have a second machine or can convert the video to digital copy. But still a hassle that is pretty unneccessary in my book. So just something to be aware of if this applies for you.
First--and a most important first:  the buyer has to accept the limitations of this kind of computer.  With only 32 GB of space available, it cannot tolerate whole lot of excessive add-ons.  It's really for a back up when the home computer is down, or one is wanted to bring to the library for work on a term paper or dissertation.  (My computer has the Hebrew, Greek, Russian language packets.)  The theory is that the "One Drive" will be utilized to access materials; material (work) will not really be saved on the computer but in the 'cloud' so they can be accessed from any computer.<br/><br/>The computer is fast to turn on, and accesses the internet through the local Wi_Fi network.  It will show YouTube videos--if there is a lag in the YouTube program--look to the internet connection.  I don't play games on my computer--so I can't speak to that.  I bought for the computer an Ethernet connection via USB port to increase its flexibility.  I also purchased a 64 GB microssd card for saving materials.  It's not a simple matter of moving programs to the micro-card; the registry cannot be modified for many programs to allow for programs on an external memory card.<br/><br/>The HP Stream 13 has available for free Microsoft Word 2013  program and includes I Terabyte of space on the OneDrive Cloud.  That is a lot of space.  My present materials are something like 6,500 documents using about 14 GB of space.  So its more than adequate.<br/><br/>But that 32 GB gets used up awfully fast.  So before adding programs willy nilly, look to see what Microsoft bloat ware needs to be deleted<br/><br/>Once the limitations of 32 GB is accepted, it is a good, economical alternative as a back-up computer when the main one is down for maintenance, or cleaning, or whatever.<br/><br/>But I have just heard some rather disquieting news about OneDrive cloud storage; according to the Micorsoft answer page, what is saved in OneDrive is also saved on the computer's hard drive.  That means, the computer ends up getting filled, and the computer's functionality is considerably decreased--to a point of almost being useless.  It seems the whole point of the Cloud was to prevent this sort of excess material on the hard drive, and that the material saved on the Cloud can be readily accessed.  And it turns out, that the format of the original document is not always preserved from one cloud source to another cloud source; in other words, the format saved on OneDrive will not match the format found on GoodgleDrive or Dropbox.  In the end, the machine becomes severely limited with this 32 GB.  In the end, one has to resort to the old fashioned method of saving material onto a flash drive and taking the flash drive with you to access material from one computer to another.  (Sounds increasingly, like someone has not thought through the concept of the cloud.)
I cannot with all honesty give this item even 3 stars. I purchased this item as it came highly recommended by PC Mag. I did a little research considering I am not a complete computer geek. My original intention was to buy a more costly and dependable item (which shall not be named here) but I ultimately decided to go with this product as I could pay off the bat for it and not owe anyone anything. My intention was to use it to complete my Masters as I am 7 months pregnant and can no longer sit up at a desktop all day. I will say this - you get what you pay for! Price = quality. What makes it so horrible is that they touchpad is ultra sensitive and HP attempted to make it a multi-touch pad which was a big mistake. I cannot type a paper while I have several windows open without accidentally opening PDF files and accidentally switching to my other documents. It's deeply frustrating when you've been sitting up for 5 hours trying to type a paper and keep getting disruptions and random occurrences in the process. Sometimes I press and button on the 'touchpad' and nothing happens. Then I have to press it again and again just trying to open the window. This computer does not have the ability to multi-task. Otherwise, software is superior. No problems whatsoever there! The main issue is with this computer are all the physical aspects. The keys are not meant for large fingers and the touchpad design is extremely inconvenient. I've had several other laptops and Acer's netbook was by far superior to this design. Battery life is alright but not for doing 5 hour case studies. I have never been able to write anything more than a 2 page paper before I have to plug in. This laptop is not for graduate level work. I recommend this product for a teenager girl just surfing the net or as a first laptop.
This is a decent little computer.  It runs well, start up and shut down are quick.  Thought it would be a good replacement for my Chromebook.  But beware, if you need support.  It did not come with the activation key for Office.  I thought, no problem.  MS's site says contact them and they will happily help.  They are wrong.  After almost 8 hours on the phone with MS blaming HP, and HP blaming MS, nothing was resolved.  Their final answer is that because I already have a subscription for Office 365 University, they just rolled the 365 Personal into that subscription.  However, the expiration stayed the same.  So they apparently took a year subscription away with no benefit to me, Decided to return it, and when I called to process the return, (figured I would give them one last chance, because most companies are usually pretty good when they are going to lose a sale).  They spent two hours trying to convince me that you don't need an activation key.  It is already activated when you receive it.  You just need to log in with your MS account.  The agent on the phone would not believe me when I tried to tell her that it still required an activation key.  (I tried).<br/><br/>In the end, I liked the system for what I used it for, but with them taking the Office subscription and not returning anything to me, that was a dealbreaker.<br/><br/>edit 1/2/14<br/>Got an update.  I was finally able to get someone at MS who was willing to listen to me.  They have issued me a promo code to the microsoft store so that I can purchase the Office subscription that was missing.  I appreciate them doing this, but it should not have been as painful as it was.  Because of this, I will raise the rating to four stars, because it is till a decent low end system.
Very nice product!<br/><br/>I purchased this for my 14 year-old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  It has a nice, sleek design.  Thin. Lightweight. Just the right size. Very portable (duh; it's a laptop). I love the color.  She wanted a white laptop but I could only find blue (thankfully her favorite color) and it still fits in nicely with her white/blue room decor. :)<br/><br/>Even without a touch-screen the Windows 8 OS works great.  She can download apps and play games if she wants. The sound quality on the speakers is awesome!  I also received a laptop for Christmas which has Beats Audio sound (great name; I do not understand the hype though).  I think hers sounds better!  I was a little jealous (jk)!  Seriously though, the sound quality is fantastic and can be loud with no distortion.<br/><br/>The laptop I received has a touchscreen and, to be honest, I use my wireless mouse and mouse pad more than I use the touchscreen.  I am sure this will change when I start to lug it around and use it as a tablet too but Windows 8 can work both ways and is quite simple either way.  I guess my point on this is do not be daunted that this does not have a touchscreen because it is still very simple to navigate and understand (do watch/read the tutorials if you have not used Windows 8 before though; I made the error of leaving a load of apps open and it crashed it and I had to reset it. At least I believe this was the reason; hasn't been a problem since I started closing apps. NOTE THAT I AM SPEAKING ABOUT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LAPTOP - ALSO AN HP (PAVILION) THOUGH.)<br/><br/>Funny story, when hers arrived, I loved it so much I had to search around and find another for myself (no more in stock on Amazon).  I found it, ordered it and then found out my husband was getting me a laptop for Christmas so I returned it.  I would have loved this one as well.  (I also love the one he found for me.)<br/><br/>She has not downloaded the 1 year free MS Office package yet (she is more into videos and drawing apps) but I am sure this would work very well. I'll update this as needed.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a review about the amount of space on the laptop, this is the wrong one to read, however, I can assume, since most storage is on-line now, that this will not be a problem for her pictures, apps, etc. I will update this as needed.<br/><br/>Anyhow, works great, wonderful for what she needs it for and I would recommend this for anyone looking for a thin, sleek, portable, awesome sounding (and looking), etc. laptop!
Love this laptop its small but works great
Love it! Perfect for going back to college

The memory is too small
This model does not accept the Windows 10 updates correctly, it always freezes partway... 8.1 was not good for non-touchscreen laptops. Don't buy this one, there's better for only slightly more.
It's great in all the ways it's advertised. Great battery life, small, inexpensive. RAM sucks though. I  can't even surf Tumblr, and that's pretty disappointing. This machine ain't got no juice.
Bought this for my mom and she loves it
Not very responsive only good for a kid
Great little computer for a good price!
Christmas gift for my son. He loves it.
Perfect laptop for my teenage daughter.
I've been on the hunt for a new laptop for what feels like ages.  I thought it would be a simple process and it's ended up becoming a true saga.  An 11-inch screen is just too small and the 15.5-inch screen felt enormous and not as portable as I  would like.  I took a look at this laptop and read "formortal"'s extensive review and decided to give it a try, following his guidelines for cleaning up the hardware.  It arrived in one day from Amazon, I took the advice in the review and I love this machine.  I really like the contrasting keyboard, the matte screen, the feel of the base and the whole look of this computer. I think it will be just perfect for everything that I need.  I'm not a gamer, hardly ever go to You Tube and never download from iTunes (yes I'm old!). I do, however, do a fair amount of web surfing, e-mail and document creation.  I'm very excited about exploring the performance of this laptop.
So far, and I will change this star at rating if I am finally able to figure out what I need - I am currently extremely dissatisfied.  I'm not the most tech savy person, so I read reviews online before buying this laptop and felt I made a decently informed decision- as its rated high everywhere unless you needed gaming, which I do not use.  I do, however, use ITunes and have a good amount of music.  When I tried to take my music off my ipod on to my iTunes, I was shocked when first night, it was ALREADY out of storage capacity.  I get that this was low money and now I realize was more of a net book than anything else, but the positive reviews everywhere to me saying it was great unless you needed gaming- was extremely miss leading unless I am missing something.<br/><br/>I saw other negative reviews later on storage and HP always comments with their number which I felt- ok great, nice<br/><br/>I just spent over one hour on my phone being connected to another specialist then looped right back..after I finally became somewhat frustrated but still remained calm and stated that they keep telling me I'm being transferred then asking for same info and saying transferred again, I was told it was bc of a high call volume and to call back.<br/><br/>Update:  I called back the next day, got transferred again, then told I had to PAY a support service in order to talk with a technician to discuss storage options.  I'm going to look into it myself and most likely return-  I used to hold HP to a good standard and have used them for years- after this- I doubt it!  Horrible customer service
Best deal out there on a basic machine
My partner seems to like her computer!
i really like the laptop its very nice
My son uses it for school great laptop
product as expected, delivered on time
Great price came in a day, works great

I like it but wish it had a DVD player
Purchased for my son and working great
light fast great product for the money
Great size, light weight,  eay to use.
My friend loves it good Christmas gift
Cute little laptop. Serves my purpose.
I actually switched to an Apple Mac book because of my horrendous experience with HP in the past.  To my disdain I have to have a Windows PC for a class so I figured this would be a good option for the low price, I was so mistaken.  After taking over an hour to uninstall all the bloatware I couldn't figure out why the track pad wasn't working until I started reading reviews about the inherent design problem.  Basically this is a laptop WITHOUT a track pad, I confirmed this by going to a Fry's electronics and using a display unit, same problem.  NON-WORKING track pad that glitches and skips on simple movements.  Whoever engineered the track pad on this should be fired.  I get this is a cheap laptop, but I am returning and getting the Asus which from reading reviews actually has a good track pad setup.  Only buy this if you like carrying around an external mouse.  Not me.
Beautifully designed, great price. 🤗
so far so good loving the pink color!
LOVE IT. & came in 2 days earlier. 👌
Horrible computer way too many popups

EXCELLENT PRODUCT,  EXCELLENT PRICE
Ridiculously bad. Ran slower than the ten year old lap top that I was trying to replace. Comes completely loaded with crap that slows it to the point that it's useless.
Good
Ok product but not really reliable
Perfect laptop for my 16 year old!
Great buy. Just needs more memory.
Great, I love it best present ever

The best NoteBook ever! HP Product
My mom loved it haha!! great gift!
perfect for what I was looking for
Works well for what i need it for.
Perfect size for work. Runs great.
Very light laptop and easy to use!
I received this computer today. On the positive side, it is small and light and the quality is ok. On the negative side, the screen is dull and dim, the processor is slow, and the styling of the computer is suitable only for children. I'm returning it and purchased an HP 15.6" laptop with a 500G drive. The screen and performance are far better, and the price was only $20 more.
It is such a great computer and at such a great price. If you need a computer and dont want to spend a fortune than I definitely recommend this one. I love it!!!!
The HP Stream is an absolutely incredible value for the money.  It's solidly built and looks and feels like it should cost a lot more. There's a lot of junk that comes preinstalled on it so you'll need to have some patience to go through it and clean it up. It comes with a $25 Microsoft gift card and Office 365 Personal with 1TB storage worth $70.<br/><br/>Storage is fairly limited at 32GB and Windows takes a good chunk of that. I originally thought it was an SSD but a helpful commenter corrected me: it's actually eMMC. Not on par with SSD but probably faster than hard drive. The keyboard and trackpad are both full-size and comfortable and easy to use. and The processor (Celeron N2840) is nothing to write home about but keep in mind that Amazon is selling this laptop for $200-$230 (as of Dec 2014). When you consider that it includes a Windows 8.1 license, Office 365 with 1 TB Storage and the gift card it's an absolutely incredible deal.<br/><br/>The eMMC storage makes it feel a lot faster than you would expect and it's perfectly fine for browsing the web, skyping, listening to music etc. It's got a micro SD slot and a webcam to round out the package.<br/><br/>This isn't a laptop you'll be happy using as your main machine but as a machine for a child it's absolutely phenomenal. The price is perfect and Microsoft's Family Safety feature is pretty good and let's you control access to applications and websites as well as to set daily usage limits<br/>For $200 this is a winner!
Perfect laptop for my 8th grader!
Very handy and I love the  color.

For the price it's a good laptop
Even though it is advertised at 32 GB it only has about 9 GB of usable space. Windows and the hidden recovery partition takes up 2/3 of the drive  Of course I expected to just add a 32 GB micro SD card as expansion memory. Well guess what that option will not work in Windows 8.1 I guess I will have to move the recovery to a flash drive and recover the hidden partition to have any workable space. Advertising it as a "32 GB" machine while technically accurate is really a marketing tool.The should have put a 64 GB drive in it and just charged more for it. This is barely usable as it is and if I want to upgrade it to Windows 10 in a couple of months I will need at least 16 GB free to do the upgrade.
GARBAGE. First of all the description states that this model comes with a 32GB SSD. That's BS, or at the very least misleading.  It comes with a 32GB eMMC SD card soldered onto the motherboard.  I went to upgrade the Stream that I bought my wife for Christmas because it ran out of hard drive space IMMEDIATELY, and even if I have to shell out money for a new SSD the price of this laptop still would have been worth it.  I dismantle the laptop only to find there is no standard 2.5" SSD drive, nor a port to install one.  Half of the 32GB drive is full with operating system, and 16GB is nothing in the days of phones with 12 megapixel cameras.  With no option to upgrade, this model is JUNK. Stear clear.
Came in time... I'm enjoying it

I was badly in need of a new laptop.  My old Dell had given me 5 years of loyal service, but it was clear she was on her last legs.  I first decided that I would try out a 'budget' laptop as I only planned on using it for the internet as well as Microsoft Office.  I then did quite a bit of research on laptops in the $200-300 price range, and all things considered, I landed on the Stream 11.  If you're reading this, you're clearly aware that it is rated highly by users, and most of the reviews elsewhere on the internet were favorable as well.<br/><br/>I placed my order in early January and received the laptop a couple days later.  I got home, unboxed it, entered my wifi password...and got nothing.  Oh, I forgot to install the windows updates!  45 minutes later the updates were installed, and indeed my internet worked fine.  10 minutes later though, the internet was once again unresponsive.  I have crummy Comcast, so I figured maybe its them?  Nope, the iPad & iPhone are connecting as fast as ever.  It's definitely the laptop.  A couple minutes later, it was again connected and running okay (note, this is all on IE with at max 3 tabs open...I installed Chrome and it was almost completely unresponsive at all times).<br/><br/>The laptop ran okay for the evening.  I setup my free year of Office (the main selling point for me), and messed around on it for a few hours with only a few connection issues.  Each time it wouldn't load a website, I was able to disconnect and reconnect to my wifi and it rectified the problem.<br/><br/>The next day after work I came home and logged on, and again, no internet connection.  Disconnect/reconnect didn't work, restarting the computer didn't work, it just wasn't able to pick up a signal for some reason.  I became frustrated enough to request Amazon send me a return label so I could be done with this annoyance.  I decided to sleep on it and see how it performed over the weekend.<br/><br/>It worked okay over the weekend, just the occasional connection problem.  However the next week, all the way to the present, the connection has been atrocious, and even the device's ability to run Office is pretty pathetic.  It almost never connects to the internet, and when it does it is only for a few minutes before I have to play the whole disconnect/reconnect game.  I've finally decided that it just simply is not worth the headache, and I will be returning it to Amazon in the morning.<br/><br/>I was excited to get this laptop, and I knew not to expect the world from a $200 laptop, but I at least expected it to outperform my 5 year old laptop that is essentially a paperweight...but it doesn't.<br/><br/>As I said, I'll be returning the laptop in the morning, and likely getting back on Amazon to search for something that may be more reliable.  I will likely up my price range, and will definitely not even consider an HP...I hear Acer has a few good options?
love the color of the laptop!
Great computer for the price!

Can't be beat for the price.
This is a review for people purchasing as a gaming laptop. People say this thing doesn't run mine craft well, with optifine, it runs on servers at short render distance and all graphics tuned down at 60 to 80 fps, I was so surprised by this. Getting into harder to run games, games like skyrim, when I first downloaded it and played the game, it was at about 10 fps per second, for me, definitely not playable, but, with all graphics turned down, and a vanilla texture reducer mod which was easily installed, I was running  about 30 fps! I was very pleased with this. The graphics were absolutely horrible, but definitely playable! With NO LAG!  I have yet to play some newer games like arc or the forest but I bet like these other games I have described they run fine with low graphic options. The best thing about this computer is the price! Another great part is that it is so small, I can play with it while in the car! Turn on my hotspot and I can take my office with me on a long drive anywhere! With very fast internet as well (determined by your provider)<br/>I hope you found this review helpful!
My 12 year wanted a laptop, and I thought this would be perfect forget, it's light weight and small enough to put In a backpack.
Understand that this review is for a full Windows / Office running laptop that cost me $180. First off purchasing retail Windows 8 cost $75 and 1yrs of Office 365 cost $100. Soooo a $180 laptop has $175 worth of must have software installed and comes with $25 microsoft app store gift certificate and 1TB of online storage.  The laptop has bluetooth, wifi, camera, usb ports, HDMI port and a SD card slot. The only downside to this super great offer is the small 32gig hard drive and for  $25 you can purchase a High Quality 64gig SD Card. Don't think you're going to load up NBA2K16 and play it on this bad boy cause you're not, but are you going to be able to surf the web, use email, load pc apps, watch netflix or other streaming media, do school work, and do some business the answer is HELL YEAH. I can't praise Hewlett Packard and Microsoft enough for making a laptop that just about anyone can afford. I purchased my daugher a chromebook last year and that thing was nothing but a toy. Don't let the happy colors fool you this little laptop is the prettiest girl at the dance for under $200 lol.
Great laptop for the price.
Great product, great seller
My son loves his bday gift.
Wonderful laptop for price.
My kid loved the computer !
Great item for on the go...
A great lightweight laptop!
Great laptop until it stop working after 3 months.  I was finishing a 10 page paper and lost it needless to say I was mad.
don't loose any paperwork !
This exactly what I needed.
Came on time price was fair
Works well for what it does
My niece loves the computer
After a month and a half it stopped working! So far I have not been able to return it because it was after the 30 day mark!!!!
I don't normally leave reviews because I can't be bothered to care about writing one. But after using the HP Stream Laptop, I need to tell the world that this computer is absolutely THE WORST. If I could give this product zero stars I would. The touchpad is terrible. I have carpal tunnel in my dominant hand and navigating with the touchpad on the Stream is really difficult and frustrating. Mind you, I use the touchpad on MacBooks and PCs and none of them give me as much of a problem as the Stream does. Navigating on the Stream is really annoying as well. Programs that I don't want to use open all the time and the programs that I do use disappear on me in the middle of important jobs. The Stream can't even keep up with me when I type.<br/><br/>Honestly if I wasn't forced to use the Stream because of my job, I'd chuck this laptop out of the 5th story window of my office building as it often makes me want to do. The one thing the Stream is good at is testing my patience, which I have none. Screw the price. Just save your money and get a real computer.
I am in love with this laptop!! it's everything I wanted and more. Highly recommend. The color is beautiful-perfect for me!
I didn't find much about this little laptop that I didn't like. It's a nice size for portability, the screen is a little too small for me because my eyes aren't what they used to be but that's no reflection on this unit. My daughter loves it and I probably won't be using it much now. The display is crisp and clear.<br/><br/>It has a lot of bloatware installed as other reviewers have pointed out, but that's easily rectified. Once I got it cleaned up it was much more pleasant to use.<br/><br/>I use it plugged in most of the time, but when I went untethered the battery life seemed to be good. It doesn't have a cooling fan so it is very quiet, but it barely gets warm on the underside.<br/><br/>It's a little light on RAM but functional. It boots up fast, I never had any connectivity problems.<br/><br/>The touchpad worked well for me, I've seen comments about the lack of real buttons but I never had a problem<br/><br/>It has a webcam which I never use, but it's a nice added feature. The free one-year Office 365 is a good added value, as is the 1TB of Microsoft One Drive space.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it as a great backup computer, or even as a primary if you're not a power-user. It's a perfect beginner for kids, too. The price point is excellent, $200 and shipped free, it makes a wonderful Christmas gift that will actually be used and enjoyed every day.<br/><br/>I give it 5 stars based on the value, you get your money's worth.
perfect for my kid's needs
great but too many updates
very good, rapid start up.
needs more internal memory
Very good laptop I LOVE IT

Thank very much. Love it
Just what  they  wanted.
Daughter gift  will love
I love my he stream, however  I have not  been  able  to  download  office 365 personal after numerous  tries!!
In theory it works. But it is greatly flawed. Purchased at Wal-Mart. When I first got it I was excited, it fit in my school bag, lightweight and battery life is awesome. But the mousepad was poorly made (had to quadruple click on things to open at times), the screen itself was not a good quality (had to strain eyes) and the Windows 8 OS had too many  "bugs" (I would be in one Windows and if I moved the cursor sometimes it would go back to the home screen). I returned it to Wal-Mart after 10 days!
love it and the 1 year subscription to Office 365 Personal
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! I am BEYOND angry! I literally received my laptop today; have not had it for a full 24hrs and already it has a virus. I upgraded to Windows 10 -as prompted-  and immediately got a pop-up chat window from "Jake - Microsoft Specialist" saying that they detected a problem with my PC and should call a 1-855 #. I contacted HP as I realized this was a scam. I was told a) I have a virus b) I can pay $99 to have it removed. HP and Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for selling such an unsecured product! I haven't even had an opportunity to surf the internet! Literally followed the initial set-up; Opened up the MSN homepage; Received the Windows 10 upgrade prompt (yes, it was a legitimate prompt); when it was complete, BAM! I have a virus. After spending $200 to purchase my laptop, I now have to shell out another $100 to repair a laptop I have only owned for exactly 7hrs. Ridiculous!
It's okay for the price
for the price its great
The listing stated there was a small scratch but that was not the case! The speakers are blown. Thanks for lying about your product!
Love, love, love this!
Perfect for the price.
its a very good laptop
I love my new computer
My son loves it!  👍👍
My daughter loves it!!
I purchased 1 for my children (11 and 13 years of age).  My daughter is on it more them the children.
This laptop was purchased for the express purpose of school work: Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. It appears to function well at first, but the extremely small hard drive (32GB stated, but you really get 21GB) will be 100% full within a week, just from Windows updates. Do not expect to be able to install any programs on this computer. I would return it, but the return policy requires it to have arrived "dead in box." It worked well when first opened, but I used the McAfee trial antivirus for a while before installing an antivirus of my choice. Now the free trial has run out, but I do not have enough space to install an antivirus program. I will never even consider purchasing a computer with a SSD again.<br/><br/>If you want a computer that will run great for a week or two, then become a $250 paper weight, this might just be the one for you.
This is my first laptop purchase, I have had a desktop for a very long time but I needed something small, not too fancy, and cheap (price).<br/><br/>I absolutely love this laptop, I thought I wouldn't care too much for it seeing as my options were limited in the notebook department but this lil' guy is great! Now I wouldn't game on this, but I believe it could handle games like... Minecraft on low.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't care for is the keyboard, something seems off about it. Other than that it's a great machine for its price. If you want something more powerful to do a little bit of gaming on the side I would recommend investing a bit more money into something with more ram and hard drive space.<br/><br/>It does although have some junk applications that I would recommend uninstalling for extra space for you. The battery is amazing too.
After reading reviews on amazon and other places I thought this would be a good computer to write my grad school papers on. I'm not using it to keep lots of tabs open while browsing the internet, but when doing research I do need a few at a time. This computer cannot do that. I purchased a 64gb micro sd card to save things on, as I wanted the SSD to be used only for the operating system and necessary programs. What I didn't know was that after you install the office 365 free 1 year on the computer it has almost no room left on the ssd to perform as necessary. I constantly get pop ups that my hard drive is low on disk space. There is nothing installed on the computer beside office 365 and the programs that came with it. This message continues to pop up even after I deleted a lot of unnecessary things on this computer. Do not waste your money.
I recommend to buy it
Really cute and fast.
Only one word: awsome
My doughtier Loves it
my daughter loves it.
My daughter loves it!
Great computer so far
I had to return mine.
Perfect for the price
Not very satisfying .
Well developed device
My daughter LOVES it!
Nice little laptop 👌
very good product!!!!
I love this computer.
perfect for 16 yr old
My daughter loves it.
Excellent.. I Like it
Great starter laptop.
very nice. Works well
I purchased this computer because my old one crashed. I read the reviews for this computer (on multiple websites) and they were all positive. Many people raved about this computer. However, I cannot download office 360-a program I have to have for school and work- and when I try to run multiple programs, like listen to music and research on the web, the music stops playing.<br/>I'm so disappointed
It runs slow and skip screens without me pressing button. The mouse pad is hard to click
Horrible computer don't waste your time. No storage barely can load any internet pages.
This is a terrible laptop. I would not recommend that anyone buy it. The trackpad is a total joke. I get so frustrated that it hardly ever works. I now exclusively use a wired mouse with it in order to use laptop. It does have a fast start up, but that's probably because I am too scared to download anything to slow it down anymore once running. Seriously, for a supposed "chromebook killer" it starts to run slow and lag if I have more than 2 tabs open. And I know it's not the Internet because I have 16mb.<br/><br/>Cons- needs a secondary mouse to function, slow, can't keep up with Internet websites, little internal hard drive space<br/><br/>Pros- awesome blue color, very lightweight, fast start up, free Microsoft trial, 100GB of cloud storage
Great for the price
Light for traveling
Love it! Thank you!
Excellent computer.
Daily use, LOVE it.
Excelent Product!!!
I bought this same laptop but with 64 rather than 32gb. You get what you pay for. And I didn't have much money left after my recent camera purchase.  If you don't like cramped. cheesy keyboards, you won't like this computer. That is my main disappointment. I may buy one of those roll=up rubber keyboards as an attachment, except this thing only has 2 usb slots, which may be expandable with an adapter, but then you think if it requires all these accessories, maybe it's better to find a laptop with the features you want. Just about every software with HP in its name can be removed from the HD, which will make it a bit less crowded. Good luck with installing MS office. As for photoshop or ps elements, don't even think about it.
Absolutely love it
very happy with it
great for my needs
happy with product
Daughter loves it!
It is a goods deal
What a piece of crap!!!!!  The cursor is always 10 seconds behind and looses its place.  The screen shrinks on its own....it will go from 100% (normal) to 25% just using the touch pad...the touch pad is extremely insensitive........need a mouse to navigate the screen.  As I am writing this, the screen is is 25% of normal because that is what keeps coming up.  It took me 25 minutes to write this review upon reading for errors.  DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER.  PIECE OF CRAP EVEN AT $199 TO $250.  iT HAS TAKEN ME 3 MINUTES JUST TO GERT THE CURSOR BACK TO THIS EMAIL!!!!!!  I know their are errors in this review....welcome to HP.  It has taken 35 minutes to type thids one review.  Piece of crap computer,
A+
It's been very difficult to use--  part of this could be my own user error, but I'm typically fairly good with computers. The McAfee software installed on it has been a constant battle with getting programs to run. I disabled the firewall once, but it keeps turning itself back on.<br/>Also, the 3 key fell of the 4th time I ever used it. :-( Crap
Gets the job done
Works great...!!!
My teen loves it!
Very nice LapTop.
I give it 5 stars
Needs more memory
excellent product
very good love it
really good price
LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.
Excellent choice!
As described A+++
Perfect first laptop for my daughter! And the cute color choice is perfect!
I ordered this laptop for my daughter. I am a very cautious buyer, I checked with my IT expert before purchasing it. He advised that it looked ok for refurbished and that he could do any set up necessary. I am happy to report that it came in great shape and my IT expert made certain that all of my requirements were updated. I wanted Windows 7 but he configured it so that Windows 8 that it came with, would be more user-friendly. He installed Windows Essentials and made sure all security codes were set and we are fully functional. She is happy, although she could have used it straight out of the package. I prefer to be overcautious but it works great!
My husband and I didn't want to spend too much on a computer for our daughter so we settled on this. It's so glitchy. The touch pad is horrible. I could name so many things about this computer I dislike but it's really not worth my time. Just wanted to give it a poor rating so others could see. What a mistake this purchase was.
Good overall but memory gets low quickly if too many programs run at once
I purchased this item as a college student on a budget. Since I knew I wouldn't use it for much more than writing papers and maybe a few hours of web browsing a week, I went for something cheap. It had its issues at first and it took a while to get adjusted to the speed some things worked (it was such a huge leap from my previous 800 dollars laptop) However after a while, it got better. It does what I need it to do, not to mention it's light and doesn't weight or take up much space in my backpack. I go tthe pink one so it's also very cute.  I recommend this laptop for people who are not looking to do heavy duty work on their device.
Great laptop!!!!
One of the best!
Excelent product
Loved it on time
Perfect computer
Perfect and Easy
So far so good. No major problems after 1 month. A little slow however.
The primary reason I bought this computer is because it came with Office 365 Personal. After downloading Office I couldn't open any of the apps (Word, Excel, Powerpoint etc.). After two days, waiting for, collectively, over an hour to talk to an agent and then close to another hour (collectively) on hold, and multiple transfers to different HP Support departments they couldn't fix it. Finally HP Support transferred me to a higher level Support department and they wanted me to pay for Support to make brand new software (right out of the box) work. I returned the computer mostly because HP Support would not help me.
I've purchased thousands of products from Amazon over many years.  This is the first product that has ever motivated me to write a review.  Please don't make the same mistake that I did and buy this laptop - save yourself the time, money, and trouble.<br/><br/>Absolutely terrible.  Worst computer I've ever used.  Touchpad is unresponsive.  Windows are slow and sluggish.  Memory came with less than 3GB of unused space.  Feels cheap.  I expect high quality products and outstanding performance from HP products - this is definitely neither of those.<br/><br/>The (little bit of) good:  Size, form factor, weight.
So far my 10 yr old is able to use this with ease and loves the size.
Love the color!
NICE VERY NICE!
Love it so far.
So far so good.
great, loved it
Awesome Laptop!
Kids are happy!
It is perfect!!

I love it! !!!

good computer!
I love it ''''
Nice laptop computer, but not enough memory or hard drive space. Battery life is great and keyboard works well for its size. Due to the low memory, the system seems to slowdown when many windows are open using IE. After installing a few programs, there is very little space remaining to store pictures and other user data. Must use auxiliary memory devices to supplement the internal hard disk space. The 365 windows and MS Suite works well, but the 1 TB stored in the cloud is not as easily accessed and useful as a regular drive.
We bought it for our son for his 11th birthday. He said it never seemed to work right and he stopped using it. I just spent an hour with Microsoft on the phone and they said take it to geek squad because it has many layers of malware and it is infected. Basically, it arrived with no virus protection and I suspect it arrived already infected since it has never worked right. Do not buy this product and do not use this seller!! BTW-microsoft tech support offered to fix it remotely for $200. How nice of them for a $250 computer.
The actual color is pink, not as shown. It also comes with windows 8 which is a mess.  After 10+ years of training<br/>their customer base to accept a top down user interface, Microsoft decides to move to an interface that is not<br/>intuitive and cumbursome to navigate and access all the things that Windows 7 has. Tried to go to the<br/>Microsoft website to see if I could download Windows 7, nope.  Insult to injury, you can only rent MS Office<br/>from the cloud for $69/yr,  what the heck are they thinking !
DO NOT BUY HP LAPTOPS.  READ THESE FORUMS.  THE LEFT HINGE WILL BREAK (PLANNED, FOR ADDED REVENUE LATER ON)<br/><br/>Per our discussion on 09/16/2015  you have declined my offer of:<br/><br/>Broken hinge repair at service center (only option available)  at 50% repair cost - - itemized below.<br/><br/>labor  $65.00<br/>Material  $164.99<br/>Tax  $19.51<br/>Total  $ 249.50<br/>50% off - - Cost to customer  (your cost)  $124.75<br/><br/>The above offer is the best I can do and is my final offer.

I ordered this laptop about a month ago. I do not do much with it. It is only used for school purposes and it began to malfunction as far as opening files, and mouse not working. I had to reset to the whole computer for it to work well again. It still has glitches here and there. Like I said it's only for school purposes, it gets what I need done. Not dependable for business purposes or anything like that. I did add memory to it and it still glitches. But it's gets what I need done.
Don't waste your money on this laptop. At first I was not sure on buying this product because of some people were saying it was not good, but I still give it a try because I couldn't afford to buy a 500 dollars laptop at the time. I only had this laptop for 3 months and it went off on me. I couldn't turn it on, I try to charge it and even went to see if I can fix it but they told me it cant get fix. save your money, it might look good with colors but it like a plastic toy.
great price!

This laptop is great... Well worth the money... 👍👌
It does the job but it's weird to get used to .  When I tried to upgrade to Windows 10, I had a whole mess of problems that resulted in me contacting HP and having them walk me through the process of setting back to factory settings.  It's great for your basics but if you're expecting more, then you might be disappointed.  I was hoping for the speed of a ChromeBook but with MS Office.  I got Office and the speed isn't horrible but ChromeBook is faster.
For what I bought it yes it works I just use it to upload photography & edit them. But it is very slow & after a week of buying it all these other sites start to pop up on my screen it's very annoying I can't really be on the Internet for too long because It is annoying. But for uploading pix and watching videos on YouTube it works. I like the way it looks it's very small and compact and it's cute but too many things pop up n it's slow
I am really disappointed in this purchase.  The device is VERY slow and is cheaply made.  My son took it to school and it broke in his bookbag going from the house to our vehicle -- which makes no sense.  I cannot say I am surprised, because of the cheap construction of the device.  I would not recommend the purchase of this device.  I am generally always happy with my purchases from Amazon; however, this purchase disappoints.
I love it..
works great
Super buena
Very useful
Cool laptop
Muy bueno!!
Very please
So far, the computer is perfectly fine and will suit my 9 year old's needs perfectly. I'm pretty irritated though that the box and packaging were already open, the computer had finger prints and dust/crumbs all over it and all of the labels had been removed. The sealed envelope for the office 365 subscription had been torn open. I bought a NEW item and I expected it to arrive in that condition. I'm pretty peaved.
I just printed the return label, using a different computer.  It connected to the internet the 1st day, but after that it wouldn't connect or would connect Limited, which is the same as not connecting.  After hours of trouble shooting & 6 different Blue Screen of Deaths, I finally called support.  They wanted $49 to help me get it online.  Unbelievable.  It's brand new- it should work or service should be free.
I like the computer itself.  What I didn't like was when I tried to use the code for free apps Microsoft kept telling me that my acct was created in another country and the code was invalid.  HUH?<br/>The computer is nice, it works (so far) and does what it is suppose to do (go on the internet).  If you are looking for something more powerful, don't look here.  If you want a cheap net book, this is the one.
File this under Weird.<br/><br/>Have encountered a PC issue unlike any other previously experienced, and so far have not been able to find an Internet duplicate or confirmation . . . and, yes, I CAN replicate the problem NOW after nine months of irritation, aggravation, and exasperation.<br/><br/>It's a TWO laptop deal; in fact, two identical HP Stream 13.3 basic laptops purchased last Christmas for the grandsons to use for school work, i.e., no way these rudimentary laptops are powerful enough for gaming. But you would expect them to boot, to run, and to stay running, right? Wrong!<br/><br/>Sit one directly on top of the other and almost EVERY time it will fail to boot, more precisely it will not come on, i.e., the "Power" light will not even glow. Sit it over on a surface by itself, or hold it, and it'll boot every time. While one is running, sit it on top of the other one and the screen will go off. Lift it a couple inches off the bottom one and the screen will come back on - instantly - and Windows will still be running. Still not surprised? The bottom laptop doesn't even have to be running or plugged in to its charger!<br/><br/>How did I finally track down WHAT was causing the problem? Pure chance . . . picked the top one up one day and it came back on! But a crazy thing or two was happening along the way to the circus . . . the boys would pick ONE up and THEY had no trouble! Yes, it was ME, but not in any way I expected.<br/><br/>What is causing it? My guess is something very similar to capacitive charging, i.e., wireless charging. Since the laptops are identical, they are perhaps "talking" to each other, and not in a good way. Heck, I'm no electrical engineer, I just report this stuff, you guys can sort it out! And, yes, I'll post a video later.<br/><br/>Woefully inadequate storage (32 GB); in fact, not enough available storage to apply the November 15 Windows 10 update.  Don't believe what it says about using an attached external hard drive or USB flash drive, i.e., even AFTER doing both, it demands more main (and unavailable) storage.  How did I ever think 32 GB of storage would be enough.
Junk. Keyboard problem. Slow response time.<br/>after 3 months keyboard begin to loose keys. You will have to hold key for 1-2 seconds before character appears. Problem began in the center of keyboard spreading all over. First was "i" then "t" then "l" and "f'"<br/><br/>There is an old saying, "I'm not that rich to buy cheap stuff" This is exactly the case...
I'm using it to write this review. I've had this netbook since the beginning of the year and it works marvelously. The color is gorgeous and the connection is fast. The only reason I give it four stars is because of the lack of disk space. It's expected for this type of device. However, I'm finding myself periodically searching for a newer, bigger laptop to accommodate the amount of space that I use.
The perfect laptop for kids who tend to destroy laptops.  It's cheap, modern and hardly worth trying to fix if it lasts more than a year.  The trackpad is a horrible thing, but that could be chalked up to Windows.  All my daughter's complaints are software related and have very little to do with the hardware.  Nice design and a noted appreciation of multiple USB ports.  Wish it came in better colors.
My high school is online it's called James Madison so I obviously need access to a laptop this is perfect for my school. The only downside is the mouse pad is annoying it sometimes stops working and you have to wait a few seconds and it can go a bit slow when I'm searching online only ever once and a while. One more downside is I don't like not being able to pop out the battery it bugs me
I was excited to get this laptop. I thought It would be a good laptop for school for the price since I'm on a budget. The problem with this laptop is that it seems as if it came with viruses! Whenever I go on the browser I constantly keep getting pop-ups and it runs really slow. I downloaded an antivirus software but it doesn't seem to be working (it was free). I wish I knew how to fix it
I was so excited to order this laptop, I was drawn by the color of it. Too bad because of weather conditions, it took a bit longer to finally receive it. Just like what I read in the reviews, there is A LOT of crap you have to delete off it in order for it to run well. Just got my computer yesterday and already there's a pink line down the middle of it -.- Not really sure what to do now.
We love it for our daughter (7 year old)...

This laptop is so slow that it makes you want to smash it against the wall.<br/>I removed all the crapware, installed Chrome. Browsing Facebook, Twitter and Gmail slows the computer down to a crawl. It has trouble SCROLLING webpages. CPU is almost always at 100%.<br/>Even Youtube playback is choppy. Netflix too.<br/>This is unusable. Don't buy.<br/>I would return it if I could.
While this laptop does not have a powerful processor, it runs very slowly, even when just using google. A friend updated this laptop to Windows 10 by clicking on the link provided by Windows through the OS. It took weeks just to figure out what was wrong because of the lack of HP support. The update actually fried the motherboard. Use caution and contact HP before trying to update.
This is a good idea, but execution is difficult.  It lacks a DVD/CD drive which makes downloading many of my software programs impossible without re-purchasing each of them.  That defeats the purpose of the low-cost device, itself.  It seems to lack capacity, although with the difficulty I have experienced downloading my needed programs, I can't really tell what the problem is.
The thing is loaded with so much crapware, it churns and churns and churns sending back who knows what information to who. I found ebay folders, and one for Target, and a whole slew of other marketing programs.<br/><br/>The hardware is decent, but you have to spend a day on a fully committed search and destroy mission to make it even vaguely your own or not a marketing tool.
This laptop came loaded with unnecessary crap and was quite sluggish right out of the box. This sluggishness was present online and offline. I've had it for 2 days and I am not impressed. Seller, packaging and shipping were all perfect. I will update this review if the situation changes...<br/><br/>Disclaimer: This is the most inexpensive computer I have ever purchased.
the mouse pad don't work. its too slow. and its too crowded with useless app and program. ( i wanted a laptop not another cell phone)<br/>its too complicated. too much going on.<br/>I have an android cell phone. I wanted a laptop to do my school work and research. this is probably good for games and music. Battery life is good. Volume is good.
This computer is nothing but a pretty face. It worked well for about a week before it started crashing. I was using it for work only and didn't search any inappropriate sites. Within two weeks I needed to take it into a shop for repair and they told me it would cost 200$ to fix. Spending 200$ to fix a 200$ computer is pretty infuriating. Do not buy this piece of junk.
This was Christmas gift for my 7yr old and she loved it!! My only complaint is after less than 2 weeks its already "memory capacity" warnings popping up due to the laptop coming with a lot of pre-installed apps that I deleted because she will never use/need most of them. Amazon was the ONLY place I could find this laptop and it arrived very fast! I am pleased!
Having issues maintaining the wifi connection. Since there is no ethernet you must use wifi.. I am not that far from the router and cannot maintain a solid connection

A wonderful, affordable computer.
First it wasn't shipped on time. Second it was damaged. I really needed a laptop for school and was excited to receive it but when I turned it on the screen was filled with black lines  and nothing would show up. Hopefully the return/refund process will not be a soul wrenching process as well.
So far, all is well with this laptop. ( I'm a single parent of a toddler, so my time is limited!) I like that it's fan-less and easy to navigate. It's light in weight too. I haven't removed the adware yet, but overall for the price, it's a good computer.<br/>The shipping was fast as well!

So far so good the reason I gave 2 stars is the storage is really really low. If you plan on downloading anything on here you need a memory card. I know laptops don't have much space but it don't have any hardy. But other then that it is a nice computer
Had it 6 weeks and had it in for repair 4 times already, including reloading to factory specs, totally clearing everything off and reloading all the programs.  Icons all quite working, not user friendly AT ALL. POS!!!  Wish I would have never bought it.
I just purchased my hp laptop and I can't connect to Wi-Fi. It's super cute but what's a laptop without Wi-Fi
This product sucks it come with Windows 10 upgrade. But what they don't tell you is that it not compatible with the stream. Then there idea of fixing it to backup to Windows 8. I may be wrong but you can't go backwards. HP will not take it back.
This laptop is advertised as having Windows 8.1 operating system.  In fact it has Windows 8.1 WITH BING.  The drawback to this (other than false advertising) are that Microsoft does not make this version of Windows available for download. If you wish to clean up a PC that is running Windows 8.1 with Bing, you will need to actually buy Windows 8.1 “Core” or Windows 8.1 Pro first.  I confirmed this with Microsoft.  I do have another option and that is to see if I can get a downloadable Windows 8.1 With Bing from Hewlitt Packard the maker of the laptop.  I see not way to get in touch with the seller of this laptop on Amazon so I am writing this review to let others know that you will be getting a different version of Windows 8,1 than is advertised with this laptop.  Do a search on this version so you can learn a little more about it if interested.  On the Microsoft site this laptop is at least advertised with the correct operating system.  On Amazon (at least with this seller) it is not.
It's a good notebook overall, the battery is excellent about 7 hours, my only complain it`s the touch pad.
Having used a Chrome book for years, I find myself struggling with the UI. My fingers could never figure which swipe brings me where. The keyboard is terrible. The purple machine has become a white elephant and adds color to my plain wall.
Cute and light but NO memory.  I saved 2 power point presentations and it was already telling me i had no apace. I guess that is why it is so inexpensive.  It is very portable and has long battery life. Also the mouse is difficult to use.
The computer has so little memory it is difficult to do almost everything. I bought an external hard drive expecting that to solve the problem, but I still do not have enough memory on the computer to even upgrade to Windows 10.
I love my laptop! Works exellent for the price! I would highly reccommend this for starters! WOW its better than my old $600 laptop!
I love my little laptop. I bought it to take with me on the trips I take for work. It is so portable and easy to use. I just wished that it had more memory.  But I bought an external hard drive to store extra files.
Save your money. Just got this today. The touchpad is horrible, extremely slow, no DVD drive. You're better off getting a full laptop. I don't even write reviews but this computer was so horrible. I don't reccomend
You get what you pay for...inexpensive laptop but it comes with a one year download of Word Office. After the year you need to pay a monthly fee or purchase Word. Wish I would've realized this before purchasing.
Nice computer. Surprisingly fast. After a week mine developed a green vertical line on the left side of the screen. It appears to be a manufacturing defect and Amazon has been very cooperative about the return.
Purchased two of these for my daughters (5 and 8) and they are great. Very durable and easy to use. My girls love them and I'm happy that they no longer monopolize MY laptop for their games and school stuff!
I have no complaints other than there is no CD ROM.<br/>This computer is not for you if you need to store stuff on it. I don't even have enough room to download Windows 10 on it. I still love it though!
I hate this computer. There is no space on it and I strongly suggest that someone not invest their time or money into it. I am currently trying to sell it or try and see into buying some more RAM for it.
Only reason it did not get 5 stars is because I thought I was buying a computer.. but this is just like a netbook.. My daughter can not download anything on it because the hard drive is next to nothing.
Nice display and comes with Windows 8.1.  Microsoft will update at no charge to Windows 10.  One problem, there isn't enough memory to update the OS. Buy an external hard drive and you'll be all set.
Bought as a Christmas gift  for my daughter. This is her rating. System is difficult to use.  She had to take computer in for troubleshooting and repairs. System is not a friendly user computer.
I purchased this laptop as a Christmas gift for my daughter who is a college student and she absolutely loves it. It is small and light weight easy for her to carry around from class to class.
Pros-Light weight, great resolution, colorful case.<br/>Cons-Windows 8, gets knocked off the internet connection each time Windows updates and have to go into settings again to reconfigure.
i love my new laptop

Very neat little Laptop for teen/pre-teen. The mouse pad could be  a little easier to use though. Excellent battery life, fast, light laptop. Advise getting a SD card for extra storage.
I wish the order puller could atleast make sure my blue laptop is not pink instead. Im sure it would make for a good laugh everytime I bring that to a clients house.Obviously Im a guy.
Good price for a regular laptop. Don't expect any hardcore gaming or editing. Delete all bloat ware and you got yourself a good laptop for Internet surfing and documents on the cloud
I struggled with what I would get to replace my netbook and I'm really glad I chose this. I also like the OneDrive much more than I thought I would (I love Google, hate Google Drive)
This laptop is the best!!!!! The colour is amazing and it very fast and light weight which makes it great. My only problem is i wish it was black and yellow GO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great concept for what it is but it had issues. Keys would travel below keyboard and get stuck and the rubber feet on the bottom fell off just from sliding it across a coffee table
I bought the laptop and havnt even had it 6 months and the battery will not keep charge. I can not find a replacement battery anywhere nor can I contact the seller to ask about it
Not what I expected
Didn't have the $25 gift card that they say that I'm suppose tobe getting.
Horrible. I've only had my laptop for not even a month and it stopped working completely. I can't click on anything, I lost all my files and projects for school. I'm not happy.
Con:physically weak!! Cheap outer plastic, I deeply question the durability.<br/>Why HP?<br/>Speed moderate.<br/>Battery life great..<br/>Pros: free ms office for 1 year.
Works as well as expected for the price. Is a little slower than preferred but it was only 200 dollars. I have had it for over a month and haven;t had a single issue with it.
The computer is not what I expected it to be.  I'm not really impressed with Windows 8.1, but that is what it came with.  I'll take my Windows 7 over this program any time!
I couldn't resist the price, I thought this would be a laptop that would get be through a couple semesters of online classes.  Boy, was I wrong.  This little machine won't stay connected to the internet.  Despite calling HP, my ISP, and doing diagnostics, it won't connect--I have no problem with my desktop and tablet connecting to my wifi.  This is going back.  Save yourself the aggravation.  Quite dissapointed--if I were able to connect and STAY connected to the internet, this would have been a decent laptop for my needs.  But I shouldn't have to make several phone calls and run multiple diagnostics on a brand new machine just to connect to the internet.
Lasted only 4 months before the crappy speakers magically stopped working, save your money and get the chromebook, much much better quality hardware for the same price.
This laptop is perfect for a college student. I do my online classes with it, and do lots of typing. This computer is super quick, and the build quality is excellent.
So far so good. Gift to son, opened on Christmas so haven't put through its paces yet. Fairly easy to set up, small screen (knew this going in) yet still easy to see.
The laptop is fine. Windows 10 not so. It hides all the apps you need and pushes all the ones you have to pay. After a couple weeks I have it almost where I want it.
Great little laptop.  Only drawbacks are no CAT-5 connection for inet, so you have to use it wireless and screen smaller than norm.  All in all a great buy though.
Sucks.  They keyboard continually sticks and cannot keep up with the speed of my typing causing many "backspace" entries.  Cheap machine.  Go for the mac!
Great computer!!!
It gets one star for looks!!! I HATE this computer.  The one I had was 6 years old, eating my power cords and getting slower, so I went out and bought this cutie.  It runs like an OLD LADY at a quarter of the speed of my old one. I don't normally write reviews but this son of a b word is going back to Best Buy; I'm so frustrated with it! oh, and the mouse pad, does all kinds of things you don't ask it to. Don't waste your time on it. Not worth the $229 I paid and I wouldn't keep if for free; seriously! Btw, I read the good reviews before buying.  Idk what they're talking about. I can't even run facebook on this thing!
It's not bad for the price, but the lack of RAM and hard drive are a little frustrating. However, I do like the streamlined size and ability to tote it around.
I like it. Great for taking to class and working on assignments.  My only complaint is that the memory is eaten up by all the pre-installed apps and programs.
Best chromebook if your child likes mind craft or robloxs.  Great for school. The aux jack doesn't work but that's OK because she uses bluetooth head phones.
I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and this is an amazing buy for the price. She is in middle school and will use it for homework assignments.
Excellent netbook perfect size the 13.5 screen is a nice increase from my Chrome netbook 11 in. and  everything worked right out of box easy set=up.

I ordered this item on July 21, 2015  Order# 110-5331106-3364209. This product was advertised as including One year of Microsoft Office Personal. For some unknown reason I was unable to activate this subscription.<br/><br/>It was my intention to purchase several more units but cannot do so until I can guarantee that the microsoft software indeed works.<br/><br/>Until I can get some assistance on this matter I have no other choice than to give this product One star.<br/><br/>https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00O65HZKS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc;=1
Lots of computers over the years. This has an OS that is absolutely not user friendly. It is W8.1. I had to get a geek to show me how to use it and after 8 months a blue screen showed up with words of warning and I called Microsoft. The person gave me advice that now has it totally screwed up<br/>and I will be forced to buy another one with good old W7 on it.  Amazon only gave me a 60 day warranty so I guess this guy is out the window for sure.<br/><br/>Really disappointed. HP shouldn't sell anything with W8.1 on it and HP should offer help if Microsoft won't.
Good price, solid build. Pretty slow if you open more than a couple of things, but, for $200, what do you expect? It's perfect for my 12-year old.
laptop is very nice and useful. new condition and fast one<br/>there was an issue with the office 365 installation and this is not so easy to use
For a laptop it's okay, but I prefer a desk computer.  I'll be satisfied to use this laptop until I can replace my fire destroyed desk computer.
Good machine and price point for email and internet browsing. I would recommend getting a mouse as the touch pad is a bit difficult to control.
Nice, no complaints other than The stupid interface that Windows 8 uses. I have my tech guys get rid of that back to the classic windows look.
excellent team, I have to mention anything negative moment, it works to perfection and the color is very beautiful. For me it was a great buy.
I purchased this for my wife and she was excited to get a nice pink laptop.  After setting it up she commented that should could not read the text so I went in to change the system fonts size.  No luck, there is a yellow exclamation that states that the screen will not let me change the fonts to a LARGER size.  Just does not make sense.<br/><br/>The HP website/forum is absolutely useless.  I would ask a question and they would complete ignore the "yellow exclamation point error will not let me change the font" part of the question.
We purchased this for my granddaughter's  10th birthday . She loved it very nice laptop for the price will be good for her to start out with.
I use this everyday. It's such a cheap but very amazing laptop. I am literally in love with it. If it were legal to marry it, I may consider.
After one month using it it stop reading the micro sd card that I bought for the space Issue on the disk, where can I get warranty in Panama
The time I got it in the mail was good.<br/>I like my new computer.<br/>I am having problems downloading the Windows 10 that was promised.
works great for our employees. Small enough to carry around. It does seem to have a glare problem but that is because we use them in trucks.
For a 200 dollar laptop I was surprised. It runs great it is completely quit due to the fan less design and does everything I need it too.
I got this for my daughter. It is quick and easy to use. As long as you have a Zip drive to save your work on this is the computer for you
This laptop literally has zero space. I know it has a smaller amount because the price is lower, but I bought this for my kids for Christmas and literally out of the box they could NOT use it. They kept saying it wouldn't load. I took it to my computer repair guy and he said I got screwed. I am very disappointed that this was their "big" gift and still 6 months later they cannot use it, it's sitting there brand new wasting space. DO NOT buy this - not for social media, not for Word, not for anything. RIP. OFF.
Bought this for a teen that normally kills computers... this computer has survived the test; and, it's still working!  Thank you, HP!!
Good thing dun
The HP Stream 11 reminds is me a lot of my old HP netbook. My favorite things about this computer is that it's light enough to carry around without the bulk. The machine feels as if it weighs two pounds total. It's about the size of an Amazon Kindle, and easy to slip into a medium sized purse or computer sack with no problem.<br/><br/>One surprise that I had: the laptop is much prettier than its picture on Amazon.com. It's a matted blue with a silver HP logo. The keyboard itself is a bit of a standout. When you open the keyboard, it is almost a sunset-gradient color (with a polka dot tech pattern).  Design is something that matters to me when purchasing a computer, and this one looks much better, and much more elegant that its picture would suggest.<br/><br/>Since this is a low-price machine, some of the high-end features are missing. There is no CD ROM/DVD player. The screen isn't a touch screen, and the mouse is not as sensitive as some high-end machines. The quick access buttons are also under the function keys too. Additionally, there isn't a keypad on the machine. It does have SD-ROM card slots, and USB ports, to use with your machine, as well as a headphones port.<br/><br/>My ultimate disappointment with the HP Stream 11 is not it's design or features; which I was satisfied with. My main problem is with the operating system that it uses. Although I like the design of this laptop, I don't like the Windows 8.1 operating system which is the antithesis of intuitive. Windows 8.1. was one of the reasons my new Dell laptop became a pretty paper weight, rather than being used daily.<br/><br/>Although you can access some operating system functions through going through the control panel, there are other functions that you cannot uninstall from your desktop (some of the bloat ware). Additionally, it basically forces you to get a Microsoft Account before setting up your desktop, and if you do not uninstall some anti-privacy features, advertisers and other third-party individuals will have access to your desktop. Savvy users should go through the custom install and ensure that these third-party groups do not have access to your computer. Another draw back for this machine is that it has a subscription to Office (for a year) rather than the ability to own the software outright.<br/><br/>I plan on installing Windows 7 (and when all the kinks are worked out) Linux Mint onto my new HP computer. I am going to use this primarily as a machine that I take to work, to write my articles on when I'm at work.  I'm really happy with the HP Stream, overall, but I plan to use a different operating system with it in the end. Three and a half stars.
Bought this for our 9year old daughter for Christmas. This is her first computer, she loves it. Nice size, very light weight.
looks amazing
HP Stream 11.6 Inch Laptop (Intel Celeron, 2 GB, 32 GB eMMC , Horizon Blue) Includes Office 365 Personal for One Year (Discontinued by Manufacturer)  I BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE MAINLY USED FOR CIVIL PRESENTATIONS VIA SCREENS OF SUCH. THESE ARE VERY UNUSED AND YOU GET THE STRAIGHT SHOOT FROM THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.  IF ONLY "PERSONAL COMPUTERS" WEREN'T AS DEALING WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF SHOES THAT REQUIRED TO BE TIED DIFFERENT FROM ONE JUST LIKE THE OTHER PAIR(S).
Fast processor and worked perfectly. I had to get used to windows 8, but it was fun to set it up for my nephew. Great gift!
Screen quit working after 3 weeks of having It. Can't return It to Amazon so tried to return it or get it fixed by contacting HP company and they want me to pay shipping which is over 30$. Don't feel like i should have to pay shipping for something that has a manufacturing problem! Took it to a computer repair place and they diagnosed it with having a screen manufacturing issue! HP should have to fix it at NO cost to me! Or amazon should have let me return it!!!!
The sound is bad, and I have to send it in to be fixed. I'm an online student and depend on my computer, so I'm not happy.
This is a great computer to have for your everyday needs and is the perfect size and weight and the color is really pretty
I love it! Mine just came in the mail today, and I couldn't be more excited to be the proud owner of an HP Stream 11!
The best computer value on the web.  Its the perfect computer for your traveling needs.  We love it.  Thanks Guys
I like it just wish it had a place for a cd. I did t realize it didn't have it until I went to try to put one in!
price was okay actual laptop was a little smaller than i expected laptop is better suited for a first time child
Great product! Seems very cheaply made, which concerns us, but had it over a month now with no issues thus far.
I love this computer it is fast compact and exactly what I was looking for at a price I could do, thank you!!!
A++
Yes
Having been an employee of HP, I can't believe this on the market.  Futile, fragile and feeble.  Do not buy.
Purchased for myself and so far so good.  It works as promised and was shipped promptly..no complaints here.
absolutely love it! i have no problem with it and it does everything that I expected. i am totally pleased.
There no complicated specification in this product I must say this is simple yet elegantly designed product
Waited 2 weeks for delivery which was Fine, however when I plugged t into charge the screen was all cracked
Bought for my  daughter, she loves it!<br/><br/>Neva Squires-Rodriguez<br/>Author of the Liliana Series
perfect for teens and the 365 office that came with this is PERFECT for high school and college projects
Love the HP Stream! I love how it is small and light weight. It will be great for when I start college!
Great price for an 8 year old. If anything happens to it. I can't really complain bcuz of the price.
We just bought this computer and it already has viruses. I am not sure how to get Spyware on to it.
Easy touch keyboard. Sized perfect for students working at home. Nice color. Easy to read screen.
We are returning this product. It never worked right. It kept going to a "black screen of death".
no comment
Best laptop I ever had sadly I had to sell it so I could have money to move. Wish I still had it
Very cute, very pink!! I love mine, the screen is a bit tiny but I knew that when I purchased it
A very nice inexpensive computer, This is a gift for someone who is just learning, it's perfect.
Worst computer I have ever owned. No storage whatsoever. Use my old one way more than this one.
Wish I could get a refund, has been a slow piece of junk since week 1. Extremely disappointed.
Very disappointing product. Nothing can be stored in this laptop. The HDMI port is not working
After removing previous version of windows I am satisfied. Could not fit Microsoft initially.
I bought this for my 12 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!! Delivery was fast.
It's enjoyable, lite, works well just don't upgrade to windows 10. Until the bugs are fixed
Sent back but not because of the laptop meant to order the touchscreen version worked great
Not enough storage, especially if you download Windows 10, it will take all of your storage
For the inexpensive price, this little laptop seems to be going strong. Works as expected.
We liked the first one so much my daughter in college bought one! Its easy to carry around
Great!  Used mainly for on-line activities, it is fast, and the screen graphics are great.
The computer doesn't work well. It moves slow, and app keep disappearing from the screen.
Great laptop, great price, Need more hard drive space though,,, but you get what you pay.
Was a gift for my granddaughter.she loves it.she is only eight but it works fine for her.
works great for couple weeks then stopped . We bought 2 same thing happen . Buyer beware
Very nice
Okay for my son but the mouse pad is wonky!! Had to use a plug in mouse for best usage.
Great little computer for going to college with!! It works well and gets the job done!!
The small HD is a bit of an issue, but as a first laptop for a child it works great.
Still fumbling my way. Am not very computer literate but Hp makes it somewhat easy
it's a really good product for school but the bad thing is it has no dvd/cd drive
Slow and when you get it it needs like 52 updates! Search around before you buy!
Very slow, many hiccups, low battery life. I have no idea how it got 4+ stars :/
Bought as gift for my son so haven't used it yet.  Very excited about it though
Good starter laptop.  Not enough memory, but for the price we can't complain.
I returned it.  It's an Internet PC and if you want to install anything on it buy a model with a hard drive.  It's meant to run off the Internet.  It has 5 gb of usable space.  It's good for the Internet but don't confuse it with a PC or Laptop that you can install software on.
My Granddaughter loves it.  Used it all Christmas Day.  She is 11 years old.
It's a great value notebook. Good price, size and specs. Fully recommended!
Excellent value. Perfect for students and home application. Cost effective.
I really liked the color and also it works really fast. I cannot complain.
I'm pretty happy with my HP. It came earlier than expected and works well.
this piece of crap wont play video, and wont update flash player.dont buy.
I ordered two of these and neither one would even turn on. Returned both.
Its awesome,  my firl loves it,  except I didn't get the touch screen one
It is ok but not what I thought I orderd.  Having a hard time using this.
Five minute set up right out of the box, and it works great!  Exceedingly pleased, as I am not one who is great with technology, and this little beauty proved easy to use and navigate.  Wonderful for taking to work and doing work at home.  Highly recommended!
ok
ok
Ok
Great computer for this price. Bought it for my niece and she loves it.
Excellent product and excellent service from Amazon.  I'm very pleased.
The space bar doesn't space unless you hit it hard right in the middle.
I love my new laptop! It's light, easy to access and perfect for work.
I loathe this. Just got it today and I want to SMASH it with a hammer.
this little computer is helping alot for my daughter who is in college
Super fast, very lightweight, and everything I had hoped it would be.
very crappy only 32 gigs of data might as well just use a flash drive
It's slow and has a lot of unnecessary pop up windows when not online
The laptop is great only thing is bad is the memory. 32 gigs suckkkkk
Awesome laptop!!! Purchased it for my 9yr old daughter for Christmas.
Love it
The compact size and easy to see keyboard were perfect for my needs!
Great laptop for the price, wish Windows 10 was installed by default
this computer just wasn't quite what I thought it would be.  My bad.
voice is too low,i can't hear anything and couldn't get replacement.
Great laptop. Have been using it since I purchased it. No problem.
this is a peice of junk laptop. save your money and get a good one
It not working right now. I have problem with it I need to fix it.
My husband loves his laptop and still learning how to work office.
The item is not fully working. I am having troubles with the wifi
Everything i expected! Its been a month and i have no complaints.
It is affordable. I only use it for school stuff. It's not heavy
Not enough hd space to complete the Windows 10 update. Returned.
Good quality. nice design, thin, portable, fresh, I had in blue.
Nice laptop. But sent me blue instead of the color I picked out.
I'm very pleased with the laptops I bought. Shipping was quick.
works great the purple is more like a dark purple but its cute
Beautiful little thing, but am having a hard time seeing......
good laptop do not expect the world from it and it is perfect
Does not work properly.  Cant even get to windows screen now.
Worst computer on earth.  Never used it after the first week
it is just wonderful. nothing to say! i fully recommand it!!
I got this for going back to college and it performs great.
This team came damaged , I can not use it because no lights
Delivery was right on time. Very satisfied with my product
I am very happy with my purchase of the HP stream laptop.
Very good computer for a student. I highly recommend it!
Super slow with Chrome and very low memory. Disapointed!
I;m not sure if it's me or were my other laptops easier.
Decent laptop for price. I expected better battery life.
It is just then right size and I am really enjoying it.
I had bad luck when I first got it I downloaded a virus
Everything came out well, a bit of a bummer on the space on it but the point for me getting this was to use it for school. So quickly forgot about that and was also able to get use to Windows 8.
It is what I like. I really think the product is well.
I gave it as a gift<br/>and they loved it<br/>Thanks
sound isnt ill that great but still an amazing laptop
perfect for my 9 year old for internet school stuff.
This is the best computer purchase I have ever made!
Purchased the HP blue for my teenage, she loves it!!
It is a great laptop and would suggest it for anyone
cool computer. I hate the windows though. terrible
I buy from Amazon and sudenly shutdown I need help
There is no one year free use of office suite 365.
Set up was easy and arrived earlier than expected.
the laptop is awesome. 100% recommended, all good.
Awesome Device; Everything checks out wonderfully!
Girlfriends loves it.. Perfect everyday use laptop
UPDATE (after contacting HP)<br/>This laptop is NOT meant for ANYTHING except SIMPLE Internet browsing & checking email (as per HP). It can't even handle the "Free Windows Update" it offers. This was confirmed by a HP Senior Case Manager. Even simple educational Flash videos drain ALL of the system resources- literally (98%). The HP senior case manager that helped me was actually VERY good. Unfortunately, the only resolution to this problem is returning it to Windows 8.1 and only using it for light use. We will have to purchase a completely different computer to run WINDOWS 10 & pretty much anything else. DO NOT INSTALL WINDOWS 10 & DO NOT USE FOR GAMING.<br/>.......................<br/>I bought this for my 2nd grader who is enrolled in Virtual Public School. I was looking for something light, easy to use, & portable. Having Windows 10 is important because it is the same as what she has been using since school started in August.<br/><br/>Windows 10 upgrade may be free- but there isn't enough memory on the laptop to install it. I tried SEVERAL ways (SD cards & USB storage, all large & fast enough for the upgrade). The update would be almost complete when it would notify me, without reason, that it would not work. I was eventually successful using an external hard drive.<br/><br/>This computer is EXTREMELY SLOW. I do NOT recommend this for gaming. EVERYTHING is slower, including the Internet (none of our other Laptops & desktops have this problem). I was able to pick up some speed by removing ALL system animations & other tweaks. It's still ridiculously slow- even my 8 year old knows it's abnormal!.<br/><br/>I installed a large, fast mini-SD card for extra memory. It's good for saving pics, docs, music, etc. I can't get the system to use it as default (especially for things like Windows Apps).<br/><br/>I wish I could return this (especially for an upgrade). This is honestly my biggest purchase REGRET on Amazon EVER!
Great
Totally average in every way.  I bought this slimmed down version of a laptop because I have been using Chromebooks for several years now with great satisfaction.  If you are just doing general browsing, online work, and perhaps some light office work, this seems like it would be ideal.  Really I should have known better.  I just don't understand how after all this time, Microsoft has not figured out how to build a high functioning operating system.  Its sooooo buggy.  So overbuilt.  How many buttons do I need to click to change some settings or turn off the computer?  Too many.  Do I really need a full version of Office (which is really only free for a year)?  The answer is probably no.  Unless you are doing really rich word processing, you will be fine with Google Docs or Open Office.  And if you really do require more computing power, you will be far far better off with a Mac.  I used to hate Macs until I worked on them for 2 years.  Apple may have many moral problems, but they know how to build a computer that functions very well.  As far as a lighter duty netbook, you will get far more for your money with a Chromebook.  The Acer 13 has THIRTEEN HOUR battery life.  When I was using it I felt like I could go days without charging.  Browser operation was smooth even when I was watching a movie and streaming YouTube in another window.  The HP Stream could barely handle one video not alone two.  It does have a nice keyboard and the machine itself is designed well.  That's where it stops unfortunately.  Bottom line if you are looking for a high capability machine this is not for you.  If you are looking for a streamlined long battery life netbook, this is also not for you.  Nice hype, but it just doesn't deliver.
It has a registry error and I can't connect to my wifi. I want to return this but it'll be such a hassle and I needed this for school work but it's 100% worthless without Internet connection. I regret buying this.
Very poor came with firewall issue cost me $109. I contacted support they charged me $109. To download movie maker and it never worked, no idea what to do no other recourse
I have had nothing but issues with this computer.
I received the wrong color but overall its great.
I bought this for work and I couldn't be happier.
This looks very nice. I just need one, will try.
Where is the code to activate the 25$ gift card?
Great value for the price. I would recommend it.
Because it not working. Can please money back.
Love this laptop- for the price- it is amazing!
Slow, slow, oh yeah... slow.. mouse had delayed reaction, I couldn't have youtube, word, and amazon.com up all at the same time without having something freeze...
Of course this will be compared to a Acer chromebook purchased with 2015 updates..<br/><br/>HP (or windows) tried to duplicate the chromebook by offering the same specs but the biggest problem is windows 8 doesn't run as good with these specs as the Chrome OS does. With word and the rest of the office sweet available on chrome now and the 1 TB of google drive additional (on top of the 100) storage for 2 years instead of 1 and free google docs, sheets, and slides as well as free unlimited photo storage for any pictures 5 MB (That's a big file!!) each, the HP stream can't compare.<br/><br/>Add in that the HP stream like any windows computer will slow down once you install programs on it, so your computer slows down once you start stacking it with itunes, word, a virus scanner and more. Actually, a lot of programs and game require more than 2 GB of ram, so you can't actually enjoy a lot of programs that you would on a typical windows computer.  I actually like the built in virus/malware protection for the Chromebook because it's integrated. The Chrome OS actually will rebuild itself (yes I'm a nerd) if in the future it ever caught a virus. I don't know about you but I prefer free virus protection and word processing and such for live instead of one year. It's kind of sad that the coolest thing about this is the color actually. If they could find a way to get all applications and OS to automatically update plus have no maintenance required like the chromebooks, I'd be more stoked but that's just not going to happen.<br/><br/>Stick with the Chromebook... the copy caps don't always do it better.
This computer was awful!! So incredibly slow!!
Amazing exactly what i expected. Great product
I love my new HP laptop . the color is perfect
Great! Quick delivery and product works great
I just brought this hp computer and I loved it at first. The mouse started acting up and now I can't even get on the internet. You get what you paid for!
Awesome look and very practical. Works well.
A gift for my grandson and he loves it.
awesome product at an incredible price!
Perfect partner to begin college with.
I love my magenta hp stream 11 laptop.
awesome produc at an incredible price
It's a great deal! And great quality!
Love it. Best laptop I've ever owned.
My grandson is enjoying it immensely.
Web performance was much slower than expected. Also came with a lot of bloatware pre-installed that slowed the system down.
Great little computer for the money!
speakers came busted .. ok otherwise
Love the laptops. Just what I needed
Very lightweight and easy to handle.
I am so very happy with my purchase.
My hp got to me very fast. I love it
Exactly what I needed for the price.
Nifty little computer for the price.
My sister give this as the present.
I love it. It's just what I needed.
Works great!! Just what we wanted.
Stopped working on 3rd day of use.
Does this computer have a webcam ?
Small but very durable. I love it.
I absolutely hate this thing. I have been on the phone with HP doing a complete system reboot, windows re-install, and it STILL doesn't work properly.  It crashes constantly, tells me websites are not responding, does not respond when I type or hit backspace.  It's just pathetic.  I bought this to replace my four year old Dell, and I think I'd have that back in a heartbeat!
Excellent seller.  I recommend it
Got for my wife and she loves it
is very good and is ese to carry
I didn't like the screen to dark
Very lightweight and very useful
Great laptop! Love the price too
All my kids do is play Minecraft
i love it nice christmas gift to
It works pretty well. I didn't need anything super nice to just do school work, so it works great for that.
Purchased this items as a gift for my Honey and he loves it ! Very compatible for the Xbox one . thanks !
The Office 365 product key I was given as part of this package did not work. I contacted Microsoft support and was told there was nothing they could do, it would need to be replaced by Amazon. However I was unable to find any place on the Amazon site to contact them for support or return of the software package as the computer was purchased over a month ago. I was in the process of moving when the computer was purchased and misplaced the office subscription until this week. The product key says it is good until December 31, 2015 so there should be no issues with its validity. Very disappointed with both Microsoft and Amazon for not providing a way for me to redeem my Office 365 subscription.<br/><br/>Also in general this laptop is very cheaply made and the touch pad is basically useless. It zooms out instead of in, on google maps it will continue to scroll in a single direction for hundreds of miles past the point I told it to stop, and I've had trouble getting the external CD drive I purchased with the computer to read the DVDs I've burned from my GoPro.
Great equipment for the price !
I bought my Stream Notebook earlier this week and am taking it back. every time I try loading a webpage, other pages pop up. it has internet explore and a proxy search on it. with being an online college student, this was a horrible purchase and I would not recommend it to anyone. I have been fighting with ever scene I bought it.<br/><br/>I cannot use the regular internet search to log onto the college website, I have to use the Proxy search, located on the top of the computer screen.<br/><br/>I constantly have ads popping up when I use the internet.<br/><br/>I cannot play the music that I put on the computer without having the flash drive that contains the music plugged into the computer.<br/><br/>I have an all-in-one computer that is used strictly for business purposes, both computers have the program ONE DRIVE, when i had both computers on, they synced together and now I am having issue with my business computer.<br/><br/>I strongly advise everyone to use caution when looking for a good laptop, and avoid this one.<br/><br/>Best of luck to those that have a Stream Notebook and to those looking for a good computer,
Works perfectly for the price.
Using for college. Works great
i  return this and buy another
Too small. and no cd /dvd port
Quit working within 6 months!!
Perfect first pc, great value.
Decent computer for the price.
Wonderful buy, 100% satisfied.
It didn't come wither Office.
Love it shipping supper quick
Great machine for the price.
My wife loves this computer.
espero con ansias su llegada
Very please with this unit..
The big problem is the 32 GB hard drive. The pre-loaded software takes up most of it, and most of it can't be deleted. It is hard to even use Office 365, which comes with a Terabyte of storage, but it can't sync with under 200 MB free disc space.  I use the work around of emailing things to myself.<br/><br/>I like the keyboard, and the speed of the processor. You have to like using the Microsoft Internet Explorer because there isn't space to download another browser.<br/><br/>I actually paid a little more for a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 inch tablet, to put things in perspective. I think the market for this tablet is older people who only want to surf the web,children who are happy with web games only and surfing the internet, and working adults who want something cheap to travel with, but they have a good computer at home to connect this to and transfer work done on it.<br/><br/>The speakers are good on it. If the storage were only a little larger this would be a wonderful laptop.
Men This laptop is the best
i bought this play games :(
Never got Microsoft office.
Great laptop for the price!
Excellent for my 11y son!😊
Complete garbage!!!  My IPhone out performs this laptop at everything.  The touch pad seems to only work about 50% of the time.  Wont even play youtube videos!!!  A purchase like this will most likely result in me never using amazon again.  I honestly cant think of anything this computer would be good for.  It cant handle facebook, twitter, youtube, or any social media website.  Hell It barely can handle amazon.  All I wanted was something that I could brows the internet with and this don't even do that what a complete waste of time and money off to the garbage with this thing.  Im canceling my amazon prime membership and never using them again because of clear dishonest sales like this.  How is this over sized Nintendo 3ds a top seller and who in their right mind would give this thing anything more then one star?  So disappointed in this purchase.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!!!
Just got mine. I'm in love
Its an awesome computer!!;
Terrific LP for the price.
ok wish i had more memory
return defective keyboard
I'm very happy and please
I'm using this right now!
Can you burn cds on this?
Perfect thank you Amazon
Great working computer.
Exactly what I expected
Daughter is very happy!
Love it kid friendly to
This laptop does not perform at the level I expect from a machine without anything hindering its processes. I am more than satisfied with the look of the laptop but the lag I experience while trying to perform daily functions is the only thing keeping this from being a four-star product for me. At the price, I'd say it has great functionality but could use a boost in RAM (about 2-4x as much) and it would be the most suitable computer I could find on the market. I have to say I'm extremely happy that this computer isn't as limited in capability as the chromebooks. The limited capability of those computers kept me from buying one for myself. I didn't like the interface of chromebooks at all and would recommend one of the HP Streams before a Chromebook any day of the week.
Great laptop for home.
unable to pick-up wifi
I absolutely love it!!
Mouse pad is too jumpy
Very Little disk space
Exactly as advertised!
It's very comfortable.
Quick ship no problem
love it. use it daily
My grandson likes it.
Great  work computer!
Just getting going...
l love my new laptop
Very heapful an fast
There is no CD port!
Perfect for college!
Very  good excellent
Bought this for my mom for Christmas and it's a pretty decent laptop for what she does (email, Microsoft Word, YouTube videos). Camera is okay, skype works pretty well, granted you don't have too much space being taken up by other stuff. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else who may be storing large files on it (music, movies, a lot of pictures, large applications like spotify tend to crash often). It's a good (secondary) laptop for taking notes on or light activity like what my mom does on it. If this is your first and only laptop I would suggest buying an external hard drive or some USB sticks to store all your big files on. My mom is happy with this laptop.
laptop is small, not heavy very slim. its good for student who are in college or high-school. only con is the space, its not enough for everything. overall im very happy with this laptop and i do recommend.
The computer itself is good. My daughter is using it for her first year of college. However, the computer was suppose to come with a $25 gift card stating "Buy apps, games, movies, music and more." First off it took months and many calls, chats and emails just to get the card to work, frustration does not begin to describe. Oh and it can only be redeemed on the computer bought (with my daughter in college out of state I tried to use it, but you can't, but they don't tell you that). Now I'm finally at her computer and if you don't own an XBOX the card is useless. Getting the card was a deciding factor when I purchased this computer. I'm disappointed.
Terrific laptop for my 14 year old daughter.  Would buy again.
Was an ok purchase!
I hate this laptop.
This laptop is really good for kids it is good for parents it is good for everyone it is ok for light gaming you can play hardcore games but it will lag a bit if you want to play call of duty it will lag it has 2 usb ports a headphone jack hdmi to connect to your tv it has an sd card slot you can get really cool colors I gat blue it works great it has windows 8.1 and it is awesome the keyboard is white it is really thin I have no negitives with this laptop it is fast everything you would need with this laptop it is lite I am writing my review on my laptop it is fast for typing writing documents everything it is awesome
Besides the super battery life, the lightness and the blue-ness it has nothing else going for it.<br/><br/>It seems storage is only free for up to one year? What does that even mean? No thanks. I'd rather get the Acer for 50 bucks more with 4GB RAM and 500 GB Memory. At least that has better specs.<br/><br/>If you want this just for school/college it isn't bad, but don't expect too much out of it. It's also kind of stuttery and I removed a lot of the crapware on it.<br/><br/>Also, its cheaper if you buy this thing from Walmart for 199$ which I did and I'm planning on returning it for the Acer.
Perfect and cheap.
Not enough memory.
Very nice and good
The computer was fast but had little to nothing memory!!!
I thought I had read enough reviews and tech specs to think that I new enough about this product to make a smart choice. It is a good lab top, lite, think, fast. Not digging the cloud storage but I knew about the limited storage space. With the limited storage space I mind I purchased this device (using it to write this review). However I wanted to be able to use my dragon software and now am perplexed about how to make it happen as this device does not come with a read/write drive. I guess I'll have to figure out how to transfer the program to a flash drive and try that......sigh.
This laptop came with multiple viruses... Buyer Beware!
It came with a virus and had crashed in the past month
was disappointed feels cheap and doesn't play cds/dvds
Great for college
Worst laptop ever
Terrific products
Very good laptop.
great and compact
The best and only thing I like about this computer is that it is light weight and easy to transport.  Unfortunately this computer has many things that I don't like such as:  the initial set up is an extremely long, long, process and it is confusing; visuals (pictures, movies, video, etc) appear in low quality and the volume is very low even when it is set on the max.  Also I thought that this computer would already be load with Microsoft installed.  Not so you have to buy it separately.  I would not recommend this computer to another costumer for purchase.
I think this computer was used.  It doesn't operate properly and has NO storage.  How can that be possible on a new computer?<br/>Very disappointed with this purchase.
Bad the sound is bad and the video play is bad also !
Very nice laptop
Never revived it
I love my laptop
Wife loves it !!
Very good laptop
Its fairly solid
Excellent gift !
I don't know who's fault it was but my HP Stream was infested with several viruses out of the box. It is possible that an offer to update Adobe played a role but I'm familiar with that company and it wasn't the only software that needed to be updated out of the box. Bottom line I went through a very difficult period trying to get the machine cleaned up. Part of the problem was that the machine showed that I only had about 500 MBytes of space free on the hard drive. I was finally able to free up enough space by uninstalling programs to get Trend Micro Maximum Security installed. Even then the "digihelp" virus reoccurred frequently; popups covering 2/3 of the internet explorer window. Finally a Micro Trend specialist took over control of my computer and corrected the problem. It took him about 2 hours.<br/><br/>Now, all is fine and over half of the HD is available.<br/><br/>I still haven't figured out how to register the computer with HP or gain access to the Office 365. I do have access to the cloud drive.<br/><br/>Not to pat myself on the back but I'm a retired electrical engineer with over thirty years of seat time writing flight critical software for aircraft software on windows machines. I shouldn't have had this much trouble.<br/><br/>The only way I could find the part and serial number for this computer was via an HP app. It may have been on the packaging but that was long gone before I tried to register. It is not visually available on the exterior of the computer. No manufacturing label, nothing.<br/><br/>All's well that ends well. I'm optimistic.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3/20/15<br/> I don't know what is causing it but nearly my entire SSD memory is consumed. I've uninstalled about everything with little success. I have Trend Micro Maximum installed and Chrome but that's about all. When examining the stored files I see a lot of suspicious  looking  ones but I'm afraid to delete them.<br/><br/>My wireless died and I got one of those USB gadgets to recover from that failure.<br/><br/>Based on my experience I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this computer.
It's amazing at this price point how much better my Galaxy tab 4 8.0 tablet performs compared to this HP Stream 11 laptop. also the screen on the Galaxy tab 4 8.0 looks way better too, sharp and clear. the screen and the viewing angles on the HP Stream 11 look terrible, it bothers my eyes after looking at it for a little while. Over all the HP Stream 11 performs ok but the display on it ruins what could have been a much better windows experience. In all honesty a tablet is the way to go now a days.
2 gigs of ram with windows 8 installed. Please.
Good for school
Perfect for me.
so far so good!
Connectivity through his wireless adapter. I spent two hours on the phone with him trying all the HP support site's recommended fixes right down to resetting the PC to factory defaults through Windows troubleshooter. It's not his cable modem or router because the computer with the blank screen connects just fine.<br/><br/>Is it possible to just cut to the chase and get a shipping label to return the PC for repairs without spending another two hours with HP tech support to no avail?
Not too great]
love it ❗️❗️❗️
So far so good
it's wonderful
Worked ok for a few weeks but then it wouldn't connect to the Internet. Too late now to return very frustrating & disappointed.
it was not what I expected I sent it back
Great so far.
Great love it
I was so impressed with this laptop that I bought two.  I only used it to surf the internet, do homework and watch movies.  All of a sudden the screen went black and it won't restart. I can see the cursor intermittently but that's it. I can't return it to amazon because I've had it for 60 days and upon googling the problem, I see that this happens pretty often with these laptops.  Very disappointed and out of $200 bucks.
Dear gents @ Amazon,<br/><br/>You will not notice the joy I felt when my kid ( 16 yrs old) was presented with this item as birthday gift from me. I think that, I felt more joy than him even seeing him jumping like an athlete warming up for the action. I will keep buying from you time to time as I wish.<br/>Many thanks, very merry x-mas and happy new year!<br/><br/>Mario Jose<br/>Luanda
computer great.  Tech support was ineffective for several problems.  #l  My passwords would not work on any of my accounts in spite of several sessions.  My last for 30 free tech support is tomorrow and that isn't enough time to get this settled, if ever.I would enter pw no good; reset good one time only, reset again, etc I am sorry to let it go but it is washed and in the box to be returned
Nice machine
Excelente! !
Very good.(:
I sent this to my sister in Arizona as just a light little computer for her to do Facebook, an occasional movie, etc.  She no longer uses it for that.  It is now working as the only computer in a full on factory!  It was donated by my sister and her husband's charity to their fabrication plant they have for out of work skilled laborers, and it is their only computer.  It's going strong!
The mouse was either defective on this refurbished model or is insensitive in all models. It didn't move smoothly, didn't highlight items in drop down menu when hovering over it like I'm used to, felt funny to the skin, and completely didn't click at the top of the pad. Some of this has been mentioned in the video review on this page. I'd prefer a touch screen or a better muse.
Incredibly underpowered machine. But then, what can one expect for $200.<br/><br/>I should first say that I upgraded immediately to Windows 10 so I cannot speak for its performance running Windows 8. Having said that - application load times were atrocious and even basic web browsing was difficult.<br/><br/>Item was returned due to underwhelming performance.
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT" Stopped working after 3 weeks and HP refuses to fix it unless we pay more than we paid for the laptop.<br/>The absolute worst costumer service ever(no one spoke English with any clarity). The screen started not working and they claim we broke it by what "opening it up" Will never buy another HP product. WHAT A SHAM
Excelent :)
good device
Excelent...
fantastic !
WORKS GREAT
good laptop
This is a piece of trash. My daughter wanted a laptop so I got her this. It literally took the whole day to get it connected to the internet and it never did. I was on the phone for 2 hours and still cannot connect. I have never gotten anything I liked from Hewlett-Packard. I should not have bought this expensive piece of trash. Caveat emptor.
Great laptop received very quickly and I am sure that my daughter will love this on Christmas
I'll admit I bought this primarily becasue of the color. I don't like the way the apps interact, and of course there's no Word and not much internal memory. I also can't figure out how to save my photos from my phone onto the laptop. I use this to surf the net and occasionally watch Netflix. Can't watch Prime on this either.
perfect!!!
WORKS WELL
LOVE IT!!!
I love it.
Not at all satisfied. I bought it so I could Skype, and it doesnt work, which was the complaint of anyone who tried to Skype..It says that is is an outdated version and you have to update, no, that's a bunch of crap. I am sending it back tomorrow. took forever to set up, I am NOT a happy camper!

So I bought this laptop when I was reading the good reviews. When I got it it was great, best laptop I have ever had. The problem is the space. THERE IS NO SPACE ON THIS LAPTOP. I CANT DO ANYTHING WITHOUT DELETING SOMETHING. Waste of my money. Don't buy it. Just move on to the next laptop.
On the 1st day my girlfriend got the computer it was a pain to set up due to multiple errors that popped up. After we got it set up the computer speed is very slow. I understand that it's a cheaper computer however for being brand new it has a lot of issues and is to slow.
Somewhat confusing to use. Can't use certain programs because there aren't any applications that support some programs! Good product for the price, but if you have the option spend a little more on a different laptop. I bought a Lenovo and my HP is more like a backup!
Slooooow
works g8
Its good
o me it succeeds gone very wrong turn but after a month tells me to buy the edition for a year equal only get 15GB storage have to buy the rest.<br/><br/>I can not install anything because the memory is not enough
https://www.amazon.com/review/review-your-purchases/ref=pe_6680_152003970_cm_1_star5?_encoding=UTF8&asins;=B00NSHLUBU%3A5%2C&channel;=ec_phy&crAuthToken;=gJznAp0chKQ1rA5H3S59Xcubqa9QtFrw1pWjjfoAAAAFAAAAAFYv98ZyYXcAAAAA&customerId;=A1IVLK19GAD0B4#
unable to load any software.  The laptop arrived with so little space left to add anything.  Deleted most everything and still only have 6GB of space to use.  Other than using this to log onto the internet, it appears to be useless.
I bought this computer 5 months ago and now it is unable to connect to the internet. I've been in contact with HP, which is a nightmare, and I am in the process of trying to get a refund. Do not waste your time with this computer.
Love it
awesome
Perfect
Light, good looking, fast BUT.... Have a windows image corrupted since manufacture HP. Errors appears, restarts, just sucks!<br/>I'm in Venezuela and send it back to HP guarantee isn't viable for time and costs for me.
Very poor and I was unhappy about the setup protocol I had to spend an additional 169 dollars to de bug the opperating program
Should have just bought a real computer.  Adequate as a spare.  It was supposed to come with free Office for a year but I'm darned if I can figure out how to get at it or where it is.  Slow on the internet as well.
not fast enough
Within weeks of purchasing I finally figured out how to get it to project full screen on my Sharp TV via HDMI so that I could watch Netflix on big screen. Now, if I don't that the laptop hooked up to the HDMI cable, the screen is black/blank - only thing I can do is shut it off with on off button.<br/><br/>I know that I fiddled with the setup and possibly messed a setting up but I don't know how to fix it so that I can use this little thing without my TV monitor.
The item is light weight. But, the network part of it is not proper. They haven't installed the network driver properly. So, the browsing becomes toooooo slow
Great

This laptop gets viruses easy. I have had it for about two months and already had 92 virus 3 different times
This computer is too slow, my nephews used it and said it is junk. Also it didn't come with the free Personal 365 program I had to purchase it separated in order to print. Bought the laptop for college can't use it. Very dissatisfied would like my money back.<br/>This issue makes me want to stop shopping on line!!!
I was disappointed because it included Windows 8.1 which I found difficult to use. Secondly, I missed having a DVD drive to load new software.
EXCELENTE...
I want to return this item or get a credit . The touch pad doesn't work all the time and sometims not at all. Can  you help ?
bien
Good

Yup.

fine
It frozen up an can't get into main menu, bought back in February, so it doesn't work at all.at first I loved it, so no star
Did  not realize it was just minor stuff. No disc drive would not load Microsoft package. Next time I need tobtesd clearly.
Can someone do the community a favor by writing a review after 3 months of usage - with the instalation of software and windows patches? A windows pc tends to slowdpwn significantly under the burden of apps and patches, I really want to see how this inexpensive pc holds up in the real world before making the jump.<br/><br/>Thanks
So far it met my expectations.  Easy to use, compact and light.  Perfect for 14 year old daughter, also great price.
Never will buy a windows product again. Computer never worked right and had a virus in it that hacked me. Not happy
love this computer. only thoin g is no DVD drive. that's the only issue.
This sucked!!!  The entire memory was filled by the operating system.  If I could give it 0 stars I would
I bought this thinking it was a touch screen. Totally​ my fault but irritated none the less so 3 stars.
The WORST  p.o.s. I have had in the way of a computer since the mid 90's....wasted 2 hrs trying to uninstall all the cap that comes with it, in between fighting off continual stream of unwanted pop-ups..Returning less than 3hrs after receiving.<br/><br/>And it's slow!!!
very small screen,can't get work done i need to do.guess i was expecting a little bigger cant use it
this is not touch screen, go to best buy for 50 dollars more you get the same computer with touch.
it was great but the Hard Drive is too small . how do i get additional hard to increase the size
So far so good,the person I brought it for was happy with it & haven't made much use of it yet.
no cd drive is the major problem...i want to return it but shipping alone gonna cost me alot
A++
I hated it ! Tried to maneuver through the programs, took at least 4 extra steps. Why?
The HP Stream meet all my expectations. I am totally pleased with its,performance.
I would recommend this to any student  who needs a smaller light weight laptop.
I got a problem with the turning on- off button everything else's is working ok
This computer does not have a CD-ROM, DVD drive which was very disappointing to me which I was not aware of. Maybe my fault I don't know. I thought I read everything but it's possible I missed it
This is a horrible piece of tech if you expect to get any work done. It's like I would rather buy a stone slab and etch my documents with a hammer and chisel before buying or recommending this.
Is the extra 2yr warranty worth the $50 ?!
great!
Good machine for bills and surfing and mail, social media and games.
Great laptop and easy to set up and follow directions for use.
Got it for my daughter she love it.Works great no problem  ..
I was very happy with the quility of laptop and shipping time
daughter 11 loves it.... wish it were a touch screen however.
A+
Ok
Adware. Malware. Needs to be cleaned up before going online.
Kind of disappointed that there is no spot to insert a disc.
as good as a paperweight... memory totally insufficient... after having cleaned, uninstalled etc etc etc can only achieve 1 G of memory :-(  DON'T BUY!...
This product is junk! Only used it once and it got a virus!
Happy to change this review, but out of the box the 32gb drive that's advertised is only showing 21.1gb TOTAL CAPACITY.  It's not even large enough to allow the upgrade to Windows 10!  I'm searching now for a solution and will contact HP if I can't resolve this, but at the moment,  EXTREMELY UNHAPPY.  I bought this for my daughter to take to school, and she'd be helpless at this point.
Sucks
I bought this instead of a Chromebook as after reading many of the positive reviews, I thought the pros (iTunes compatible, compatiblity with Windows apps) outweighed the cons (running Windows update, pre-loaded with Internet Explorer, the gateway to viruses, malware and browser hijacking apps). I wanted something easy for my 12 year old to use for schoolwork and Web games like Animal Jam that she likes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I should have paid closer attention to all the reviews that talk about having to remove all the junky adware and bloatware that HP allowed to be installed on these devices. Even after taking a lot of time to uninstall these, there were apparently others that don't show up in the Windows Programs list that go out to the Internet without your permission and download updates and other unwanted apps. My daughter used this laptop one day without my supervision and there were over 15 new unwanted apps that somehow got on here and started spawning pop-ups and  demanding restarts and generally disrupting my daughter's ability to do anything on this thing. She is not a computer technician and shouldn't have to be! She doesn't even know what she did to make this happen, and I suspect she accidentally used the IE web browser instead of Chrome which I purposely installed to avoid using IE. I suspect IE was hijacked by some of the existing adware and that's where it all started, though I can't be sure. Really, a kid should be able to use a PC without constantly being in danger of downloading junk without her knowledge which an adult then has to spend a lot of time deleting and uninstalling.<br/><br/>Other cons: A very long and invasive setup process, a hinky touchpad that is not accommodating unless the user makes very precise points, clicks and scrolls--not even when using the control panel to adjust the settings did the touchpad become usable. Also, laggy and generally unremarkable browser performance, Windows Update prompts and restarts, HP Warranty upgrade prompts that cannot be easily dismissed. Seriously, HP--I just bought this thing a couple weeks ago and you're already prompting and nagging us to upgrade the warranty to 2 years or more? No thank you. Here, you can have it back, we don't want it.<br/><br/>Replacing this junk with an ASUS C300 Chromebook--something that hopefully just works! <br/>
As online the Orchid Magenta color was very hard to find in store but I finally got it.<br/>For a review of the actual product I'd have to say it's a pretty good laptop for the price. I personally don't have regular internet access at home I have to access the internet else where which might be why I am having some problems. For example when I click the Windows Store it takes forever to open and when it does finally open and I go to look for apps and click to search it also takes forever and then I get a message saying something along the lines of "check your connection and try again in a few minutes." So I try again and I have the exact same problem which may again be because it's not the best internet connection but I can't be sure. Finally a few days ago it let me log into my Skype account which it wouldn't let me do before. Another problem I had was with the customer service. I had barely begun to browse the internet on the laptop and I already had the free subscription virus help notification coming up and telling me to call the emergency virus number. I called and of course was answered by some foreigner I could barely understand but he was friendly. He couldn't help because I wasn't connected to the internet so I decided to call back when I could be connected. I was so upset because I called at a fairly decent time (about 9pm) and it said no one was available to take my call. This was the "emergency" virus center so I was upset with the terrible hours. Finally a few days after that I got a hold of someone (when I had a connection) and she told me that it would cost $179 for her to fix all the viruses which I found insane especially because the laptop was around $200. I told her how the previous man I was talking to didn't say anything about paying for it (which I had assumed free). Again, terrible customer service. Hopefully I can sort all of this out and I'll update my review as for now I'm not too happy.
I am very happy with my purchase . Everything works great!
Have downloaded very little onto it and  I'm low on memory
Runs super slow. Tons of pop ups. My son is disappointed
This thing is so restrictive you might as well sit in a straight jacket to use it! I am just dumfounded at how these companies think they have the right to control every thing we do, limit how long you use it AND now limit HOW many people can use it! Unfreakingbelievable. Well guess what, WRONGO, not for me anyways mine is going right back to their controlling hands. The only good thing about it IMO is the ombre' color. here's SOME of what I hate;<br/>it is only useable for a YEAR, yup after that they gouge you for $ to keep using the 'CLOUD"<br/>They have a thing called defender, sounds good right? WRONG. if you read the whole users agreement when u first sign up/on it explains that this stupid program "helps" you by removing adware and suspiscous apps. ok so far, THEN it goes onto say it might delete some of your apps/files by mistake, oops but supposedly thats ok even though they say it could be something you only bought with one license, in that case you're sol, because they're not responsible and it's YOU who will have to shell out more $ to buy another liscence! it'd only be a mistake silly goose.<br/>The Mcaffee virus protection that is on there free for a month, oh my they're so nice, they want a picture of your face & even a sample of your voice, to protect you of course you silly bean, what else could they possibly want it for silly? It's a thing they called Biometrics sounds mathy. I no like math.<br/>I only got that far, that was enough for me! I'm sure they have so many other lovely features to "help" you, cough cough
good laptop with basic needs. fast delivery also...
Was hoping for more but over all good for the price
Comes with a lot of pre-installed junk. Unusable.
This product stinks would not recommend to anyone
Does it work when trying to mod Xbox 360 games?
Can't wait to see their faces on Christmas day!
Junk doesnt work just got it and dont work
Do I have insurance on this purchase?!?!?!
Everything ok. Nice colour or my daughter
great computer. The price was excellent.
Other than the viruses, it's great....
Overall very happy with this purchase.
perfect for shopping and paying bills
Does this computer have a DVD drive?
was a gift that was received well
Great price, love my new laptop!
IT CAN'T HANDLE ANY NEW ADD ONS
Not working keeps shutting off
Very good decision to buy it.
It was a perfect deal. Thanks
Great computer for the price
Does it come with a charger

Excellent value and price.
I had to return this item
Still getting used to it.
I love the two toned pink
Can yu burn dvds or cds?
Works well no problems.
the laptop is excellent
Can not wait to get it
Just came in I love it
I really want to like this because I love the look and feel, and really everything about it — Except, it fails on its most basic function, which is to connect to the internet.  I have two macs which both get speeds of 3MB download on my network, but this machine is struggling to get 3KB's download.<br/><br/>I've spent the past day trying to figure out what's going with the connection.  Apparently, it only operates on the crowded 2.4ghz network, and not the 5ghz network that my other computers can run on.  If anybody has a solution to this, I would love to love my new computer, but as of now I'm thinking I will return it.
My son loved it. The size and screen the visuals n over all performance was right on. Me and my son just enjoy u amazon!
Don't really like it
love it..its great!!
Very nice computer.
Excellent love it!!
Love this laptop!!
No problems at all
love it so much !!
Not what I needed
Great computer..
Don't ever buy this computer. I bought one here on amazon and it is the biggest piece of crap I ever purchased. It is extremely slow while on the internet and now locks up constantly. I have been trying to download my free upgrade to windows 10 (because let's face it, Windows 8.1 is horrible) and it keeps freezing up and will not allow the download. I will be extremely cautious before I ever buy anything from HP again. Horrible, horrible computer.
Hate this comp.
Not easy to use
I had a hard time to download the office 365 and when I called the HP, they told me that this version is not available anymore and  helped me to download the version 2013. for one year<br/>It took too much time and I was actually frustrated with the ads on Amazon. They should have known to change the ad and mention that the 365 is<br/>not available and other versions of office would be .<br/>Ali Salehian
not what I thought it would be
I bought this laptop for my wife for our anniversary because she bought a similar one for me for my birthday. She liked the touchscreen aspect of it but, when I turned it on to set it up- the touchscreen did not work.  I went online with HP support to try and reconcile the problem but to no success.  I requested a replacement and hopefully this one works with no problems
I had high hopes for this laptop but I cannot read my email on it. Apparently Windows 8.1 has no way to zoom in or enlarge text on the mail app. As it is, it's a tiny font and not usable by my senior eyes. I guess this is more of a Windows fault than HP's, but I want to caution any seniors, that you may not be able to read your email with this.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it's a nice package with a usable, but not impressive display, good performance, and great battery life. I don't like the color and the trackpad is very touchy with lots of inadvertent touches.<br/><br/>I have a 14 inch and 13 inch (wife) chromebook, and have no problem with text size on these. It's very easy to use Ctrl + to zoom in. I could not find any way to make the text on the HP Stream mail app any bigger.<br/><br/>Finally, like many people I had trouble adjusting to Windows 8.1. The trackpad on the Stream is so touchy that you really need to use a mouse. I looked at several 15.6 inch budget laptops at Best Buy and Office Max. By budget I mean between $229 and $249. I found these to have much better screens and trackpads (although trackpads can vary from terrible to pretty good on the budget machines). I love the size of my 13 and 14 inch Chromebooks and their great performance, ease of use and battery life, but this 13 inch Stream was actually very frustrating to use between the nervous trackpad, not so great screen and mail issues. Would still love to have a 13 inch Windows laptop that operates as smoothly as the low cost Chromebooks, but this one is not it.
Kids love it
great laptop
It's awesome
Very good.
Very Good
i like it
Very good
Love it!!

This Netbook Has Nice Color To It As I used it ive Notice That it has nice Keyboard.For Typing as 200$ Netbook with Win 8.1<br/>as There Chrome Books But This Netbooks Stands out From The Crowd This Laptop Great For Home User.
I just got this tv....didnt know it did not come with cd drive but seems to work good for the price. I downloaded the 365 office but now i cant find any icons or get to it....can someone give the steps?! It doesnt specify.
returned
HP offers a 13" for 229 but no office 365, I don't like windows, I don't like the cloud or not owning my software<br/>I do like that it is fast light and portable and  priced well and I love hp support
I thought I ordered 3 of the same size computers for my grandchildren. Not sure how I ended up with one being 11 inches. When I realized it was too late to return in order to give for Christmas .
It's ok
Love it
Good :)
Exelent
Love it
I've had this laptop for about a month now and it's already starting to get slow, the virus protection has ended and it won't let me renew it. This browser called astomenda came up when I got google chrome. At first I was very excited but now this is getting really annoying, I would not recommend this if you want a permanent laptop but if it's only temporary I suppose that it would be fine
I would actually give it a couple more stars but there are a few things I have noticed about it since I got i t a few days ago that takes it from "I like it" to "It's Ok"<br/>1) The SD Card reader on my computer doesn't read any SD Card - I tried multiple ones and tried them on other computers and they work just fine.  This might be not a huge deal for some people, but I edit pictures a lot and they're on SD cards - so kind of a hinderance for me, and honestly the real reason the stars were taken off. I liked the computer til I discovered this.  :(<br/>2) Maybe I am just reaching that point where technology is starting to pass over my head, but as of right now, I do  not like Windows8.  You get in a habit of knowing how to do things on all the other versions and it feels like it is completely changed now.  Maybe after I have played around with it some more it will become easier to navigate through.<br/>3) I wasn't too fond of the McAfee virus protector it came with.  As soon as it was installed and activated on my computer, it would have "blocked items" pop up every 30 seconds which just got obnoxious having to remove things over and over again (sometimes even the same file). This was happening right out of the box with all the original factory settings - I hadn't had added anything to the compter yet.  So apparently there are a lot of things in the computer original setting McAfee doesn't like (not sure if i should be concerned with that or not).  I uninstalled it and working on getting Avast virus protector on it instead.<br/><br/>I will add some positives: I love the size. It's perfect for carrying around to work, a cafe, etc (now if only the SD Card reader so I can actually do my work on it).  The color is playful.  It feels more like an tablet (minus the touch screen) than a drab laptop, so I enjoy being able to just throw it in my purse and take it wherever I want.  Also, as far as I have noticed, the battery life is amazing. Of course, my old computer had reached is limits and could barely stay on for 20 mins without it pluggin in, so having any battery life on a computer feels like a miraculous gift.  I think this is the 3 HP Laptop I have bought in the past 10 years - not bashing HP's durability at all, but rather praising it because I keep returning to their products.
Well since this laptop died after only 3 months...I have to say I hate it.  Amazon won't take it back either...20 days after return window...dead as a doornail.
I absolutely regret buying this product. I have had nothing but trouble with the hard drive and have had it professionally looked at twice. Regret!!
Was a little smaller than I expected....Office for only 1 yr......?  They got me on that one.  Thought it would be for<br/>life of the machine.
For comparing with other options such as a stand-alone computer or Chrome book, realize that Office 365 only works for 1 year for free, then it is $69.99/year.  Apparently the subscription is good for 5 computers.  Maybe you can share with your room-mates, but this cost should be considered.
Don't waste your money, we bought this for our son for Christmas thinking we were getting a good deal, it has no storage space whatsoever...
I bought it for my wife and she really likes it.  I got an exceptional deal on Amazon when it first came on the market.
NIce
slow
Good
The memory is not sufficient for those that need regular computing such as I Tunes, One Drive, Videos, etc. etc.....the 2G fills up super fast and because it is a basic netbook, can't plug in a separate hard drive and transfer like you can with a real laptop, I think....I tried.......fine for a Tween kid student who emails and does studies and pops their zits...
Waste of Money it needs a bigger hard drive .It offers Widows 10 not enough space to install!!
I hate the windows 8.1. I installed my office and couldn't find anywhere in the system.
Not Ethernet Port other than that perfect they should implement touchscreen though
Did not work when I tried to turn it on. I recommend finding a different laptop.
This product does not come with Microsoft, other than that I love it.....
I spilled water on my mac after having it for almost two years, so I bought the cheapest priced laptop I could find with Microsoft office. BIG MISTAKE. I seriously took my mac for granted, and I knew immediately when I first laid my fingers on this piece of crap. I used to think, hey, internet is internet right? WRONG. I cant even do this machine justice, and if you do get it, whatever you do DONT UPDATE. after a few weeks my computer started slipping in and out of wifi to the point where it got unusable, I called Microsoft support, and they were ready to charge me 109 dollars for a fricken consutlation, the guy was like is there a problem with the price, how much do you want to pay? I was like no s***, I shouldn't pay anything for your crappy machine basically malfunctioning on its own. I did some research and finally came across an obscure post that sounded like my situation and read that he also updated, I thought theres gotta be something to that, cause when I first bought this thing a few weeks ago it wasn't doing that atleast.  I then was forced to reset to the original state and try that out. And Wa fricken la it works again, so apparently one of the "Features" of a Microsoft update is that your computer downloads the "slip in and out wifi every 2 minutes App"!!  how friken awesome. Luckily I only had the thing for a few weeks so didn't lose very much files. Now when people ask me what type of computer I have, I say I have a Microsoft POS. "Piece of S***"!!.......... So if I must leave you, I leave with this. A computer is an investment, not a purchase, don't take the cheap route, don't be like me.  oh and Ps, yea get this, m POS's wifi slipped out during the time I was writing this review, so there was a fricken submitting error!! looks like the problems still there.
This is an 08-16-2015 addition that needs to be at the top. Just "upgraded" to Windows 10 and McAfee is gone so my 30 day free trial of a decent virus protection is now over less than halfway through and I'm surfing with a free program until I can get money to now pay over 2 weeks early for actual virus protection. On top of that Windows 10 had an ad saying all the best of Windows 7 and 8. Apparently neither of those had any good things since almost nothing of either is included. On top of that, the fall back is to go back to Windows 7 despite this laptop coming with Windows 8.1. On top of that, Windows 10 is worse than all other Windows before, just like all other Windows "upgrades" have been since time began. Now tell me again how I already have no helpfuls and 4 unhelpfuls? Because sellers of the laptop want to bury me. That's why. I didn't even mention in my original review that it claims a 32 GB drive but it was only 21.5 when I got it with 14 GB free. As of the Windows 10 Update it now says 28.2 with 9 GB free due to my added programs. It's like selling you a car that claims to get 50 miles to the gallon but in the small print it says, "If it had a different engine." It's 32 GB except it's not. Lots of PC's since 1998 and a few laptops recently and never seen one that claims 32 but has 28 or 21 or anything but 32. Last laptop used for 6 months said 16 and had 16. I guess that company and sellers of that product weren't total liars, huh? I'm changing my rating to a ONE if that's possible.<br/><br/>Original review - 08-11-2015<br/><br/>I'm giving this a marginal 3. The touchpad is a minus one million. The fact that they would sell this with this awful a touchpad on this thing is truly indicative of what liars electronics sellers are now. Watch it zoom so that you're resetting that dozens of times a day. Watch as it brings up the Windows 8 menu on the right side an average of about 7 times an hour but sometimes 7 times in 15 minutes. Watch as you try to click the middle of the mouse and the middle of the page nowhere near the menu and it takes you to the ad filled Windows start page anyway, taking you away from what you're doing over a hundred times a day. Watch as it grabs something, anything and moves it despite you not clicking it long enough for drag. Watch as it's almost impossible to cut, copy and paste a portion of anything. Tons of other mouse problems that mean this thing will drive you insane unless you buy a usb mouse. I also think it's hilarious that this refurbished version was 164 and then 169 a few hours later when I bought it with the damaged box one being 179 and new 199 only to now to be 179 new and 159 refurbished. I realize most reading this are sheep and think this wild, wild West selling policy is fine. Uh, it's totally illegal as is 99% of what happens to you online. You don't go in Walmart or your local grocery store, put something in your cart and have the price of anything go up as much as 100% in the minutes it takes you to check-out. Amazon call it's self a "store" but this selling practice is a what happens at a flea market, not a store. If they're going to claim to be a store and not operate like a store, they're performing illegal acts. If you're saying there is no internet law then you set precedent or you fall back to real life law. You don't just say it's OK to 100% of the time lie, falsely advertise and screw your customers online despite that being what both political parties have allowed to happen for decades now. Not opinion. Facts folks. The laptop other than the mouse is about a 4 but you're not going to be able to upgrade to Windows 10 without tons of problems due to it's limitations so selling it with upgrade to Windows 10 for free is also a total scam. You've been warned. Proceed with caution.
Nice pc.
:)
It is a lot smaller than I thought it would be.
This coputer is slow! It often freezes up, needs to be re-started and the keypad is constantly freezing up. DO NOT purchase this computer. I will be returning mine.
I was thinking about buying this and since I read the reviews I believe I will. Seems cute, little and it would come in handy since I need a laptop for school.
My daughter loves it and won't ever get off!
Horrid memory capacity. Very disappointed.
Just what my 90 year old Dad needed!
Other all I expected for the price
wasn't what I was looking for.
Biggest piece of bulls*** ever sold! Should've just gotten a f@&*ing chromebook. It does not allow you to use Windows 365 without a credit card on file. I hate this computer!
my wife hates the windows8.1
It is so unresponsive

I've never reviewed a product in my life. Ordered off amazon for over 10 years and 100+ items. This one frankly deserved a review. Why even have an option to select color?!  Ordered the violet and got the blue. Don't have the time to return and/or exchange.  This laptop is for my daughter whom a homeschool and she said she can like the blue. However that's not the point! Other than that the computer is fine, works great.
Not what expected
Beware. This thing seems to come pre-loaded with pop-up ads. Speeds surfing online are similar to the dialup days of the 1990s. Operating system is a mess. I am extremely depressed by this purchase and am in the process of returning it.
did not like it
Touchscreen??
This is a terrible computer. I have already had the motherboard replaced and my Microsoft Word program is wiped out and I cannot find the Product Activity code to reactivate it!  I am very disappointed in this computer and wish I could send it back as it is not even worth the money I paid for it.
I bought this computer in January and I am not pleased with it  at all. Please, do not listen to others raving how good this computer is ! This computer is utter garbage save your money and buy a MacBook Pro. I wasted my money on this piece of garbage (computer).
DO NOT BUY!!  I have a HP Chromebook and the USB charger no longer works - so I'm stuck with a slow, low power charger for a phone (5X longer to charge)!.  HP knows about the problem and tells the user not to use their charger - customer service is of no help.
Love this article, but when my sister brought it to Argentina she forgot the font in San Francisco. Im now trying to recover the font. I still couldnt see how it works. Perhaps I will be needing to buy a new cable and font. Iwill be in contact. Dolores
This is not a laptop.  I am no expert, but I purchased this for my son's birthday and he ran out of space the first day using it.  it looks very nice, but is useless.  I would like to return it but am not sure how this works through amazon.  HElp!
- 8.1 scaled well on it. runs sufficiently on day to day computing tasks.<br/>- Well constructed. Light. Very portable. Doesn't seem cheap. Your kids could probably throw this thing around without much worry.<br/><br/>- 32GB onboard is tight. the install and the 7gb recovery partition doesn't leave you with much. I blew out that partition (I have SO many copies of windows)<br/><br/>- Touchpad is stiff. only bottom half seems to work. Iffy.<br/><br/>Here's where it went south, which was admittedly my own doing:<br/><br/>I like 8.1 just fine, but I like 10 better. I blew the whole thing out and installed 10. Everything worked, (That I needed) except for the touchpad. I find this odd, because I am writing this on another HP laptop running 10, and the pad works just fine.<br/><br/>I fully updated 10, and the touchpad still didn't work. There is no driver listed for the touchpad on the HP site. Took a shot in the dark and went to Synaptics page and downloaded their 8.1 driver. It wouldn't install.<br/><br/>Now, since this is not a touchscreen device, I think not having a touchpad is a dealbraker, so I bit the bullet and reinstalled 8.1. Now, not only does the touchpad STILL not work, but the WIFI doesn't work either, and the WIFI driver listed on HP's website won't install. Incidentally, the only drivers listed for the device on the website are WIFI and Bluetooth, which is absurd. I'll try going straight to Broadcom later.<br/><br/>I actually like the device. I'm not really panning it, but my tinkering shouldn't have caused this much trouble. I've half-bricked it, now I have to poke my way out somehow.
It is hard not to like this laptop. Cheap, cute, light weight and runs Win 8.1.<br/><br/>However, because it is portable and I purchased it mostly as a remote PC/tablet, I was displeased that it did not come with a touch screen.<br/><br/>I know, I know... what do you expect for $199?<br/><br/>It is a good value and I liked it, so if you don't need a touch screen... this is a great deal.
Nice little laptop.  Takes some getting used to as it runs on Chrome system but hey, everything pretty much today.  It's great for work, email, typical stuff.  I Don't know if it would be great for gaming though.
This is fine, I suppose, if you only want to surf the web and send emails.  But don't try to download any software.  I bought this to run Quicken, as Quicken for Macs doesn't work well.  I have NOTHING on the this computer but Quicken, and it is totally full and virtually unusable.  Don't buy this piece of junk.
Love it!
Great!!!
Why do I have to enter a password in just setting this up? It tells me I must have an Microsoft password. NO! I do not have this - and I cannot access the laptop. Why is this required?????
Packaging was great!! The delivery was super fast. I bought the laptop for my daughter for christmas. I cant wait until she starts to use it.
I received the computer, the stride rite Ramona Mary Jane, silver girls cute but the dream pearl angel didn't came in the package.
This is a great little, light computer.  The reason for the low rating is it states it comes with Office 365 for one year and it does not. No literature on how to get it is included.
Junk!
biggest piece of garbage i have ever purchased! would never recommend; even to my worst enemy!
Fine
Very disappointed.  My daughter didn't even have this computer for 3 days & its full of viruses!!! Disgusted with this purchase.
Save yourself the time and frustration; please buy something else! I have had this laptop for about a week. Initially, it seemed to perform. After about 2 days, all the programs started to crash. I couldn't even open a powerpoint. The anti-virus that comes with this computer is horrid & the complimentary office 365 cant even open documents without overloading the entire device.<br/><br/>Surfing the web is a hassle. I've honestly just started using my phone! You will have to refresh a page 3 or 4 times for the information/pictures to even show up. You cant download any of your own programs even though this computer runs windows 8 and is not technically a chromebook. It still limits you to the apps in the app store. Also, the laptop also has difficulty keeping a consistent internet connect, which again, is very frustrating.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you are buying this as a replacement for a windows 7 pc you used to have--DONT. You will be disappointed. While the appearance and the weight is great, the performance IS NOT. I will definitely be returning this PC after I find something else on black friday. Dont waste your time, money, and patience!!
My daughter did not like this weak internet reception, I returned it
“Brought product to surface of Mars. It stopped working. 0/10.”
My laptop arrived without any paperwork so I was missing the one year Office 365 and 1TB OneDrive storage offer.  I called HP and I was transferred 13x after spending over two hours on the phone.  In the end they said they could not help me.  I suppose I could return it but I'd have to go through the hassle of swapping it out.<br/><br/>For the money the laptop itself is fine.  The touchpad is not very sensitive and there are no buttons.  Right-clicking requires a click or tap on the right side which does not always work.  The screen resolution and DPI are low enough where reading text can be difficult at times.<br/><br/>If you are looking a basic, entry-level pc on a tight budget and can live with terrible customer service then this laptop is one of the best options available right now.  My recommendation is to spend a little more and you will get a far better product.
ok
Does this have a camera built into it?
iTunes to the hp stream 11 laptop?!
Friends hasn't me nice they lover
I need to vent my frustration for this product. Pros = the keyboard is very comfortable for prolong typing. the display is on par with other computers. Cons = an extraordinary amount of bloatware installed<br/>Ok, the killer for me happened once I connected to the internet. I was bombarded with pop-ups, some from the installed bloatware and some from Microsoft and it's failure to prevent it from happening. I sat at the computer and felt I was being attacked by pop-ups. Microsoft should be a shame of themselves. McAfee security was a joke. I was just about to return the computer until I downloaded Firefox as my browser. (McAfee was also a annoying pop-up) Only then did I get some piece of mind. I really need the computer at a reasonable price for word processing but next time I will save up and  buy a Mac. Will also uninstall Mcafee & use my AVG or my employer security software
didn't like this sent back
Nice looking notebook, Lightweight, Fast, Good battery life, BUT-You cant download google Play to download apps games etc. HP IS BEHIND IN THE TIMES. YOU WOULD THINK EVERYTHING CAME WITH GOOGLE play,{at least I did}.  There is NOOOOO download option for google for this computer, HOW SAD. The games HP offers are cheeseie at best, Downloaded a few for the kids, after a few minutes they walked away. HP needs to update and get with the times.  I would say this notebook is for students only, Not worth it other wise. Not worth the money, Will be selling this no doubt.
I've been searching the market for a while, spending lots of time reading customer reviews, and I'm glad to say, my journey's over. This product works perfectly as a paperweight, a bit on the pricey side, yes, but definitely worth the added cost. It covers my paper stack completely! I can even use it as a placemat. Some of the reviewers reported that it can also be used as a calculator if you tinker with it a while. I'll believe it when I see it. Also, I'm not really the tinkering sort. Definitely the best purchase of office supplies I've made in a while.
I have had this laptop for about 2 weeks and I HATE the Windows 8.  Horrible.  Mine came with lots of annoying popups and the "scroll pad" is a nightmare to deal with.  But this IS my first laptop.  Much heavier than it looks but very quiet.  Visual is nice.  I know it will be almost impossible to find anything with Windows 7 but I will probably be downsizing to tablet with touchscreen.  I'll wish myself good luck finding Windows 7.  If anyone out there has any suggestions - feel free to comment on the Windows issue.
Piece of crap. Ran into tons of problems just trying to boot it up. Track pad nearly non-functional. Sent it back within a week. Probably just not enough power to really run Windows. Not a Chromebook killer.
Nothing beats an apple-
has built-in camera?
I would give it -5 stars but I can't. This computer isn't worth the cheap plastic it is made with. It is extremely complicated every time you want to do anything it goes to the news or settings. It also has thousands of pop up ads and a terrible security system. My ASUS broke 2 days after  I got it and I still like it better than this terrible HP. I could go on for days about the general awfulness of this HP. BUY A CHROMEBOOK!
Doesn't work
Nice little computer but print too small without method of change except for something called magnifying glass which is useless. Also Windows is such a pain to operate compared to Apple. Too bad Apple is so expensive
I have made the mistake of buying HP products. These are horrible with the worst customer service ever. All my HP's have been nightmares...STAY AWAY!!!
Useless
I absolutely HATE this device.  It runs so slow that today I had to boot up my 7 year old laptop to finish my homework.  It did not open videos, just buffered and buffered and said site was unavailable; the site opened right up on the old laptop -<br/>I can not believe how SLOW it runs, and would like my money back -  It also said that I could save my documents to a USB and that doesn't work either; billed it as running on Windows 8.1 and it is Windows 8  -<br/>This is the first time I have purchased anything from Amazon that I feel truly ripped off on -
We purchased 3 of these for our children to use for homeschool.  None of our children were old enough to have their own Microsoft accounts. When I went to redeem Office 365 personal for install on 3 machines, it would not allow me to install this on all machines. It would only allow me to have a license for ONE machine for 3 years instead of 3 licenses for one year (one for each laptop).  I spent a lot of time talking to customer care at Microsoft office to ONLY be told because the license came with the laptop as a package deal, they would offer nothing to correct this problem. I then had to purchase a home license to make this work at the cost of another $99.  DO NOT order this package if you have multiple children. Chromebook would be a better value with integrated customer service. AND you wouldn't be paying $99 a year to create basic documents. Chromebook includes the ability to create documents. I'm sure HP paid a pretty penny to have Office 365 bundled with this machine. I bet their executives would be angry to know Microsoft was trying to place the financial responsibility for their inability to hold up their end of the deal on both Amazon.com and HP.
I absolute hate this  laptop. Do not buy it!
can not work properly.. DO NOT BUY IT
This product isn't even worth $50. You cannot even play Netflix on it properly and basic tablets can function better. This is the worst laptop I have ever purchased. The entire thing looks like a toy. The mousepad is hard to work with, and is very finicky and difficult to maneuver. Worst of all, videos do not play properly.<br/><br/>These problems were apparent the first five minutes of using the computer. It was clumsy to use and the design needs to be fixed. The mouse-pad is one of my biggest grievances, as it is very difficult to use and has no real buttons. The keyboard looks rather cheap, but I don't care as long as it is functional. Videos do not play well on this, and it really should. It is a shame that it doesn't perform even to that capacity. My previous laptop played Netflix and other online videos just fine, so it is not an internet connectivity issue. I've only had it a week and I'm about to pull out my hair from the frustration and time lost on this thing. The design is very small (which is to be expected) but the performance is also quite terrible. There is a great deal of lag and difficulty switching between tasks. You would be better off buying a Galaxy tablet for the price of this "laptop." Serves me right by trying to save a bit of money when buying laptops. I should have gone for a bit more expensive option if it would save me the headache of worrying about returns.<br/><br/>My word of advice: look for this in stores first. If you like it, then buy it. Don't buy it without playing around with it in stores. $200 is quite a bit of money to lose without knowing what you will be getting.
Do not buy a chromebook.  All it does is surf the internet.  My files disappear  The sound is terrible.  Scrolling is terrible. For a long time it insisted that I was in Guatemala and would not change to English.  I guess Google finally spied on me enough, figured my address, and took it upon themselves to change it for me.  It was a waste of money.
I didnt like it!
This iteam is a junk waste of money i shouldnt even bother to look at it i dont know why this ppl making aome crap and trying to make money
NOT RECOMMENDED!  At first glance, this looks like a good deal - a $200 laptop running Windows.  However, the biggest drawback for this machine is that it's RUNNING WINDOWS!  A non-up-gradable 2 GB of RAM is just not enough to adequately  run Windows 8.1 (Windows 7 needs at last 4 GB of RAM to even work).  Also, over half of the 32 GB solid state drive is take up by Windows alone.  The free 1 year subscription to Office 365 (online only) is like those cable TV deals - good for a year and then suddenly more expensive than the laptop.<br/>I like Google's Chromebook and Chromebox approach - I've been logged in and working (Google Docs, Sheets, etc) for several minutes before the Stream figures out what planet it is on.  The beauty of the small ChromeOS is that it boots almost instantly and gets you to the web, where you do most of your work.  With the Stream, the Windows operating system has to carry so much baggage from days of yore that it defeats the purpose.  Many users are replacing Windows on this machine (basically the same hardware as a Chromebook) with light-weight versions of Unbuntu or even Android OS.<br/>If you really want an inexpensive laptop running  Windows, don't waste your money on this latest Microsoft gimmick and get a refurbished Dell or HP laptop running Windows 7 (and make sure it has it least 4 GB of RAM).
this thing is junk, my wife said it back, last time I sent something back to amazon I got screwed real hard
I have had nothing but problems with this computer since I received it a week ago.
Bought for my elderly mother.  Within 24 hours it had a virus/Trojan.  She was scammed into signing up with "majestec", a third party company, who charged her $149 to install ccleaner.  Then I called HP customer service, at the recommendation of Amazon, and spent approximately 60 minutes being transferred to SIX different foreign agents.  My intent was just to ask what should have been done differently on starting up the computer.  The response was that for a fee ($99 one time, 6 months for $149, 1 year for $199) they could tell me more.  This was my first phone call to a tech support/customer service since 2009, when I bought my MacBook Pro.  So, the last agent I spoke to said "this is just the way it is if you do anything on the Internet. It even happens to me!  I have to be careful'". I said to her, well then let me give you some advice.  Buy a Mac.  So the bottom line is, this computer, this operating system is still a colossal waste of time and money.
This does not have a wired internet plug and you would think that it would advertise this in big print!<br/><br/>I do not care to have WiFi, I do not know anything about it, and I would assume all computers have a regular internet plug. If anyone knows of a computer that has the regular wired LAN internet plug and HDMI out so I can watch old TV shows, please let me know?<br/><br/>I purchased the cheap computer, not because of price, rather because I thought it would have less useless junk, which I never use. I grew up way before the computer age, and never once had to use them for work..I hate returning anything because the cost never will compensate me for my time! All I need is email, net forums, eBay and Amazon, and old TV shows like Hulu on my big screen so my old eyes can see it!<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to anyone over age 60, unless you have kids researching, buying and configuring the system for you!
Has Windows 8.1-Need I say more?
Can't wait to get My lapTop
The mouse pad is hard to manipulate and sometimes the screen goes from one program/page to another without clicking it.  It comes with one year of Office 365 which cannot be downloaded on this product so I don't know why it's even included.  I wanted to down Office on the chromebook so I can do work on it but can't so that's useless.  Since the mouse is hard to maneuver and office can't be downloaded, I'm going to return this chromebook and look for another.  I
#amazongiveaway
Nice and slim
horrible i am sending back this pos<br/>i want a full refund this laptop doesnt work good for anything not even good to do my school on<br/>this thing wont let you down load nothing unless you have a credit card and virus protection that i dont need what so ever<br/>also the packaging was crap<br/>box inside box needed more protection then that im very un happy now how about someone call me and send me a box and lable to send this back with
This lapto comes with liner?
I dont realy have a verified perchase, amozon gave me my laptop hours after i was supposed to get it, but good look to it
Not worth the 200$ when you're practically buying nothing.
GENIAL
Waiting for my laptop is killing me. I Want It
Does this have a CD DVD burner
too small - I request a return and never heard back from vendor Beachlong
How is this computer, performance wise, for downloading movies and just basic scheduling and inventory stuff for say...a restaurant?
Windows is finally going in right direction with solid state drives similar to tablets n phones. Machines operate much quicker and more efficient. I will be ordering one next week
The screen quality is disappointing, for a portable device i expected this to be lightweight or would have the better design the device is rather bulky and the bezel is very very thick.<br/><br/>Colors are rather childish.<br/><br/>For the office 365 - i already have 1 came free with another device and every office 365 it comes with 1 yrs subscription but available on 5 devices, so i didn't need the office at all. so many devices are offering the free office 365 but once you have 1 subscription it's available for 5 devices anyway. But every subscription will start charging you after 12mths time, really don't like this it's like you have to pay rent to use this software.
What kind of Cd/DVD drive compatible with this computer?
I don't have one yet, but I think that I will purchase one in the near future. I love the blue color and the size. It also is for a really good price at only 200 dollars! The one thing that would confirm my getting one is if it had a more storage space. It only has 2gb and 1tb of google cloud, but where in live there is no wifi or service. Other than that, this computer seams as if it would be perfect!
Per the HP website:<br/><br/>Proposition 65<br/>WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer. (California law requires this warning be provided to California customers)
The product said 32GB diskspace; however a check on device revealed 21.3GB of disk space and usable is less than 17GB
The rightvside in the pics shows one without an hdmi port and one with it. Does it actually have one?
horrible
Absolute waste of money
Great idea if you really must have a Windows computer. It's good looking and by all accounts sturdy. But I still prefer the Chromebook.<br/>You can run MS Office online apps on the ChromeBook for free without the worry of malware infection that you have with a standard Windows installation. You can also run Google Apps. It's an interesting idea though. Too bad most will slow to a crawl as soon as the user downloads a free email offer.<br/>Which they surely will.
I like the laptop is ok and the color is is good but , Does this laptop have a DVD player
Let's do a side-by-side comparison with my refurbished 4GBx32GB C720p Chromebook, which I just bought for 30% more.  No touch screen.  Half the RAM.  Much slower CPU.  The word processor does not support collaboration.  No group-editing a la Google Docs.  The word processor has no intrinsic way to "share" documents with others.  Your computer gets slower over time.  Metro.  Let me make that perfectly clear.  Metro.  You have to run a virus-checking software.  You have to manually approve operating system updates and installs.  More viruses available for this computer than for all other computers combined.  Tons of low-quality games (it's an Atom processor, after all) so your kids can waste their lives in useless pursuits.  Every time the OS breaks you get to chat with the nice guy in India who asks you 75 questions before descending from his mountaintop to deign you worthy of an OS reinstall.  It takes a long time to boot.  It doesn't take 7 secs to boot.  After 1 year you have to pay a huge fee to edit your documents again.  I think Microsoft has a real racket going in selling these turds.
I can't use this PC because it only comes in ridiculous colors. I would buy it in a heartbeat if it came in colors even remotely appropriate for business.
don't like this one
