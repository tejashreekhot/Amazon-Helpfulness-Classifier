An imaginative tale that leaves one wondering about how much of it is true.

Disjointed and Disappointing
I held on to the end thinking surely there was something positive to be taken away but it only ended in the worst possible way
want to feel depressed?
A tragedy
but I HATED it. It was too dark
Starts out well then abruptly ends; disappointing.,
