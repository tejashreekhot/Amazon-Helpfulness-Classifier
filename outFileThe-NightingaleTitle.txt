What An AMAZING Novel -- Five Stars Isn't Enough
I felt compelled to write this review for the other readers like me who are drawn to highly rated books with ...
So anachronistic!
... to agree with the reviewer that said it read like "Nancy Drew joins the Resistance"
Show, don't tell
Very Disappointing
Weak
it was nothing like the story in this book
Mistakes abound, one sister ages four years while another ...
It left me feeling like I had just eaten a meal of air.
Pixelated Pulp Fiction
Adjective Central
Familiar story line strewn with unreal characters...........

but then became disgusted with the character development
Beaucoup de clich√©s!!
THE NIGHTINGALE SOARS!!
Just awful
Magnificent. Extraordinary.

Pretty Mauvais
Overrated, formulaic, predictable, poorly written glorified romance novel
Suspenseful and romantic at the same time, and offers readers a very personal portrait of life in wartime
Surprisingly mediocre.
great book
Badly written novel
Disappointing WWII Novel
Plot is much better than the disappointing writing
A melodramatic view of the French resistance through the eyes of America
Annoying
As so many people have rated this book so highly I really wanted to enjoy reading it but.........
Not a literary endeavor; sophomoric writing and poorly developed ...
I hated how the writer deliberately withheld which sister is alive ...
The Best Book That I Have Ever Read
Unbearable.
Ho-hum historical fiction

Not worth reading
