I found this to be a slow start and a little confusing to begin with but it picked up and ended up being quite an exciting ending!
Good suspense. Good storytelling between characters. Read it in 2 days. Would recommend the book to others. Worth getting the book
This was simply a beautiful, captivating read.  The story moves quickly and with great suspense.  This was a great vacation read!
Started reading this and couldn't stop! It is impossible to put down once you have started and sticks with you even after you do.
This book has it all: drama, suspense, lust, adultery, jealousy, anger, and sadness. Twists & turns- the ending being unexpected.
This book was confusing to follow. I did hang in there after seriously contemplating putting it down. It was dark and depressing.
Great read!  At first, I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it, but stuck with it and it was a good read and a good suspense story.
Interesting, sometimes boring. Reminds me of gone girl was better. Little bit horrible and uncomfortable to read. Too dark story.
Fascinating and unusual plot with genuine and approriate surprises consisten with character portrayal.  Could hardly put it down.
This book was a very fast read.  The characters were interesting and the author pulls you in right away.  It is a great thriller.
I enjoyed the book very much. I must admit I was confused about who is who at first . I then figured it out . A good who done it.
The story goes into a completely different direction than you think it could go, and comes to a grand conclusion. Very well done.
I would not give it rave reviews. I chose it because it has been touted as a great read and am grateful it was cheap on Book Bub!
Couldn't stop reading after the first page ! Awesome read. Look forward to reading more by this author since this book was great!
Good read for sure! I couldn't wait on the library waitlist any longer, so I decided to buy it instead! I wasn't disappointed! :)
Very much enjoyed this thriller. Couldn't put it down. Read it in one day.  Didn't want it to end. Anxious for the movie version.
Not at all what I expected but unable to leave it until I had finished and knew what was happening and who these characters were.
I couldn't put it down. Realistic troubled past for all. Suspenseful till the very end. Can't wait to read more from this author.
So good! Suspenseful, exciting and totally awesome. Reminds me of Alfred Hitchcok's "Rear Window". I highly recommend it!
A good thriller. Characters are well defined. Narrative is to the point and succinct. Would love to read more by the same author.
Takes a journey not expected in the beginning chapters. Gets you really see through the main character's eyes. Highly recommended
The dates confused me, and I started over ....3 times. Can't say I enjoyed this book. Can't imagine why it's on best seller list.
I loved everything about this book! It's a consuming story that doesn't want to be put down! It kept me on my toes until the end!
Characters were a bit much to keep up with. Weirdly interesting and still left the end to wonder what happened to this poor girl.
Started out good but lost interest and figured out who did it right away. Didn't feel real kept feeling like I was reading words.
It was a good read. The main character is difficult to love but you some how end up rooting for her despite her flaws/weaknesses.
It was a book that you didn't want to put down!  It wasn't predictable and kept your attention throughout the story.  I loved it!
Great book! The story was engaging and the author did a great job developing the characters. And the ending was pretty thrilling!
I can't believe so many people loved this book. I like most everything I read and this book just went on and on and on. So simple
I enjoyed this more than gone girl.  I looked forward to reading it and couldn't stop.  What a surprise the ending held.<br/>Com
Riveting story.  Never know what is going to happen next.  I liked the characters telling their own stories through out the book.
Really enjoyed this book went in directions I wasn't quite expecting which makes for a real page turner. Read in a day and a half
It was a good book. A bit too similar in tone to Gone Girl. Not sure which was published first. But a fun, fast read nonetheless.
I did not like this book. It jumped around too much, I didn't really care about any of the characters and it seemed to never end.
This book kept me glued to it from start to finish, intrigued as to what would happen next. Best book I have read in a long time.
This book was amazing. It was so captivating, a real page turner.  I would love to read another book on Rachel. Highly recommend.
I couldn't put this down. Great anticipation in each chapter. Well written using the different perspectives of each of the women.
It has been such a long time since I've read a book that I could not put down ! Amazing story and kept me guessing till the end .
The Girl On The Train is a good novel.  It is suspenseful!  I enjoyed the book but expected more due to the hype about this book!
A page turner! Great summer read!  If you enjoyed "Gone Girl," you will also love this book. It starts slowly, but hang in there.
It was a good story. Good and easy read. Entertaining, I would recommended for book club or anyone that likes a good mystery...!;
Wasn't sure about the book as I started it but it kept getting better and better. If you like thrillers you will enjoy this book.
Very good book. Couldn't put it down. It's definitely worth reading! Very unexpected ending and has you wondering the whole book!
I now understand why this book it's a bestseller...A+.... It will keep you reading from start to finish. Highly recommended !!!!!
Much better than Gone Girl, to which it is oftentimes compared. Had me going back and forth as to the killer for quite some time.
You will not believe how this story comes together. What a page turner! Great summer read. Perfect for mystery and thriller fans.
This book grabbed my attention and held it to the very end. I loved the different narratives and perspectives of the same events.
Unexpectedly thrilling and captivating.<br/>I couldn't put it down! I loved how it was told by the main three female characters.
Thrilling novel about three women struggling through life and love. Keeps you guessing. Thoroughly enjoyed The Girl On The Train.
Pretty good suspenseful book with decent plot and character development. But, could have been more. Recommend for fun, fast read.
This was a real page turner, couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next.  The ending could have been so much better!
Not sure I would like it at first but I quickly got sucked in and couldn't put it down.  Would definitely recommend reading this.
This book is a page Turner from the beginning, great story line and believable characters that take you to another place in time.
It's a page turner. Don't want to stop reading until you finish and you figure out "who done it?" Our book club loved it.
Enjoyed the book and having the different perspectives of the accounts. Keeps your interest and keeps you guessing until the end.
Couldn't put it down.  Very accurate portrayal of an alcoholic. Woman.  The mystery rivits you until it's finally, finally, over.
The novel grips you from the first chapter. Each chapter reveals a bit more about each of the characters. Definitely a Must Read!
Great summer read! Devoured within a day. Author kept my attention and managed a huge plot twist without any predictable cliches.
Enjoyed this mystery, who dunnit story, although it was highly predictable.  Overall, great character development and a good read.
Well written. Good character presentation, and really character driven. I won't say anymore so I don't give anything away. Enjoy!
A very fast paced thriller that keeps you reading on. Interesting characters and plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing.
Definitely gets you to read because u want to see what will happen! Read in a day. Wasn't awesome but I also couldn't put it down
It was a really good book not too long which is what I liked a lot very interesting I barely ever finish books but this one I did
i liked the separate telling of each characters stories and the facts given by each person with the inclusion of dates and times.
Difficult to follow. Characters not sympathetic or interesting. More tedious than it was enjoyable. Not time I would spend again.
This book was really, really good! It kept me wondering the whole time and definitely had an ending I didn't expect! I loved it!!
I think I got caught in the hype of this book and expected it to be better. I liked it but it felt a little long and predictable.
it took a while to get into it--too many broken people at first.  But then the 'mystery' intrigued me and I'm glad I finished it.
Loved the book. If you read and liked Gone Girl , you would most likely like this. A psychological novel that keeps you guessing.
Couldn't put it down and was so disappointed to find out it was her first novel so I couldn't read any others by the same author!
I liked the characters and the way this book was set up.  This mom of two who never has time to read enjoyed this book very much.
I liked the style of this author and found it hard to put down. Also wasn't disappointed with the ending like I was in Gone Girl.
I enjoy a good mystery thriller and this is one!  Each character is likeable but flawed until they are exposed to the real truth.
I enjoyed this book.  It reminded me of Gone Girl but I still thought that it was good story and it kept my attention to the end.
This is a good read with an ending that is disclosed a bit before the book actually ends. I would recommend it for entertainment.
Wow. Just WOW! Kept me guessing until the end. You don't realize how screwed up people can be until you read something like this.
It was an entertaining read. I was appalled by the main character though, hence only four stars. I got sick of being in her head. But the story was gripping, and a real page turner. I stayed up way too late finishing the story. Good read.
I would recommend it to anyone interested in mysteries.  The storyline seems to go slow at times. But then has predicted outcome.
Quite a story!! Certainly held my attention. Another novel about pretty unlikeable people, almost as good as "Gone Girl."
This book had a good plot and was a quick read. I highly recommend it. I will be looking to see if the author has other books out
Think this would appeal to women more than men.<br/>The story is a bit of a downer...not very uplifting.  Kinda a sad love story
I don't read mysteries very often. Maybe I should rethink that. This story kept me guessing and just about made me late for work.
Very well written; could not put it down. I found myself pulling for Rachel even while annoyed with perceived character weakness.
Good read.  Suspenseful.  Figured it out although it took a little time to do so.  Very much like Gone Girl with a male pays off.
For a quick read - it's a bit confusing in the beginning but holds a grasp for you to keep on reading feel in the middle and end.
Slow start but picked up nicely to aa exciting conclusion...interesting character study.  I enjoyed the book, will look for more.
At first did not like the book. The style or even the characters. Did pull together nicely though. Good twists. Worth hanging in.
Every page propelled me onto the next. An amazing read. It usually takes me a month to read a book but I finished this in 5 days.
I agree that it's like a drunk alog, depressing and was not drawn into the story. Hard to finnish and then sorry I took the time.
It was such a downer but ended up being very good.  I couldn't put it down toward the end - was too excited to see what happened.
This book was very enjoyable. It keep me interested from beginning to end. Couldn't wait until the end to find out what happened.
Love how this book has multiple points of view.  Well written and it was one that kept you guessing. I would definitely recommend
A bit hard to follow at the beginning but an excellent read.  Once you are into the characters, you won't be able to put it down!
An almost perfect example of the unreliable Narrator. One is surprised by the constant plot twists and turns. Highly recommended.
This story kept me in suspense page after page. The characters were so real I felt their suffering and sadness. A very good read.
Good Book with somewhat predictable ending~ New author for me. Will likely try other books by this author.  Book kept me engaged.
Started off well but the plot is way too drawn out, the characters are flat, the writing is ho-hum and the ending is predictable.
This is one of the best books I've read in a long time...it was a page turner. Surprise ending! You won't regret buying this one.
This book definitely kept you turning the pages! It became somewhat predictable in the last 50 or so pages, but was a great read!
An excellent read...entertaining, intriguing and full of suspense. I was hooked from page 1...and the ending was a total shocker.
Great story.  Surprising ending reminiscent of Gone Girl.  Starts out a little slow but once you get going it's hard to put down.
Written from  the different women's perspectives, which was a different take on a thriller! It was well written and a great read.
I really enjoyed the mystery of it. The not knowing who really did it and being shocked in the end. I would recommend reading it.
Each character had problems - couldn't have feelings for any of them. Was disappointed in the book when it got such good reviews.
I enjoyed the book. Kept me guessing. I don't think I figured it out until almost the end. A Sunday read...rainy day page Turner.
A great read, exciting and heart pounding. Good luck getting your everyday duties completed at least until the novel is finished.
Kept me ion edge throughout the story.  Good character analysis of a troubled woman and how every one sees what they want to see.
This book is really well written.  I enjoyed reading from each characters point of view.  I would definitely recommend this book.
Wouldn't doubt this turns into a movie. I flew threw it.... Found myself thinking about the book and needing to see how it ended.
A page turner!  It's keeps you interested and the characters are great.  Definitely dark as it sucks you into Rachel's alcoholism
Til the last 50 pages didn't know who "did" it!<br/>Great psychological thriller. Cannot wait for next novel from Paula Hawkins.
I thought it was very well written, and the aim narrators personal struggles to remember and the plot's reveal are nicely paired.
Loved the book.  Quick reading.  Just when you think you know who dunnit you find out you're wrong lol.  I'd recommend to anyone.
Liked the book but it dragged on in the middle. Last chapters were intense, I didn't guess the ending. Excellent writing overall.
Fast read. Good characters. Confusing first couple of chapters but picks up after that and I couldn't stop reading until the end.
A fast paced and entertaining read, cleverly written and easily consumed in a few sittings. Perfect entertainment when snowed in.
The author artfully weaves lives together in a suspenseful plot, leaving the reader transfixed on motive and intent. A must read.
I loved this book.  It kept me guessing the entire time.  Masterful character development.  Better than Gone Girl<br/>.  Read it
Wonderful book.  I would recommend this book to a friend.  You are not expecting the outcome.  Read it, you will really like it.
The story is good but kind of predictable.  I found myself getting mad at the main character because she wouldn't stop drinking!
I couldn't put this one down.  Although at one point it becomes quite predictable, it's still a great read.  Leaves you curious!
Loved this thrilling page turning story!  The details made me feel as if I was watching every piece.  Love the twists and turns!
Great, quick read. Geared towards young adults. The story line was predictable. Entertaining none the less! Great book club book
So many twists and turns! So many questions you ask during the book and thankfully they are all answered by the end. Loved it!!!
Overall, great book. It was a little slow at the beginning, but eventually picked up steam and pieces started falling into place
A fun, easy read. A bit predictable but still enjoyable and kept me interested til the end. I wanted to know what happened next!
Loved this book from the very first page! Would recommend it to anyone, especially those who enjoyed Gone Girl. A fabulous read!
Fast paced, easy read. Great for a long afternoon where you can just sit and read the whole book. Would definitely recommend it.
Well written, easy to follow even through the story is written from 3 people's perspective. Not too heavy but not life changing.
You will never suspect who murdered Megan..... The story format keeps you at the edge  until.... Go ahead! Find out for yourself
This is a really<br/>Good read. I like the perspective on a common storyline. Looking forward to reading more from this author.
Gripping!  I would highly recommend this book if you want a suspenseful book where you can't wait to find out what happens next.
Started slow...didn't mind missing a day of reading...from the second part to the end, the pace picked up<br/>and was exciting!
All kinds of unexpected turns. Took me some time to get into it, but once I did.... It was a fantastic read! Worth the purchase.
A Great read. Thrilling. A novel that Definitely captivates the readers attention. I would highly recommend for any drama lover.
Gripping , better than I expected from the reviews.  Unlike "Gone Girl", I didn't hate myself for not being able to put it down.
Wholy smokes. What an awesome story- it's amazing how things will seem, and how they really will be. Couldn't put this one down.
Great read! The characters are flawed and real. It keeps you in suspense until the end. Some of the characters you love to hate.
Great, gripping book. I would thoroughly recommend it to all but the faint hearted! Intense, quick read that is very intriguing.
Excellent read. Could not wait to get to the end to put it all together.  Highly recommended. Great job in keeping me wondering.
It was entertaining and a page turner--I finished it in one day.  Overall I liked it, but it was kind of a poor man's Gone Girl.
Too much feelings and not enough logical deductions from all the characters. already knew the outcome in the middle of the book!
Easy read. Hard to put down. I kept wondering how it was going to turn out. Interesting characters. Shows the crazy in everyone!
I read this book after reading 3 of Gillian Flynn's. I would not call this a good recommendation for anyone who likes thrillers.
From the girl's point of view but it was boring and I never finished the book because the character just kept ranting on  and on
Lives up to the hype. It was a fantastic story with a semi-predictable ending, but still a fantastic read. Love this author now!
It was the first time I have read a book by this author.It was a great read, gripping and surprising. I will recommend this book
Great book filled with its share of suspense! I really had no idea who the killer was! All characters were portrayed fabulously!
I couldn't put this down. I would read on work breaks and dreaded putting the book away. Great read kept my interest throughout.
An enjoyable and creative mystery which you want to keep reading. One theme throughout involves woman's rights and independence.
It took a long time to get to the interesting parts.  The main character, Rachel was just too pathetic through most of the book.
Excellent read- read in less than 24 hrs- just couldn't stop reading till the end. Will definitely be reading this author again!
I was guessing throughout the book.  Well written.  Very real characters.  Anyone who enjoys a good mystery will like this book.
Takes a little while to get exciting, but worth to keep reading.  Very similar to Gone Girl.  Entertaining Read, I recommend it.
Well written, can't put the book down.  An exciting page turner with a surprise ending.  Highly recommend The Girl on The Train.
Couldn't put it down but didn't love it<br/>Very suspenseful, but hard to follow and very dark. Made for interesting discussion
I did enjoy this book, but I am not quite certain why it is so acclaimed.  The characters were all very unlikeable and pathetic.
This book had a slow beginning and it took me some time to figure out the characters, but eventually I couldn't lnt put it down!
I had a little trouble getting into this because it was depressing to start. However once I got past chapter 4 I could not stop.
The woman in this novel were so desperate and pathetic, it was depressing to read about their lives. It was an okay summer read.
Couldn't stop reading; very suspenseful and well-written. Blew off my morning workout to finish it! I would highly recommend it!
Felt I had to read the book and found it slow reading at times.  Never predicted the ending.  Glad I took the time to finish it.
I have an older kindle and pages weren't respected.  It took me awhile to figure what was going on re character changes in book.
Highly recommend this book. Read it in two days..could not put it down. Rare that a story keeps me awake past 10 pm. these days!
I loved it from start to finish. I did not find it so predictable as others have said. I would recommend everyone give it a try.
Awesome!!!!! This was a great read. First time I read anything by Paul Hawkins and I will definitely be looking for more by him.
Because the story jumps between characters as well as timelines, it requires a lot of concentration. But it is worth the effort.
Interesting story line.  Didn't know who the killer was until the end.  Couldn't stop ready it.  I had to find out how it ended.
I purchased the book and read it straight through...it's a very good read!  Well written.  I would recommend this book to anyone!
This book was so good I couldn't put it down. Definitely a page turner and well written. Interesting collaboration and build up.
This book was so good a must read!!!! Well written and a great buy. I am looking forward to buying another book from this author
I loved the style with different characters giving their views of the same story while their lives were colliding. Really great!
I wasn't sure about this book at first, but as I read more I became more engrossed in the story and the characters.  Great book!
This book was entertaining and easy to get into. It was a quick and easy read because I couldn't wait to find out what happened.
One of the best books I've read in awhile! At time the main character would frustrate me with her drinking but still rate it a 5
Thrilling. Plot makes it hard to put down. Short read and recommended if you like suspenseful novels. Sorrowful, exciting, lost.
Loved the twisted plot. Very good storytelling and the characters are seriously messy but at time you can't help but feel sorry.
I did not enjoy this book, though I did manage to read it thru to the end. Story not interesting to me.  Sad cast of characters.
I loved reading this book. Just when you think you know how it will end, something changes. I believe I had this happen 3 times.
Wonderful, suspenseful, and completely unexpected. I enjoyed this book from start to finish and had a hard time putting it down.
I got very tired of the alcohol use by the main character.  I also got very perplexed but the jumping time like of the chapters.
Crazy book, crazy characters, enjoyed the tension and the mystery! All the twists and turns in the story kept the pages turning!
I liked the unpredictable element and the psychological point of view. Excitement continued to the end. It was very suspenseful.
Great psychological thriller along the lines of "Gone Girl".  The first book in a long time that I read through in two sittings.
I became really interested towards the end of the book instead of at the beginning.  I would recommend this book as a good read.
I read this on my daily commute to work via train. I can't look out the window of the houses we pass on the tracks the same way!
A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF READING. NOT YOUR NORMAL READ. IT WAS QUITE INTERESTING, AND I<br/>WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO SOMEONE ELSE.
It was a well twisted mystery that kept me going until the end...the end was fairly predictable once you figured out the twists.
Loved it! Great, quick, easy read , certainly reccommend it! Similar to Gone Girl but a little different... Keeps you wondering.
Great, great story.  Well written and suspenseful--it's been compared to Gone Girl--but I think it's just as good if not better.
Hard to follow the characters when reading this book.  It almost seemed like a imitation of "gone girl"'s writing style.
I thought this book was ok.  At first I thought a little depressing. It did keep me engaged otherwise I would not have finished.
The book was a real page turner and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I woud definitely recommend it if you like psycological thrillers.
I was caught and excited to solve the .mystery. Great storytelling skills. Could not put it down. Thanks for creating this book.
Has good level of suspense and not predictable ending. Keeps you wondering what is going on  until  at least  80% into the book.
Page turning thriller! Just when you think you have figured it out there is a twist. Wonderful read!  Well developed characters!
Love the way the story goes from one person to the other. Surprising  to see the characters change the way they<br/>see things.
Enjoyable read,  It is rare that a book lives up to it's hype--this one does.  Looking forward to reading more from this author.
Good murder mystery with unexpected story line. I got caught up in the main characters crazy thinking. At times painful to read.
Everybody is suspicious.  I don't appreciate the backlash but it was needed for the story to be completed. You'll never guess!!!
Very fast and excellent read. Entertaining and well written. Would recommend this book to anyone looking for a riveting mystery.
Very good story telling and character development - good twists and turns - highly recommend - I had a hard time putting it down
Hard to put down once you get into it but falls down a little in the end. Perhaps a little extension of where they go from here.
A suspenseful novel that will hold the readers interest right to the end. If you enjoy a good mystery, this book is a must read!
Very compelling, intriguing, and totally surprising ending.  Great read!  Never figured it out ahead and that is unusual for me.
If you liked Gone Girl, The Dinner, Summer house with Swimming Pool, u should love this. Think this was best writing of these 4.
This has to be one of my favorite books of the year.  Be aware of the dark content. I have recommended it to many of my friends.
Page Turner from beginning to end.  A great "who done it".  I can't wait to read her next books and pass this one on to friends.
I read this book because there was soooo many 5 🌟 reviews.... It just wasn't that great to me.... Like I said... It was ok.....
Once you start, you can't stop, the most cringe worthy but amazing, the turn of every event it's surprising. Highly recommended.
Awesome thriller!!!! I got lost in this book . I really didn't see the end coming. Such a good murder mystery. I will read more.
Had to see what all the fuss was about with this book soaring on all the Best Seller lists.  I have to admit I was disappointed.
From the first sentence of this book the reader will be drawn in, very suspenseful, addictive. A perfect psychological thriller!
It is interésting as it shows the Inner processes of an alcohólic person, but it laya a sense of doom and dirt, not easy to read
A page turner with twists and turns; a 'you never really know someone' message. I would recommend it if you like a good mystery.
I  not a history buff but I love this story.  Great family relationships.  Terrific story about WW2 that I had not heard before.
It was a good book confusing at times the way it switched from one person to another and my guess about the ending was right on.
A little slow at first, but it picked up quick. There were lots of twists and turns along the way. Original and fresh storyline.
It's an okay book. You keep hoping as you read, you will get to something good.  It does end with a twist you didn't see coming.
This is not just any mystery/thriller--It is a wonderfully written saga about lives that intertwine in troubling ways.  Read it!
It was a good read. Different than previous books I've read. Held me interested to the end. Would recommend  my friends to read.
I enjoyed reading this book.  It was suspenseful.  The author did a good job keeping the reader guessing. I recommend this book.
Interesting twists and turns.  The characters were rich and compelling.  The premise of the train and its role was quite clever.
I read Girl on the Train over the course of a few days. The book held my interest, with the right balance of suspense and drama.
This author enables one to really care about these broken, flawed individuals while maintaining mystery. I couldn't put it down.
Fascinating plot, very unpredictable. Clever writing. I was expecting something like "Rear Window", I was totally wrong!
Not psychologically complex enough but a fun read. Are women inherently naive and weak or exceptional survivors? The jury's out.
Gone Girl lovers wills rejoice at the equally edge-of-your-seat type of suspense in The Girl on the Train! Couldn't put it down!
Couldn't put it down, couldn't sleep or eat till I was finished reading.  I highly recommend it.  Grabs you from the first page.
Loved the uneasy feeling throughout.  True Suspense novel where one is never sure who the villain might be.  Right until the end
I really enjoyed this story, thought it was well written and recommended it to several friends.  Hope they make it into a movie.
Suspenseful and surprising, I couldn't put it down! And I'm not a fast reader. Probably the best book I've read since Gone Girl.
The story,which is told by 3 different characters, was clever & kept my interest. The ending was unexpected. Highly recommended.
WOW some kind of story. A little hard to get into but worth the effort. The story draws the reader into the Psyche of the "girl"
This was recommended to me after reading Gone Girl. I found it just as addicting but a little less twisted, more expected turns.
This was a very gripping suspense story- very well written, very well constructed.  Can't imagine what book can follow this one!
I enjoyed this book very much.  The book club I am a part of read and discussed the book.  A real page turner and. An easy read.
.<br/>Everything a good mystery should be, intrigue,romance,sex and a lot of twists and turns. A surprise  around every corner.
Good read! It left me guessing who the killer was until the last chapter! I liked this book. I would recommend it to my friends.
Great writing... Story was told from three different points of view. Did not want to put this book down. Read this book?  YES!!!
Reminded me a little of Gone Girl, in that the points of view and timeline jumped around. It kept you guessing. A great mystery.
I love books that flow well, and this one did!  Such a good story.  Always looking for something different and this one was fun!
Very hard to put down. I was so torn between thinking what a lunatic she is and feeling so sorry for her. A lesson and a thrill.
Rachel needs professional help. Another book could be written about her after she gets the help she needs. I look forward to it.
The book was okay.  It took awhile to figure out the pattern of the book with the three women.<br/>A little confusing at first.
This story will grab you at the start but will leave you AMAZED in the middle n Sad to see it end. Would make an AWESOME MOVIE!!
Not the greatest piece of thrillers, but very gripping and the storyline stays tight. A page turner for sure. Good weekend read!
I loved the suspense, couldn't put it down.<br/>I could relate with the 3 main characters.<br/>I wish I could write like that.
Could not put this book down! Enjoyed the multiple points of view.  The writing is phenomenal and the characters well developed.
Very good & well written.  I  can see why this is a popular book, but it didn't take a genius to see where the story was headed.
This is a great read. Not your typical who done it. After just a couple of chapters I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended!!
I loved being on the edge of my seat waiting out the twists and turns! Phenomenal truths to be found out; you'll love this book!
"The Girl on the Train: A Novel" was a real page turner.  Loved it and recommend it for anyone who loves a wild and wicked ride!
What a dynamic read! This book held my interest throughout. Great story with despicable characters. Well written as well, enjoy!
This was a page turner, and a fast read. I found it hard to put down. At first I had a hard time following it but it got easier.
Mawkish rubbish!
A waste of time.
Kept me reading!
fascinating read
No
WARNING!!!  With such an interesting premise, my choice was to buy this book, but about a quarter into the book, I realized purchase was a big mistake.  My expectations were woefully too high or this book is woefully pitiful.  The reviewers that raved about the "Hitchcockian" aura apparently understand that concept differently than I; the characters were much too weakly drawn to drive a suspenseful novel.  I agree with other reviewers who point out the constant sexual encounters, the emphasis on the protagonist so weak that any disappointment sent her directly to drunkenness and the dull dialogue that add up to nothing.<br/> Save your money and your eyes (or ears) for another read!
Following the story line is difficult in parts.  Needs to be read thoughtfully to solve the mysteries.  A good surprise ending.
Interesting read but all of the characters are unlikable and the story is unbelievable.  I did really like the whodunit aspect.
This is the first book in a really long time where I didn't see the end of the book coming...it was a total surprise and great!
Very well written. Love loved the characters.  I thought it went fast and couldn't wait to  figure out if I solved the mystery.
Great thriller, similar vein of gone girl.  It was nice to get the perspective of numerous characters.  Really good, easy read.
Just really difficult to get into..jumps around a lot. Difficult to keep straight. Rachel character needs more info at the end.
So suspenseful and very hard to put down.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys psychological thrillers.
Although some of the situations seemed a little hard to believe, the book did keep me interested and there were some surprises.
Wonderfully written. This book had me hooked from the start! Would highly recommend this thriller to anyone who loves suspense!
I haven't enjoyed a book this much in a long time. The characters were great, the plot was twisted and I loved every bit of it.
Figured out who dunnit before the book ended, but that's okay. First book I ever read on my new IPad Air 2 with the Kindle app.
It was a bit depressing at time and didn't move away from being a depressing read.  It picks up some then has a typical ending.
The Girl on the Train is a great page turner.  I couldn't put it down.  Very suspenseful and a really great way to tell a story
Will keep you reading once the hook is set. Bought this book because it had tons of favorable reviews and was not disappointed.
This book was amazing. It may have been due to the fact that I was on a train while I was reading it that I enjoyed it so much.
Took me several pages to get used to the way the story is written, after that, I was on the edge of my seat until the very end!
Not a favorite for me.  Interesting though.  Really don't like books where women are victims and it was a bit depressing to me.
A fast pace page turner that didn't have the obvious who done it at the end. Like the point of character writing style as well.
Keeps you guessing all the way until the end. You find yourself stressing hoping that Rachel will finally remember. Great read.
Such a great read! Great suspense and mystery written with a unique humor that works together to be entertaining and thrilling.
The beginning was a bit confusing but definitely worth reading. Keeps you on edge and questioning the entire time. I recommend!
I felt like this novel was slow and not as much of a thriller as I thought it would be. Definitely not a favorite book of mine.
Not believable. Boring. Wish I had read something else. The characters were whiny and the prose repetitive. A waste of my time.
Another story about unreliable narration..the characters weren't really believable and the book left a bad taste in my mouth. B
Started out slow but once I arrived at the end, I totally understood the buildup. Great book! Hope they turn it into a movie...
I can see Paul Hawkins reading "Gone Girl" and saying to herself  "I can do that".  Unfortunately she couldn't.
This book kept the reader engage. I could not put it down. I read it on my breaks, lunch and before bedtime. Very well written!
Enjoyed this one!  Reminiscent of Gone Girl plot twists but not quite as dark.  Expect to see a movie of this one one day soon!
Pretty boring, just didn't pike my reading appetite at all.  Sorry, but I am sure it is only because it is not my kind of book.
A very suspenseful novel that kept me involved from beginning to end! Would highly recommend this book for a great summer read!
Could not put this book down.  Even though the final twist was a somewhat predictable, overall the story was full of surprises.
A great who done it. It takes a while to realise you are reading a murder mystery. In time it goes back and forth. A good read.
This novel's style reminded me of Gillian Flynn's writing.  Very dark with many surprises along the way.  I enjoyed reading it!
Bought it the day it was released based on the reviews and loved it.  Recommended it for a book club and they all loved it too.
If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this one, too. It's a quick read, you can knock it out in a day, but still a nice thriller.
Weird ending.  Interesting how different people can live through the same situation, yet see things so differently.  Nice read.
I loved this book!  It was hard to even go to bed, I wanted to keep turning pages to read.  I can't wait to read her next book.
Keeps you guessing to the very end, twists and turns that you never see coming.  Definitely worth your time. Great summer read!
A good read, but not in the same class as Gone Girl for me...loved the three different perspectives though.  I would recommend.
Keep rapt attention as to the development of story line.  Didn't want to stop as anticipating what the next character would do.
Would have never guessed the ending! It kept your attention the whole time and made you realize anybody is capable of the worst
Books moves at an easy pace. Love the alternating between characters as the story is spoken. Great twist. Very hard to put down
I couldn't stop reading it. I read a lot of books and this one was a thrill. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it keeps you guessing.
A decent mystery, but predictable half way through. The writing would probably be more interesting to women readers then to me.
This was a suspensful book. I read the bad reviews and can't understand how you can not like this book. I couldn't put it down.
Psychological thriller, suspenseful, honest, chilling. This could happen to the girl next door. This one will keep you up late.
this is a real beach type book, and you can devour it in a couple of sittings, probably knowing soon after beginning who do it!
Like Gone Girl but still really enjoyable. The three points of view gave me insight into each perspective and the end was good!
Full of suspense and tension, this one will keep you reading furiously with your heart-racing until you get to the final words.
Great plot, couldn't put it down.  Similar style to Gone Girl.  Would read other books by this author.  Would highly recommend.
This story is a psychological thriller. There are three female narrators and the author has weaved a tight suspenseful mystery.
I enjoyed the book. I thought it moved fast. I figured out the storyline twist before it was presented, but I still enjoyed it.
Started off real slow. But the interest built up as I continued to read. Would have liked it to have more of a positive ending.
This book ran away with me! I loved the suspense, the story and the way it was told. Going to recommend it to friends for sure!
I get bored easily, but I couldn't put this one down.  The writer has a great writing style and you can't wait to turn the page
I couldn't put it Down. The author gets you inside their head turning<br/>the next page. It will be hard to find my next read.
Really a cliffhanger. .. once I got into the story I couldn't stop reading it.  Very suspenseful. I highly recommend this book.
This was a great read. A page turner, entertaining and mysterious- if you liked Gone Girl, you will love The Girl on the Train!
Good beginning ...repetitious middle ..decent end.  Good read ..but I did have to skip alot in the middle.  I recommend anyway.
Loved this book couldn't put it down from the moment I started reading.  Totally captivated by the characters and their stories
...but that isn't a bad thing. A good page-turner and a lot of unexpected happenings. I would recommend as a quick summer read.
Had trouble putting the book down... had to sneak out of the office to finish as couldn't wait until the evening to read again.
The book was really good; however, it took me a while to really understand what was happening and keep the characters straight.
A very easy read, read the entire book in one sitting.  All of the characters were emotional messes.  Found the book just okay.
What a great read! I'll put this up against Gone Girl any day. Lots of suspense and plot twists made it a hard one to put down.
I could not put this book down. I was going on vacation and I needed a good read. This was excellent and I highly recommend it.
Really enjoyed this book--read most of it in 2 days once I got going on it!  Great psychological thriller with some dark themes
I liked this bool a lot but others in my Book Club did not.  It is a great Book Club book since thoughts on it are very varied.
I know that this is on the best seller list but I'm really having trouble getting into it.  Will reserve getting into this one.
This story is so well written. The characters, their stories and the way they eventually come together. I couldn't put it down!
Easy read but all characters dysfunctional and not likeable. Knew early on who the really bad one was so ending not a surprise.
I got a little tired of Rachel's behavior and the switching back and for in the timeline, but I stuck with it and was rewarded.
I liked the ending, but liking any of the characters was rather difficult. I just needed to know what happened...kept me going.
A thriller which is good recreational reading and holds one's interest, but is hardly memorable in terms of content or writing.
A  wonderfully plotted, wonderfully conceived, and well written thriller, that keeps you turning the pages late into the night.
Recommended by two friends... One of the best reads in a long long time. Can't wait to see what Hawkins will come up with next!
Hard to get in to it but once you are 30 pages in it really picks up. Then I could not put it down.  Finished the next morning!
Tell all your friends and family, it's a must read especially if you like mysteries<br/>Great for book club discussion groups.
Female characters (3) have no discernible character differences. This can lead to some confusion with cross cuts. Thank you. Cp
I really liked this one.  I did figure it out, but it kept me wondering if she would figure it out.  Sad story of manipulation.
Excellent thriller. Well drawn characters. Keeps you wondering until almost the end and then there is still a twist in the tail
We think we know people, even those we are close to. We imagine people as we would like for them to be...not as they really are
What a great book! Interesting from the start! I loved how the chapters would jump from the different characters. Great ending!
Confusing plot  but it causes the reader to think  I love  a mystery  I liked that each character  had  a chapter all their own
I enjoyed the book! I can see its resemblance to gone girl, but it is an easy quick read for someone looking to be entertained.
I could not stop reading!  The writer has you on the edge of your seat throughout the story.  Looking forward to her next book.
So intriguing.  Kept me hooked and interested throughout the entire book.  I finished it in less than a week. Highly recommend!
The ending as not what I expected, a complete surprise and in between the beginning and the end , I could not put the book down
Wow!!!!!!!! What an amazing book! Got a bit slow in spots but the ending more than made up for it. Well with your time to read!
A bit hard to get through because all the characters are loathsome, but interesting and compelling nonetheless.  Worth the time
Fabulous book that will keep you guessing until the very end! I loved that the story was told through several character's lens.
I will be thinking about this book for a very long time to come, and I surely expect this be picked up as a film! It should be!
Magnificent. Cannot wait for her second book. Have shared with several friends, and all agree: Author hit this out of the park.
This was a relatively good read but predictable. I figured it out at the half way point but kept reading to see if I was right.
I really enjoyed this book. Characters were well prsented. Kept you wondErinG riGhT to the end. WoulD like more by this autHor.
This was a fun book to read. The different perspectives and intertwined stories keep you entertained throughout the whole book!
If you want a book to read before bed, this is not it. It will keep you up at night wanting more. I think I will read it twice.
Extremely disappointing.  Drinking problem repetitive beyond my patience with an unrealistic resolution.  Story not believable.
I couldn't put the book down.  Very exciting read.  The villain was a surprise, my kudos to the author. Good and quick reading.
I immediately fell in love with this story, and the twists and turns had me coming back for more. I couldn't put the book down!
Took a while to adjust to writing style of going from one character to another and piecing it all together.  Was worth the time
I read this book in one day because I simply couldn't put it down! Very good read for a book club, which is what I read it for.
One of the best books I have read in a long time. Weaving in and out the plot takes you places you never though would be there.
You will love this book! I couldn't put it down. Such an intriguing and quick read.<br/>Looking forward to Paula's next novel.
I really enjoyed this book, it keeps you interested.Well written with a few good twists<br/>I like this author.<br/>Thank you
A well-crafted compelling novel. As with all mysteries, read carefully. There are many hints along the way. It's a tangled web!
Definitely a page turner, The Girl on the Train had me from the first paragraph. Predictable? A little, but still a great read.
Wonderfully crafted and intense a real page turner. Her characters jump off the pages into your mind. Highly recommended to all
Well written, but too scary a read on a dark winter night. Interesting that all the male characters are by-in-large real jerks.
I liked this book a lot, I am surprised by some of the bad reviews.......I reccomended it to several friends who liked it also.
Well conceived ... three stories strung together make a strong yarn. An enjoyable read from every point of view.  Intoxicating.
Couldn't put it down. Read it in a day.gripping story.think it would make a good movie. Would recommend it to all thriller fans
A really good read. Similar in style and substance to Gone Girl. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a who-done-it thriller.
Loved it! It was depressing in the beginning, but after a while I couldn't put it down. I've recommended it to all my  friends.
I was taken by surprise as to how the plot unfolded. Great characters, vivid dialogue and amazing pace. I couldn't put it down!
Such a great book!  Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to share it with a friend. A thriller with a twist you may not see coming.
I found it quite enthralling<br/><br/>No really like-able characters early on but the heroine has an air of mystery about her
Good but not phenomenal.  If this is her first novel, kudos for the substance.  It certainly kept my interest right to the end.
Superb! I love a book where you aren't sure who is trustworthy and who is not!  I couldn't put this book down until I was done.
Very much in the style of Gone Girl and A Nice Girl.  A pretty fast story with a believable drunk.  Saw the end coming however.
Literally could not put this book down! Similar to gone girl, but different enough to give it a try! You won't be disappointed!
Awesome book,interesting story. It had me right from the first page and then I was hooked. I highly recommend reading this one!
IcCouldn't put it down but I had to for a mental emotional break from this fascinating story, but then I had o pick it up again
This book is fantastic! I loved every minute of it. It was an amazing thriller and if you like Gone Girl you will like this!!!!
WOW what a ride. Didn't want it to end, but couldn't put it down. Just a great entertaining story.  Nothing looks the same now.
Loved every minute of this book.  Loved how all the characters were connected. The writing was beautiful too. Highly recommend.
I really enjoyed the complicated story.  It had me racing to the ending.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves thrillers.
This was really hard to get into. Then about half way through it grabbed my attention. Towards the end I couldn't put it down.
It was a good story. A bit predictable, but it kept my attention. I would still recommend for those who like murder mysteries.
Took me forever to get through this book.  Don't know what all the fuss was about concerning this book when it first came out?
I really enjoyed the book. it starts out mildly enough, but starts getting more and more involved. It was hard to put it down.
The format is different from most mysteries and keeps you reading and guessing until the end. Nice read for our new book club.
The Girl on the Train was extremely suspenseful. Great characters. Wasn't sure Of the ending till the end. Highly recommended.
I love the way the story is told from each woman's point of view. I couldn't wait to see how it all came together. Great read!
Hard time getting into this but kept trying. Hooked me and I couldn't out of down.  This is a must read To the surprising end.
Amazing read great thriller full of suspense didn't even imagine the ending. Addictive read keeps you on the edge of your seat
Best if read in one sitting.  Different characters and time flip-flops can confuse.  I ended up re-reading first part of book.
Loved the characters and interactions. Great story for a beach trip. Thanks Jaye for recommending it. Wonderful book club pick
Got better with every page. Surprise murderer. Thought I would get bored with the main character but I didn't. Not a bad book.
Alcoholics don't know how much they drink..they just drink. The protagonist in this story is a nosy, boring, unemployed drunk.
If you like a fast-paced psychological thriller, you will love this book. It was a fun read, well-written and very engrossing.
Many parts were often drawn out . It was well written, but I thought about not finishing it a times , because I lost interest.
Page turning. I love that they use multiple viewpoints it helps make the story flow. Can't wait to read what else she puts out
Interesting book, that I didn't figure out the "whodunit" until close to the end of the book.  I enjoyed it very much.
It was confusing for the first part of th book until you sorted all the charaters. Then it was difficult to put the book down.
Slow start with many twists.  Once you get into this book you don't want to put it down, even though you know how it will end.
Wow...this book had many twists and turns...really enjoyed it..there were times when I could not put the book down..Great Read
Was a decent but predictable story.  The characters are not well fleshed out and the plot is too neatly wrapped up in the end.
The book started out slow.  I loved the way it developed.  Not telling the ending, but it is not what you thought it would be.
Not like I expected, but glad I stuck through till the last pages. Great read and afraid of the nightmares I may have tonight.
Crazy till the last paragraph .fun and didn't expect it .i don't know why 14 words are required to tell the ending .....stupid
Amazing!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat! Very well written to keep suspense throughout the entire book! Would read again!
An enjoyable read, well written, well narrated, and a suspenseful plot. I read it mostly on MY train commute to and from work.
I liked the book because it was story-driven and, like a train, picked up speed and intensity before it go to its destination.
It started off pretty slow. If I didn't question "why" in the beginning, I don't think I would have finished the book.
About 3/4 of the way through you can figure out who did it but there are still surprises in store. A quick read and enjoyable.
My aunt had mentioned this book. When I was looking for my next read, I went for it. So glad I did. Great story, easy to read.
Such a gripping tale. Difficult to put down, from start to finish. A thrilling ride full of intriguing, believable characters.
I liked the book, but found the switching back and forth from character to character and from past to present a bit confusing.
Excellent read. Grabs your attention immediately. Never certain where story is going and that is good writing. Great suspense.
Loved this book not something I would normally read was looking for something different and I found it could not put it down!!
I just thought the ending was slow. It seemed it could have been wrapped up quicker. I enjoyed the rest of the book very much.
Fabulous read.  I can't tell you how many people I offended because I had to keep reading this book. A truly remarkable drama.
It was hard to stop rooting for Rachel.  No matter how many times she fell, I wanted her to overcome her demons. Well written.
Meh! With all the buzz about this book, I had high expectations.  It was slow to start, quite predictable, and a little trite.
The story is not fun to read but absorbing. The twisted life's of people to self-centered to see themselves as they truly are.
Kept me on the edge of my seat and was a mystery until the very end.  Twists and turns keep you guessing! Intriguing for sure!
Moving from character to another kept me confused.  Also moving from one time period to another and back was very frustrating.
Bad book, I try to read this book but it was so bad that I left in the page 20.... To many publicity but not a good book .....
I love this book. It was a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. It's a mystery based in England which lends a nice flare.
"The Girl on the Train" by Paula Hawkins is a must-read! It keeps your heart pumping fast throughout most of the book!
Good beach read, although pretty depressing at times. I wasn't expecting that from a thriller. But besides that, I enjoyed it.
Loved it!! Suspenseful until the very last page!! I would definitely recommend it to those who have read and enjoyed Gone Girl
The Girl on the Train was well written, and it held my interest.  I am looking forward to reading other novels by this author.
Mistory with twist. Satisfied with the conclusion. My wife's assesment. She's read it.  I Haven't yet . I trust her judgement.
Wasn't sure that I would like this book in the beginning, however I stayed with it and was glad I did.  Ending was a surprise.
It was a little confusing at the beginning, jumping from one character to the other in each chapter, but it all came together.
It's like a psychological murder mystery. Very interesting. We had almost an 1 1/2 hr discussion on the book in our book club.
Although confusing at times as to which person was speaking I found it good reading.  It kept you guessing as to who did what.
Whole gotta crazy!  Reminded me of Gone Girl, but I didn't enjoy as much.  Worth reading, but not the best read of the summer.
It was a slow read for me because of  several different characters speaking on different timelines- but it was a great ending!
Excellent book!  The author captures each character and makes the reader doubt "Who did it?," the entire time. Very good read!
This book starts out difficult to track but quickly graves you. I usually don't read fiction but I couldn't out this one down!
I like the juxtaposition of the 3 main character's timelines. The story was crafted well. I couldn't put it down. I want more!
It was a little depressing at times but certainly kept my attention! I definitely wasn't expecting the ending that took place.
Couldn't put it down...great suspenseful story.  You come to accept the sad truth and then it all spirals into something else.
Look forward to more by this author. Great depth to the characters. Really enjoyed that it was unpredictable. Highly recommend
An unlikely heroine, unloveable and yet you find yourself applauding her courage! Many plot changes and many twists and turns.
Good book. Difficult to put down. I think it's interesting the way the author portrays women in the book. Overall, I liked it.
Kept my attention and did have some interesting twists.  Good insight into alcohol addiction and its effects on relationships.
A great read with good character development and and great twist.  Keeps you wanting to turn the page to find out what is next
Action novel, sometimes a little hard to follow but thought disturbing. Picture of what alcohol can do to your brain and body.
Very original take on a very familiar situation.  A great summer book to read at the beach.  Would make a great movie as well.
Great story!!  I read it in 2  days.  Haven't done that in a long time.  It's worth the effort.  Twist you won't see coming.😀
it was difficult to sympathize with the protagonist and I continued to read to see if I could figured out who killed the girl.
This was the perfect book club read. I'd recommend this book to women seeking a quick read that will keep you asking for more.
Good light read, but I figured out "who done it "way too soon in the book, and I usually don't do that with mysteries!
This book has an excellent plot with decent character development. If you enjoyed "Gone Girl", this is a book for you.
I was expecting more suspense but only found it in the last few chapters. I found the book entertaining and am glad I read it.
This book is well written but did not move fast enough for me...at times it dragged.  Interesting story but not a page turner.
The story is so intriguing and interesting; hard to put the book down! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good story.
Fast read. Compelling storytelling. Great unique narrator. If you liked gone girl you will like this book. Perfect for summer.
I literally couldn't put it down. So we'll written--plot pulls you through at fast clip. Can't wait to discuss it at Book Club
I couldn't put this book down. I needed a distraction from the drama of life, and this drama was much more riveting-thank God!
It started out a bit slow for my taste, but I'm glad I stuck with it. About 1/2 way through the book it gets hard to put down.
Very enjoyable read, easy to connect with the characters - an interesting tale told between the main players..with a fun twist
This book is very engaging. I couldn't put it down.  But u must pay close attention to the dates.  They can jump around a bit.
Great writing, completely unable to stop reading. Enjoyed every minute of it. A must read mystery for all, highly recommended.
for the first book I've read in years.  Had a,hard time putting it down.  I liked the different vocabulary for common objects.
Couldn't put it down! Very developed description of alcoholism and the pain it causes with a twist of redemption. Recommended.
This is the first book, in years, that I was unable to put down until complete. Fantastic story lots of twists....must read!!!
Thrilling, kept my attention throughout the whole book. Nice fun twist in the storyline. Perfect mystery novel for me to read.
Never read this author before. Kept me reading. Good novel<br/>A real look into the hearts and minds of humanity. Interesting
Very entertaining read, reminded me of Gone Girl.  Interesting twists will keep you engaged.  I expect to see this as a movie!
Ok. Characters a little annoying at times and there was one guy in there that I'm still trying to figure out why was he there.
It's been awhile since I could not put a book down. Loved the suspense and mystery. Looking forward to another book like this!
I thought it was great.  It caught my interest immediately and kept me guessing throughout.  Best book I have read in a while.
Overall I liked the novel but at times I was impatient with the pace...sometimes it was almost tedious, but glad I persevered!
Wonderful character development, riveting story, your heart will be pounding!  You will not want to put this book down. Great!
I quit reading it about a third of the way through......just didn't like it.  Am surprised it's still on the best seller list.
Interesting characters and writing style. Have recommended it. Enjoyed the twist and turns. Loved it. Still Need 5 more words.
It was overrated. It was ok. It held my attention the whole time, but nothing shocking or surprising happened. I kept waiting.
I was completely amazed at the clever character writing. I could not put it down, Reminded me a bit of Gone Girl , but better!
I enjoyed this more than Gone Girl because I did not figure out the "twist" until the very end...good, fast, fun read.
Loved this book. It moved along quickly, and I got really into it. I had no idea how it was going to end, and I was surprised.
I was hooked in the very beginning!  Great read!  Love the vehicle of the train traveling through the lives of the characters.
Ok, but not sure why it's a bestseller.  Not overly thrilling.  Could have quite happily gone on in life never having read it!
I couldn't stop reading the book. Superb psychological thriller!  Thanks. I hope there are more books coming from this author.
Loved all the different points of view from all the characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a who done it
Started off slow then picked up throughout and got very I tense towards the end.. Very unexpected, didn't see any of it coming
I found the book to be very good and difficult to put down. It held my interest throughout and wondering who "done it"
This was an excellent book right from page one to the end! You truly get to know the characters and care what happens to them.
I am a fan of alternating points of view. I will admit that I had to keep a record of the characters for this one. Great read.
Enjoyed the twists of this story. Could not put it down.  Read it  in two days.  Everything turns out satisfactory in the end.
Very original and well written....maybe a little dark, but could handle it because of not being the typical story formulation.
This is a good book.  It does "jump around" a lot so you have to be thinking about when the subject matter took place.
This book kept me guessing until the end. I thought I'd figure out something, but a new twist always followed. Good adventure.
This is not the next Gone Girl. It is so much better! The Girl on the Train is one of those books that leave you wanting more!
This book was predictable from the start. I can see how it could be compared to gone girl...gone girl is much better, however.
Very much enjoyed the story as it unfolded, and its narrative approach. A definite page turner that I am sure many will enjoy.
If gone girl were triplets with a twist. Dysfunctional and yet you can't stop reading. Who knew suburbia could be so riveting.
I loved this book!  Reminds me of Gone Girl a little bit.  Not quite as many twists as Gone Girl, but still an EXCELLENT read!
Twist and turns just like a train ride.  Kept me guessing the entire time.  Could not put it down.  Just as good as Gone Girl.
Cleverly written, suspenseful. Couldn't put it down! Kept you wondering until the end. Highly recommended to all. A must read.
Had some trouble getting the hang of switching characters and switching timeline. Once I did tho, really enjoyred this story!!
I must have liked the book since I finished in 2 days,...  Don't want to give anything away.  Good characters and a good read.
From the first pages I was gripped by the story.<br/>A tightly knit story that keeps you wondering from the start who did it.
This was the author's first novel, and it was extremely well written and compelling until the very end. I highly recommend it!
I couldn't put it down. A page-turner to the end.  Flawed characters and a surprise ending. Very enjoyable, very entertaining.
The start is so slow and simple that you may put it aside, but it builds to a very clinching finish. Should make a good movie.
Not typically my genre but ended up just as intriguing and fast reading as Gone Girl. A bit eerie at times with a great twist.
First few chapters seemed a little slow. About half way through I couldn't stop reading.  Can't wait to see the movie version.
Quick read, intriguing story. I wonder if they'll make a movie. Worth your time... a good whodunit novel that kept me reading!
Slow start but over all it was a good read. Didn't like the whiney spells but great twist in the end never thought was coming.
You can power through this mystery and enjoy every moment. Telling the story from three points of view make it truly exciting.
Very engaging story.  Many twists and turns that are a little hard to keep up with at first. Eventually it all comes together.
Kept me reading way past my bedtime!  Fun,twisty little ride.  All the right Ingredients to bake a page turner.  Such a treat!
Started with great interest....was a little redundant and ending was not as much of a  mystery as I thought it was going to be
I could not put it down, best murder mystery I have read in years.  Very clever , suspenseful and a great way to tell a story.
Different, exciting, with terrific twists. Kept thinking it would make a wonderful movie....happy to read it has been optioned
It started out a bit slow but that didn't last long.  Soon I found I couldn't put the book down, I just had to get to the end.
First person voice from three characters. I really liked the format and story. Nice plot twist. Good characters. Strong women.
Decently written. Good storyline. Predictable, I figured it out fairly early on, but I read an awful lot of this type of book.
Great plot.  Kept me thinking the entire time and I didn't figure it all out until the end.  This should be made into a movie.
Great fiction novel. Quick read. Great character development. Very intriguing story with lots of twist and turns. A must read!
This book is gripping! So many twists & turns, you'll never guess what's ahead. Hoping to see this one in theaters very soon!!
Well written story with good imagery and a twist. I liked that the chapters were told from different points of view and times.
A roller coaster, took me a long time to put the pieces together and figure out "who done it". Just the book I needed!
So much hype about this book just like Gone Girl. Very slow start and very predictable. Next time I'll preview before I order.
Not very impressed, somewhat predictable, hard to follow at times, run of the mill type of story been written a thousand times
Loved the writing, the twists and tuns.  When I thought I had it figured out, I really didn't.  Would definitely recommend it!
A very mind grabbing book.  Interesting  characters. Twist and turns I enjoyed it very much, would recommend it to my friends.
Worth the time spent.  A straight who dunnit thru to the end. Great read. Loved Rachel, what a raw, open, empathetic character
Thriller. Fast paced and an easy read. Good story. Ply twists. I really recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read
Too many different characters<br/>At times I couldn't figure out who was who. Maybe that is just me.<br/>I enjoyed the book.
It's been a while since I've read a book that kept me engaged for such a long time.  It was a long story and kept my interest.
Took a while to get into the story, especially since I had heard it likened to Gone Girl.  I did enjoy it but I wouldn't rave.
This was a good read. The women were interesting and were complex. I didn't know until near the end who the real villains was.
Very great book with suspenseful twists, you won't be able to put it down! Highly recommended if you like books like Gone Girl
It's a very intriguing book - I haven't read that far as yet, but I'm already hooked. I look forward to more from this author.
This book was slow to get me hooked but once I got past that, I couldn't wait.  Awesome ending! You just have to keep reading.
The story just dragged on and on. Pointless narrative that didn't confuse anyone. Story is predictable and not worth the read.
Overall I like the way the story was told as well as the plot. Not sure I liked how it ended or how they tied it all together.
I liked the story told in different perspectives though, at times, hard to follow.  I will look for more books by this author.
Kept my heart racing throughout. Very well written. I was, however, wishing that the young lady would get off that darn train!
Very interesting and many twists and turns.  Very quick read.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who likes a good mystery.
Good book. Reminds me a lot of Gone Girl book. Characters rather confusing at first but later on into the book became clearer.
Best book of the genre I have read since Gone Girl!  I started it after dinner and finished it at 3:10AM.  It was a wild ride.
I liked it, but didn't love it!  Somewhat frustrating to read, with constant change of characters.  Plot did hold my interest.
Reading this book was tedious.  There wasn't a single sympathetic character.  I'm completely puzzled by the book's popularity.
Could not put this book down.  It kept me guessing until the end.  Very well written.  I've recommended it to everyone I know.
Very slow and often confusing in the beginning . A good psychological thriller with a twist. I found it hard to read at night.
Very fast reading. One of those true murder mysteries that you just want to keep reading till you have the answers.  Loved it.
Better than Gone Girl<br/>A must read - couldn't put it down<br/>Psychological thriller at its best<br/>Don't miss this one
Sort of a British Gone Girl.....not quite as well-written, but good nonetheless. I recommend it to those who enjoy a thriller.
I had a hard time finding anyone that I liked in this book, perhaps because the characters were well-written. I could empathize with Rachel watching other's lives out the train window, and making up stories about the people she saw, but her involvement in the crime and the lies she told to be part of it made me embarrassed for her.<br/><br/>As the plot moves along, we meet her ex, Tom, and his new wife, Anna, with whom he had an affair while married to Rachel. Then there is the victim, Megan, whose past has its secrets, and her husband Scott, who is the prime suspect, of course.<br/><br/>The book is well-written and kept my interest; I just had a hard time liking anyone in it.
Great page turner, but by process of elimination had figured who done it! Got tired of the continuous alcoholic descriptions.
Captivating story, unique perspective, excellent insight into the addicted brain all weave together into a suspenseful novel.
This book got my attention very quickly and held my interest until the last page. A quick read - couldn't put it down! Enjoy.
Great book I read it in 2 days! Character development is wonderful, giving the reader shocks And twists. Brilliantly written,
Still reading but enjoying it thus far....it's a rather bizarre story line that you have to closely track details to keep up.
Amazing book and very entertaining. Took a while to become interesting but was a very good read once it grabbed my attention!
Good book with much suspense. Dragged on a times, but overall I recommend this book if you're looking for a thriller/mystery.
I was glued to the book until I finished it. I absolutely recommend! this as a suspenseful-makes you really think-kinda book!
Great read. Twists and turns the whole time. Leaves you guessing what's to come next, every time you put the non l book down.
The main character seemed very believable an alcoholic at its worst.  Commuting train was interesting use of a story.  Tense.
Loved this book,kept you guessing all the way! I really enjoyed reading this book and would love reading more of this author.
Good the only issue was trying to keep track of the characters and dates. They do go back and forth otherwise good story line
Psychological thriller that touches on addiction and obsession.  This is a good read that kept me interested till the ending.
Kept me wanting to continue reading. Loved how their lives intertwined. Didn't see it coming, and was surprised in the end...
After finishing this book I wondered why I bothered. Repetitious, unlikeable characters, predictable ending. What did I miss?
It was a pretty good story. The author built the suspense up and the reader was kept on their toes the majority of the story.
This was an excellent read. Slow in some areas but overall it was awesome. Great twist at the end you would never see coming!
So many twists and turns. What's real, who's real? Is she crazy? What's happening?! I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Loved it.
Too contrived . Characters were not real. The men seemed wishy washy. Women were not real. Too much time spent on the train .
A great read! Full of suspense and a quick pace which keeps you engrossed. I read this in a day! I just couldn't put it down!
I completely enjoyed this book.  I felt it was very well written and the story was so intriguing that I couldn't put it down.
I couldn't put it down! It seriously an addiction to read. I had to finish it, couldn't stop until I figured out the mystery.
A great read for anyone interested in a thriller. The twists and turns in the book had me on the edge. A great read all round
Very drawn out for quite awhile Main character can be boring Next comes question of who did it Near the end was most exciting
This is a good story, told well.  The mystery is not the usual graphic one, with blood everywhere, but seems more believable.
This book was incredible. A little overwhelming at first then impossible to put down! Definitely one of my top ten favorites!
It took me awhile to get into the book but then towards the end of the book it was a very quick read that I wanted to finish.
I could not put it down and can't recall the last time this happened to me. The story has tons of turns.  Highly recommended.
I enjoyed this book a lot.  It has been awhile since I read it, but I have passed it to my daugters, who also liked it a lot.
I really enjoyed this book.  It was a little bit confusing but you just had to pay attention.  This story had lots of twists.
Loved the depth of the characters and just when you thought you had it figured out some thing  new would emerge.  Great read!
I was sorry to see the book end. I generally don't read mysteries, but this book has made  me view them in a different light.
A slow start, somewhat confusing but I couldn't put it down once I got started. A great book if you enjoy a bit of a thriller
A crazy, suspense filled story!  I stayed up late reading because I couldn't put it down.  Great characters in a great story.
Hard to put down<br/>Liked the ending<br/>The girl is stronger than you think<br/>I would read another book by this author
If you like Gone Girl, you should like this book as well. Great, easy read... couldn't wait to see how it would all play out!
It was an interesting twist and kept my attention until about 80% through but the female characters leave much to be desired!
Wasn't expecting all the twists and turns. Definitely worth checking out. You won't be disappointed. A very good read. Thanks
Read this in book club. Many were disapponted because it was hyped up alot in comparison to Gone girl. Not a bad read though.
This is a disturbing story about flawed humans trying to find truth and redemption.  So much manipulation and many surprises.
Good writing although the main character is an alcoholic and is less than appealing so it's hard to care what happens to her.
Now I know why this book has been on the best seller list for so long! A great read and kept me guessing right up to the end.
Suspenseful-can't wait to read the next page. Great twist at the end! Will not let u put is down until the last page is read.
compelling. I couldn't put it down.  As soon as I thought I had it figured out, it took another turn.  Best book this summer.
This story kept me guessing up until the end. Believable characters that caused so many emotion. Could not put this one down.
Interesting, intriguing, I wanted to keep reading to find out the outcome. I liked that it is set in England and with a train
average writing, shallow character development, just another soap opera class read, quick easy mindless entertainment at best
Holds your interest.  I found myself absorbed in the story and couldn't wait to see how it ended.  The ending was unexpected.
This book was an unexpected delight. I love the way the story unfolds. My only wish is that I hadn't read it so quickly...:(.
good reading, little hard getting into it, switching characters stories was a little difficult, but all and all a good story.
Decent who done it but predictable.  Similar to Gone Girl but not as twisted.  This one is a quick easy read worth your time.
Great book! Draws you in right at the beginning. I definitely recommend it for people who like a well written suspense novel.
Good psychological thriller. Took me a fair amount of time to determine the killer... Hope she writes another one.... Cheers!
As captivating as Gone Girl, I couldn't stop reading this. A psychological thriller that leaves you wanting more. A must read
Okay read. Decent thriller. Give it a chapter, you'll get into it. Characters had depth. Would be great to make into a movie!
We read this for book club, the main character is very odd but overall the story telling was great, lots of twists and turns.
Gripping from halfway till the end. Could not put it down and then twisted into an ending you don't quite expect. Great book.
The timeline was difficult to keep up with, and all the women characters were so much alike it was easy to get them confused.
Reminiscent of Gone Girl , Rachel's alcoholism perspective give the plot some suspense. All vapid characters to say the least
This was a good book, it kind of went up and down with the pace, but the last 20% of the book I HAD TO READ IN ONE SITTING!!!
Sometime reads like it was taken from a TV Soap Opera.  Think it would make a Great movie in the hands of the right director.
I could not put this book down. Very suspenseful and total page turner. Good character development and storyline. Great read!
Great read once you get into it. Starts slow but ends fast.<br/><br/>Overall a good read. Looking forward to the next book.
I loved this story and got so engrossed in their stories. I felt as if I was watching this unfold from the train. Great Ride!
Mesmerizing!  Similar to the format of 'Gone Girl' but you actually like the characters.  Great ending, couldn't put it down!
It's a good "Summer Read" but it's been compared to GONE GIRL and I feel it's just not as complex nor as suspenseful.
It was so difficult to get through this book that I finally read the ending and skipped the last 1/4 of the book.  So Boring!
A good mystery  three women caught in a web of disruption of their lives believing in one man they should never have trusted.
Filled with suspense and mystery. Human beings do get themselves entangled in relationships. Too much like a soap<br/>opera.
If you like psychological thriller you'll enjoy this book, a lot like Gillian Flynn.  If you like her you'll appreciate this.
Once I started it is was impossible to put down. I see this being made into a movie ! Best book I have read in quite awhile!!
Not my usual book choice but as it was a book club read it was pleasant surprise as I could not put it down. Really gripping.
This was a very interesting book which moved well.  I will recommend it to my friends even with the occasional foul language.
Excellent read. Kept my interest from beginning to end. Story was not predictable with good believable character development.
This is a very unusual story but very interesting. The characters almost seem like real people. I highly recommend this book.
One of the top ten books I've read this year! Wonderful suspense, keeps you interested in the characters until the last page.
Wasn't my favorite, but still provided some entertainment on a rainy weekend. The twists will keep you flipping pages though.
Love books like this one.  I couldn't put it down and it kept me guessing until the very end. When it was over I wanted more!
Very suspenseful and each character is interesting.  The twists and turns in the plot make you not want to put the book down.
Good Hitchcock style thriller that moves at a good pace.  Would recommend for anyone who likes a good psychological thriller.
Suspense book that keeps you guessing who did it. She really creates good characters that you love and hate at the same time.
The first half of the book was a bit too depressing. The twist at the end was quite dramatic. I like gone girl better though.
Could not put it down, it has so many twists that you don't want to stop reading! Loved the way she intertwined the stories..
The start of the book was a little odd for me, but once I got into it I though it was great and I loved the twist at the end.
Very interesting. Kept me turning the pages. Nice little twists from the middle on. I would suggest to all my fiends to read.
I find it hard to like any character in this book.  They are all despicable and seem deserving of the fates that befall them.
An excellent read with all of the hallmarks of a classic murder mystery and full of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down.
Recommended to read on a trip so downloaded it and read away. Very quick read that kept you guessing until the end. Loved it!
Definitely a page turner. The story unwinds in a unique and creative way.  Great character development of the main character.
I read this book for book club.  The main character Anna drove me nuts with all the mindless jabbering.  I skipped to the Ed.
I really enjoyed this book.  A great mystery that I couldn't put down.  I'm disappointed that it's over!! What to read next??
Really good. Didn't see the ending coming.  Well worth the read if you've ever been betrayed by someone you thought you knew.
It was a very good book.  I thought it started slow but then it really grabbed my interest.  It was a very interesting story.
Started slow and was getting tired on the "train".  But it picked up and took some turns.  Enjoyed for the most part.
I genuinely enjoyed this book.  Told from a different perspective on each chapter.  Very involved and enjoyed this immensely.
Engaging but not engrossing. Well written but slightly predictable. It was a good read while traveling. I would recommend it.
The book was rather dark but the puzzle wove itself nicely. The ending was not surprising but seemed to answer all questions.
Rather a surprising ending.  I really got engrossed in this book.  I wish she had gotten over the DTs a little sooner though!
You won't figure it out until the end! Great suspenseful novel - highly recommended. It's 1:30am - I couldn't put it down....
Confusing at first, but once you realize who the characters are it's hard to put down.  I would recommend this book for sure.
There were so many twists & turns! Just when I thought I figured it out I was amazes by the ending! I thought it was awesome!
Do not usually read this type of book,but really enjoyed it. The story moves at a quick pace,good characters would recommend.
Great read! It was a little hard to follow at first the way it jumped from present to past but I soon could follow the story.
Compelling story.  Could have went without some of the jumping back and forth between characters POV. Was confusing at times.
This was a great story and engaging throughout. I really liked that it was told in the perspective of the various characters.
Great read. Fast paced. One day of those you can't put down.  Did remind me some of Gone Girl but I actually liked it better.
This was a quick read...enjoyably, but no different then any book of this type. Read it before with different names. 1/10 a 6
I enjoyed this book.  It gave a powerful insight into how alcohol can slowly strip your life of everything good. A good read.
The storyline was interesting and had many twists for the most part. Just wish that I hadn't figured it out before the ending
An unreliable narrator seems to be the motif of the moment. There's much about this mystery that will remind readers of *Gone Girl.* There are plenty of twists, but perhaps attentive readers will see the resolution coming. There's a perennial but always interesting--at least to me-- theme here, that perhaps no one is what they seem, and a perennial, and--to me, anyway--not so interesting plot complication com min to mysteries, that only a thin line separates anger management issues from psychopathology. But it's well written and I, for one, found the heroine compelling, in all her disheveled pathology. But, like *Gone Girl,* this one leaves me asking, "So what?" Raymond Chandler or Daphne DuMaurier, this isn't. So everyone is guilty of something in our modern world. What distinguished those classical mysteries might be a hint to modern thriller writers: There has to be one upright person willing to wade through the muddled mess without compromising him/herself at every turn. Otherwise, we may as well give up on humanity and let the sea levels rise.
Beautifully written,  exciting,  mind boggling.  I really enjoyed this book.  Looking forward to author's next piece of work.
Finally a mystery I didn't figure out until the author wanted me to. Loved this. Would love to see Rachel find true happiness
It kept me on the edge of my seat, until the ending which was not to surprising.i probably would read another book by Hawkins
A little slow start but then I couldn't put it down. Excellent character development and plot twists. Read it you'll love it.
Best read ever! Realistic..twists and turns and real emotion. You must read this...you won't be sure of ending until the end.
This is  a terrific book. The plot is well developed  and the characters are very believable. The author  writes beautifully.
It was a slow start. I didn't get interested until the vey end. I found a lot of typos in the book. I wouldn't recommended it
One of the most suspenseful, well written pieces I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. Read it you won't regret it.
Read it in less than a day because I couldn't wait to read the next chapter. Absolutely amazing book that I highly recommend!
Structured like Gone Girl, keeps your interest from the start.  But by midway, I had it all figured out without much thought.
Great read and though you may figure it out before the end. Stiil worth the read. Great character development. Happy reading.
I love a book that grabs me from the start. I don't read novels often and this one was worth it. I didn't want it to be over.
This book captured me immediately and I read it in 3 days (I wanted to skip work to finish it)! Well written and intriguing!!
A good read. Keeps you guessing all the way to the end! I would definitely recommend for all types of readers and book clubs.
A good read start to finish... Love a book that makes me want to stay up all night to finish, and Girl on the Train delivers!
The story leads the reader through the thoughts and disillusions of all the characters. We choose to see what we want to see.
It took me some time to get into this book.  However the last half of it really held my interest and it had an amazing twist.
Really enjoyed this book. Particularly the way the story was presented from the views of the different characters. Well done.
This novel sucks you in pretty quickly and will keep you guessing until the end. Very well done, intriguing, and suspenseful.
Best book I've read since Gone Girl...intriguing and insightful. We read for our book discussion group...lots of good points.
I found it to be a little slow moving. The story was interesting and heartbreaking. I would read another book by this author.
Hard to put it down. If you enjoy mysteries, give this one a try. Well written . I will be looking for more from this writer.
It is well written, simple light read and it keeps you trying to guess who did it, but in the end it's just a lifetime movie of the week script. The only comparison with Gone Girl is the style of the chapter titles and sequence. While Gone Girl is not the greatest novel it's much better. Nothing to remind me of Hitchcock, please!
Gone Girl on steroids. This was literally a page turner from start to finish! Downloading more Paula Hawkins books right now.
Could not put down! Very suspenseful and stayed up late to read. Quick pace with a lot of drama . It thrills to the very end!
The girl on the train is a true page turner.  Characters came alive and worlds intertwined perfectly . I recommend this book.
Not as good as Gone Girl, The good Gril or Big Little Lies. However, the storyline was interesting, but left me wanting more.
There are many twists and turns in this book.  I kept changing my mind about the outcome.  Did not want to put the book down.
I loved this book - the twists and turns kept me riveted, and I'm still out looking for something as good as this great read.
Couldn't stop reading! I normally do not like mysteries but this was fabulous!  Thought the alcoholic depiction was so exact.
Highly recommend.<br/>IIg you enjoyed Gone Girl you will enjoy this.<br/>Lots of twist and turns to keep the pages turning.
Suspenseful account of a masterful liar and the collateral damage he causes.  Could not put it down. Loved the point of view.
This book was amazing.  I started reading it Friday night, and was just going to read a chapter or two, but I just couldn't put it down!  This book is told from 3 women's point of view, and just when you think you know what is happening, there's a twist and you are right back to trying to guess what happened.  It is very well written, and really pulls you in and makes you think. The one part I didn't like was how the book used dates when switching characters, and sometimes I had to go back and see what day and date I had just finished, but all in all an amazing book.  I would love to see this made into a movie.!  I can't wait to see what else this author is going to write!
Disappointing...figured out the mystery halfway through. Characters didn't build enough for, didn't get attached to any one.
THE STORY IS PRETTY GOOD BUT I HAD A HARD TIME FOLLOWING THE STORY IN THE BEGINNING BUT LATER CAUGHT ON TO WHO WAS WHO.  KIN
Felt it was a little slow getting started, but loved all the twists and turns that the story took! Would make a great movie!
Slow moving in the beginning but keeps you reading to find out what happens next. Suspenseful. Reminds me alot of Gone Girl.
Excellent, fast paced and suspenseful story! Just when you think you might have figured things out, a new layer is revealed!
Great entertaining and easy to read! I have attention problems, often cant concentrate to read and this book worked for me!!
Bleak and not the thriller / page turner I expected from it's popularity.<br/>I regret spending the time and money on this.
I liked the story told in different viewpoints, going back and forth between the main characters.  Raw emotion was palpable.
An amazing page turner that grips you till the end. Told from multiple character's perspectives, the story kept me guessing.
I loved the suspense of the book. Interesting ending and kept me interested throughout the reading. Wasn't easy to put down!
One of the best books I've read!! I loved everything about it!! Would highly recommend it!! Suspenseful and very intriguing!
At first, I thought was borring, but after 30 pages it got really good. It's worth reading because the end is unpredictable.
The book was hard for me to get into but then it certainly held my interest and had a very surprising ending.  I enjoyed it.
This book will have you guessing until the end! A great story to get lost in! Definitely recommend! I hope you enjoy it too!
Suspenseful and dark. Twists and turns that keep you guessing the whole time. If you like Gone Girl, this is your next book.
Gripping in the sense that I couldn't stop thinking about this book in between my commenting time and had to finish it ASAP!
This is a great suspenseful mystery type story.  Read it for my book club.  Authors first book hopefully there will be more.
Starts slow but picks up fairly quickly. I was mesmerized until the end. Seems very predictable, then surprises, repeatedly.
Liked the suspense in the storyline and the resilience of the characters.  Not a typical book I would pickup but glad I did.
This is a page turner!  I loved the writing and the characters were interesting.  I actually read this book in two sittings.
I had trouble keeping up with the characters and the flashbacks to other dates.<br/>Probably not a book I would read again.
Superb psychological thriller.  Well written, lots of tension, and no telling who did it until the end.  Highly recommended.
I hadn't expected the witness to be a participant. Very unexpected twists and turns. A little repetitive. Still a good read.
I knew we are all flawed human beings but the characters of this novel demonstrate a level of sinfulness that is disturbing.
Pretty good book. Definitely could not put it down. Formatted a lot like  Gone Girl. Was a bit disappointed in how it ended.
It was good. Got boring I the middle. A little redundant. Kept going on and on. Then it got good again. Liked did t love it.
A thriller to the end.  Well conceived characters.  Plot twists and turns.  Searing in my mind now well after the last page.
Great book! I get bored easily, and often choose tv over reading.  However, this book kept my interest and kept me guessing.
Great quick read!! Good mystery and intriguing characters. Would make a great lifetime movie! Good to read on a rainy night.
An example of British low taste and smutty interests. Perhaps making the reader feel lucky after seeing such pathetic lives?
I loved this book so much that I read it in24 hours. It was one of the best of any genre that I have read in quite sometime.
I felt like it could have been so much better, I guessed who it was within a few pages.  I still couldn't put the book down!
This book is total package of mystery, great characters and a plot that continues to keep the reader guessing until,the end!
Hard to get into the story as there were numerous segments for Ana, Megan and Rachael.  The last part of the book was great.
This was a very good read. Suspenseful at times and definitely a good mystery! Really liked that the main POV was so flawed.
Just okay, not sure why so popular.  I read it for a bookclub and found the mystery to be lacking and characters unlikeable.
Excellent narrative. You are not able to put down the book with unexpected turnarounds in each chapter. I enjoy it very much
Loved the book...a little hard to get into but the plot thickens and oh what an amazing story<br/>Would highly recommend!!!
I read books so quickly I've already sort of forgotten this one, but I do remember it was a suspenseful and addictive story.
It took me a little while to get into the read but well worth the perserverance. A great take on intimate domestic violence.
Excellent story telling. Many twists and turns, kept me busy till I finished reading the book in 2 days, Very good purchase.
Rachel's problems were somewhat tedious for first 2/3 of book.  Her escape from her boozy fog seemed to happen too suddenly.
I bought the book because of it's best seller status.  The book kept me turning pages all night.  Did not expect the ending!
Outstanding! Hawkins captures the torture of the grips of Alcohol-Use disorder while twisting it into an amazing plot twist.
Liked it very much. Interesting characters. I believe this is Paula Hawkins' first book, hopefully she will write some more!
Off the advice of others I picked this up.  Very slow beginning and then the end is drawn out.  Not great but not the worst.
I liked this story it kept me interested. I was surprised at the end ... I couldn't figure it out... Which is a good thing !
Too depressing.  Too much negativeness! Would not recommend it to anyone. I want to read novels about people who inspire me.
This book has so many twists and turns you have no clue what is coming. I loved it ! Please Paula Hawkins , bring us more!!!
One of the best ever.  Very unusual central character - not the usual heroine - and many a plot twist with unusual outcomes.
But then once into the story it twisted my mind and I couldn't decide where it was going! Not the ending I expected, better!
The plot and the intertwining of the characters keeps you guessing until the end. I would definitely recommend it to others.
If you liked Gone Girl you will enjoy Girl on the Trail. It is suspenseful and a page turner. I could not put the book down.
Interesting plot with a few twists. I really liked the character development, however the ending was somewhat disappointing.
Excellent Read! Very entertaining! Keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end! Highly recommend this book for readers.
A must read for anyone who loves complex, suspenseful interaction between the people involved--multi-dimensional--great read
The book was kind of confusing at first untel you realized that 3 people are telling the story. But really enjoyed the book.
A great read.  The more you read, the more intriguing it becomes.  The ending was a surprise.  I highly recommend this book.
Awesome read I was glued to this book finished reading very quickly , it was gripping and a very easy read. Loved this book!
Page turner. Told from different characters' viewpoints. Would recommend to friends. Similar to Gone Girl  but less violent.
Lots of hype around this book. Quick read for summer and kept my interest. A little too predicable if you like who dun it's.
I really don't understand all the hype this book created.  It was hard to get into this book and I didn't enjoy this at all.
Entertaining but it seemed to much like Gone Girl, and I figured the ending out too quickly. Good summer read but that's it.
Kept my interest, but I did predict the murderer halfway through the book. The main character was really frustrating though.
The book is dark and depressing at times, but holds you captive. Excellent writing style and character development. Read it!
Good thing I had jury duty! I was able to read without stopping. The end would have kept me  reading all night to finish it!
I usually see an ending coming but it wasn't until the author subtly revealed the connections that the pieces came together.
It won't take long to get sucked into this book.  Hawkins is masterful in creating an intertwining of lives and experiences.
A past paced, great novel! It definitely keeps you interested through the woke book. I could not put it down! Loved the end!
very readable. An easy read and quite well written. Yet the story is not special though not just violent but with a message.
A very interesting read. Well developed, realistic portrayal of a complicated woman fighting alcoholism and low self esteem.
I absolutely enjoyed this book. Took a while to get going but it was a book I couldn't put down in the end. Highly recommend
I really enjoyed this book. I'd say it was slow in parts, but I enjoyed the characters and the storyline kept me interested.
I really enjoyed this book... I found it unpredictable... a little bit like Gone Girl... but kept me reading til the end....
Best book in ages. Page turner well written to keep you in Suspense. Trying to find more books written by this gifted author
The plot zips along like a train. The characters each tell their story of pain and pleasure. Their lives intertwine forever.
Kind of Gone Girlish......same sort of character development but not my fave. I think I just couldn't cheer for any of them.
A little slow at first and you need to keep track of dates and character perspectives but once you do it's hard to put down!
The book was a thriller! Kept me on my toes!!!! The outcome is surprising. I truly recommend this book if you like suspense!
it kept me guessing all through the book. The ending was not a total surprise but it fit in with the characters of the book.
Interesting perspective of an author; It seemed tense at times and it was easy to feel the anguish of the Girl on the Train.
This story seemed to drag.  Was not a "page turner".  It did have unexpected turns of events to keep suspense alive.
Great story! An interesting way to piece together a mystery. I was pleasantly surprised by the twist at the end. Quick read.
an easy read but not worthy of the praise. i wish i passed on this book. rachel is an infuriating character and unrealistic.
Very intriguing and fast paced! I could barely put it down! I loved the different view points from the different characters.
Surprised ending. I would recommend this book. The beginning was slow, Rachael was pitiful. In the end she redeemed herself.
I binge read this in 24 hours.  Thanks, I think.  Great read, but also slightly disturbing.  Paula Hawkins is a storyteller.
Liked the story, but it was very  confusing in the first chapters, but fine later on<br/><br/>It reminded me of Gone Girl.
This was a great book!  Couldn't p it it down.  Lots of twists and turns. Would highly recommend. You would have to enjoy it
Hard book to read, but worth it. Not for yang people as leaves depressed feeling . Interesting, unusual,  strongly recommend
Liked about it - the narrative style. Disliked - too much details of depression. Overall good read if you like dark fiction.
Different style than I am used to but found it very interesting and intriguing.  I will look for more books by Paula Hawkins
Suspenseful until the end. I had an idea throughout of who the murderer was, but couldn't determine the why. What an ending!
This book kept me on the edge of my feet the entire time!!!! I couldn't put it down!! You never know what's going to happen!
Excellent portrayal of love gone wrong. The story keeps you questioning everything...more than once. Right to the very end !
took awhile to get into then it got very interesting the start was very boring was nearly over the train rides but it was ok
Hard to get started then I found it annoying to keep track of who's speaking and the dates!  More trouble than it was worth.
This book is amazing, there was nothing I did not like about it. It was an easy read and made the time on train fly by fast.
I was hoping this book would live up to the hype and great reviews, and it probably did.  But not for me.  It was just okay.
I read it during my vacation and it was quite entertaining. Recommended to anyone with spare times at airports, planes, etc.
Not as good as all the hope.  The back and fourth in tale telling sometimes made it hard to follow. It did hold my interest.
Very enjoyable,grips you and holds tight til the last page. Would highly recommend this book to any mystery/ suspense lover.
Filled with many layers of the human experience- and a great thriller too!  I highly recommend this book.  A very fast read.
A little hard to get into, but enjoyed the last 100 pages the most!  Good mystery -- didn't guess who dunnit until the end!.
Awesome read!  The twist and turns of the plot will have flying through the pages of this book.  Highly recommend this book!
Had a hard time reading this  depressing Hard to follow  did not care about any of the characters Guess I just didn't get it
Wow, just wow. This book kept me up at the night, an  absolute roller-coaster of emotional doubt and questioning perceptions. BRAVO!
I liked the interwoven stories.  She really let us get inside their head. Once I started this book, I could not put it down.
A very satisfying read! Like Gone Girl, only better character development.  Honestly couldn't put it down! You will love it!
Most books are hard to get into..I really enjoyed reading this book the flawed character come together and secrets slip out.
Until I realized there were  3 different women in the story I thought the main character had multiple personality disorder ,
Well written, keeps one guessing til the very end.  All the clues were there, but kept me guessing.  Read this in one night.
This book was a great page turner. I couldn't put it down. So eager to read Rachel's story then Megan's and Anna's. Amazing!
With all the great reviews I was expecting the book to better. Instead it was very slow and repetitive. Would not recommend.
Absolutely intriguing.  Just don't look for a Hollywood ending.  A griping novel that makes one think and wonder throughout.
Great read and good flow to plot, unexpected twists. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quick, fiction read.
Hard to put down. This book kept me in suspense until the end! Great story line, good characters, and many twists and turns!
From the moment I started this book, I couldn't put it down. It will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.
Gobbled up this thriller in a single day. Fast read told through three fairly ureliable narrators. Sure to be a sassy movie.
This writer wove a story with so many twists and turns, you never know where you'll end up. It engages from start to finish.
After a slow start it did get better, but several times I debated finishing it.  But don't give up on it, it does get better
the people in the story were so real,  My feelings kept changing as the story twisted around,  readers should love this book
This book is well-written. It kept me up at nights reading into the wee hours. And it will stay with me. I highly recommend.
This is a very interesting book. Telling about the lives of three women and how they are connected.<br/><br/>Great story..
weird characters, sad plot.  At times the story was predictable, but mostly just plodding to an end that was, again...weird.
Could not put the book down till it was complete.  Stayed up reading all night, the story was intriguing. Wonderful mystery.
Loved reading this suspense book. The characters and story line really draw you in...I couldn't put it down or stop reading!
Kept my attention throughout.  Kept me guessing.  Excellently written, not your average murder mystery.  Highly recommended.
Great book! I couldn't put it down. Enjoyed the writing style... Very real. Get your hands on this book, you won't be sorry.
Slow start/ steady build up to suspenseful tension. A modern thriller of deception set in a grip background of moral deceipt
Excellent psychological thriller. Lots of twists and turns. You will not want to put it down. Can't wait for her next novel.
Excellent read. Twisting the whole way. I hope she writes another one! Definitely recommend this for a quick but great read.
Well written and with a great plot that keeps you on your toes. Definitely worth a read! It kept me guessing the whole time.
Wow!  Haven't read anything like this since Gone Girl. Lots of twists and turns and completely unexpected ending. Must read.
Could not put this down! Totally enjoyed this book and so well written! Looking forward to another Paula Hawkins story soon!
Couldn't put this book down!! Will have you guessing until the very end. Best book I've read since "Gone Girl" A must read!!
Well written with suspense but in the beginning it was difficult to follow the different charters and to keep them straight.
The character Rachel can drive a reader crazy with her failings<br/>but in the end she pulls the book together.  Good work!
I thought it would play out like Gone Girl but there were plenty of unexpected twists and turns. It was a fantasy each read!
I am someone who takes forever to read a book. Sometimes, 6 months have passed, and I haven't even gotten halfway through a book. This book, however, had me enthralled and I was done within two days. Loved it!
this book is great! some have compared it to Gone Girl and I see the similarities. It's very engaging and lots of surprises.
This book was awesome and I couldn't stop reading it!!!!!!! I wish it was longer but I look forward to more from this author
Loved this book. Captivated me from the onset  Character development and changes very interesting. Good read for a book club
I love how the story was told from three very different perspectives. The suspense was killing me!  I didn't want it to end!
Wow. This was well written, great pace, I thoroughly enjoyed this read and look forward to reading more of the authors work.
Started slow, but once she goes missing.  Hold on. Interesting look at alcohol!  Liked the west it rocked along.  Good read.
I enjoyed the book... It was a little too British at times, but it was entertaining. Slow in the beginning but grows on you.
I disliked this book. No character had integrity or was likable, except perhaps Anna up to a point. It was a dressing story.
A must read.  Could not put this book down.  No surprise that it is on the best seller's list and will be on the big screen.
Paula Hawkins brings the reader on a thrill ride!  For those who liked Gone Girl, you will love this book. It's even better.
I chose this rating because the more I read the harder it was to stop.  I had to finish. I got lost in the book.  Wonderful.
There was a slow start with a lot of info that didn't seem pertinent, but, it all comes together in a spellbinding g finish.
From the first page of the last page of the book kept me reading until I finished the book I found it very very well written
One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Well told and fast paced.  I heard countless reviewers comparing this to Gone Girl.  Please stop!  They are two different books.  They are two different stories by two different authors.  This book has it's own tale to tell and I thought it was well told.  I was interested from the moment I started reading and stayed glued to it for the whole read.  Finished it in one sitting with only a 30 minute break to feed the family.  The story turns and twists and for a while I wondered if I really did have it figured out or was I wrong.  I was wrong and then right and then confused and then a little of all three.  But I loved it.
Slow to get started, I had to push through the first 1/4 of it, the main character not remembering things became a bit tiresome and repetitive. However, the story became more interesting as it went on. Actually seemed as though the writing got better too as the plot progressed. I love a good mystery and part of the enjoyment for me is figuring it all out by the end. For me, this ending cheated the reader because it didn't come from a connect-the-dots progression of events. I expected more. All in all, not bad a read, but the comparisons to "Gone Girl" are misleading. The only thing the two books have in common is the first person narration changes throughout.
Pay attention to the ladies names on each entry.  Once I started, I could not stop, so read it when you have a lot of time!
i did not expect to like this book, as it started off slow.  But the pace picked up, the suspects transfigured.  Good read.
Entertaining, a bit predictable, and I kept thinking to myself, "Well, get on with it, then." But it was enjoyable.
Very good will recommend this book to everyone. Good to the very last page. Good thriller,enjoyed very much. A page turner.
Such a good book. Nailed the twist.... Had me committed to believing one thing and then completely played off the opposite!
I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read. It's full of suspense and such a good twist at the end.
It was a good read, I would not say it was great but ok.  I was a little dissapointed based on the hype from other readers.
I really enjoyed this book, its intensity, and its surprising moments. It reminded me of Gone Girl.. a book I also enjoyed!
Keeps you in suspense from the moment you start reading. Very clever way to weave the characters together. Surprise ending.
I couldn't put this book down. A great plot with the perfect characters and unexpected twists. Would recommend to everyone.
Very exciting, couldn't stop reading several nights in a row. Stayed up very late since I was wide awake from the suspense.
Such a great read!! I finishdx the book in two days. I couldnt put it DOWN!!! I have told everyone they NEED to read this!!
I had a little trouble getting used to the way the author wrote this book.  It had lots of suspence and a twist at the end.
Read this on a recommendation, it was good, but really have outgrown a lot of fiction these days, it is suspenseful though.
Three stars for keeping me engaged and glued to the pages. Totally predictable ending with that cliche bad guy monologuing.
Well written short novel with a fair bit of suspense and creativity. Nothing to write home about though. Overall quite meh.
This book was not to be put down until completion. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to everyone who enjoys good reading.
This was a great suspenseful read. The suspense slowly builds with twists and turns along the way. I could not put it down.
Great writing and so many twists, turns and red herrings in this novel. Couldn't put it down and never expected the ending.
This book reminds me of gone girl it takes a couple chapters to really get into the characters that once you do your hooked
Great book.  I would recommend to anyone who likes Gone Girl.  Similar in writing style with a very different spin.  Enjoy!
It was a good read and kept me guessing.  The characters are not at all likeable, but the story grips you and pulls you in.
Well written, complected, wonder how they will make a movie out of this but then they did a pretty good job with Gone Girl.
Such an amazing and fast read! I felt like I could've been a character in the book, it felt so real!  Loved it!!! MUsT reAd
I love these kinds of books. Nothing graphic, or perverse, just intense. I'll be reading more Paula Hawkins books for sure.
I feel it was well written because I did not suspect the murderer until the end. It kept me involved through the whole book
I did not like any of the characters and just wanted to tell the main one to get a life! Great concept but did not deliver.
A definite page turning nail biting novel that I could not put down.  I felt badly that it had to end.  Will be great movie
I really liked this book and it did remind me of a Hitchcock story.  Sometimes a little repetitive but overall, a good read
The nice job of character development and surprise twists make this novel a real page turner. You will not be disappointed.
This was an excellent mystery that left you  guessing the entire time. I couldn't put it down until the mystery was solved!
A quick diversion with many avenues to pursue. It will keep you guessing all the way to the end. Good luck putting it down.
No too thrilled about this book. It sounded great and I thought it would be since it was a best-seller. I wasn't impressed.
I could not put the book down!  Exciting and thrilling. The book really gives you a different perspective on others' lives.
This book was amazing! It started a bit slow to me, but a few chapters in and I couldn't put it down!! Wonderfully written!
Very intriguing and one of those books you want to keep reading until you finish! I highly recommend for quick summer read.
It took a lot of twist and turns but I figured it out just before the end who really was the one who 'dunnit'! Fascinating!
It started slow but I was hooked and couldn't put it down! Great book, now I need something else to capture my imagination!
The ever changing time line makes this a difficult story to become invested in. It doesn't capture and hold your attention.
Although it moves slowly at times, it is a compelling story.<br/>Recommended for women of any age. I couldn't put it down.
Excellent storytelling, clever use of suspense. I found myself giving up sleep so I could read on to see what happens next.
This is an absolute page turner! It kept me guessing the whole way through. If you liked Gone Girl you will LOVE this book!
Good thriller. Too bad I didn't like any of the characters. All self absorbed. So I didn't feel any vindication at the end.
A good read, not too complex, to easy to predict the ending which I got very early on in the book. Definitely a page turner
This book is a good read. I love the way she introduces the characters to the readers and unravels them chapter by chapter.
Slow in the beginning but evolves into a very intriguing novel midway . Fascinating plot and characters.  Hard to put down.
It takes getting used to the people involved because it keeps hopping around but it is a good story although a little weird
Finished in three days. Had to force myself to put it down sometimes. Love books like this! Great story, very well written.
start especially slow f reading in short bursts of time. I didn't like Any of the characters but that was ok I. In the end.
This book has lots of twist and turns and you have to keep up with the characters as you are reading the story.  Great book
Awesome book that keeps you guessing the next move.  A bit like Gone Girl for all you fans. Great start to summer reading !
No redeeming value to this book at all. I couldn't wait to get it over with. Wish I hadn't spent hard earned money on this.
Mesmerizing but too realistic.  Horror whodunit is not my taste.  For everyone who likes this genre, it would be excellent.
Read entire book in 24 hours.  Story is told from each lead female characters point of view.  Very clever and a worthy read
Love it, addicted to it.  Have to remember who is talking in each chapter.  Suspenseful.  Reminds me of "Gone Girl"
Story had unique premise with entertwined lives.  Predictable ending but lots of sub stories at the end.  Good summer read.
Highly recommend this book. Keeps you guessing til the very end. Has so many twist that in the end you are left with schock
It was  OK reading for me.  It didn't seem to have a lot of depth to it and I don't know why it is on the Best Seller List.
Loved this whodunit.  Very imaginative, very well written, and plot twists like crazy..<br/>Four stars  for Paula Hawkins.
A story with a different approach.  One that holds your interest with surprising outcomes. The ending was as real surprise.
This is a fantastic read, so many twists and turns. Thought I had it sussed many times but fooled me to the end. Loved it .
Great story from beginning to end.  I found myself unable to put this book down.  Unbelievable ending leaves you breathless
Page turner! Smart and kept you entertained. Must read. Now, I wonder what I can read to follow this book? Any suggestions?
Don't listen to the negative comments about this book! Loved it from start to finish!!! I couldn't stop turning the pages !
I like the way it was written going back and forth and telling the story from the perspective of the three different women.
Great book club book. Gripping all the way through. Recommend it for anyone looking for a thrill that's still easy to read.
I enjoyed every moment of this book! All of the characters were woven together so well and you felt like part of the story.
Gripping page turner. Her writing style has you holding your breath as YOU relive it all.  Recommend to all mystery lovers.
Suspenseful and a surprising ending. I thought the plot too confusing and drawn out. I put it in the category of Gone Girl.
I was looking for a book to grab my attention and keep me entertained, and it was a success! I couldn't put this book down.
The characters in this book were so depressing!  I wouldn't recommend this book as I got depresses just reading about them.
Great book, I can see why it was on the N Y  Times bestseller list!  A real page turner , I hated to see it come to an end!
It was a fast read and kept me interested. I couldn't help but feel like it would be a "Gone Girl" ending, which it wasn't.
Engaging characters - real enough to make you feel for them + well-developed twists and turns made this a great quick read.
Very well written. Twists and turns at every page and she really made the characters come alive. Highly recommended for all
Keeping characters straight and time line is a challenge. Hated all of them in the end.  Don't bother or believe the hype .
This book was recommended by a friend . I would also endorse. Ending was a real surprise. Now I will check out this author.
I really enjoyed the book. Kept my interest great book<br/>I thought it could be Tom but wasn't sure till 3/4 way through.
Good read. This book has dimension and the characters come to life. I HIGHLY recommend it! Looking forward to more like it!
Twists, turns, mystery, suspense...I can see why everyone is reading this!! It was fun to read. Don't miss it. Page turner.
This book grabbed me on the first page!  It's a great book to take on vacation and hold your attention all the way through!
I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS BOOK AT ALL.  RACHEL KEPT REPEATING HER MISTAKES OVER AND OVER.  NOT AN<br/>UPLIFTING READ AT ALL.
Held my attention with twists and turns and it still gave me a surprise and unexpected ending. I liked this book very much.
Wow, what a page turner! I read this book in 4 days. The twists and turns of this book will want you knowing who'd done it.
Very gripping...loved every minute of it! A perfect mystery.. I will definitely be looking for more books by Paula Hawkins!
im not good at reviews other than to say that it was a  cant put it down book.... well thought out and very interesting....
From start to finish "the Girl on the Train" is a fantastic well written book, really enjoyed the turns and twists.
I loved the book.  Well written and very suspenseful right up to the exciting ending.  Many twists and turns and surprises.
Even better than "Gone Girl!"  Can't wait to read more by Paula Hawkins.  I read in one day because I couldn't put it down!
Definitely a page turner that keeps you guessing until the very end! Loved how it alternated from each persons perspective.
A good turn pager. Starts off slowly but picks up and has you involved in an interesilting mystery of "who done it"
I really enjoyed this book. The protagonist is so flawed you really don't know what to think, so the suspense really lasts.
Great characters and a suspenseful plot that keeps you guessing. Somewhat like Gone Girl but the ending is more satisfying.
I wasn't enthralled with the book but couldn't stop reading until I had finished it. The ending was somewhat of a surprise.
I knew that this book was going to be good, I didn't know that I would read it all the way thru in one sitting!!  Loved it!
I can't talk about the twists and turns or when I figured it out without giving things away - so just read it!  It's great!
great book! i always like having different perspectives of same events- shows you what you wouldn't usually be able to see.
When I first saw the write-up it appeared to be something I would like to read.,and it turned out to  meet my expectations.
Poor decision making and choosing the wrong partners for the wrong reasons all while mixing it with alcohol.  Good grief...
From start to finish it kept me on edge, loved the character development, had many twists and turns , I recommend this book
The Girl on theTrain holds your interest all the way through. Easy to read, good twist and turn plot. An enjoyable mystery.
LOVED IT!! A MUST READ. THE BOOK YOU RACE HOME TO READ. THEY ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. BUY IT, KINDLE IT.... JUST READ IT!!!
Awesome page turner! Couldn't put it down...<br/>Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing. You won't be disappointed!
Really liked the book.  Very exciting.  Seems like after every chapter I figured the outcome wrong.  Great to the very end.
I really don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say this was a very engaging read!!! Great vacation or beach novel. If you get it, Rachel is a completely believable narrator, made unreliable on purpose!
A very creative approach to telling a whodunnit. Enjoyed although I was lightly annoyed with Rachel by the end of the book.
This book is a nonstop page tuner. You just can't wait to see how it turns out. Just stay with it and enjoy the train ride.
Action packed thriller. I couldn't put it down. A real page turner from beginning to end. Looking forward to her next book.
All the book-review cliches apply here - the book was riveting, suspenseful, full of twists and turns, really a great read.
I was hooked from the start. The characters felt real and the plot was well written, I would definitely recommend this book
Great story with so many unexpected twists and turns.  I had a hard time putting this book down. You won't be disappointed.
A wonderful and suspenful novel with many twists and turns.  You somehow know Rachel is a victim being taking advantage of.
This book is a real page turner. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery. Keeps you guessing until the end.
Overall this book kept my interest, but in the end I  thought the plot was just alright. I had to really push to finish it.
For all those who loved GONE GIRL, this book is definitely for you! Really loved the writing and the character development!
This novel is a page turner!  Just when you think you've solved the puzzle there is a surprise.  The perfect commuter book.
Wonderful story - very much like Gone Girl.  Lots of twists and turns and different narrators in each chapter.  Excellent!!
Good book.  Intriguing characters. I never lost interest. Somewhat on the idea of Gone Girl but not exactly the same level.
Interesting story.  It got better the farther into the book you get.  You can't wait to find out what happens near the end.
I couldn't put this down! The characters are flawed and almost irritating, but the story is so good. Didn't want it to end.
Great read! It kept me engaged and asking questions throughout the entire book!!!! Can't wait to read what she writes next!
Very different than any book I have read.  Not at all predictable.  I did not want to put it down nor did I want it to end.
Enjoyed the book very much. Good, fast moving who done it. Recommend. Nice change in people perspectives kept story moving.
Finished this in one day!  Couldn't stop reading it and what a surprise ending!!!! I would recommend this book to everyone.
Couldn't put it down. For those of us with past drinking problems, the blackouts and the day after, are poignant reminders.
Loved the twists in the book.  I felt anger, respect and hope for the main character. Really enjoyed it. Finished in a day.
A great read.  Fully drawn characters that keep you guessing almost until the end.  Interested to see what she writes next!
I loved this book and couldn't put it down, I finished it in a day! It kept me guessing until the end...I HIGHLY recommend!
Great story. Couldn't stop reading  very intense a lot of twists in the story. Didn't expect it to turn out the way it did.
This was a very engrossing story and one I couldn't put down. It really drew me in and held my attention. Lots of suspense.
Read this book practically in one sitting. If you want to be entertained to the very last sentence, then pick up this book!
Couldn't put it down!  This book was very well written and it kept me guessing until the very end. Would highly recommend!!
A great thriller with perfectly developed characters all of whom have some personal deep flaw that adds to the intrigue imo
I like a fast read.  The steps to the end of the story were not as detailed as I would have expected.  Good book not great!
Great book-- so many twists. Paula Hawkins is a great writer --straight to the point easy read. I definitely recommend this
The book kept me engaged from beginning to end.  Writing style is similar to Gone Girl but this book stands out on its own.
Couldn't lay it down. The plot will make you feel invested clear thru the climax. Mothers will remember this story forever.
I did like this book and it's a fun read. I wasn't as surprised at the twists as in gone girl. But it was a fun quick read.
I dont typically leave reviews but this was a fast past twisted thriller that i would def recommend i couldnt put it down!!
Great premise, interesting plot, easy read ... but ultimately, a disappointment.  Like everyone else, I picked up the book after hearing so much about it.  After I finished, I thought I understood why so many people raved about it, but it didn't quite do it for me.  No question it is told in a heated style with lots of action and plot twists.  But by the final third of the book, I felt cheated, as if the author kind of phoned in the climax and resolution.  Maybe it's just that I didn't find any character I liked even remotely, so there was nobody to root for.  In sum, I would say worth a beach (or train) read, but not a story that makes you want to revisit it.
Good fast read. Thought it dragged in parts but what a twist.  I suggest you read this one. You won't want to put it down.
This is a fast paced book. I liked the fact that the author used three narrators to develop her story. It is entertaining.
great story. Unique, interesting style. A real interest grabber and holder. Thought the ending weak relative to the story.
I like the different perspectives of the women and the way it was written. Main character was literally a train wreck. LOL
This was a great book.  The characters were complex and so well drawn.  A classic "Whodunit" without being corny .
Couldn't put it down! Felt like I was part of the story. Great twists. Excellent character build up. Intriguing storyline.
Ragged at first but hang in there you will start to get a hold of the story and then you just want to know who done it !!!
One of the best books I've read since Gone Girl. The characters were more realistic, though, which made it more relatable.
I liked Gone Girl better but it is twisty like it. I definitely stayed interested throughout. I would definitely recommend
I was hooked from the very first page!!!! Read it in a day! Couldn't put in down! Great read!! I highly recommend reading!
This book grabbed me right from the start...a real page turner!!! I loved the character development. Could'nt put it down!
Quick read I didn't want to put it away! Loved all the characters in the novel. I hope the author has more novels to read.
The story being told in first person from different people made this book so wonderful and unique. Doesn't get any better.
Quick read that keeps you intrigued. Just enough twists and turns to keep you from figuring it out until close to the end.
I didn't like 3 "I" characters.<br/>Became very predictable half way through.<br/>Too much repetitive monologue.
Good book. It was very well-written and I couldn't put it down. Some scenes were a bit drawn out, but overall a good read.
Started the book on a recommendation from a friend and finished it in a day. Highly recommended for a quick and easy read.
The characters weren't convincing and the writing isn't my style. I did finish it though... Only because I needed closure.
Great entertaining book! What am I gonna read next?! Highly recommend it. Kept you guessing and kept you entranced. Loved.
Loved every minute. Caught my attention in the first chapter, and kept it until the end. Many surprising twists and turns.
Excellent" who done it " . Very well written. Keeps you guessing. Reminded me of "Gone Girl" in many ways!
It had me wondering "who done it" throughout the whole book.  Everyone was suspicious, especially "The Girl on the Train"!
I mostly really loved this book!  I thought the ending was a bit of a let down but overall a very clever, engrossing read.
I initially liked the book and found it intriguing, but I found the ending was very disappointing.  Wouldn't recommend it.
Very well written, kept me guessing up to the very last.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this.  I highly recommend.
DID NOT like this book at all, boring and running here and there - could not finish it and very disappointed in the story!
It was an interesting story and kept your interest but it was a little depressing due to alcoholism in the main charaCTER.
Quite the page turner.  Even though I guessed who done it, the revealing of the characters' true selves kept my attention.
Very good read, couldn't put it down! Usually I can guess the perpetrator but not this time, it was a shock and surprise .
All the things a good mystery should be, and just when you're you've figured it out...you haven't. A quick enjoyable read!
Started out so slow. Almost put it down and not finished it. It does pick up in the middle but I really was not impressed.
NOT as good as Gone Girl. had to keep track of different characters, confusing at times. Got better if you stayed wirh it.
I was able to quickly get into the book and couldn't put it down. I was 85% through and had to make myself put it down.  L
Loved it and couldn't put it down. Surprise ending too. get it, you won't regret it. Read it on the train if you have too.
This book reminded me of gone girl the way it was written. If you like suspense and twisted endings you'll love this book.
It was a good book, keeps you engaged.  I thought it could have moved along a little faster.  But all in all, a good read!
Amazing story of the twisted lives of 5 people. Great writing by the author. I'm sure this will be a TV thriller very soon
Reader was Mildred S. Hartpence. held my attention, very hard to put down.  A BIG wow when the perpetrator was identified.
Rivals Gone Girl.  A thoroughly enjoyable read from beginning to end.  If you liked/loved Gone Girl, this book is for you.
It took a while to figure out format, but when I realized that there were different characters it became quite intriguing.
Not my type of book but so well written and compelling. It will surely be a movie. Shocking, mesmerizing, and so very sad.
Great mystery that made you look forward to reading every night to see what you'd learn next.  Didn't want to put it down.
Sad pathetic characters in a well told story. A bit like great Gatsby without the solid nick to tell the story. Enjoyable.
Fast paced, well written and suspenseful til just about the end! Would recommend to those who liked not loved gone girl...
Enjoyed the story. Needed more depth of character though. The imagery is well done tho. Writer has succeeded with the plot
I expected it to be better than it was considering the hype about it, but I found it quite annoying and fairly predictable
Didn't find story plausible.  Characters were unlikeable.  Easy to read but nothing meaningful to take away from the read.
This book kept me guessing. I really enjoyed the alternating perspectives. This is a real page turner. Well crafted story.
Definitely worth the read - ticks a long a little slowly to begin, but the payoff is worth it when the situation tightens.
I'm about halfway through the book and I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN!! I just know something disastrous or crazy is about to happen.
It was a slow start but half way through I couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to my friends and coworkers!
My sister recommended this book and am so glad I listened to her. Good story that keeps you guessing almost until the end.
Not my normal genre but really enjoyed it.  It's definitely dark and interesting.  It's a fast read... good for book club!
It was captivating from beginning to end. A real nail bitting. It was well written and surprisingly better than I thought.
Best book I've read! The audio make the whole experience so much better when you switching from one character to the next!
Excellent story line - I liked chapter headings with character' names-made it easy to keep track of characters' narratives
Well written with the characters in the first person, however I found the book to be very depressing therefore heavy going
Don't waste your money. Felt like there were a few chapters missing. Very disappointing read. Again don't waste your money
Great book! Perfect for some suspense, little darkness and interest to keep reading on...🙅 I would recommend to a friend!
I feel like I have to take notes and make a chart to figure out what year it is and who's who?<br/>Overall disappointing.
Very compelling! Love that the story is from three points of views. Each one with its own secrets. Will make a good movie!
Very well written and suspenseful!<br/>Had to keep reading to see what would happen next! Best book I've read in a while!
Riveting reading - hard to put down, but I had a hard time trying to find someone to root for. All characters are damaged.
Fast paced, not as good as Gone Girl but a good read.  Don't plan on liking any of the characters, they are all dirt bags!
A friend told me she had been unable to put this book down. I was skeptical, but she was right. It's a real 'page turner'.
Well thought out thriller, I agree with most of what has already been written. Better than most but not as good as others.
Found it confusing to keep track of the story with all the back & forth action.  Enjoyed it as I was getting near the end.
Amazing book! I had the hardest time putting the book down. I wanted to read and read and read! You won't be disappointed!
The time jumped backward and forward and was rather confusing but it was a book I would recommend because of the suspense.
Great read, suspenseful with all the right twists and turns! I enjoyed every minute of the book. Definitely a great choice
If you had read the book Gone Girl, get ready for an even better book than that! I couldn't take my eyes off of this book!
Great read!  Stayed up late to finish...  so many twists and turns.  Just when I thought I had it all figured out, but NO!
I read this book in less than a week. I couldn't stop reading and boy was I surprised! It's so easy and enjoyable to read.
I loved it . It very easy to read and engage the reader to find more and more ......<br/>Huge and a big thrill at the end
Good suspense novel about present or former spouces and the cheating that goes on resulying in disaster for some families!
It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the book. It has some similarities to Gone Girl, but enjoyed it all the same.
Enjoyed the twists along the way, though the main character Rachel could've been a little less one dimensional.  Fun read.
To hard to keep track of the players. Chapters to long. Hard to find a break. Hope the next book is back to her standards.
What a depressing story, it continued to keep repeating the same themes running through the story. struggled to finish it.
Quick and engrossing read...Along the lines of gone girl in terms of mind games and thriller.  I would recommend this book
Interesting development technique.  A little wordy to get imagery across but a good read.  Would recommend it to all folks
If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this one.Similar genre,I actually liked this one better.Ending much more satisfying.
Just another "Gone Girl".  All the characters were terrible people.  Could care less what happened to any of them.
This was an easy read but hard to put down. I really enjoyed the way the characters acted in separate chapters. Good book.
The media attention to the book was better then the book itself. Had a good underlying story that was too slow to develop.
This was a good read and I did figure out who did it, but not until alsmost the end.  Lots of twists and kept me guessing.
The book was captivating. It was very easy to follow and had great twists and turns. It was very similar to gone girl too.
Plot twisting back and forth! Everyone was a suspect, to the very end. Would definitely recommend this book to my friends.
Not bad. Easy read with just enough "whodunnit" thrill to keep the pages turning. If you liked Gone Girl you'll like this.
This was a strange book.  I couldn't decide if I liked it, but I didn't put it down.  A story about a sad group of people.
This book kept me wanting to read & read til I finished. I was pleasantly shock with the ending and I love that in a book.
If you like reading about mentally disturbed men and women, read this.  If you prefer sunshine and flowers do not read it.
Pretty good read. I was a bit confused in the beginning because different people in different chapters but figured it out.
I enjoyed reading this book. It isn't often that there is a twist that takes me completely by surprise, but this one dead.
I found it very compelling even though most of the characters appeared to be crazy.  So who was the craziest?  You decide.
Readers who liked "The Gone Girl" will like this novel. Enjoyed the slow build up of tension around the 3 male characters.
Don't understand what people liked about this book. Very strange and to me unrealistic. Not a particularly enjoyable read.
I stayed reading this book and I thought it was so bpleoring. By the time i got to chapter 2 i changed my mind. Great book
This was a fab read. Could not put the book down and what a twist in the end.  Did not expect that. Would give is 5 stars.
This is a well written mystery. The main character is well developed and draws you in to her story and you can not escape.
This book was entertaining to say the least. Two crazy men and three crazy women. What more can anyone ask for in a novel?
Couldn't  put the book down !Great mystery & surprise ending. I will read more from this author,& will recommend the book.
I couldn't put this book down - the suspense is fantastic and it keeps you guessing until near the end. Highly recommend!!
Wow this was definitely a page turner. I really liked the book despite the ending being pretty creepy. Would recommend it!
This book was good to read, however, it jumped around a lot.  If you stopped reading it for a few days you would get lost.
I'm generally pretty good at solving crimes prior to the end of the book. However, this one had me guessing until the end.
Very good story line.  Reminiscent of a Hitchcock story, but also has original ideas.  I really enjoyed reading this book.
You know a book is good when it can actually remove your mind from the present and give you a break from everyday stresses
Read on vacation. Perfect poolside read. Highly recommended. Amazon wants me to keep type type type type type type typing.
Great concept for a story. Interesting main character who is not normal. Her weakness made her that much more interesting.
At first I was put off by the diary format, but when Zi warmed up to it, I really enjoyed the book.  It was a page turner.
The storyline was a bit confusing in the beginning, then the story started to take shape and turned out to be a good read.
Thrilling. Riveting. A page turner til the end. Great for chilling at the beach or stuck on an airplane. Or curled in bed.
I was rather disappointed in it.  From the reviews I expected something in the vein of Gone Girl but it didn't come close.
I Loved the real life issues combined with the can't believe this would ever happen because it probably does.  Great read.
Liked the 1 st person narrators. Liked the psychological suspense.  It was good to see Rachel dig in and find her strength
The story is well written and takes you on a ride that moves quickly. It is hard to put down once everything gets moving .
Very repetitious meaning how many times  are we going to read about Rachel's  drunkeness too shallow not much of a mystery
Not a spellbinding book. Easy to put down  it does draw you back. Not a real thriller. Enjoyable reading for the most part
Loved the story.  Complicated, full of intrigue.  Please write another.  I felt as though I was on that train with Rachel.
Somewhat predictable but very entertaining.  Tempted to read the last chapter to see if I was correct but did not give in.
Could not put this book down, it was SO GOOD.  Mystery, murder, and a whole lot more, I would give it 10 stars if I could.
Great book from beginning to end.  You are never quite sure where you are going but when you get there it is a real treat.
great book..hard to put down.. the descriptions on Amazon do not do it justice.  Good character development and plot line.
I would recommend reading this. Very interesting. Plot keeps your interest and wanting to read more. Was hard to put down.
Picked this novel randomly from best sellers . Found the writing to be very attractive and story line strong and gripping.
Hard to put down. Loved and empathized with all the female main characters and liked how their connection unfolded at end.
Well written with the reader learning a little more about each character as the story moves along! All is not as it seems!
A quick read but it's hard to like any of the characters. Entertaining for sure though and kept me reading into the night.
Totally enjoyed reading this book; it kept me guessing every which way! And, of course, I was clueless up to the very end!
Great book kept me wanting to read and not put the book down until I finished it.  I highly recommend this intriguing book
Amazing read! Loved it! Best read in a very long time! It will keep you up all night, so don't start until you can commit!
All I can say is that this was a major page-turner from beginning to end! Such a thrilling mystery and twisted love story.
Great book. I could hardly put it down. Felt like I really knew all the characters. Enjoyed this<br/>more than Gone Girl.
We chose this book for our book club and really enjoyed it. It kept me guessing up to the end! It really held my interest.
just ok, not sure what i missed and why everyone seems to love this.  it was good, far from great, but certainly readable.
This was a difficult approach to carry off well, but the author succeeded in creating a convincing and suspenseful story..
Amazing read.  This book keeps you guessing and wondering all the way through to the end.  It should be made into a movie.
Very good, couldn't wait to get to the end. Pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this book and it crazy plot twists.
Maybe not on my top 10 list, but overall kept my attention and interest. I was rooting for Rachel through the entire book.
"Page-turner" is a phrase often used, but never more apropos than with this novel. I dare the reader to put this one down.
Starts out a bit disjointed, then seems to be about a psychotic alcoholic, then seamlessly weaves into a fabulous mystery!
i thoroughly enjoyed this book. The Girl on the Train is a page turner with several good plot twists.  It is well written.
Easy read. A bit confusing to keep characters straight in the beginning. Loved it. I'm telling all my friends to read it!!
Ok I found the characters to be very depressing I felt drained after  I finish the book It was well written but not for me
Going back and forth is not for Seniors.  We are set in our ways.  But he story was fun to read.  And I will recommend it.
Great mystery...not as "on the edge of your seat" as Gone Girl, but it definitely keeps you guessing. Good book club read!
This was a well written book that I really enjoyed. Could hardly put it down. Better than Gone Girl! I loved the eeriness.
This book is crazy! Twists and turns definitely worth the read. Just when you think you've figured it all out guess again.
It was very griping, enjoyable if you like that sort of thing.  But I didn't like or empathize with any of the characters.
I loved this book. Took a little while to get the time frame in my mind, but when I did, it was hard to put the book down.
Great book. Enjoyed it from beginning to end.  The suspense built well through the story and the ending didn't disappoint.
I kept going from person to person as the person who committed the crime.  Very interesting and exciting to the last word.
I just finished this book. I missed an event I was supposed to attend because I couldn't put it down. It is a well-written
Just OK.  Despite the "twist" in the ending I found the main characters' narratives contrived and overly dramatic.
Good read.  The book kept you involved and guessing throughout.  I would recommend it to anyone liking a romantic mystery.
Actually liked this better than "Gone Girl".  Characters were very relateable and plot had me guessing to the end!
Enjoyed reading each characters commentary and point of view. Kept me gripped until the end with all the twists and turns.
The author does a great job in keeping you hooked. I read this book in a matter of 3 days. Definitely recommend this book!
Although I have a huge dislike for infidelity and alcoholism, I definitely found myself wanting to find out what happened.
Really enjoyed this book. Was a fast read for me and kept me interested. Highly recommend. Complex and quite entertaining.
Great! I could not put it down. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend to anyone looking for an interesting and great read
The girl on the train was a compelling story of lies, twists, half truths and intrigue.  It kept me coming back for more!
the main characters had no redeeming qualities. Even in the end no one was a victor. Not a good statement about humanity.
Kept me on the edge of my seat! Loved the development of the characters and the insight to alcoholism. Very well written!
Loved this book. Once you start, you just want to keep on going and want to read more and more to know what happens next...
Real page turner... Lots of twists and turns.  Great writing.  Characters came to life.  Love the way the story was told.
It was better than Gone Girl, a similar book and a break from the historical fiction of WWII of which so much is written,
Absolutely riveting.  Great story, and great character development! It reminded me a lot of Gone Girl which I also loved.
A heart wrenching suspenseful tale that leaves you wanting more. I couldn't put this book down! I'm sad that it's over...
I found this book depressing and hard to stick to reading. It didn't catch my attention until more than half way through.
Pedestrian tale about unlikable, sick people, with no redeeming qualities. Boring. Have no clue why it became bestseller.
This story was very well written, keeping you guessing until the end .  I really enjoyed it and could hardly put it down.
Sorry I wasted my time.  Another "Gone Girl".  I should no better than to read something on the best seller list.
This was a very good mystery which kept me guessing.  It was hard to put down and that is always the sign of a good read!
Great page Turner that keeps you guessing until the very end. Hard to put down once the action started. Highly recommend.
This book is an interesting but not brilliant thriller, with characters logical puzzle pieces that all come together.....
It was different than I thought it would be. I was told it was like several different other books but I did not think so.
Fantastic book. Caught my attention from page one. Couldn't put it down. If you like a few twists & turns you'll love it!
While I enjoyed it, I don't think it was equal to the  hype it received.  I had little  sympathy  for the main character.
good book with surprize ending but dragged out too much for my taste.  A little too much conversation between characters.
So many screwed up people playing off of each other!<br/>Far fetched and felt like I needed a shower after finishing it.
Maybe it wasn't the opening you are hoping for but it's well written and exciting! Definitely a fantastic and crazy read.
This grabbed me from the beginning and kept me entranced the whole way.  Very surprising ending reminiscent of Gone Girl.
Great book! Like that it wasn't predictable. Twists and turns kept me enthralled. Would read another book by this author.
It was okay.  It wasn't the kind of novel that captures your attention so much that you don't want to put the book down !
Not even one character is worth anything. Drunk, cheater, laying, ignoring. Bad copy of Gone Girl with a predictable end.
Expecting much more after all the glowing reviews.  Kind of slow. Can't understand how or why  everyone loved it so much.
Fantastic, suspenseful story.  I couldn't put it down.  The author describes the characters in such details.  Great book!
I found this novel easy to listen to on a road trip. It held my interest, but I did figure out who did it before the end.
Although I disliked the main character(found her annoying and dumb) I kept reading as I wanted to see the mystery unfold.
So well written, such a twist! I usually figure out rather quickly who did it but this one kept me guessing! A must read!
Easy read with an interesting story.  I would recommend this book for a nice weekend read as it will keep your attention.
Seemed like a slow start, but once the characters were all revealed I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book.
Although the lead character was the most unlikable woman I've ever encountered in a novel, I couldn't put this book down!
I guess I was expecting more...  Pretty predictable, but overall an easy read (less than two days) and kept my attention.
Not the typical book I normally read but I enjoyed  it thoroughly. You can relate to the main character like it was real.
Wondered about the main character and became very frustrated with her before the great ending- as any good author can do!
Started out a little strange, always on the train. It picks up once all characters are explained. I couldn't put it down!
Couldn't put it down!!! Great book by a phenomenal author!!  I loved Gone Girl and this was just as good, if not better!!
VERY suspenseful and a great page turner!  it didn't disappoint.  looking forward to reading Paula Hawkins' future works!
Enjoyed the book although not a single character had any redeeming qualities. It was not easy to relate or root for them.
Good book, definitely kept me turning the pages to find out what was going to happen next.  The ending was a little weak.
I have to admit the opening chapters were confusing and then it became clearer and interesting.  Surprise ending was fun.
Worth reading it is a throwback to the old agatha Christie but with a modern twist. Entertaining read for the train ha ha
Intriguing thriller that will keep you engaged till the end. Would definitely recommend to all. Very quick and easy read!
This book was a great page turner. It kept me guessing throughout. Enjoyable for mystery suspense lovers. Worth the read.
I enjoyed this book and read it quickly. Simple characters and a bit predictable, but a great read with twists and turns.
The books takes a while to get going but once it does, you're definitely pulled in until the end. Twisted and intriguing.
This book was a good book.  My only complaint is that it was a little obvious in the end. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.
Page turner. What I liked about the book is that it was entirely plausible. The characters were believable and authentic.
Although there are a couple twists and turns, the focus on Rachel's drinking habit was a bit too much. Good book overall.
Little bit slow, little bit already been done...but an easy enough read. Twist at the end that makes it more interesting.
A thrilling page turner definitely worth reading! I was hooked from the very beginning. I would recommend this to anyone!
Great suspenseful book from start to end! Would definitely recommend to a friend to read for their next book! Great read!
I didn't really like any of the characters but I still wanted to find out what happens next. Does remind me of Gone Girl.
Started to get a little disappointing 3/4 of the way in, but started out excellently.  Recommended if you like a mystery.
Unexpected and engaging, even though I figured it out about half way through. Getting to the how and why kept me reading.
This was a great read. The story is well-paced, the characters believable, and the suspense keeps you turning every page.
Riveting mystery - masterfully unraveled.  I loved this book. Once I was caught up in the story, I could not put it down.
I found it dark with  slow plot development.  It was just not anything I enjoyed reading nor would I recommend to others.
I really enjoyed this book start to finish and finished it quickly as it was a good read that keeps twisting and turning.
An excellent thriller, with well-developed characters and tight writing.  Also thought-provoking regarding relationships.
Story reminded me of Gone Girl but at least at the end of this one I didn't have the urge to throw the book out a window!
I gave it 5 stars because it was twisted and kept you guessing. The stories were all different but intertwined. Good read
Took me two days to read because I couldn't put it down. It pulls you in from the start and has you questioning everyone!
I really enjoyed this book, although it took a while to get into. Once you are in, though, you will want to keep reading.
Great way to move the story was done by all the participants and just how they saw everything.  Very interesting concept.
I enjoyed the twists that this story took. Just when you thought you had it figured out, a new possibility is introduced.
Perfect story in every way. Highly recommend it to anyone who likes a page turner. Masterful story telling at its finest!
A little slow to start, but once I sunk my teeth into it, it was good. Would recommend it to other suspence book readers.
It went a completer different direction than I thought it was going to. Good and unpredictable but surprisingly a murder.
Great story but don't like how it was written. Too confusing to follow. Almost put it down but I like the story too much.
I thought her writing was very confusing.  Maybe that is what she wanted.  I had trouble keeping the characters straight.
Fast read and interesting story. Not what I expected. Why do we need to add more words! Short and sweet reviews are best.
Really a surprising conclusion, that keeps your interest right up to the end!! I recommend this book to everyone!!  BRAVO
Great characters ....great who done it story! Hope they are planning a movie for this one. Enjoyed Paula's story telling!
Great book full of suspense! A book you won't be able to put down. Highly recommended. Many toward and turns in the plot.
Engaging from the first page to the last.  The characters are so well defined and believable.  You won't be disappointed.
I really enjoyed this book!  I didn't want to put it down. Much better written that Gone Girl, but kind of the same feel.
Hawkins' plot and pacing drag you through the book at breakneck speed. Everybody's damaged and anyone could have done it.
Engaging, suspenseful, and well written. Kept me up late at night because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
A fantastic read and the perspective made a somewhat typical story so fantastic. Well worth a quick read that's for sure.
It was definitely an easy read.  I just couldn't be sympathetic to the main character.  She was weak, needy, and pitiful.
I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into but let me say I loved this book.  I almost didn't want it to end. Loved it.
This is not a book that I would recommend for anyone to buy or read if given as a gift.  It was a total disappointment!!!
I read this book in one day because i couldn't put it down! Great, fast paced thriller. Similar to Gone Girl, but better!
One of the best reads I've had! Highly recommend this one. Twists, turns, ambitious details... A real page turner for me.
Very suspenseful.  Couldn't put it down.  The characters are well developed and reminded me of the style of Ruth Rendell.
I had not experienced all the different narrators prior to this book. Interesting to hear each character tell their story
I would give this book zero stars. I read it to the end hoping it will get better -- it got worse! A total waste of time.
A very well done book that may start confusing do to the various characters but then becomes interesting due to the same.
It took me a couple of chapters to really get into the book. Once into it it really got interesting and hard to put down.
Certainly a surprise ending.  I could not figure out how this strange story would be resolved.  Strange story sums it up.
Very well written and interesting.  Somewhat depressing at times but good example of addition and what people go through.
Enjoyed-- reminiscent of Gone Girl -- even though the guilty one was fairly obvious, the path was twisted and interesting
Great read. Flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles was 5 hours and I almost finished it front to back. Could not put it down.
If you enjoy suspense, then this is the book for you. A great read from beginning to end. Read it you'll be glad you did.
Almost didn't finish as characters so unlikable till the very end. Style skips around a lot so difficult to keep up with.
Loved it.  Couldn't put it down. The suspense kept me intrigued.  Could be good movie if Hollywood can mms make it right.
Brilliant read - could not put it down. Plot and characters believable and a final twist in the end makes for a great bok
Good read, figured out the twist early but it was still entertaining. Hawkins has a casual writing style. Would recommend
A little hard to follow at first, but when I realized the 1st person speaking was the name of the chaper, I could follow.
Pretty quick read and a few surprises through the very end.  Wouldn't rank in the top ten books I've read lately however.
Great plot with lots of surprise twists and turns. Keeps you wanting to read one more chapter. Definately recommend this.
It was little slow at first to figure out the plot but the ending was great. The characters were well developed and real.
I thought this author had a great writing technique. She kept you on the edge of your seat. Lots of twists. A great read.
Starts off slow , but gets better , kept going back and forth who might be the killer , love that , keep you guessing ! N
A really good read. Once you get into it it's hard to put down. Nothing and no one are as they seem. Don't miss this one.
Enjoyed from start to finish. She kept you guessing what might have happened on that Saturday night. Right up to the end.
I was hooked from page 3. This was a great read if you love to read a good thriller. I highly recommend it for the price.
Great suspense! Loved it!  Kept my interest till the end. Would recommend to anyone especially those who liked Gone Girl.
I loved the book "The girl on the train"!  I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. Delicious reading.
It keeps you wanting you read more.  However, I figured out the ending half way into the book but I still liked it a lot.
An avid reader, but have never had this experience before.  Very refreshing and well written from an unusual perspective.
A great read.....I could not put it down....marvellous mystery....did not  figure out the ending at all.  Give it a try..
Once you start reading, you can't put it down.  Such interesting, flawed characters.  I want to read more by this author.
Kept me on the edge of my seat. One of the best reads for a very long time and I can't wait for her next one to come out.
Brilliant read!! Finally, characters who feel very real in a plot that boggles the mind very pleasantly. DO buy this one.
Although the story was interesting, the writing fairly good, I found the characters distasteful. I did not enjoy the book
Was a bit bored in the beginning, then angered by characters stupidity and drunkenness. Very good read, I give it 5 stsrs
Great story. Couldn't put it down. Liked the setting and characters. I recommend to anyone who loves a good suspense book
It's a page turner! I'm going to read it again!  I couldn't put this book down. Bravo, Paula Hawkins. Great storytelling.
WOW! Fabulous book, fabulous story. Loved it, kept me interested & engaged, right up to the twist in the tale! Good book!
This one is a page turner. Told from multiple perspectives and kept me guessing! Also and interesting story of addiction.
This book slowly drew you into the complex plot very quickly.  Great mystery. I read it in one sitting.  My kind of book.
It was so much better than Gone Girl.  My daughter and I could not put it down. It kept you guessing all the way through.
Little hokey at the end but a fun read.  Pathetic characters really. I liked none of them but still compelled to read on.
So glad I finally finished this awful book. Don't see how it made best seller list. Have read much more interesting books
Very compelling. I never knew where the next page would take me. The characters were all interesting and a bit enigmatic.
Reminded me of Gone Girl type of book...sinister and intriguing and a twisted ending that I didn't see coming. Good book!
This was an amazing book!! I was hooked from the very beginning.  You definitely will not be disappointed with this book!
It is better than Gone Girl  I just ordered a copy for my husband and I cannot wait for him to read it  it is great!!!!!!
More than expected, great book with lots of twists and turns! I loved it and couldn't put it down! Maybe a movie someday!
A good mystery. Hawkins weaves the lives of the characters together in unusual ways and ends the book with quite a twist.
Never saw it coming.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  Not my usual genre of books but I was totally engrossed.
What a fabulous read couldn't put it down!I really enjoyed the author and the story being told from different characters.
This  book was great, it was a fast read and had a hard time putting  the book down.  I needed to find out what happened!
What a thriller. Love the way the characters developed thru the story. Kept me guessing. Will think about it for a while.
It showed signs of a good read at the beginning; however became laborious and disjointed before the midpoint was reached.
Once started had to finish. Simular to gone girl. A good story and plot. I need six more words to submit this. That's it.
Held my attention ... A strong plot, suspenseful and clever.  Good characters.  I enjoyed it enough to finish it quickly.
It was very hard for me to put this book down.  It is written through the eyes of  three women:  Rachel, a divorced woman who is alcoholic, Anna, who is married to Rachel's ex-husband, and Megan, an unfaithful wife.  Rachel rides the train every morning and afternoon, and is fascinated by a couple she sees from the train every day.  This couple, coincidentally, live in Rachel's old neighborhood, where her ex-husband and his wife and baby live also.They are also central to the story.  Rachel sees something one day from the train, and cannot let it go. She must investigate.  This book was VERY good, and I hear it has been optioned for a movie.  Hope so!
Great suspense!  Two primary stories intertwine, one present day and the other a year or so in the past, leading up to a fateful event.  It's an easy read with great details that pull the reader into the story.  At first the alternating story lines were a bit confusing, but moving through the book it becomes clear why the author chose this method to reveal the plot.  Highly recommended!  I will definitely  look for future books from this author.
Did not like it
long and boring
Slow and boring
slow and boring
Didn't like it.
sorry I read it
TOO DEPRESSING!
It was just ok.
Nothing special
too depressing!
I am well aware of the great reviews, I just could not finish the book. Interesting premise, but too slow for my liking.
Very well written.  The twists and turns make this book very hard to put down - with a surprise ending.  Very enjoyable.
Novel is confusing in the beginning. Hard to follow what is happening until you get a few chapters into it. Unusual book
Wasn't a huge fan of the skipping around technique in her writing.  Not my fav.  Good mystery and character development.
This book was recommended to me. Once I started reading it I could not put it down. If you like suspense read this book.
I didn't know I liked psychological thrillers until this book. I couldn't put it down and what a twist.  Thank you Paula
I couldn't put this book down. It was so suspenseful that I had to know what happened next. Great story line and ending!
I enjoyed the book, but it felt similar to other reads.  The beginning was very slow.  Still enjoyed my time reading it.
There were lots of twists and turns.  Finished the book in one day.  Much better than I expected.  Definitely recommend.
characters very unlikable - a bit wordy.  If one enjoys devious twists, it may be enjoyable.  Too long by several pages.
Really good mystery set in London. It is really hard to critique this book because of the ins and outs of the character.
Loved it. Read it really quickly and very much enjoyed the ending. Not super shocking, but exciting. Over all good read.
I didn't like it switching from person to person. Was just ok. There was too much fluffier my attention. Just not for me
An interesting story that makes it easy to identify with the motivation of the characters. A bit long,but with the read.
Read this only if you do not mind disliking all the characters. However the author does a good job of creating suspense.
This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  I was on the edge of my seat with my heart racing constantly.
Its a good story I just got predicted the ending realy really soon so then I was like skipping pages to ge to the end...
Grabs your attention from a very beginning and makes you want to keep reading till the very end. I strongly recommend it
Good but I felt like I saw the end a mile away. I knew who the killer was early in the book. Still I did read all of it.
Unique view from different characters looking at their world from another vantage point or vantage points. Well written.
Okay. Could figure out what was happening in the middle of the book. After that it was like reading to get it over with.
A psychological page-turner.  Much like the Gillian Flynn novel Gone Girl.  I would read something by this author again.
Excellent book!  Could not stop reading - had to do just "one more chapter".  Suspenseful and surprising.<br/>.
Good story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Easy reading with good flow of events with full of suspense and excitement.
Like it... but not really love it... I knew the end of the story and who was the guilty around the middle of the story.,
Started slowly. Almost gave it up. Got better and better but had a bit of a time keeping characters straight. Good read.
Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down! I highly recommend this book! I hope the author publishes more.
Slow start imho but it picks up as it goes on. Great writing I feel the pain and confusion of the characters throughout.
It was basically a suspense novel about an alcoholic.There were no clues leading to the end. Overall, sub par narrative.
I thoroughly enjoyed the perspective of this book. The story was interesting and kept my attention from start to finish.
Compelling. Dark. Maybe a little predictable but still able to keep my interest from beginning to end. I really liked it
Great read! Author built the characters wonderfully! A few slow parts, but most details were valuable later in the book.
Engrossing! I was recommended this book by an acquaintance who said she finished the book in two days-i finished in one.
A chick book, very very wordy. I was halfway thru the book before a story emerged. The end was pretty good and welcomed.
I'm wondering why this has been a best seller for so long. I guess I have missed something. Found it dragging in pla ces
The story moved quite quickly and for me, this thriller had a good plot and reinforces that you just do not know people.
A good novel with several twists and turrns that push the narrative forward and keep rhe reader interested. A good read.
Very well written and suspenseful from start to finish. Good character descriptions, hope there's a movie in the future.
This was a fast, exciting read throughout most of the book.  At the end it was a bit predictable and farfetched, though.
Good, suspenseful but I had a tough transitioning through it with name changes and I had to leave it down several times.
Fast-paced, creative twists and turns, loved the characters!! Amazing summer read to bring to beAch or on a plane! Enjoy
Very well written. Strongly recommended. If you are into some suspense and with a great plot, definitely read this book!
Great read. Ending surprised me. I wanted a different ending to this series. A bit anticlimactic after all the suspense.
Book was very well written. I had a really hard time putting this book down. It was a great easy read while on vacation.
The story line was convoluted, did not think it's ending was fleshed out. I would not recommend this book expected more.
Liked the book. The book was entertaining but I figured out what the mystery was before it unfolded. Good poolside read.
Enjoyable read. Kept me interested. Started a little slow but picked up the pace. Definitely would suggest it to others.
Couldn't put this book down! Just got back into reading and this was such a great choice. I hate that I am done with it.
Suspenseful and quirky, this book is hard to put down. It will not disappoint from beginning to end. Highly recommended.
Interesting book that kept me interested in reading it. Surprised by the end but liked it. Would recommend it to others.
Exactly what I was looking for! I thought I knew what the ending was going to be, but I was wrong. Definitely recommend.
I thought it was a dark book to read.  It was with me all day while I was reading it--always on my mind, but depressing.
I could not put this book down.  I really like the way the author developed the characters who were all very believable.
Too much predictability for me.  It was not well written (I didn't think so) and to me very boring.  I do not recommend.
The plot is good, I could definitely see it going to the big screen eventually but I didn't think the writing was great.
I loved it.  Very well written.  A bit sad but overall I thought it was great. Rachel was a very well written character.
Fast read, kept my interest,  page turner, couldn't wait to read, should make a great thriller movie. Loved the writing.
Page turner for sure with plot twists in a similar  vein to Gone Girl-- with a similarly loathsome  group of characters.
Solid start and ending, but lagged a lot in the middle and became repetitive. Worth a read, but it wasn't a page turner.
Not what I was expecting. It added nothing to my life and makes me wonder why someone would want to share these thoughts
Not completely predictable which is a refreshing change. The book is some what like a Gillian Flynn novel but less dark.
Hard to put down kept me guessing...everything you want in a good book from start to finish.  Perfect beach/summer read.
A little difficult to keep the characters straight in the beginning but once I figured it out I was hooked.  Great read.
Gripping mystery with twists and turns that you have trouble keeping up with. Surprise ending that you never see coming.
Easy, good read with a wonderful twist. Paula Hawkins has managed to capture the readers attention from start to finish.
This is a great book, it was exactly what I was looking for. Hard to put down for sure! Keeps you engaged until the end.
Loved the book kept me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't put it down. highly recommended if you like mystery and drama.
Really draws you in to the story and has many great twists to keep you guessing!  As good a suspense novel as Gone Girl!
Excellent characterization of the dangerous dyadic relationship between an alcoholic and a controlling/enabling partner.
Very exciting book.  Kept you guessing until the end.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller/mystery!
Again, as with so many books, the ending wasn't really satisfying.  Well written, fun to read, and absorbing; but, .....
Wasn't what I expected. Better. Sets up the story well and keeps you interested throughout. Very enjoyable. A good read.
This was a. Book Club read. I enjoyed it.  Kept you guessing almost to the end. I recommend it for an entertaining read.
At first confusing:  It was a lot easier to follow once I figured out that the storyteller kept changing. Great wrap up!
This was a fun read that was a little longer than it needed to be, but unique and fun to read. A great twist at the end!
The plot of this book reminds me of Gone Girl.  At first it seems confusing but becomes clear after you read for awhile.
One of the best books I've read in a long time. Couldn't put it down. Would highly recommend it! It's worth every penny!
Loved this book. Once I was half way through, I couldn't put it down. Recommend for those who love stories with a twist.
Good story that held my interest!  Was hard to follow from one character to another.  Hawkins kept it incongruity along.
Somewhat difficult to grasp initially,however easy to see where it would end midway through the book.  Not a great read.
Usually I have it figured out....not this time.  Felt as if I were there in England watching the characters. Good story!
The plot was interesting and not too predictable.  It did seem to drag a bit in some spots.  It was a good read overall.
This book starts out kind of slow and boring. About midway or 3/4 of the way they is where it starts to get interesting.
This was an excellent book with chapters divided by character. I enjoyed the plot, the characters and the writing style!
Unable to put it down! Didn't see the twist in plot coming! Great character building. Kept my attention to the very end.
This was a great book. I couldn't put it down! I loved how everything came together and kept you guessing until the end.
This is a very well written and engaging story. The best thing I've read since Gone Girl.  I recommend it most heartily.
I did think that it lagged a little toward the end, but what an ending !!!!!  Wow that took me by surprise.  A good read
It was slow in the beginning. But then it picks up to the point that you don't want to put it down. Very enjoyable read.
One of those mysteries that you don't know the answer until the end.  A very interesting twist to the story. A good read
Read this book for Book Club. Once I started reading, it was very hard to stop. Loved it and would definitely recommend.
A plot-driven page turner that keeps you reading late into the night but withvery little depth of character or language.
in the genre of girl gone. a mystery within a story of human emotion. a mystery slowly pieced together from many sources
Better than Gone Girl - still getting different characters POV with a better, more satisfying plot and ending- loved it!
Loved the book. Great read. Can't put book down! Surprises all around, intense in a good way. Highly recommend this one.
Excellently presented story. A bit lengthy to get to the plot but still a good read.  Thrilling and exciting.  Recommend
There are too many similarities to Gone Girl.  They were both selections for my book club.  I doubtI'd have read either.
It was not what I expected but kept me interested throughout. It certainly throws a light on men alcohol and perception.
Intriguing story, but totally frustrated with the behavior of the primary character so made it hard to connect with her.
Great read, with lots of twists and turns.  The ending will be better than you think.  Sit back and enjoy a great story.
A great murder mystery that really keeps you guessing throughout the book. All of the characters seem capable of murder.
Wasn't sure where this was going but a delight to see it unfold<br/>Surprising smart and British with twists everywhere
Enjoyed the book but found it to be predictable. Characters were difficult to like. But did have a few twists and turns.
this book I a real page turner. sometimes hard to read but couldn't turn away....like a train wreck.  highly recommended
Excellent gripping and a shocking twist! Can't wait for more work from this author, this novel would make a great movie!
Even though I figured out who had done it fairly early in the book, I was still unable to put this book down. Excellent.
Very fast read, exciting to the very end. Would highly recommend! Good book for vacation! Totally shocked at the ending!
This book is in nature of "Gone Girl," wherein the mystery is intriguing and the plot fast moving.  A good read.
Slow going in the beginning, but a page turner half way through. Characters are quite interesting. Overall, a good read.
This book had me guessing right until the end.  This book has been compared to "Gone Girl", but I liked it a lot better.
I enjoyed reading it. The story was unique, but it was hard to relate to the main character. She had a big drinking problem and was not able to take charge of her life..
Not bad.  Good plot points.  Good page turner.  Then turns into typical thriller at end.  Great beach novel this summer.
This book keeps you on the edge o  your seat from the first page. I couldn't put  it down.<br/>Same style as Gone Girl.
This book has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster! Couldn't put it down!!! The suspense is gripping and chilling!
Great read.  Well written. The changing character perspectives and the date changes take getting used to - but you will.
Does really read like another Gone Girl, I had to check that it wasn't the same author!<br/>A light read for the beach.
This was a well written suspense story with a minimum number of characters and plots. It kept me interested til the end.
This novel kept me reading, but the characters were annoying and there was a lot of underdevelopment and incompleteness.
Haunting and suspenseful, a reminder that we never know what goes on behind closed doors...kept me guessing all the way.
Perfect book for a book club discussion. Quick read yet packed with action, character connections and some twisty plots!
The Girl on the Train reminded me of a John Grishman book ... quick to read, ok story and ready to be made into a movie.
I had some diffficulty following the story, until I realized it was told from the view of an alcoholic who was confused.
This was a surprisingly good book. Lots of twists and turns. Unexpected ending. Very good. Hope she writes another soon.
What a surprise this turned out to be! If you like plot twists, thrills and mystery..... You will truly enjoy this book!
The story starts out slow. But when it gets going, it sucks you right in! I was not sure who the killer was for a while.
It was interesting, but not the page turner I was expecting.  Having Steven King on the parade me want to read this book
I could not put this book down.  Quick paced, intriguing and exciting.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book!
A murder mystery seen from the perspective of three women.  Very interesting.  It held my interest and was a quick read.
Very Good read! Didn't expect the outcome! Lots of revelations about all of the characters. I would recommend this book.
Fun read...slight twists to the point of utter chaos & then a satisfying clarity.  Real in its treatment of human flaws.
I enjoyed the story. I found it somewhat predictable, but it kept me reading to discover if my predictions were correct.
Wonderful book! I read it in a day on a friend's recommendation. It's the perfect weekend read if you want a great book.
I had trouble getting into this book.  I liked it more as time went on, however, it's not my favorite book by any means.
Enjoyed this book almost as much as Gone Girl.  Wanted to keep reading and not put it down, which to me is a great book.
Hard to put down!!! A great read. Can't wait to discuss with my book group. Suspenseful, with likable flawed characters.
Well worth reading again and again! I could not put it down until I was finished. Definitely worth buying in my opinion!
Well written thriller with a good, unexpected twist. It kept me going and I couldn't put it down. Sad, tragic charcters.
Made a cross country flight speed by!  Girl on the train kept me turning page after page until it's chilling conclusion.
From the first page to the last sentence this book held my interest and left me guessing. A great 'who did it' thriller.
Twisty story well written and suspenseful.  Once you're into it. It's  hard to put down.  Should make for a good movie.
I didn't like the characters which is why it did not get all find ve stars but I enjoyed th book and was engaged by it.
Very good plotting. Interesting characters. Not as jarring or violent a book as many mysteries but does its fair share.
I liked it, but the ending was disappointing. It felt like the author was just done with the book and wanted it to end.
Great Read! Every time I thought I knew where the story was going, I was surprised...and wrong. I couldn't put it down.
Great suspense, the storyline keeps you guessing "Whodunnit?" up until the end, thoroughly enjoyed reading it!!
This is the new gone girl. At first thougt, everyone was really messed up. Lots of twists and turns. Could not put dow.
Suspenseful and captivating. Definitely a page turner. Made me want to stay inside to finish it when I was on vacation!
Even though it is a good story it takes a long time to develop and gets a little boring untill the end when it picks up
Well written. Nice style of alternating between the characters. Kept the suspense well till the later part of the story
I enjoyed this book very much. It wasn't a quick and easy whodunit. There were many twists and turns before the ending.
A book I couldn't put down. It was excellent writing and flowed perfectly. I loved it and am now following this writer.
This book is really hard to put down and great for a cold and rainy day!  Very suspenseful and will leave you guessing.
A good book For mystery lovers. Quick, easy, and enjoyable for intermittent reading. A Similar book style to Gone Girl.
It took me awhile to grab hold of the main character, but I found myself wanting to know how she turned out. Good read.
This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved it. The author weaved each woman's story and perspective beautifully.
Amazing writing that draws you in till the very last page.. Such a good read .. Intriguing, realistic and suspenseful..
i found it difficult to follow at first due to the changing of characters narrating. once got that down very enjoyable.
A fast paced book that I couldn't put down. I would highly recommend this book. Look forward to more from Paula Hawkins
Very well written.  I could not put the book down.  I think I read it in two days....could not wait to see who did it!!
A fun read.... An exciting page turner… But  - not a beautifully crafted book, which would have made it a 4  or 5 star.
Great read! I was hooked from the beginning.  Great summer book that made me stay up late to finish!  Loved the twists!
Great read!! Had me on the edge of my seat!!<br/>Couldn't put my kindle down!! I just had to know what happened next!!
One of those rare books that encompasses your thoughts.  You rush home from work to pick it up, first thing. Addictive.
The author does a fine job of weaving back and forth between the characters.  Suspenseful with a nice twist at the end!
Great read.  Unpredictable.  Very fun, but also sick.  Took about 20 pages to get into but then I couldn't put it down.
I had some difficulty keeping track of who all the characters were.  Good story mostly but I was glad when it was over.
It had me guessing, kept me intrigued. I had a hard time putting it down. Great characters . I definitely recommend it.
Very dark, but it did hold my interest.  Told from the view of three of the characters who are entwined in the mystery.
Good quick read for summer. Good thriller and mystery if you like Gone Girl. Easy to read. Page turner. Very enjoyable.
This is a very good book! I had to keep remembering who was who but I was reading it before I went to sleep each night.
Once you get past the first couple of chapter you can't put it down. The plot has great twists and is a very easy read.
The book was interesting, the characters are all despicable people. There's a nice twist at the end, but it's all dark.
Good book. Train as setting was a nice touch. Main character was interesting. Plot was good but predictable. Easy read.
Very engaging after getting through the beginning. The first chapters are a little confusing but worth working through!
It was a slow read, tedious sometimes, but a good plot, so I had finish.  I liked hearing the voices of the characters.
I couldn't put it down.  Intriguing, well put together. It reminds me of something Hitchcock would want to put to film.
Its a wonderfully amazing story and very well told! There are twists & turns galore and keeps you on the toes. Amazing!
I wanted to know why the characters were motivated to act and react as they did. I can picture this book being a movie.
too slow at the beginning, but it got going at the end. good luck with the next book. I am sure will be looking for it.
Very Interesting idea. Had me guessing throughout the last half of the book. Great writing, with a "twist"!  Loved it!!
Good reading and exploring the mind of a person who has lost the boundaries of society. And then there's the killer....
As literature, the writing is okay.  However, if the reader is just wanting an entertaining read, this novel is boring.
It went into too much lengthy detail with Rachel, in the first person.  The book could be shorter and therefore better.
I kept looking for clues to who "dunnit!" Good read!  I would just be on the verge of figuring it out out, and then....
Nicely paced. Told by two of the characters, alternating, and not necessarily in sequence, so you had to pay attention.
This book was AMAZING!!!!! The ending was amazing, everything about it was amazing. Read it! You won't be disappointed.
Great read. Took me almost till the end to figure it out! Lots of twists! Author did a great job at keeping me guessing
I liked the book and it was a nice fast read.  Different but it kept my attention and not wanting to put the book down.
I don't  understand why this made the top 10 book list. It's dull and boring (someone purchased this as a gift for me).
I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't till the very end that I knew who did it.it kept my interest all the way through.
I couldn't put this down! Excellent story with intriguing twists. There were times I felt I was also riding that train.
Lots of twists and turns generating different feeling about the central figure as the story progresses.  Nice whodunit.
Different approach to telling a compelling story with a somewhat surprising ending.The character development is superb.
This book started out well, but soon became convoluted and drawn out. It was difficult to finish, and a disappointment!
This book kept my attention from the beginning! Very suspenseful and a mysterious, who done it! I enjoyed it very much!
Great book! It held my interest throughout. It is helpful to pay attention to the names and dates heading each chapter.
I did not like the fact that many characters in the book were mentally sick people, i did finish because i was curious.
This book takes several turns and leaves you never knowing what to expect next. A quick read because it's so addicting!
THis book keeps you guessing from the very beginning until the last chapter!  A must read foe mystery and thrill lovers
It was not really believable. I guess just not my kind of book. Liked The Green Line much better- much more believable.
It was difficult to get interested in as it was a depressing start.  It was ok, but not the best book I have ever read.
I honestly did not love it. Premise was good, I wanted to love it but I had trouble really caring about the characters.
It started slow and was difficult to keep track of the characters but by the middle of the book I couldn't put it down!
Confusing in the beginning, but as you continue to read, it becomes clearer! A page turner! Mysterious to the very end!
Sadly to say, this my first fictional novel ever readen. I love every single one ofthe caracters. totally recommended .
Really liked the book. Story kept me turning the page to see what happened next. Did not expect the ending, great read.
This was a great read.  Hard to put down and actually kept me awake and up late reading.  Would make a fantastic movie!
Great book!  You think you have it figured out and then BOOM something else comes up and changed your line of thinking!
Good story that is well written.  Similar to the Gone Girl - keep you guessing - scenario.  But, generally a good read.
Loved all the character's imperfections and the raw honesty of what they were really thinking.  Page turner. Fantastic.
I enjoyed the book and could  not stop reading trying to find out who the murderer was and was surprised who they were.
Wasn't an original idea. Not sure if Gone Girl was written before this or not, but too similar. Good characters though.
This book was chosen for our book club read. I really enjoyed this book. It is a quick read and it is full of suspense.
The twists and turns in this book reminded me of a Hickoch story. It starts a little slow but ends with some surprises.
This is an easy fun read. It's not high art or anything, but the story keeps you interested and has a number of twists.
Kind of slow and depressing getting in to the book, but once the plot starts to unfold you won't be able to put it down
Meh. It's got a lot of crazy people in it. Well written, but all the names are similar so it's a little hard to follow.
I thought the plotting was masterful and suspenseful. Reminded me very much of "Gone Girl," which I also loved.
Well written, and kept a good pace.  A fun 'who done it' plot that reminded me a little of Gone Girl. Good summer read.
Story is told separately by main characters and then blends theirs lives seamlessly at the end.<br/>A good solid read.
A most excellent read. It starts off kind of slow, but when it hits you, you are hooked. I highly recommend reading it.
I like the different perspectives of each character that the author uses. Good book I would recommend for a quick read.
Very slow and depressing. Jumps around a lot. Gets a little better towards the end. I had to force myself to finish it.
I thought this book was very reminiscent of Gone Girl & would recommend it to all who like a page turner! Great ending!
i absolutely loved this book! i could not stop reading!! way better than gone girl! great twist at the end! fantastic !
An old style written book but a great story.  If you haven't read it definitely consider it, reread if a long time ago.
I appreciated his analysis of Israel's past and present history especially the interviews with many prominent citizens.
Intermingled narratives drive to the end of a complicated psychological thriller. Held my interest all the way through.
It was a little confusing, but in a good way. It was interesting and well done to see how the characters came together.
This book was amazing! Dark murder mystery with a gone girl feel. Highly recommended! This would make an amazing movie!
Grabs you from the beginning and you really get to intimately know the characters.  An must read if you like mysteries.
Characters are dynamic, the plot is rich, and the writing is so smooth. Great read full of suspense! Unexpected ending.
It was a great read. A bit confusing at first but once it starts developing, becomes a page turner. Highly recommended.
I enjoy reading mysteries, this one caught me from the first page. I couldn't wait to find out how it was going to end.
Honestly I read African American authors but this book caught my eye so I brought it and read it it one day. I loved it
Engrossing from start to finish. Couldn't wait to get back to it and find out what happened. Very realistic characters.
Thrilling to the end....I couldn't read it fast enough! Highly recommend. Can't wait to see more from this author soon.
Once you got to the point in the book that something happened it was a very good read but it took a while to get there.
Didn't  love it. Storyline forced. Character sketches tied by a weak thread. The writing was well done. The story weak.
I lost patience with characters in no time. I knew who the killer was by the middle of the book. I just wanted it over.
The story drags for the first half alternating between female characters. Second half picks up some speed and interest.
Fast read.  Hard to put down.  Suspenseful and full of twists.  Good choice for book club reading.  Would recommend it.
This was well worth it! It was a book that I did not want to put down and those seem to be few and far between. Enjoy!!
Lots of twists and turns with flawed characters that you weren't sure you wanted to cheer on or watch fail. Good read!!
Enjoyed this bookmaker much.  Starts off slow but eventually builds up and I couldn't put the book down!  A great read.
Page turner, a la Gone Girl.  You know to expect the unexpected and that there will be a twist, but still entertaining.
well written, interesting as told by three separate characters..Did figure out the outcome but not til towards the end.
It was a good book overall.  I found it that it dragged a little in the begining/middle, but the ending made up for it.
It is very suspenseful.  It was hard to put down once I started reading it. I loved all the twists & turns in the story
I just could not wait to complete this book as it was very dark, and depressing.  Not enough mystery to make up for it.
Page turner to the end. Interesting characters and twists - keeps you guessing to the end! Can't wait for the next one!
Well written easy reading loved the few characters Rachel was a mess in the beginning but turned around toward th d end
Still pondering the journey of this book.  A good read.  Don't let the beginning deter you.  Definitely worth the read.
easy read, caught my attention and kept it until the end. Nice surprising ending. Would recommend to family and friends
Highly highly recommend this book. What an exciting and twisted tale of quite the love triangle. Such an original tale.
Great book. Well written. Suspenseful and hard to predict the final twist. Recommended as an intriguing but light read.
Great story!  I kept thinking I had it figured out but I was guessing right up until the end!<br/>Couldn't put it down
I enjoyed the book.  It kept me wondering who the killer was.  Kept story going, not getting bogged down in description
I thought this was a well written and good thriller. Characters were involved enough to keep you interested to the end.
This story soon gets tedious. I did not like the girl and as the book went on did not really care what happened to her.
Exciting read start to finish! Ending was a major surprise, would recommend to anyone looking for a fun, exciting read!
Switching identities from one character to another, by Chapter, was very confusing.<br/>Would not recommend this book.
Didn't want it to end.  I want to read more of her books. I liked it better than Gone Girl although that was good also.
Hard to put down. I haven't read a book that captivated me like this one in a long time. Easy read. Highly recommended.
Fantastic read. A real page turner. I finished the book in 2 nights. So many twists and turns.<br/>Definitely 5 stars.
I had to finish it!! Once I started reading,  needed to continue to find out what happens next. Great for a beach read.
Enjoyed.  On the Kindle there should be some sort of " jacket". It took too long to get the thrust of the stort
very suspenseful, you get right into the characters and their lives, wonder where it is all going and just keep reading
Having trouble getting interested.  It seems disorganized and hard to follow the characters.  I gave up on . It for now
I thought it was a well written book on the order of an Alfred Hitchcock movie, or PD James. Very suspenseful and good.
Started off slow, but turned out to be good. Lots of twist and turns till the end. One of the better book club choices.
A wonderful story. Many twists and turns in this who done it.  I just couldn't put it down.<br/>I highly recommend it.
Excellent  novel.  It's a real page-turner.  I hope Ms. Hawkins continues to thrill readers with her excellent writing.
Wow! Oh the tangled web we weave.... You will not want this book to end. Looking forward to reading more Paula Hawkins.
Couldn't put this one Down! Loved it. Highly recommend if you have a little bit of time because you won't want to stop.
At first I did not care for the book ....but then, once I got into it  I was intrigued by it.  I could not put it down.
It has been compared to gone girl and rightfully so.<br/>Excellent mystery - keeping you spellbound to the final page.
Suspects everywhere but twists and turns until the very end.a hard book to put down.i highly recommend to anyone super!
This was a Kindle recommendation.  The description was enough to buy it and I couldn't put it down.  It creeped me out!
Very good book. I found myself not being able to put it down.  This is a highly entriguing book and I highly recommend!
Very interesting book.  Thought it a little slow in the beginning, but once getting into it didn't want to put it down.
Loved the aspects of different characters....starting with the view a girl has each day on her daily commute on a train
Intrigue at its best!!!  Excellent writing!  Certainly deserves the acclaim it is receiving!  I did not want it to end.
The storyline was clever. I didn't feel invested emotionally in at character, which left an empty feeling. A good read.
I don't generally like murder mysteries but this was an exceptionally good one. I liked the format and narrative voice.
Loved it!  It usually takes me months to finish a book due to my busy schedule, but read this one in 2 days.  Gripping!
Great book,  a little confusing with the characters in the beginning. But once you had it figured out it read very good
Thoroughly enjoyed this read.  Felt the concept of the story was something different.  Think it will make a good movie.
Book kept your attention.  Felt bad for Rachel at times and then didn't.  Didn't see plot twists, so overall good read.
This book was such an amazing read and I couldn't put it down if I tried. Can't wait to read more books by this author.
Could have ended several chapters earlier. Seemed to drag on. Very dark story. Not as good, in my opinion, as Gone Girl
Kind of reminds me of Gone Girl. So if you liked that, you will love this! Well written, suspenseful, great characters.
Was easy to read and hard to put down. Loved the way the three stories came together would highly recommend this book👏
Similar to how I felt reading Gone Girl, like ghoulishly rubbernecking at an accident scene I couldn't stop reading it.
I LOVED the book couldn't decide who was guilty until the very end I found the book well written and hard to put down .
Could not put it down! Loved the character perspectives as well. If you're on holiday and need a good book, this is it!
Excellent story and very real. I could feel the pain these women endured. Raw emotion and characters really drew me in
Wonderfully suspenseful!  I had a hard time putting the book down once I got started.  Getting the next one right now!
Excellent book!  Delves into the lives of several characters.  Keeps you in such suspense that it is hard to put down!
What a page turner that kept me guessing right up to the very end!!  I highly recommend this as a great mystery novel.
Suspenseful with lots of twists. I could hardly put it down. It had a satisfying ending. I highly recommend this book!
Fairly good read. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because at times I was a bit confused as to who was speaking.
Engaging with enough twists to make you wonder. Slow start but amount of moving pieces pulls you in. Good summer read.
I could not put this one down. And when I absolutely had to stop reading the book, I could not wait to get back to it!
A good read.  I figured out who did it about half way but the writer does a pretty good job of keeping the reader guessing.
interesting characters that leave you guessing up until the end of the book. I could see this being made into a movie.
Excellent reading, suspense filled all the way to the end. Read this in one sitting,couldn't put it down! A must read!
The book was an easy read, yet, the whole time reading it I felt as if I was reading a script for a made-for-TV movie.
I loved this book.  It has a great ending.  I could not put the book down.  It is rare that I can give a book 5 stars.
fantastic book ... literally couldnt put it down !! keeps you guessing the whole way through … would highly recommend.
Loved the speed of the book. Read it in two days. Was so anxious about the characters I had to find out what happened!
Twists and turns ..... a unique story and a great read.  The story takes you in many directions.  I enjoyed this book.
This book would be a good book if it didn't drone on and on about the same three topics the entire length of the book.
So many twists and turns!! You just can't figure out "who done it"!!!!  I would recommend this book to anyone!
Very different, kept my attention throughout. The ending was a little far fetched, but I loved the books prespectives.
Best book I've read in years. Didn't want to put it down. Its got so much suspense in it. The characters are fabulous.
It was an OK novel.  But I have read many novels that deserved to be No 1 on the best sellers list for suh along time.
I just felt that the book was boring, unbelievable and I was always just waiting for it to get better...but it didn't.
Random thoughts by three women, none of whom are heroines. Not sure what purpose is served in the telling of the tale.
I could not put this down. Excellently written, the characters are wicked, sick and ill.  I highly Recommend this book
It was difficult to understand an alcoholic person most every single character was a mess and the end was flat for me.
It's great from chapter one!  I could barely put it down.  It was similar type writing to Gone Girl but not as "dark".
i don't understand why this book is a best seller. Not a like able character in the lot. Mystery is ok. But who cares?
Hard to follow  not a page turner<br/>Would not read again. Story had mini m all  cohesiveness<br/>On to t h e n ext
It was good but A bit boring until about 1/3 of the wAy through<br/>The last part was a bit melodramatic for my taste
I read this book in three days.  I couldn't put it down because I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Read this.
Great way of pulling a story together!  Each woman had their own story to tell and their own interpretation of events.
Kind of a strange book.  Took me awhile to get into but I find the story kind of sticking with me.  A satisfying read.
Very contrived and rather difficult to follow. My aerobics class (12 members ) mostly didn't care for the book either.
Considering the characters' POV and personal issues, I consider this a tragic story rather than a suspenseful mystery.
Great story from beginning to end. Loved the way the author had a way of making every character real and identifiable.
At first I found this confusing until I realised how many characters there were. I couldn't put it down. Well written.
It was a good book ... not as great as I thought it was going to be, but I can imagine it would make for a good movie!
Great plot twists! Keeps you guessing right until the very end.  I would definitely highly recommend this book to all.
Didn't much care for the characters. They were one-dimensional until the plot twist at the end. It didn't work for me.
Engrossing mystery with complex charactors.  I throughly enjoyed this novel and will read more books by Paula Hawkins.
Great book! Couldn't put it down!! Highly recommend it to anyone. Would make a great summer read... happy reading! Lol
Too many flashbacks.  Good story, but could be told better. Spoiler alert ... You could have guessed the final result.
Great diary style read! The suspense made it hard to put the book down! Loved this author, would recommend to a friend
Great fun read.  Well written and u dont expect the ending.  Well done! Would highly recommend buying this book today!
I could not put this book down! So many unexpected twists. I love the way it is written. I highly recommend this book!
This book and it's characters kept me intrigued for the whole ride! Loved the twists and turns all the way to the end.
Story jumped around a lot and that was somewhat distracting. Likely better if you are reading the book in one sitting.
This is an unexpectedly good book.  Not great but good, it kept my interest. It's a mystery and it keeps you guessing.
Thought it was somewhat tedious reading and quite predictable however I finished it with no problem. A good beach book
This is a great read.....but a slightly disappointing outcome. It will remind readers of "Gone Girl" at times.
This book was definitely a page-turner; however, it was clearly lacking characters with any redeeming characteristics.
Enjoyed this book because I couldn't figure out where it was going. Became a page turner about 2/3 of the way through.
a twist that I definitely did not see coming. the ending happened somewhat quickly but a good, quick read nonetheless.
A very good read, twists that keeps you guessing, slow start but then i could not put it down, would make a good movie
Well paced page turner. Started off relatively slow and gathered momentum as the story progressed. A real page turner!
One of the best books I've read in the past couple of years.  Couldn't  put it down.<br/>Terrific story. Good ending.
A great read. It's hard to put the book down once you have started! If you enjoyed Gone Girl you will enjoy this book.
There is a reason that when you glance across the bus or the subway that this is the book everyone has in their hands.
It took me a few chapters to get in to it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. Suspenseful all the way yo the end.
This was a well written story with interesting characters. The development of the plot and characters was suspenseful!
A bit drawn out more than need be but a tightly woven tale that twists with true Hitchcockian flare as it moves along.
The main character did not seem to care about anyone - she appears cold - perhaps that is because she is an alcoholic.
Selected this as my choice for our book club, not disappointed, everyone is loving this book. Fast read, well written.
I was disappointed in the book. It did have a good unexpected ending but I was tired of the main character by page 75.
I have and will continue to recommend this book to all my friends. the audio book is also available at local libraries
Girl on a Train has an interesting, twisting plot. You really do want to know how it ends.<br/>Good read this summer.
Twists & turns with unexpected jolts, not unlike the train itself. Try as you might, you won't be able to put it down.
I can usually guess what's going to happen in a book and I was totally clueless until the end of this book. Great job!
Wow. A real page turner. I could not put it down . I highly recommend this book.  I figured it out at 77percent point.
This book was a real page turner!  You will love the characters despite their many flaws.  Good twist at the end, too.
A story line that stays ahead of the reader right to the end. A train ride through a sinister fog. Skillfully written.
It took awhile for me to be able to switch characters in first person but as i read it got easier.  Such a great book!
So many twists and turns in this book, the characters so real it will definitely keep you reading long into the night.
Really Not bad. I liked having to think and story from different points of view.  Quick fast read-similar to gone girl
The multiple points of view and twists of the plot kept me on edge; I had to keep reading to see it all come together.
This reminded me of Gone Girl which I also loved. Tons of twists and suspense. I would definitely recommend this book!
This compelling story will keep you guessing until the end!  I could not put this book down once I started reading it!
Wonderful pacing of the story.  Very believable characters who you just wanted to shake and say what ARE you thinking?
A mesmerizing story, couldn't put it down. loved the characters. A great mystery. Will recommend it to all my friends.
Thought this book was pretty good. The end had a twist I hadn't seen coming.  It will be interesting to see the movie.
A great read. I could not put it down till I finished it..I was surprized at the ending..I really recomend this book..
Could not put this book down, great weekend reading with lots of crazy characters and a wild ending. Enjoy this novel.
Bit drawn out yet overall good story line. Wish there would have been a better ending, kind of disappointed in the end
Hard to adjust to the chapters that changed for each character. Stuck it out and liked it by the time<br/>I finished.
It was an enjoyable read, however I do not see how it stay number one for so long. It seems to wander in the beginning
A real page turner. I figured out who the guilty party was only about 50 pages from the end. Hitchcock style suspense.
This book keeps you glued from the first chapter. It is an excellent read. Couldn't wait to finish it. Great mystery!!
I bought this book on a whim and although it took a little while to get into it I liked the way the story was written.
Really enjoyed this book.  Read it over a weekend (even though I've two small children), kept me wanting to read more.
This book definitely keeps you on your toes. Couldn't put it down! A must read for anyone into these kinds of stories.
More than anything else, the author's voice is original and rings realistically -- especially about the female psyche.
I like style this is written in. Definitely keeps you guessing throughout the entire book! Good ending and quick read!
A little difficult to get into with all the real & imaginary characters, bit once I sorted them out, it was very good.
"The Girl on a Train" was an Easy read, suspenseful with many twists and turns and a great ending! I highly recommend.
This book was amazing. I finished it in less than a week!! I recommend this to anyone who likes a good suspense story.
Once started you can't put it down. The characters come to life. You have to solve the mystery. The end is satisfying.
Enjoyed the book. Good story intertwined with different characters.  It was a quick read and a great a twist of plots.
Fast, who-done-it mystery.<br/>I liked it quite a bit, but it's certainly not a feel-good story.  It's a real downer.
It keeps you wanting more with every flip of the page. Very suspenseful, and the ending is not at all what i expected.
I couldn't put it down! The story has you guessing how it will end more than once. Easy to read and very entertaining.
Excellent read. One of those books that's hard to put down - and many interesting twists. I highly recommend this one!
This suspenseful novel has realistic characters, some good plot twists and is well written.  An enjoyable page turner.
WE PICKED THIS BOOK FOR BOOK CLUB AND I'M GLAD WE DID. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN I READ IT IN 3  DAYS. SUSPENSE WAS HIGH.
I love suspense and this books is definitely right up my alley.  I don't read very often but I couldn't put this down.
Very much like Gone Girl...mystery told thru 3 women....makes you want to keep turning the pages...this is a fun read.
But not the best either. I almost quit reading it after the first few chapters. All the characters were so unlikeable.
Slow at first but picked up during the second half. Characters not likable.  Figured out mystery 3/4 through the book.
It is a very good, hard to put down book. Reminds me of Gone Girl. Highly recommend  this book if you liked Gone Girl.
I was very disappointed after all the hype. Would not have been a good short story but would have been more tolerable.
I felt the story dragged on a bit but overall a good read.  Shocking twist at the end that I didn't really see coming.
This finely tuned story keeps throwing surprises at you.  I found it to be one of those books where I don't really lik
Kept my interest but gets a little lifetime movie-esque on you near the end. But a good beach/easy read. I enjoyed it.
A little hard keeping the characters straight but after a while it started to make sense. Kept my interest throughout.
I enjoyed this book even though it was confusing at times. There were a lot of twists & turns and a surprising ending.
Very enjoyable read. Great for rainy night's in bed. If you liked Gone Girl then I recommend this book.<br/>Buy it!!!
Good book, a little slow in the beginning and far fetched in parts, but it held  my interest and finished it in 2 days
Interesting book.  It has many surprises and the story is carefully woven.  I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.
Loved the book. Liked the way the author wrote it from three women's perspective. Somewhat disappointed in the ending.
Kind of disturbing and creepy in the beginning but then it became a little predictable.  A good, fast, thrilling read.
OK writing, OK plot.  Quick read.  I expected more from a book that has been atop the New York Times list for so long.
I liked the book in the beginning but after 100 pages it became a little redundant.  I preferred Gone Girl much more !
I was a little weary of "Rachel" and the"f" word.  Why this is necessary for a good book is beyond me.
Get 47% through and then it will be worthwhile! Finally, a story with a believable ending! (Four more words required).
A true page turner that reveals the sinister mind of one who believes his own lies and manipulates those who love him.
This book twists threads so delicately together, leads one so gently along...it lingers like an ear worm - who did it?
Fast paced thriller. I read it in two nights ... Could not stop reading!!  Great female characters . Lots of suspense.
Good story. It drags a bit. The main character is really defeated but overall it works out. Good if you like mysteries
Loved the mystery and suspense. Once I understood the format I was hooked. It was a tablet tapper until the last page.
Challenging to understand the introduction to the plot but once the story got moving I couldn't put it down! Loved it!
An excellent book for a book club. The 5 main characters would lend themselves to personal  opinions from the readers.
I couldn't put it down! This book is written and suspenseful. If you like Gillian Flynn novels, you'll love this book.
Great mystery.  This book keeps you guessing until the end. So far one of my favorites of 2015.  A good and fast read.
Never really grabbed me.  Got very tired of the alcoholic Rachel.  Glad when I was through with it so I could move on.
I was confused in the beginning trying to figure out the characters as the chapters kept changing quickly.  Good read.
The author makes you feel you were on the train with her!! You won't be E to put it down and you won't want it to end.
Couldn't put it down. Highly suspenseful and very intriguing. Well written! If you like Gone Girl, you will like this!
Different read and I dare you to put it down once started.  Paula Hawkins is going on my 'authors you must read' list.
Not the most likeable characters but that was ok the story of the voyeurism and lies was well worth it. Strong finish.
It started out interesting but lost some momentum.  It was worth the read but wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
Interesting characters and intriguing mystery plot.  Kept me guessing, involved, and anxious to get back to this book.
Very good. Kept me guessing. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys mysteries and suspense. Good work  by this author.
This book was great ! I usually don't buy books because I have kindle unlimited but i bought this and it was worth it!
Full of suspense, this book was hard to put down! You never knew what was going to happen from one moment to the next!
Gripping read - finished in 3  days! Kept me in suspense until the last chapter. Would definitely recommend to friends
all i can say is wow  , crazy on the edge and sure not what i would have expected at the end . still thinking about it
This was my first book to read by this author and I thought it was very good.  A twist at the end I had not expected!
Even weeks after reading this book I still continue to think about it.  That quality alone, to me, seems a good book!
Just read it - a daily train ride turns in to an amazing journey that will keep you awake until the crazy conclusion!
You don't realize it's a whodunnit until your craving the next dose of twisting plot lines . Then you're swept away !
Great read. Suspense all the way through. A definite un put down able book. One of the best fiction books I have read
I could not put this book down! This was a  fantastic mystery with plenty of surprises. I highly recommend this book!
Hard to keep track of who is who or where the story is leading<br/>Best part nearing the end<br/>Wouldn't recommend
This book kept me entranced the entire time. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good psychological thriller.
this book Reminds me of Gone Girl. Quick read, interesting from the beginning! An easy read for a long weekend vacay.
Great book, similar plot to Gone Girl. Easy to read, twisted characters, I like the back and forth between characters
The author was great at keeping me pointed in the wrong direction. The killer was right there lurking in plane sight.
This one was fun to read.  In The Girl on the Train, there were unexpected twists in the plot that kept my attention.
I couldn't put this book down. Very clever writing. You really feel for the main character. You won't be disappointed
The plot really developed my anxiety level; kept my attention.  However, I had difficulty keeping the names straight.
I found this book a little slow moving and hard to keep in chronological order. Are there really men like Tom around?
I could not put this down. A fast paced read perfect for a long weekend! Watch out imagination; it might lead you ...
This novel was great. It really made me feel like I was there and the suspense was superb! I finished this in 3 days.
The novel takes a unique and interesting approach to the unreliable narrator archetype, but that is about all it has.
Dragged in the middle. Loved the characters. The end had the suspense and the action. Page turner. I would recommend.
Involving and well written. Not in a class with Gone Girl, as some reviews would have you believe, but then, what is?
The book is over talked about, and I disliked all the characters. The book is simple, predictable, and sexist.<br/>B
Some initial difficulty getting into story. However, glad I stuck with the book. The reward was a well crafted story.
Could not put this book down...I felt like I knew the characters...ending will have you shaking your head. Great read
Excellent book. When you think you have it figured out, more is revealed to make you keep guessing. Very suspenseful!
A very captivating thriller. Characters are thoroughly portrayed and the reader almost "shares" the outcome .
This was a really great book!  fast paced and very hard to put down.  If you like Gone Girl, you will love this book.
The best book I've read in a while. Really quite suspenseful. Although I saw the end coming, it was a fantastic read.
I had no idea what this book was about when I bought it, And found myself riding the train, eager for each new twist.
I enjoyed the book quite a lot. Interesting, if somewhat unlikeable characters. But that's what makes it a good read.
Hard to put down. Thriller. Well written. Twist and turns in the plot keep you wanting more. Comparable to Gone Girl.
If you liked "Gone Girl" - you will probably like this.  It's twisted and sad but I couldn't stop reading it.
Sooo depressing and soooo long getting to the point. Was Anna really as oblivious as written?  I'm missing something.
What's all the fuss over this book? I read it in a couple of evenings and enjoyed it but "it ain't all that."
A page turner for sure. Intense and gripping, but EVERYone in the book is crazy, so you don't really care who-dun-it.
A great read - with several twists; just when you think you know "who done it", the story changes once again!
Very good piece of fiction.  A surprise ending will keep you guessing until the very end... or almost the end anyway.
Couldn't put this book down.  Read it in one day.  Truly spell-binding.  What a GREAT summer read!  Highly recommend.
This is a great thriller. I read it in one evening. It's just getting light now. I'm looking for more by this author.
This was a wonderful story. It was hard to put down as it kept you on the edge of your seat! Certainly recommended!!!
I appreciated the author's style. I read the entire novel in one day, it kept my interest. Very good book, different!
Waste of time reading it.  How can it remain on the best seller list?  Guess everyone is like me, curious to see why.
I had no. Idea what to expect but I devoured the book in two days. Very compelling, a really surprisingly good dread.
Not any likeable characters... struggled trying to make it to the end of the book. Will not be recommending this one.
Sex, lies, betrayal, alcoholism, murder, what more could you want in your beach book?  More twists than a cork screw.
Great book once you really get into it you don't want to stop! Beginning is a little slow but loved to see it unfold'
Kept me interested and hooked until the end. A bit slow in the middle but push through and you will be happy you did.
Kept going from start to finish, no slow spots, disturbing reveals even through the last few pages.  My kind of book!
This book reads similar to Gone Girl. I enjoyed each chapter telling the story of each character. I highly recommend.
What a read. Horrible life for all involved...keep me going until the last word.  Hope that Anna and Rachel healed...
Kept my attention, good suspense. Worth the money.  I didn't figure out the ending, which is also good.  A good read.
Good book for a lite quick read.<br/>Not as much depth as hoped, but kept my attention and read in less than a week.
If you liked Gone Girl, you're going to love The Girl on the Train.  Suspenseful and well written, it's a great read!
I found the story interesting and suspenseful.  I thought that the character development was very good!  A fast read!
Not my usual fare, but had to keep reading. It certainly was an escape.  Well done! Difficult to turn into a movie...
Great story and I would recommend it to anyone, kept me intrigued and wanting for more info throughout the whole book
It had me wanting to read more and more of it. I didn't know the book would end like that though, amazing plot twist.
Very good read.  I liked the characters.  Took a long time to get the person that was the killer.  Really good twist.
It would have made an interesting short story . It was very repetitious. As a novel, it lost momentum and got boring.
Fun, creepy, suspense-filled read. This book kept me on the edge of my seat; even after I realized what was going on.
Enthralling,mesmerizing ,moves quickly, even though I figured out the killer early on, I till had to read to the end.
Couldn't put it down. Even though I was pretty sure what happened it kept me guessing till the end. Highly recommend.
I was on the edge of my seat the whole book. Loved it! Definitely would recommend this thriller. I hope it's a movie.
The ending was riveting, but then, was it because I was finally finished.  This book lasted longer than I would like!
A little slow but a twisty turny plot and some good character development. A page-turner! Liked the twist at the end.
I love reading from the different point of views of all the characters. It was disturbing, but I had to keep reading.
I loved it.  Fast paced.  I read it in a day.  Didn't want to put it down until the mystery was solved!  A good read.
Loved this book! Lots of plot twists. A fun read and it didn't hurt that I was traveling on a train while reading it!
I loved gone girl... this was better!!!!  Keeps you on the edge until the end.  Great beach read!!!! Great characters
Big Fan of this Novel.  Story slowly unspools to reveal a murder mystery wrapped in a sad story of humanity and loss.
I liked the story, but it starts slow. However, towards mid story it really picks up the pace and it kept me on edge.
Enjoyed the plot twists and story line.  Well written.  Looking forward to reading more by this author in the future.
Slow getting stated because of the change of person telling the story but once you get used to that the book it good!
Enjoyed this...<br/>Very intensifying and fun to read. Kept me glued to the book. I would recommend this book. Great
Just read the whole book in 24 hours. Was hooked!  Great real style of writing and thrilling. Highly recommended book
This book kept my attention from start to finish.  A fast and enjoyable read that I would highly recommend to anyone.
This was a great who dunit book  One never knew who the bad guy (or girl) was.  It held my attention through the end.
I can't say a word without spoiling it for others. I both listened to and read it, enjoying every devilish plot turn.
Very suspenceful, non-stop action.  I recommend it for mystery lovers. It would make a good movie.  Hard to put down.
Awesome!  This book Had me guessing until the end!  Full of suspense .. On the best mysteries I have read in a while!
It was exciting and I kept wanting to get back to it. I went an extra stop on th  train just so I could keep reading.
Your belief in the Villian changes with each chapter you read. Oh of course, what's it her? Oh of course, was it him?
A truly interesting read. The story starts slow and chugs into full speed similar to its title. Difficult to put down
I thought the story could have been told in a hundred less pages. How-ever I couldn't put it down till I was finished
I read this book over a two day period and it kept me guessing until the very end. You won't regret reading this one.
The style was confusing but did keep the curiosity going.  I expected to be delighted at the end but I felt let down.
A page-turner of the first order - could hardly put it down.  I love twists and turns, and there are plenty of those!
Entertaining, but didn't blow me away. Was hoping for more, but if you are looking for a quick read, worth picking up
Really well written. Keeps you guessing until the end.  Love the way it bounces between the voices of the characters.
Agree that the uniqueness of the voices of these three women was both compelling and entrancing. A well done mystery.
This is an exciting story from start to finish!  Enough<br/>Twists to keep you on your toes!  A perfect beach read!!
It was gripping, I read it one day. The plot twists were terrific. Great thriller mystery.i would recommend this book
Loved the book.  Pay attention to names and dates as it can get confusing.  Great book club book, lots to talk about.
I loved this book, and have passed it on to my friends, who also loved it.  Five stars on this one!!<br/>Grandmamax.
This book was Very interesting and captivating. I like mysteries. I try to guess. There was no seeing this coming....
I couldn't put it down. Loved the intense descriptions of the characters.  Thought about it when I wasn't reading it!
This was a page turner!  I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story and would highly recommend this for a book club.
I love reading about incredibly f'd up people. It makes me feel so good about myself! Liked it more than 'Gone Girl'.
Loved every word! My new favorite book. On the edge of my seat. Haven't read a book I loved this much in a long time.
I loved the book but some of the time I had to go back and look at the dates. Loved the chapters with each character.
A mind twisting book, hard to put down. Just when you think you have it all figured out It takes on a different turn.
A well written yarn that kept my attention<br/>Almost as intriguing as Gone Girl so I do recommend to mystery buffs
I'm with the minority here. I found the story boring and not enticing at all.  I struggled to get through the pages.
Amazing book. Everyone should read it, never a dull moment...couldn't put the book down all weekend to save my life.
I read it for book club. We all loved it! We definitely didn't expect the twist at the end. Definitely a great read!
Started out slow and difficult to read. I hung in there and it got better. The surprising twist made it a good book.
This was an engaging read. Interesting tale of addiction and relationships with some surprises. I really enjoyed it.
Kinda hard to follow at first.<br/>The characters-who was who,<br/>Etc. Once you get by that,<br/>It's very good!
I couldn't wait to pick my kindle up each night to continue with the story . Will look for other books by the author
This book started alittle slow for me, but I kept reading because of the buzz. Will definitely anticipate next book.
Could not put this book down!!! Compelling from page one all the way through. I highly recommend it! A new favorite.
This was an ok book if just want something to read. It was a very slow read. Not the worst but also not my top pick.
I couldn't get into this book. Never finished it and that rarely happens. too many change ups to follow per chapter.
Writing is great and draws you in.  Plot is believable, but final twist is obvious.  I'd recommend as a casual read.
It was an easy read, hard to get into at first but the ending is unexpected. I would definitely recommend this book.
Many story twists told from the view of two main characters.  The story keeps your interest through the entire book.
Found it a bit confusing.lost me in a few chapters-had to go back to make some sence ended up not finishing the book
I was not thrilled with this book. There was so much side information that I couldn't wait just to get to the point.
Started off slow but by the 3rd chapter it picked up and you couldn't put it down.  Look forward to seeing the movie
Started out slow but then it got interesting and I couldn't put it down. Many surprise twists. I recommend this book
What a great, insane, thrilling book. You start to love and pity all the characters  I'm so glad I picked this book!
When I wasn't reading it, I was contemplating who did it.  Well written mystery.  Best I've read in quite some time.
Definitely a five star book because it was hard to put down.  Keeps you guessing for a long time.  Highly recommend!
Author is too wordy.  I never felt empathy for the narrator.  I quit reading about a third of the way into the book.
Really good mystery! Many climaxes but the last one the best!! Highly recommend this book to ppl who like mysteries!
Could not put the book down....wish there was a sequel of some sort....hopefully a movie might be made please please
I was at times derailed by the dates at the beginning if the chapters  not sure if they were sequential. Good story!
It is hard to read as the characters are all very flawed people.  I had a hard time with more than half of the book.
Very well written and griping lasting till the end. Making one think of the unthinkable. Awesome work by the author.
Slow start but then quickly explodes. I was unable to put it down. So many emotions, love hate, suspense, suspicion.
This story had me interested from the start<br/>Very cleverly written<br/>The ending a surprise i didnt see coming
I started this book on a Monday and finished it by Wednesday. I couldn't put it down.  Loved it right up to the end.
I was a little disappointed. For being a best selling for so long, I expected more. The ending was very predictable.
Very interesting and moved along without being boring. However I found it to be some what dark, a little disturbing.
Sucks a good book! So hard to put it down, always wanting to keep reading to find out more. Definitely recommend it!
It kept me guessing till the end. I particularly liked the strong theme of healing from the damage life can inflict.
Somewhat predictable but still a page turner. Easy read but good writing. Checks off all the important boxes for me.
Loved it. Could not put it down! It's real and raw and makes you want to keep reading to find out what happens next!
Enjoyed the book very much. Great twists, interesting plot. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story.
Great book, I see why it has been on the best seller list for over two years. I am recommending this book to others.
This book was really great. You got an in depth understanding of each of the characters. The twist was great as well
Keeps you guessing. A little bit slow in some parts though.  Would recommend to a friend. Great Book overall though.
Could not put this book down once I got into it. Very well written. Exciting and suspenseful story anyone can enjoy.
Great book, loved every twist, every detail to it and very much enjoyed the ending. You go Rachel, took you a while!
Unstable, unlovely, unreliable narrator was captivating.  Good story for those who prefer something beyond the norm.
The kind of book I miss when I finish reading it. A page turner with good character development and good story line.
Saw reviews for this book everywhere, had to read it.  Did not disappoint !  Loved it.  Good story, very suspenseful
The every day ride on the train is the mystery!  Imaginary or reality?  A life changing event seen or unseen?  Hmmm!
It is difficult to follow the first part of the book.  The last past of the book was well done and kept my interest.
I could not put this book down! Every chapter had me convinced the villain was someone else. Definitely a must-read.
This was a good page turner and pretty well crafted, if somewhat predictable.  I bet this would make a 'killer' movie.
this was unbelievably boring, and horrible characters so I didn't care who did it in the end. Don't waste your time!
Interesting plot- but the main character (Rachel) is such an annoying loser, that it makes it hard to relate to her.
If you're looking for a quick and suspenseful summer read, this one is for you. Keeps you guessing and on your toes.
Lots is twists to this book! Anyone liking suspense novels should read this. Had a hard time putting this book down.
An incredibly skillful use of an unreliable narrator. Although this book contains a mystery, I think its greatest strength is in the character studies: how we lie to others and to ourselves, and the variety of methods that we use to do so. Not an upbeat book, for sure, and yet not exactly depressing. Somehow, there's a certain beauty and grace in the sheer humanness of the flawed and complex characters. I found this to be extremely well written and, as an utterly fascinating read, it has made the shortlist of my favorite books.
I found the book to be rather slow to read. Not my favourite mystery book so I will go against most reviews on here.
Great book! Loved the different characters and how their stories interrelated with each other. Surprised at the end.
Quick read. Very fast paced. This is a great mystery that grabs you right from the beginning. I highly recommend it.
Enjoyed the plot and the twists and turns.  Would have liked RAchel a little less tortured. All in all a great book.
Overall good plot. A bit predictable once you get into the second half of the book in my opinion, but worth the read
This was a book I couldn't get out of my head and wanted to read every spare minute.  Almost as good as "Gone Girl".
Keeps you on your toes the whole time. An easy read for this summer, interested to see how they interpret the movie.
Best book I've read in over a year.  Sadly, I think all of my other planned summer reads this year won't measure up.
I would definitely recommend to anyone. I could not stop binge reading. It's a mystery till the end. Excellent book.
What a stunner! I couldn't stop reading. Very well written, don't skip paragraphs or you will miss the clues. Enjoy!
Couldn't put the book down. A character study reinforcing that people are not always how they appear on the outside.
Great story and great writing. Not a lot happens until the last chapters of the book. I'd recommend for a light read
Gripping but easily figured out 3/4 of the way through. Still a good read and worthwhile  - just easy to figure out.
It keeps you engaged. The author does a good job on how emotional abuse and control can take over a person's senses.
Very complex murder mystery/thriller.  I read it in one sitting.  Great development of the alcoholic main character.
Good book, great for vacation reading, interesting plot, ending is interesting as well. Good book for summer reading
Found it hard to put this book down, perfect reading for the holidays.Suspense was built nicely throughout the book.
I was not impressed.  I was encouraged to finish it as I did.  The ending did get better.  I would not recommend it.
I loved this book. There are a few twists and turns. Good old fashioned summer reading! I highly recommend this one.
It held my interst. I did figure it out about 3/4 of the way through. A little slow in the beginning but I liked it.
It's been a while since I read the most popular book in the bestseller list, but I'm glad I did. Highly recommended.
The story was okay. My problem with this book is that the voices of the two main women characters were not distinct.
A great read that was very engrossing and difficult to put down. If you liked Gone Girl your going to love this book
I enjoyed the book. I read it on my e-reader and did find I had to go back to see who was talking from time to time.
This book was incredibly engaging, I couldn't put it down. Very well written! I would recommend this book to anyone.
Good read for sure, but not as edge of the seat excitement as I expected. Little slow in places. Overall good story.
It was very good but I thought it drug out some scenes alittle to much. Definitely didn't see the ending coming tho.
Loved the the book after I got passed the fact she was an alcohalic. It was really a good suspence novel to the end.
The book started out strangely but I quickly got interested.  The ending threw me for a loop.  I would recommend it.
Storyline intriguing. Approach to characters and their stories perfect. Description of characters became monotonous.
This book was very enjoyable and had some great twists and turns.  The characters were very interesting and complex.
Pretty good.<br/>will look out for her books in the future.<br/>I guessed the guilty party about half way through!
I found it puzzling and difficult to sympathize with the protagonist but was hooked and was surprised by the ending.
A good suspense novel that keeps your attention up to the very end. Recommended for any suspense and mystery readers
I haven't read a book as good as this one for a while. Well written, full of suspense, and quite a twist at the end!
I kept changing my mind about who did it until almost the end. The book hooks you right away and keeps you obsessed.
Thrilling and interesting! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it. Lots of plot twists and many surprises!
I would have perhaps loved this book when I was14.  But I found the characters and storyline a bit slow and tedious.
It started slow, but after a while it did pick up and I couldn't put the book down.  It does have a surprise ending.
Kind of s dark book. Enough twists and turns to keep me interested. Would recommend to others. Similar to Gone Girl.
Good book that held my interest all the way through. The best of the suspense type that I have read for a long time.
Was not sure to continue reading the ordeals of an alcoholic, but eventually I became curious and finished the book.
This book was AMAZING!! It had me holding my breath the whole way through. I absolutely loved this book! Great book.
Its an interesting storyline and the change in character perspectives is neat, but the main plot gets a little lost.
If you liked Gone Girl you'll like THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN. Quick read because you want to find out what happens next!
There were a few surprises but overall the book was very predictable and how many bad people can live on one street?
Started out great but ended even better!!!<br/>Worth every minute of missed sleep trying to finish it in one night!
I was not that impressed with the writing style and I thought it dragged to the bitter end which I spotted early on.
Very interesting,hard to put down. Reminded me of Gone Girl. Would recommend to anyone who likes this type of story.
Much more suspenseful than I anticipated and kept me on my toes the entire book! Hope to read more from same author!
Right up to the end of the book, I was unable to predict with certainty the outcome of the plot. A real page-turner.
Although I wouldn't consider it great literature, it was fairly well written and kept your attention.  I enjoyed it.
Truly a well written book that kept me on the edge of my chair........reminded me of Gone Girl both are great reads!
The main character is so sad and so alcoholic it's difficult to like her.  But she's persistent, I'll give her that.
I didn't want this book to end.  I felt like I was actually there experiencing the whole story.  Strongly recommend.
I literally could not put it down! So many twists and turns. I never knew what was coming next! Highly recommend it.
I really enjoyed reading this book. I liked how the stories were told from various points of view.  Would recommend.
Main character makes you want to scream at times but all in all a good book if you are looking for a light thriller.
This book is certainly worth the buzz...couldn't put it down!!  A really fast read that will completely suck you in.
Twisted events. The Bain character was so pathetically sad. Story of love list and it was so depressing. Poor Ravhel
This book was so relatable and kept you on your toes the whole time! Loved the suspense! Would definitely recommend!
It had you guessing the whole book.  Loved the characters and the plot.  I would recommend it to read it.  Easy read
It took a while to become engaged and familiar with the characters. But the last chapters made the read worthwhile !
Would recommend this book.  Definitely worth taking the time to read. Lots of twist and turns to keep you interested
Excellent writing and "edge of your seat" excitement!  Also bought the audio book and it was very well done.
I would rate the book a 6 on a scale 1 to 10. The writing was fairly good but it took too long to get to the climax.
This novel will keep you from putting the book down. Very well written thriller, with an interesting story line too.
Very strange but the authors' writing keeps you reading. A love and hate story.  It reminds me Gone Girl to a degree
Yes it was a lot like gone girl with the switching of characters<br/>The characters were very real<br/>A good read
Easy read that quickly captivated me as the "who done it" took on a whole new meaning, definitely recommend!
A little difficult for me to connect with the characters but the plot was so lovely, twisty turny that I enjoyed it.
Great book! Couldn't put it down! Great characters and a blending of their stories. Would be a great book club book!
Disappointing.  I expected better given its place on the NYT list.  Easy to put down and pick up a day or two later.
Interesting, suspenseful story of a protagonist fighting to bring her life together but, in the end, not believable.
Slow at first, but gets your interest. Could not wait to see how everything sorts itself out!  Can recommend to all.
Interesting story line. Got rather boring in the middle but picked up again towards the end.  Good book.  Recommend.
Dark but interesting characters.  Nice to see the flaws in the characters and the twists and turns of the storyline.
This story kept me reading right to the end. Really does what a manipulative person is capable of. It leaves me sad.
Great read.  I did not put it down.  The characters were introduced well and maintained their story line throughout.
Easy read, kept me guessing. During the firswt few chapters I found the real names and the fictional ones confusing.
They will be turning this one into a movie, I am sure!!! Read it almost straight through in one sitting! Well done!!
I couldn't put it down....HAD to find out what would happen next! Finished in two sittings...one into the wee hours.
Loved it. Couldn't put it down. Definitely worth a read or two of three! Read this book-- you won't be disappointed!
The book was interesting but not great. The main character was annoying and the characters didn't ring true at times
Couldn't stop reading, twist and turns but will say I figured it out along the way but wanted to see if I was right.
Although I struggled with liking the characters it's  a testament to how well they were written. I enjoyed the read.
I thought it was depressing but did show the struggles the woman went thru and how she finally succeeded at the end.
Reminded me of Gone Girl - Not a fan.  May be well written but I never cared what happened to any of the characters.
Great book,a real page turner! The most difficult thing about this book was putting it down. Great job to Me Hawkins
This was very well written. It kept me guessing. Characters seemed real. Loved the whole train and where it took me.
A page turner although the ending is somewhat contrived.  Would definitely recommend...looking forward to the movie!
This is a page turner but I had trouble relating to the main character until the end.  Interesting twists and turns.
I loved that I couldn't put the book down and it has a great twist at the end that I didn't see coming! A must read!
This book was an interesting, quick read. I liked this book but can't say I loved it.  The story line was just okay.
I couldn't put this on down. Stimulating and entertaining you really felt for Rachel and what she was going through.
I enjoyed reading this book.  I could not put this book down.  The mystery of all of the characters kept me reading.
decent, well written, somewhat predictable.  would read another by her.  it was not as good as i had hoped.  decent.
The end of the story tied it up nicely, but it took a long time to get there - slow reading, although I finished it!
I've not read any of her books, saw it on a listing and thought I'd read something different. Wow, what a wild ride.
Could not put this book down.<br/>What an intriguing story. Glad I found this wonderful read on the Amazon website.
A quick, easy read with lots of twists. Warning: I don't really recommend it for anyone in recovery from alcoholism.
If you like an unexpected twist, this is it. The characters are well developed, but leave you wanting more and more.
Great if you enjoyed Gone Girl.  I couldn't set it down. Can't wait for another book to hold my attention this well.
I found it disappointing. The story jumps around so much. I think the book does not measure up to other best sellers
Enjoyed the manner in which it was written from the viewpoint of each character.  Definitely suspenseful to the end.
It took me a while to figure out the characters and the flashbacks/current stories. Not sure I would recommend this.
Loved the book... immediately engaging. Quick, easy read. Some may say too simply written. I couldn't put it down :)
Great, well written book to read. A lot of twists. Fast paced with characters to whom you feel emotionally attached.
Love this book! If you like Gillian Flynn, you will like this book! Suspense, heartbreak, a killer... It's worth it!
I was a little surprised to find the more pages I read I really had no idea as to where it was leading me.great read
I couldn't put it down. You don't know who's lying and who's  telling  the truth. Good story and good story telling.
Having finished reading this novel, I was very glad that I listened to the reviewer in Entertainment Weekly.  The Girl on the Train was compared to Gone Girl and was recommended to those readers who enjoy a twist.  The reviewer was spot on.  The pages couldn't turn fast enough, and just as a train gathers speed as it goes along, so did this story.  The tale is told from 3 different perspectives and leaves you trying to figure it out until the very end.  Even then, there are a few more surprises in store.<br/><br/>This was an excellent book and my only complaint is that I read it too greedily and didn't savor it longer.
Great read!! Finished it quickly and kept my attention the whole time! Lots of great twists and turns. A must read.
Good  plot, it  kept me reading as the possibilities kept shifting ground.  The Girl  was an interesting character.
Intense as an electric arc, a difficult but well drawn story. Honest and deeply pathetic. A heavy sigh upon ending.
Slow paced and repetitive. I liked the unusual plot though I found it hard to follow at times. Too much repetition.
Totally recommend this book. It will leave you on the edge of your seat almost until the very end.... so no peaking
Very good book.  Unlike Gone Girl (one of the worst books every written!!) you don't know the ending until the end!
The classic "who dun it" plot, but why was everyone sleeping with everyone, and all characters screwed up??
Fans of Gone Girl will not be dissapointed. That being said, it has a great ending that makes it stand on it's own.
Suspenseful and a great psychological thriller. I couldn't put it down. One of the best mysteries I have ever read.
Not my style. Rather dark and lacked substance. However, I did find myself wanting to see what would happened next.
Not an avid reader but finished book in 2 days! Very good suspense/ mystery book. Highly recommend this to anybody.
This book was amazing! Keeps you guessing until the very end! This is a must read for any good lover of mysterious!
I really can't understand why this book was on the best-seller list for so long. It was a good read, but not great.
This book grabbed me in the first chapter.  The twist and turns kept me guessing until the end.  Highly recommended
. I'll have to pick up another one of her books. Interesting way the story was presented... Sort of like Gone Girl.
Best book ever. Can see why it was number one. The author was in journalism and it shows. The writing is exquisitye
The author's use of different points of view coupled with insights into alcoholism make this an intriguing mystery.
I found the Girl on the Train exciting good mystery.  There were many twists and turns.  Was a very good fast read.
Overall depressing - most charachetrs negative.  I don't want to believe this is a reflection of the present times.
An awesome book. Arresting and inventive. New way to look at ones perspective of imagination.  Extremely suspensil.
Four star because it was a well written twisted plot , and I didn't suspect the killer until the last few chapters.
Pulls you in till the last page. Great fast read. I would recommend this book to everyone who likes a good mystery.
I loved the book it held my intrrest to the point where I couldn't put it down. I hope she is writing another book.
I thought this novel was well written and kept my attention through out. I enjoyed the twist and turns of the story
THE STORY WAS TO SCRAMBBLED UP. I FIGURED THE WOMAN HAD MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES BUT IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW THE STORY.
You just can't decide who to pity and who to hate.  Telling the story in 3 voices, Hawkins weaves quite a thriller.
Wasn't impressed.......i finished it because I have a hard time leaving a book even if it's predictable and boring!
This writer really captured the struggle alcoholics must endure and the stress they inflict upon those around them.
A fabulous read. My wife read it inside a week and sat gasping and commenting all the way while we were on holiday.
Clever and interesting. The main character did get annoying and boring at times but otherwise an entertaining read.
I recommend this book.  Great book that you can't put down.  Kept you wondering what was happening next.  Good read
I enjoyed it as my commute read. But overall, I've read this story before. Also the last 100 pages just dragged on.
The start was REALLY slow, and I just couldn't warm up to any of the characters.  Probably won't re read this book.
Perfect summer read! It's definitely a page turner. I would have given it 5 stars if I hadn't predicted the ending.
I started and finished this book today. Creative telling of a mystery and watching pieces fall into place. 4 stars.
You feel you know each character and enjoy different things about each. You are still not sure how the end will go.
It is a good read.  Keeps you guessing about who done it till about 80% through the book!!!!!  I liked it a lot!!!!
Good read, I finished the book in three days.  I would recommend reading this book.  A little gone girl feel to it.
Interesting way to tell the story but can be a little confusing until the main characters and dates are understood.
book is interesting to read.  reads fast.  it is one of those books that you can put down and pick up a week later.
really expected more...befuddled logic slow moving story that meandered to nowhere. needed a drink or two to finish
A quick read. Very "Gone Girl"-esque. More predictable with less developed characters. Read it in two days.
Very suspenseful yet somewhat predictable. Still a fun read. The time shift angle keeps you on your toes, for sure.
Got really tired and bored w/the pathetic main character - could of ended the story about 5 drunken stories earlier
The Girl on the Train:A Novel<br/>I really didn't care for this book,but for some reason I had to keep reading it.
Depressing, confusing, boring. Read half of book and I am putting it down will save it for a day I am more patient.
Good storyline. Interesting characters. Who done it kind of novel.Not a great book, but would definitely recommend.
two thirds through the book there is only one person left to be the villain -- heroine is not exactly one to admire
It was a well thought out twisted story. Good details, unpredictable. If you like gone girl, you'll like this book.
This book is interesting and just when you think you figured it out, you got it all wrong. Couldn't put it down!!!!
I can truly see why this was the best seller for many, many weeks.  I liked the different stories within the story.
Great read. Hard to set down the last 100 pages.  Loaded with twists and turns. Everyone has secrets in their past.
The narration is terribly confusing with action jumping from one time period to another.  Very difficult to follow.
The book is one of those you can't put down until the very last page. Great character development. Very suspenseful
Very slow.  I ended up skimming a lot to get to the end.  The end of the book was good if you can make it that far.
This is a great read! I couldn't put it down! I was trying to figure out the ending the entire time, unpredictable.
This was a page turner that keeps you guessing and trying to get one step ahead....but you never do until the end!!
I loved the suspense of this book. I also liked how she told the stories from the different characters perspective.
Loved this page turner!!! This book sucked me in. A lot like gone girl. Pay attention to the names on each chapter!
This reminded me of Gone Girl, really didn't figure it out until the latter part of the story. I would recommend it
The best book I've read in a long time. One twist and turn after another, had me guessing the whole "ride".
This book was the best that I have read in a long time. It.had so many twists and turns and a big surprise end ing.
Just did not like the book.  Just ran around in circles.  Finished it under duress forcing myself to get to the end
A superb mystery that you absolutely can't put down.  I read it in one day because I had to find out what happened.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book and it was hard to put down. I caught myself reading at work, instead of doing my job.
Well written,good character development and great build up to the end. This book takes Gone Girl to the next level.
The writing was poor with errors in tense. Some of the characters were well developed but others were not credible.
Excellent read.  Hard to put down.  Unexpected ending.  I would recommend it if you enjoy a good suspense/thriller.
Very well written. Not your typical story line. CHARACTERS WELL DEVELOPED. I look forward to her next book. GO Pala
good plot and I liked the ending, had a bit of a twist. I liked the way it was written with alternating characters.
Love how the characters are introduced. Easy quick read with a twisted plot. The audible version was great as well.
Really great and suspenseful story. Great characters and timing. Along the lines of gone girl will be a great movie
Unbelievably suspenseful and thrilling! I highly recommend it to anyone who would like to curl up with a good book!
This is an intriguing read and I understand why it has been at the top of many Fiction best seller lists.  Read it!
Hard to bounce from character to character.<br/>Last fifty pages were the best. It was a somewhat dark book to me.
This was a wild ride of a read. I  couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book. You won't regret reading it.
This book was terrific!  I was hoping the ending wouldn't let me down and it definitely did not!  It's a must read!
Easy read, a few twists and turns.  Read it for our bookclub, anticipate good reviews and discussion. I enjoyed it.
super intense book! I loved every page! It was easy to get through and I found myself caught up in it! A must read!
An absolute must read. The last chapter made my heart race like mad. I would absolutely recommend this book anyone.
I thought it was similar to Gone Girl and I did not enjoy that book either. I was not sympathetic to the characters
liked the book until towards the end when found out neither man was the father. then  guessed right away who  was..
I enjoyed reading this book.  It was suspenseful and the characters were interesting.  I would recommend this book.
I thought this was a great read.  It was very fast paced and I couldn't wait to get to the end!  Well worth buying.
Great read. Will keep you on your toes.<br/>Well written and executed to read many more stories from Mrs. Hawkins!
Great book that keeps you thinking with a lot of twists. Awesome characters to follow, couldn't put this book down.
This book was difficult to stop reading. It had just the right amount of twists and turns to keep the reader alert!
Get ready to read....glasses, drink, afghan, popcorn, whatever....cuz this is a can't-put-downer.....so plan ahead.
You only begin to see where this book is going about two thirds of the way through. And then you can't put it down!
I couldn't put this down. It is a unique perspective from multiple points of view. Highly recommended. A must read.
Thought it was a fascinating story. Well told. We all want to think this could never happen to us - but - it could.
Great read for vacation.  Had me guessing for a while!  If you liked Gone Girl, you'll enjoy this. Back to reality.
Took a while for the book to get interesting and I almost put it down at one point but it's not a totally bad read.
It was good, but not nearly as good as "Gone Girl".  I thought it focused too much on alcoholism.  Depressing!
As good as 'Gone Girl.' A real page turner which kept me guessing for a long time. Really well crafted. A fun read.
Real and raw emotions<br/>Make this story one I could not stop reading. I would love to ride on a train very soon.
Really enjoyed this. Liked the way the stories were a year apart and gradually linked up. A good suspense thriller.
It was a good read. I never guessed the ending.  Characters were interesting and easy to follow.  Kept my interest.
A good surprise,  at the end it teaches you that their could be endless scenarios.  Next please, I will be waiting.
This book is for anyone one who wants a well written thriller. Easy to follow charters and get lost in their lives.
A great read and compelling story!  Well worth the read.  Tell your friends to pick it up.  Thanks for a great book
This book was well-written with too many twists and turns to count! You'll be guessing right up until the very end!
Good read for travel, makes time pass quickly and you won't be bored at all. Good crime thriller and murder mystery
A slow start as you get to know the characters but the suspense subtly builds to a thrilling ending. Very enjoyable
Great read! Couldn't put it down. Be prepared to not stop once you start reading this intriguing, well written book
Fast read, with a lot of mystery.  I'm glad it was recommended to me.  I will look for more books by Paula Hawkins.
Good story, but too many tiny details.  I found myself skimming over parts just so I could move along in the story.
Great story line. Kept you hooked the entire time. I highly recommend this book. Thrilling. Happy I read it. Yahoo!
Very good book. A little hard to read at times as one of the characters is struggling through some personal issues.
I enjoyed the mystery of this book. I have to say that I didn't actually guess the plot till the end, which I like.
Full of twists and turns...can't wait for another read by this author! Had me right there with her, heart pounding!
A good read.  Like the way the author uses characters own perspectives to develop the story.  Ending was a bit weak
While I did finish the book, I have little patience with those who wallow and was really ready for the book to end.
When I started reading I was like what is this but quickly I got taken in and then couldn't put it down. Great read
Several times while reading this book thought it was a different murderer.  Very well written and hard to put down.
Too much angst.  Friends said it got really good half way through.  I'm not wasting my time reading all that angst.
My kind of thriller.....study in psychology.<br/>Have not stopped recommending it.<br/>Actually may read it again!
Well written, suspenseful. I read it in one day -- couldn't put it down. Am recommending it for the next Book Club.
Liked it a lot, gripping story. I wish it had a happier ending...but it was very real. Twisty love and murder tale!
A page turner. Unique way to tell a story. U forgettable ending. Good character building. Intense. I liked it a lot
Lots of plot twists and turns.  Highly suspenseful.  Well written.  Our book club choice, and it was a good choice!
All characters were un likable. Very slow reading the first half of the book. Really struggled to finish this book.
Fast paced and keeps you guessing who did it? Very surprised in the end! Well worth the purchase! Highly recommend!
I really liked this book; it was engrossing and not always predictable.....key elements for me in a murder mystery!
Great fun quick read.  I was not expecting it to end the way it did.  I loved the characters and the story overall!
This is a book a person probably ought to read twice. It would be even better the second time..<br/> Women mostly.
I enjoyed the book, lots of twists and turns. I will definitely be looking for this author's next novel. Well done.
This book is a page turner!  There are many twists and curves along the way!  Good fast read! Similar to Gone Girl!
It took nearly a quarter of the book to get my interest or to make any sense. Once it got going...it was very good.
Good thriller. Enjoyed the parallel story lines from the three female characters. Interesting view into alcoholism.
I enjoyed the twist and turns for sure!!! Better than gone girl! A true page turner... Absolute fun with every page
A little slow in the beginning but turned into a great book that left you guessing until the end! Highly recommend!
I thought this was an easy read and kept you guessing till the end.could not put it down! Can t wait for the movie!
Suspenseful. Well written. Many little surprises in the plot. I really can't think of another book to compare it to
I was sucked in right away...and continued on the edge of my seat. A truly great read - well written and presented.
This book is spell-binding. I couldn't stop reading it. The ending is an absolute stunner. You must read this book!
Read it so quickly I'm sad it's over. Gripping and left me wanting more! I would recommend this over and over again
If you are a fan of Gone Girl, then you will love this.  Many twist and turns keep you guessing to the end.  Enjoy.
Very fast read. Recommend for a book club or an easy, quick, and entertaining read. Kept me on the edge of my seat.
I couldn't put this book down.  What a great mystery with lots of twists and turns.  A must-read, fast-paced novel.
Good story but not stellar<br/>The pathetic nature of Rachel's character is overdone ... Should make a good movie
Well written. Good story.I got a good  feel for the lives of these women. I will read another book by this author.
Truly a train wreck, but a fun read.  Many plot twist that keep you guessing until the end.  Similar to Gone Girl.
Great book! Read it in 4 days (and It usually takes me weeks to read a book). 4 stars bc it left a few loose ends.
Dragged on, very depressed story. Was expecting more. Don't even want to watch the movie when it comes out. Eh....
This book keeps you on your toes! Just when you think you've figured out what is going on they surprise you again.
Such a great book! I definitely wasn't expecting it to go like that. Great, easy read, highly recommend this book.
I got confused in the beginning, just my brain but once I got the characters sorted out, thought it was very good.
I Enjoy this book, a page turner. Suggest others to read this book if they enjoy crime investigations and mystery.
I expected this to be a favorite book, but didn't really care for any of the characters, so kind of disappointing.
Loved it. Lots of twists and turns. So much seemed obvious all along, but then it was not at all what you thought.
I got tired of the main character's drinking and not solving her own problems.  Only a slightly surprising ending.
I could not have loved this book more. The writing, the characters, everything. I can't wait to read her next book
It will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's so much better than Gone Girl. No confusion or hard to read parts.
Basically  this book was a long drawn out overview of the effects of alcoholism and a poor attempt of a thriller plot.<br/><br/>And lets not even talk about the main characters😖
I hated every single character in this book. I've never read a book like this before. It really made me depressed.
Really enjoyed this whodunit told from three unique perspectives. I have to add 11 words to get my post published.
Nothing more than a thriller. No depth at all to the characters, I didn't relate to or like any of the characters.
Jumped around too much - not particularly intriguing or entertaining. Could have been titled housewives of Witney.
colossal waste of time.  Right down there with "Gone Girl" and "Goldfinch."  I want my brain back!
Would recommend to anyone who loves a good who done it book<br/>Kept me guessing till the end. A truly good book.
I didn't want to like it as much as I did but it was such a page turner.  I had no idea who was the guilty person!
Couldn't put it down once I started! Easy read and easy to follow. Not sure who was good and who was bad at times.
Things were starting to get interesting but then towards the end it started feeling like Perry Mason in a bad way.
Great suspense, fast paced read.  Started late and stayed up all night because I just couldn't put this novel down
Easy read with a fabulous surprise ending. dates get confusing but I ended up ignoring them and just kept reading.
Give yourself a good hour with the book to get into it - then, you're hooked.  Could not put this down! Excellent!
You can't put this book down- it is a page turner! I read it in a few days, it is easy to read but very intriguing
Thought it was a little dark at first.  But, it just kept getting more interesting and I had to see what happened.
I am not sure why people liked it so much. I almost quit in the first half, since the story was so hard to follow.
This was OK. It's an easy afternoon read, a whodunnit, but I was able to figure it out...not a lot of plot twists.
The Girl out the Train was a quick, suspenseful read! Could not put the book down for the later half of the novel!
It reels you in and cannot be put down.  Love all the twists in the story and all of the different points of view.
Well written, and a great plot. Definitely kept me up reading much later than I should have a few nights in a row.
It keeps you guessing the whole way.  I couldn't put it down! Similar to Gonna Girl, but with a much better twist!
I did read the whole thing but it didn't grab my attention. It was pretty boring except for e last 50 or so pages.
good read. similar to a couple of books I have read, but I was happy with the ending as it wasn't too predictable.
Well written. It will keep you guessing right to the end.  An enjoyable read that I would highly recommend to all.
Slow starter but once it got going I was hooked.  The life events of a confirmed alcoholic were quiet interesting.
Easy read. Good plot. Good character development. A tad slow. The red haired man should have played a bigger part.
I enjoyed this book.  It had twists and turns so I never knew what was coming next.  I couldn't put the book down!
A real page-turner: not exactly literary fiction but interesting, told from different first-person points of view.
This kept me awake and could not put it down. Suspense on testosterone. Could not predict the ending at all great!
Hard to put down with excellent twists and turns. I highly recommend this book! A great beach read for the summer!
I just loved this book.  Reminded me of Gone Girl and then again not so much.  But I would recommend it to anyone.
Great read. A little bit of a slow start, but last half was a compelling read!  Not a "Gone Girl" copycat!
Couldn't put it down. Kept me guessing all the way through. A different type of mystery. A very good read, indeed.
Loved the style of writing and switching back and forth between characters.  Kept me guessing all the way through!
I seriously loved this book it kept me on edge the whole way through. I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense.
While I found it difficult to like or admire the characters, it was a well written book with many twists and turns
I did not like the book but  could not stop reading it. Thankful I made it to the end.<br/> Very different story.
The book has a great flow to it and the story is one that you simply sink into, with an ending that is unexpected.
Very good book. I had to keep reading.  I couldn't put it down. I'm anxious to find d my next book written by her.
I could nit put it down, the characters are complex both smart and all disturbed in their unique ways. Incredible.
Loved this book and the style it was written. It was fast paced and I had a hard time putting it down.  Must read.
Quite possibly the strangest book I never finished.  Perhaps I just " don't get it".  Too depressing for my taste.
An easy read, gripping. I enjoyed it and was surprised by the twist of events. Good writing and suspense. A treat.
If you really liked gone girl, you'll also like this story. Very suspenseful and kept me guessing the entire book.
Became predictable, glad I read it, as I was looking forward to it coming out, feel it didn't live up to the hype!
Not a bad read but characters not well developed and I found it fairly predictable. Sort of like a Lifetime movie.
Good read ...absorbing to the end and a chilling look at coping in our times ....with grief or loss or depression.
Not a profound work of literature, but a page-turning murder mystery that draws the reader I from start to finish!
Loved the story, the pace. One of those books where you don't want to be interrupted by anyone till you finish it.
Loved the fast pace, the twists and turns and the unpredictability. A fun read if you want something entertaining.
Good book and well written. The real action doesn't happen until the very end of the book so it drags for a while.
If you like Gone Girl you will love this novel. Keeps you engaged, mysterious, well written....a real page turner!
Too confusing for me. Not much substance.  Bad end.  Have to pay more attention than I desire to do.  Didn't like.
This book kept me guessing the entire time. When I thought I knew the answer something happened to prove me wrong.
Interesting concept - felt sorry for the main character but she didn't seem to try too hard to overcome her angst.
This is a real page turner from chapter one. It's very entertaining - a great book to read on your summer vacation
Psychological thriller that gets better with the development of the characters through the first person narrative.
I bought this book for myself but have shared it with my daughters.  I hope there is a sequel for this story.  :-)
Great read. I had to keep putting it down so I didn't finish it too quickly.  Now I can get back to headier stuff.
Quite a thriller<br/>A who did it<br/>I can't believe this author<br/>Quite a imagination<br/>Very worth while
I loved the twists and the characters. I would love to see this one as a movie. Definitely reading this one again!
was slow to get into as characters were developed, but quickly picked up the pace. Kept me guessing until the end!
An ok read.  Mildly entertaining.  It does hold your interest throughout the book.  But the ending is no surprise.
Super. Deserves to be no. One.  Characters are believable if a little died. And of course the ending is unexpected
Excited to read it every night, flawed characters that felt real.  I'll be looking for more books from this author
If you are into thriller mysteries this is a book for you. I couldn't put the book down! Enjoyed every page of it!
The story held my attention and I found myself going back to it even when I should have been doing something else.
Mildly entertaining but it didn't live up to what I was expecting after reading some of the higher rating reviews.
Exciting thriller, well written. Keeps you reading on. Haven't enjoyed a book as much lately, which us refreshing.
I could not put this book down! Started out kind of slow...then suddenly picks up. Well written. Kept me guessing!
I would recommend this to everyone and everybody it truly kept me turning pages until the very end and in suspence
Could not put it down. Awesome book with great characters, plot and writing. The best book I've read in two years.
Grant hobbies sick while reading this book but I was so unbelievably confused for about 95% of it.  Hard to follow
For a best seller this book is absolutely awful. It is a chicks only story. If you are a guy, don't buy this book.
Awesome. Great twists. I loved every second. Kept me on the edge all the way through. Hopefully they make a movie.
Riveting and page turning. I liked it more than Gone Girl but it had the same creepy feel. I couldn't put it down!
Great read, and a quick one too! Once you get used to the different dates and narrators it gets better and better.
Said it all above. Rachel is an intriguing character, in spite of or perhaps because of all her flaws.  Fast read.
Great book!  Great Story with twists. Couldn't put this book down.  If you enjoyed Gone Girl, you will enjoy this!
It was a decent read. Had a good twist at the end. The characters were all a little crazy but that made the story.
Awesome read. Captures your attention from the start. Definite page turner, you won't be able to put the book down
I Loved this book - it Had me hooked right away. Satisfying ending too. Will definitely read more from this author
I really enjoyed the story.  It was very well written and easy to follow. No excess rambling like a lot books have
Couldn't put it down.  Very interesting writing...hardly any dialogue during the first few chapters.  Captivating.
Suspenseful till the very end.  Can't wait to read another from Paula Hawkins. Takes the reader on a great journey
Had loads of potential, but a little repetitive and slow to warm up, with an ending that wraps up all too quickly.
Hard to put down.  Well written, suspenseful.  The author goes deep into the main characters.  Highly recommended.
I don't usually like to read books written in 1st person but this one grabbed my attention and held it to the end.
Had me guessing the entire time. Well written with a wonderfully twisted and layered plot. I couldn't put it down.
Started out somewhat slow and I had the ending figured out about halfway through.  Was not as good as I had hoped.
Best book I have read in a while. Keeps you guessing until the very end. A must read for those who like thrillers.
What a great novel!  All kinds of twists and turns in the plot!  Did not expect the ending, but really enjoyed it!
Overrated first novel. It's a story of flawed characters, none of whom are likable. Easy to figure out who did it.
I found it a hard read and boring most of the time.  The so called "surprise" ending wasn't worth the read
The book keeps you guessing throughout. A real page turner. Couldn't put it down. Great read and very well written
This book, about the lives of two women, was rather unrealistic, but I enjoyed it and was surprised by the ending.
Similar to "Gone Girl". Started well, climaxed and got a little slow in the middle, but did finish strong!
The plot was interesting but I did not care for the author's style of writing, particularly in<br/> the first person.
A good story, not great, but good. Lots of questions to be answered as I read. Lots of drama among the characters.
I enjoyed the book even though it kind of dragged on in the middle.  If you like Gone Girl, you'll like this also.
Kept me in the edge of my seat!  Great twists and turns that kept me reading.  I would highly recommend this book.
Good read! It goes quickly and the story & characters are interesting. I Enjoyed trying to figure out the mystery.
I really liked the character development was excellent. It was very original and hard to put down.  Two thumbs up!
I like novels in which I cannot predict what will happen next. This was one of those novels. It was unpredictable.
Wow. I can't say what was the last book that captured my attention like this. Go get it. You won't be disappointed
Very pleased with this book. A great page turner. Kept me guessing most of the way through. I recommend this book.
Although I found the beginning a bit plodding, this story became a page turner about halfway through. A good read.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and could not put it down.  Great suspense and a unique story.  Super read.
Story unfolds in a very unique way, I was on board from the beginning and eager to read more at every opportunity.
A page turner.  Amazing plot and excellent character development.  Just when I thought that I had it figured out.
This was not a favorite. It went on too long and I kept putting it down. That's all I can say. It's ok not great.
A good story about a true monster hiding I plain sight.  We all probably know one or have known one some point...
Great read for train commuting! I sometimes didn't want my stop to come up since I was so engrossed in the story.
Many twists and turns in this book. You will end up shaking you head at the ending because of the twisted ending.
The book was a  real page turner, one that you can't put down. Cannot draw conclusions til very close to the end.
It was very slow moving with a confused story line.  I  didn't finish the book as it wasn't holding my attention.
I guess I can understand why so many readers gave this book 5 stars but I really didn't enjoy the book that much.
Shifting points of view converge at the last minute. The characters grow on you - they're not the usual suspects!
It was an okay book for me. I wasn't enthralled. It was just an easy read that kept me occupied during pedicures.
I didn't like the writing style.  I only finished the book because it was my book club's selection for the month.
Good story line, a bit obvious though towards the end. One thing that annoyed me was that it wasn't well written.
Bit disappointed having read all the reviews I was expecting much from it.  Half way I knew the way it would end.
The novel definitely held my interest, and I finished it quickly, but it became a bit predictable toward the end.
The structure was interesting. The characters were not so appealing but the plot was engaging.<br/>Easy to read.
A well written suspense novel that I could hardly put down. The characters in the book were very realistic to me.
A little slow for the first few chapters but thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the book. Didn't want to put it down.
Started out slow but really picked up the pace by the middle<br/>Head to put it down<br/>Unpredictable thrillet
was totally bored with this book-can't believe it was ever a best seller-too long, too much repeated detail, etc.
I enjoyed the book! It had just enough suspense to keep you actively interested and twist you didn't see coming!!
I could not put this book down. I loved the fact that the "who done it" was a mystery almost to the end!!
The premise of the book was good.  But the character, Rachel's, blackouts and drunkenness was excessive at times.
Suspenseful. I like the alternating perspectives. It is a twisted tale that leaves you on the edge until the end.
A complicated murder mystery.  The author takes a lot of time but we finally get to the all-too-obvious murderer.
It's a great suspense novel. I was angry with Rachel frequently, but the mystery of the story was well protected.
Starts out a little slow, but stick with it. The book becomes a page turner that you just don't want to put down!
Very good book, good mystery and told from a unique point of view.  I liked how the characters evolved over time.
This book is a good as it gets! Wonderful story line, and well written. Can't wait to read more from Ms. Hawkins!
Really enjoyed this book. There were a few times I felt it drug on a bit, but overall it was a thrilling journey.
Boring, redundant and depressing. Did not enjoy this book at all. I would not suggest this book to anyone at all.
My wife loved this book I bought her. She read it in a few days. Couldn't put it down and now I need another one.
Will definitely give you chills and you won't be able to put it down. Crazy good with, of course, a twist ending.
It is a book u can't put down. I would wake up at 3 or 4 n read. I recommend this book to all who like mysteries.
Loved this book! Couldn't wait to finish it and sorry when I did!  Great read for anyone and everyone! WONDERFUL!
Great book for women.... I loved the suspense, and the three different perspectives! I couldn't put this on down!
Good read, well-enough written, ending twist is a bit too predictable.  Gillian Flynn did it better in Gone Girl.
An intriguing story that had me gripped from page one. I was completely entertained and finished it within a day.
I could not put this book down after the first few chapters. It started slow,but then the story line picked  up .
Once I started this book, I had to finish it!!! I had to know what happened next!!!  Very relatable characters!!!
Was really good reading throughout most of the story. However the end was predictable and a little disappointing.
Hard to put down, surprises along the way, well written.  A must read, characters are so real, could be real life
I enjoyed this book very much.  There was a lot of character development and a few twist and turns.  A good read!
Excellent book. On the same lines as Gone Girl. Kept me guessing until near the end. I would recommend this read.
A good read.  Disjointed at times and her drinking problem disturbing for anyone that is familiar with alcholism.
This book kept me interested from beginning to end...even when I wanted to reach in and choke the main character.
Very good!<br/>The story evolved in a gripping way and the ending was a nice twist.<br/>Very well written story
Still a little unsure if I liked the ending or not...it kept me engaged and turning the page. Perfect beach read.
I loved it. It kept you interested in til the end. I would recommend it to everyone . Can't wait to read another.
This book keeps you on your toes with the shifting personalities and alliances.  Well crafted and a ver fun read.
Interesting story! Many twists and turns! You are never sure where you're headed until you get there! A fun ride!
What I liked about this book was how each life intermingled with one another's, even though they did not know it.
Not bad, probably appeals more to a female audience? I stopped reading about 75% in to the book. Got a bit bored.
Slow start but good ending. A little confusing with the characters at times but worth a read. Keeps you guessing!
Suspenseful story - told well from different points of view. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book
This is a great read - engaging with some complexity and surprises - I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed GONE GIRL.
Different way of spinning a tale, all in all a great read. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I can finally breathe.
Great summer read, with a fun plot (if a bit dark).  I read it in just a few days, which is my best compliment...
Wonderfully dark and twisted.  Get me interested to the end! Would love to read this one again.  Thank you writer
Interesting!  A lot of twists and turns. Make sure you notice the title(ie who is speaking") of each chapter.
You won't go wrong with this book. Terrific character descriptions - I feel like I can see them all. A wild ride!
THE PLOT RIDES THE TRAIN SO MANY TIMES THROUGH THE SAME TERRITORY THAT ONE GETS TO KNOW THE LANDSCAPE INTIMATELY.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Could not put it down. Will be reading more of this author when new books come out.
This book grabs you from the very beginning.. Was hard to put down.. Finished it in a quick 48 hrs.  Great read..
This is a definite page turner - read it in less than 24 hours.  Excellent character development and plot twists.
I thought I knew where this book was headed the whole time; I was totally wrong. Great story, I'm glad I read it!
I could not get into this book.  I kept trying and found it boring.  All she did was ride the train and complain!
I'm still reading this but to date, I find it intriguing and looking forward to the end to find out what happened
Terrific thriller. If you are a fan of Gone Girl this book is for you. Great characters and twisted plots. Enjoy!
What an intermingling of three so bound by pain and tragedy of misplaced and lost loves. Had to find out the end.
I couldn't put it down. I loved the back and forth story telling between the characters. It kept me wanting more.
Read the book in one sitting, letting everything else fall by the wayside.  A must read for my book club buddies!
This was an incredible read. I couldn't put it down. If you're looking for a page turner then you must read this!
I loved how there were different points of view throughout the book. It made it much more dynamic and interesting
Great Story with a little bit of history and learning about what it was like to live in the early 1900's- 1940's.
Read this book for book club and found it very entertaining, it may not seem good in the very beginning but it is
Twists and Turns. A great story to lose yourself in the pages.  Very Dark and disturbing, but a true page turner.
This book kept me hooked throughout. Character portraits were good. Common storyline presented in an unusual way.
Not usually my genre but I loved it anyway. To be cliche, a page-turner! Wonderful characters and a great ending.
I'm just going to say that I was very bummed when I finished this book. I didn't want it to end! It's a good one.
I never knew what direction the writer would take me all throughout the read. I would recommend this book to all.
I enjoyed but got tired of each chapter changing  different narrators. Finally got used to it half way thru book.
I Could not put it down - it had me from the first page. Very entertaining - I would highly recommended this book
I enjoyed the characters, found that Anna and Meghan had a lot in common, no wonder Tom was involved with both...
This book was great! It kept your interest right from the start. Loved it !! And it was not a predicable ending .
I thought the book was good.  It started out a bit confusing, but improved throughout the remainder of the story.
This crime fiction novel was handled differently to most but somehow didn't hit the spot. It was just an OK read.
A good easy read full of plot twists that keep you guessing to the end. Recommended to those who liked Gone Girl.
I couldn't put it down. The flaws of these characters keeps drawing you in further and further.  So Well written.
Not what I expected .  Fun quick read ...can't give anything away as that would not be fair .  Highly recommended
Very good.  Hard to put down, easy to read.  Liked the different perspectives of the characters.  Wold recommend.
Sometimes it's hard to follow between female commentaries but otherwise a well written book.<br/>Held my interst
A good story but difficult to read and to follow. I got tired of Rachel, her drinking, and her foolish decisions.
Weird ! First half very hard work but ultimately it all gelled & became a 'can't put down 'til I find out' book !
Took a bit to get I to the author's style of writing.  But once I did, I was hooked.  Couldn't put this one down.
A gripping thriller! Love the writing style . You don't see what is coming until you are there. Want to read more
This was a fast and enjoyable read. Loved the suspense - it kept me guessing the whole time. Highly recommend it!
Couldn't put it down. I wish the characters in the novel had not been such losers but it still made a great read!
I enjoyed the twist and turns. Just when you thought you figured it out another surprise.  Exciting till the end.
Took me a while to really get into it, but once I did I enjoyed it! Not sure I truly remember how it is narrated.
Great characters woven in and out and through a story that keeps you wanting you to learn. Insightful. Easy read.
Keeps you guessing.  A definite page turner. Read for my book club. Can't wait to discuss with the group members.
Great! Can definitely see the comparisons between this book and Gone Girl. A really tense, well-written thriller.
I couldn't put it down, and I was always wanting to know what was going to happen next. I would highly recommend.
This was such a great book! Lotsof twist and turns. Once I started reading it was very hard to put the book down!
it was rather boring,the main character coudn't keep my interest...l had to force myself to finish reading it....
started off slow and a bit confusing but by the time it made sense i was hooked until the end. very well written.
Great who done it! I liked the time line story  and the three women telling their story. Really held my interest.
It was exciting to the end. Good writing, with twists and turns. Now I know why it was on the best seller's list.
Couldn't figure out where the story was going at first, but then I couldn't put it down. Really enjoyed the book!
A book that is hard to put down. A "he said , she said "  keeping the reader intriqued.  I enjoyed it completely.
Hope this written continues to write.  Kept my interest throughout  the book and had a great twist AT&T; the end.
This is a book I simply couldn't put down.  The twists and turns keep you guessing until the end. A superb read.
Keeps you wanting more. Nothing is quite clear until the ending. Very well written, a must on your reading list!
Its a while since I read it so I'm a little hazy on the details but I do remember thinking it was a 'good read'.
I found it hard to follow at first.  But, once I got into the story I was interested and wanted to keep reading.
A took a little while to get into it but then it took off. The instructed weaving of the plot line was brilliant
I only gave this 4 stars, because I'd already figured out the ending, but it's a fast paced read, and a good one
Nice character development.  Mystery the outcome of which was not totally surprising.  Nice focus on the trains.
Couldn't put it down! It was assigned reading for my book club so I purchased this copy and was very glad I did!
I did like the book, but felt it was depressing.  I felt sorry for the torment in the lives of  the  characters.
It started out slowly but built to a delightful story. Lots of twists that will keep you guessing until the end.
Books that draw you in and don't make you want to put it down are the best kind of books!!! This is a must read!
Some good twists. Have heard it compared to Gone Girl but I liked it more. I didn't feel so let down by the end.
Very good read! It jumps around a lot with the different characters but keeps you guessing all along. Recommend!
It keeps you trapped and wanting to know the end.<br/>Interestingly nonlinearity in which the frame is counted.
Deeply thought out plot with well developed characters. Very gripping to the end.I thoroughly enjoyed this book!
Had a hard time putting it down. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  Definitely would recommend to read.
This book held me captive the entire time.  I finished it in three days.  I will definitely recommend this book!
Very much in the, "Gone Girl" genre. Kept my interest, pulled me along and gave me a satisfying​ ending.
Little disappointed. Do you really care about any of the characters. I kind of just felt like "so what?"
There are too many names of characters. A little depressing because the story is told from the eyes of an  drunk
Could not put it down! If you like mysteries I definitely recommend this! Twisted ending and a lot of surprises.
It has been awhile since I've read a book that kept me so engrossed. This is definitely a page-turner! Loved it!
A good read.  Slow start and frustrating at times.  You really wanted her to get it together.  Tense at the end.
I found the story very interesting and thought about the book when I wasn't reading it. The story moves quickly.
I liked the book but I did not fine it was all that great for being on the best seller list for such a long time
Needed to be edited to about 1/2 the length and would have been a GREAT story - too long, too "clever" -
A little bit of a slow start but then I started wanted to peek at the end which I do not do!  Very well written!
If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like The Girl on the Train. Fast-paced, keeps you guessing, couldn't put it down.
I had no idea what to expect from this book, but I didn't want to put it down.  Interesting read, yet a bit sad.
Good read for all couldn't put down I didn't want it<br/>To end. I hope  there is another one of her books soon
I found that it was impossible to lay this book down.  I really liked it a lot. Kept my attention until the end.
This is the best book I've read in a long time.  Well wriiten and a good developed story line. Pick this up soon
Enjoyed the book and was unable to predict the ending. Definitely was able to get through this book very easily.
I feel like it was Just ok...... The story Got better towards the end. It wasn't a book that kept me interested.
Writing is good. Characters believable. This is a dark book and I am glad I didn't read it in the winter months.
I enjoyed this book and the plot. At times it was a bit hard to follow but overall the plot twist made it great!
I liked this book. It was a good summer read. I did find it a little slow at times. I would recommend this book.
cleverly written. Interesting perspective. Someone on a train who sees something occurring ...very Hitchcockian.
Great read, couldn't put it down!  Well written and never left you hanging.  Good twist to the story and ending!
Enjoyed the way she gave us a little at a time!  Great first novel....look forward to whatever she puts out next
Loved going back and forth between the girls. Could not put it down. Set in England, so places were interesting.
Loved the charters, I felt so sorry for Rachel. But really was surprised with the ending didn't expect it. Great
Loved this story. I couldnt put it down! Finished it in a couple of days. Was not expecting how it all unfolded!
It was a challenge to try to sort out the different character's roles, but interesting at the end - a long haul.
Great book. Well written and certainly a surprising conclusion. I highly recommend it for your reading pleasure.
at times i was confused re; the women characters  and if they were the same person and she escaped  her husband.
Needed concentration to keep characters separated.  Very engaging, always seeing new twist.  It was a good read.
Great thriller with an exciting twist! If you like Gone Girl, you'll enjoy this story just as much very similar.
This story has a slow start and confusing group of characters but becomes one of those books you can't put down.
Good story overall. If one is sensitive, there is a lot of pitiful suffering, but loved the premise of the plot.
I did not care for the book at all and would not recommend it, however others in my book club did like the book.
This was a great quick read. It was filled with fun twists and turns throughout the story. Definitely recommend!
I didn't really like the main character. I don't know she could get away with being such a stalker in real life.
Loved this book!  It was suspenseful and well written.  Read it in two days.  Probably would make a great movie.
Kept me guessing.  If you like who done its, you will want to read it.  Half way through I couldn't put it down.
I read this book in one day. I had to keep reading to see what would happen next.  This would make a good movie.
Held my attention from the beginning. I never wanted to put it down. I would highly recommend reading this book.
very interesting read.  If you like "Gone Girl" or "Before I Go To Sleep" you'll like this read.
I didn't like it at all.  It was all I could do to finish it.  Way too disjointed. It isn't even worth one star.
Shocking. A great book. Twisting and turning the entire time. Loved it! Def a great book to recommend to others.
I couldn't wait to read more every time I had to stop. A real page turner.  I don't often find a book like this.
A quick and fun read, but not a great book for all time.  Some of the characters were just not credibly written.
Pretty gripping read that seems to be character study before going full tilt thriller at the end. Very very fun.
I enjoyed the interaction of the characters.  How the plot involved the three women with the thread of the train
This book can appeal to people who don't even read this genre. Great story and fantastically written. I loved it
Amazing book. Very well written, and an easy read, but keeps you on your toes - and confused, but in a good way!
Great story of twisted lives and watching them unravel. Enjoyed the way Rachel was so very human like all of us.
The book kind of dragged at the beginning but stay with it. It starts to gave some twists and a surprise ending.
Very exciting and keeps you guessing.  Difficult to sleep after the ending.  I thought it was a good solid read.
Multi-perspective, suspenseful, thought-provoking, and very well thought out. Loved it and couldn't put it down.
Held my interest to the end even after I guessed who was the culprit.  A good read and a uniquely written story.
At first I thought it was slow and not what I expected but as the stories went on I was hooked. Really liked it!
Hard to get in to it... The last two chapters were good other than that I felt like I was on a train to nowhere.
I can usually guess the outcome early on in books, but not in this one! Very surprised with the ending for once.
Suspenseful. Just amazing. So glad we decided to read this book for book club. I hope to read more of her books.
Great, fast paced read. Unlikeable characters and somewhat predictable story but worth the few hours of reading.
This novel has so many twists and turns. As soon as you think you figured it out, a new fact changes everything.
Very captivating. Loved the format of the narration. Plenty of twists & turns to keep you guessing. A must read!
Fantastic well written fast paced book. I'm not a quick reader but managed to finish this book over the weekend.
First third of the book is a little slow but the pace picks up and is a quick (but implausible) read thereafter.
Kept me guessing through most of the book! I enjoyed her writing style and am looking forward to her next novel.
I stayed up way too late four nights in a row reading this book. Couldn't put it down or stop thinking about it!
I thought this book was a great read. Total page turner and you never know what's going to happen until the end.
Liked it.  Recommended by a friend who loves to read. Story line is exciting and surprising start to finish. You
It was hard to put the book down.  A real surprise ending.  The reader won't be disappointed, for sure.  Enjoy .
What a fun read! Wish I could find more stories written this way!  Really loved Rachel. Thank you Paula Hawkins!
It took me awhile to get all the people strait.  It was amazing how the author made me suspect every character .
I loved this book and have recommended to friends.  Do yourself a favor and sit down for some enjoyable reading.
The Girl on the Train held my attention, the suspense was building throughout and I was surprised by the ending.
An excellent reAd. Seduces you from the start. Unable to put it down once you start reading. Keeps you guessing.
Awesome story!!!!! Could not put this book down!!!!! The ending was a real shocker!!!!!!! Enjoyable read!!!!!!!!
Absolutely the best I've read in a long time.  Credible characters in an incredible plot.  Couldn't put it down!
Great story told from the perspective of three women who's lives turn out to be connected by lies and obsession.
even though it's not always stands to logic it's very captivating and is a good read.<br/>I would recommend it.
I could not put this story down. It was so well written and from the viewpoint of each of the women in the tale.
A very fast read!  Enjoyable mystery!  Worth the time if you want a quick read. Better than Gone Girl, for sure.
Written from an interesting perspective unlike most novels.  Good insight into the ravages of alcohol addiction.
Slow at first but great mid to ending. Would definitely worth the read.<br/>Style of writing was easy to follow
Engaging and full of twists.  Great mystery, fans of Gone Girl will enjoy the book. Never saw the ending coming.
I could not put down this book. It  will draw you in until you turn the last page. Well written, and compelling!
Kept you wanting to read further. Liked it a lot. Highly recommend reading this book.<br/>Great for a book club
The main character truly depicts the "haze" that drinkers live in every day.  Didn't foresee the ending!
I can totaling see why book is #1 on NYTimes best seller list. Great suspense and hard to figure out the killer.
Suspenseful, page turner' I didn't want to put it down about 80% into the book so I didn't. Good book club book.
Very entertaining. Brought awareness to the commuters lifestyle on a train.  Who knew one could observe so much?
I take the train into work every day and wanted to go past my stop more than once to continue reading this book.
Finished this book in two days, GRIPPING. One of the few books that have kept me in suspense until the very end.
Intriguing, keeps you on your toes. A real page turner, couldn't put it down.  Sorry it had to end! Great read!!
Wasn't sure what to make of it at first but than I couldn't put it down.  Thriller with a nice twist in the end.
Started out interesting enough but somehow lost its appeal about 3/4 of the way in. Ending not plausible to me.
Amazing story! Couldn't put it down! Left you wondering the outcome the whole time...left you very interested!!
Like the novels of Gillian Flynn, "The Girl on the Train" is a, how you say, good read.  I highly recommend it.
At ditsy it feels like a sad soap opera. Then it becomes interesting; then compelling.  A very enjoyable  read.
An interesting approach to a story I was familiar with.  A "happy ending" helped.  It was well written.
But beyond that it also reminds me of the basic sadness at the root of modern life, an existentialist paradigm.
Page turner!<br/>Interesting perspective from the narrator.<br/>I loved this book and the way it was laid out
Excellent read. Only a brief slow period throughout the middle but the twist at the end makes it well worth it!
Based on other comments I was expecting it to be great. At the end I thought it was a good read, but not great.
Loved it! I couldn't put the book down: with each turn of the page, it got better and better. Very suspenseful.
I love a mystery that can actually be solved, has decent clues, and a believable ending.  This book had it all.
What is supposed to be so special? Clue is been given away soon and after that you are just hoping to be wrong.
The best thriller that I've read in a long time! I've recommended it to just about everyone I know. Great book.
It was hard to understand at first a little weird - very dreary  slow reading had to force myself to finish it.
Dragged on for a long time without going nowhere, especially as I had guessed the plot easily half way through.
Hitchcock would have loved it. And some actress is going to make a career playing the flawed Girl on the Train.
I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed it! I have already recommended this book to family and friends!
Suspenseful and entertaining. It took a while to get used to the format but overall I really enjoyed this book.
This was Definitely a page turner! Surprising ending! Can't wait to see what they will be doing with the movie.
Very good. I started it over after not being able to read for a week. Names/dates made more sense second time:)
I wasn't keen on the chapter breakout at first, but it helps to truly define the characters.  Really enjoyed it
Hard to put down once you start! Read this based on online suggestions.  So glad that I did. Didn't disappoint.
This was an enjoyable and easy read.  It isn't going to win any awards for great literature but a good mystery.
The story moves quickly and keeps your interest. You are never quite sure where it is going until the very end.
Maybe I'm obtuse, but I can't get into this at all. Had high hopes because it was so touted. Doubt I'll finish.
absolutely amazing..I am an ending person, I require an amazing ending to love a novel, and THIS book delivers!
Drags on.  Jumps all over the place. Average writing.  A Gone Girl wannabe. Just did not make the grade for me.
A recommended read for sure. A good whodunit although a little bit redundant. I would read more by this author.
A great read; only three main characters to follow...but oh what tangled webs they weave!!!! Unexpected ending.
Couldn't put this down. I felt like I was making the discoveries along with Rachel. The detective work was fun.
A little slow at 1st . I had my doubts where it was going , but then I was sucked in and couldn't put it down .
Interesting reading. A page turner. The three stars indicate that for me, the material was a little depressing.
A very strange twist of lives that are entwined in love, deceit and murder.  A thriller with a shocking ending.
Was  great book-Once I really got into the story-I just couldn't put it down. Read the book in less than 2 days
A great read that keeps you guessing until the end. Can we ever really know even our best friend? Questionable.
Easy to get sucked into this story. Twists I did not expect. A good mystery to get caught up in on a rainy day.
Couldn't put it down  it's a quick summer read.<br/>For anyone who enjoyed gone girl. You will like this also.
Not my favorite book. Thought it times it was rather convoluted. The end was a surprise I will  I will say that
Starts a bit slow but gathers pace to an exciting conclusion.  You must keep track of the characters narrating.
The story takes twists and turns that keep you guessing while wanting to read more. I highly recommend it. Wow!
I am not sure I will finish this book. Everyone seems to like it, although I heard the ending is disappointing.
I couldn't put this book down! It certainly earned its right to be on the best seller list! Highly recommended.
Very good book to read. Kept interest going throughout book. I world read more books by this author. Thank you.
Not worth the hype. Pretty predictable outcome with the story falling flat half way through.<br/>Disappointing
Twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end.<br/>I can't wait for this to be made into a movie!
Could not put down.  Cannot wait to see the movie.  I feel it will be better than it's comparison to Gone Girl.
The book is a complete thriller and a page turner! I was not able to keep the book down and enjoyed reading it.
I thought I knew what was going to happen and them boom, it took a complete turn. I was on the edge reading it!
Interesting story line, well developed characters. You get sucked into their lives.<br/>overall worth reading!
Had to put down once started, but could have used a little more character development of the men.  A good read.
Very rarely do I rate a book with 5 stars.  But Hawkins sets a brisk pace with her three captivAting narrators.
Great book that takes many twists... Will keep you on the edge of your seat. Turns out how you least expect it.
It is well written, the way the story was told was very interesting and I really got into it.<br/>A must read.
Absolutely loved the book!  Grabs you from the beginning and gives you a thrilling ride all the way to the end.
Read the whole book on the plane from San Francisco to Baltimore. Great story with a twist to jeep you guessing
Great book! Couldn't put it down. Looking forward to a movie in near future. I do highly recommend  reading it.
This book was very difficult to put down. An Edge of your seat read.  Kept me wondering till the end. Loved it!
the book was all it was advertised to be.  would recommend it to anyone interested in a good mystery.  enjoy...
I really didn't care much for the book.  The "girl" was a drunk and it was hard to like her or to care.
when you read this book, keep track of the dates for each chapter or it can get very confusing. Excellent book.
This book was absolutely amazing. I recommend it to all my friends and anyone who loves a well written suspense
What a great book . Pulls you in quickly, but you'll be wanting more by the time you finished. Excellent read!!
Lots of twists and turns in this book.  Great characters with a great story line. I didn't want to put it down.
I read this book in 3 days. I couldn't put it down. Very well written and keeps your attention. I recommend it.
Good, good, good!!!  Somewhat complex presentation but once you're comfortable with it, very becomes very good.
Couldn't put it down<br/>Slow start but once characters are ascertained it's easier to follow<br/>Great story
A riveting story of damaged human beings seeking a way to their own happiness and the results of their endeavor
I was surprisingly interested and intrigued. Didn't even realize I was reading a mystery until halfway through.
I know it's been on the best seller list, but I had a hard time getting through it. It was very confusing to me
It starts out slow for only a few pages then picks up steam and never stops. Practically perfect. A great read.
Kept my attention. Sometimes I felt rather confused but not terribly. Your just never 're know a person I ghee.
Couldn't put it down. Very suspenseful. Written very well. Quick read that can be finished in a week of reading
loved the twist and turns.  if you like Gillian Flynn novels, you will love this too.  a quick satisfying read.
It was suspenseful without being obvious.  I enjoyed the main character,  and how she was relatable and flawed.
I just found it difficult to follow as it went back and forth between characters.  Also, it was kind of boring.
The plot was great and it stayed interesting to me. Very easy read with lots of twists and surprises. Loved it!
Don't start reading this book if you have something else to do!  Great characterization.  Couldn't put it down.
Read it in one single day, couldn't put it down. Very well written. Lots of suspense. Worth every single penny.
I personally didn't enjoy this book. I thought it really didn't have much of a plot and didn't keep my interest
I read this book in 2 days. Soo so good. Never expected the ending. It was very entertaining. Highly recommend.
I think this is a real good book and I can see a movie in the future.  Readers need to stay alert to the dates.
Interesting read. But went on a little too long before conclusion. Got tired of so much of Rachel's weaknesses.
I read this book in two days. It is exciting from the very beginning. A perfect book for the beach this summer.
This was definitely a quick read.  Not nearly as hard to put down as Gone Girl, but a good vacation beach read.
loved it very hard to put down and so many twists make you want to read it all over again to look for the clues
I was intrigued by the very first chapter. It was incredibly suspenseful and it kept me guessing until the end.
While the book was entertaining, I found the actions of the characters and story line unrealistic to illogical.
The book was a "who done it" which is not my favorite type of reading. The characters had little depth.
The Author did a great job of keeping you guessing of what is going to happen next. I really enjoyed this book.
This book is very suspenseful. I Couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book, if you liked 'Gone Girl'.
A nice read for a vacation or flight. Engaging characters, if not a little despicable all of them. Tidy ending.
Hard to like any of these characters. A few twists and surprises.  Ending is helpful to a more positive review.
Good plot, but the denouement was a long time coming.  The drawn-out detail was confusing in parts of the book.
Exciting book page after page kept me  changing my mind  about who done it.  I'm sure someone will make a film.
Sorry I ordered it.  It didn't interest me or bring me a story to look forward to reading.  Not my cup of tea!!
Loved it! And I read it on a train as I traveled in Ireland. LOL<br/>Will now  check out other books by Paula.
Edgy, makes you want to keep reading and not put the book down. Highly recommend this book. Read it on one day!
intriguing but too much back in forth with characters and dates.  It was fairly easy to figure out the culprit.
I didn't think I was gonna like this book because of all the hype about it but I loved it and can't explain why
Suspense filled to the end.  Hard to put down.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  Very well written book.
Great twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book to my friends. Five stars. Get it.
Good read for what it is, but lacked body. I mind that I didn't like any of the characters-just like Gone girl.
Could not put the book down. Very realistic as I know  first hand about addiction out of control. Great ending.
A fun, suspenseful plot. Keeps you guessing for the entire ride. Not the most like able characters. Enjoyed it.
Very surprising, suspenseful story! I couldn't put it down. Similar to Gone Girl but with a much better ending.
Great read.  Started out thinking it was like GONE GIRL,  but a great twist makes this its own excellent novel.
Full of unexpected twists and turns. Enjoyed! Definitely a fun  read. Thought it was a really good book to read
Fast read, good suspense, I'd read this author again if she writes similarly to this.  Worth the money I think.
I loved this novel from the very first page!  It is a page turner that keeps you guessing from start to finish.
Best book I've read in awhile. Many twists and interesting turns, could not put it down. I recommend this book.
I really enjoyed this book and I had trouble putting it down once I started. It kept me guessing until the end.
What an interesting twist in the s story.  Characters seem real to life and things happen and liars always lose
Couldn't put it down. Great read from cover to cover. Looking for more books and page turners from this author.
A thrilling read! Could not put this page-turner down. If you liked Gone Girl, you will love Girl on the Train!
This was such a wild ride. I loved everything about this book. The twist and turns the not knowing. Good stuff.
a bit far fetched i thought.... held attention to want to finish.. but was a bit disappointed with the ending.
Unusual storyline kept me reading non-stop. Haunting love with twists and murder mystery to solve.  Good read.
Aside from the language, I enjoyed reading the book for it's intriguing plot that kept me guessing to the end.
I liked this book. The ending surprised me, which doesn't usually happen. I'm betting it will be a movie soon.
Suspenseful but an easy read. Very interesting! I was able to get through it quickly and the ending was great.
Told from different perspectives and it all comes together in the end.  Did not guess the ending.  Great read.
I loved it and it was a page turner.  I think I read it in 2 days! Can't wait to discuss it with my book club.
Fascinating look into the life of an alcoholic mixed with an intriguing mystery.  Interesting turn at the end.
Slow at first and then I couldn't put it down! I read so many books that I had a feeling I knew who it was....
I could it put it down. Lots of twists. Lots of heart ache. I could really picture the whole book. Great read.
At first the book starts slow, but I finished it in less than two days. I couldn't put it down. Great twist...
This was a really good read. I did not know the outcome until the end. I would recommend if you like suspense.
I just couldn't read it.  I was forcing myself too-so stopped.  I hated it that primary character was a drunk.
Once I got started I didn't want to put it down. It was fast moving and Kept you interested in the characters.
Good read but a little draggy in the middle.  Too many details slow the story down.  Good ending. 3 more words
Really enjoyed the book and the pace of it all. Definitely a page turner and something to curl up to at night.
Initially the plot is slow in developing…but it continues to develop into a mystery that has a surprise ending
Such a captivating novel that made me not want to put it down! Will look for more Paula Hawkins books to read!
One of those rare novels that you cannot stop reading.  I couldn't wait to find out the answer to the mystery.
I became very frustrated with the characters and plot while reading this novel; although, the climax was good.
I could not put this book down and didn't see the ending coming. Lots of twists and turns. I highly recommend.
Definitely a great read, would recommend if you loved Gone Girl. Can't wait for Hawkins next book to come out!
Although the book started out a little slowly, it quickly picked up and didn't stop! Definitely worth reading!
Very nicely written and plotted. Ending might seem a small letdown but only after the fact. Great, quick read.
Loved this book. Wad a real thriller. Full of twists and turns. The ending was a shocker! Not expected at all.
Captivated from the beginning with surprising characters becoming more and more complex as the story unfolded.
Took a while to get into it but then when I did, I loved the "turn" it took in revealing the criminal!
So many twists and turns. This book kept me up most of the night!  I hated to reach the last page. Great read.
It was a thrilling page turner that kept me wanting to read all day.  I reccomend this to anyone.  Great read.
I couldn't put this book down! Fantastic story. Loved it! Now I should go to clean my neglected house finally!
Great book. Not as good as Gone Girl but still a good read. Would definitely recommend this book to be anyone.
A lot like Gone Girl. Great read until about 2/3 in, then an unbelievable, hasty ending. Left me disappointed.
Didn't care for the format; totally predictable plot. I do not understand why this book was so wildly popular.
A different kind of story, I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  Once I got into it, it was very interesting.
Did not like any of the characters. Confusing the way it jumped from person to person, and tracking the dates.
Became a lot faster paced towards the end.  Liked that it wasn't predictable.  The 'Girl' was a bit of a mess.
It was a pretty good read. The main character was very relatable! I enjoyed and recommend this book to others.
Great thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end! I would highly recommend this book!
Kind of boring in the beginning but near the middle picks up and has a very twisty ending. A good summer read.
This book comes highly recommended, and I was not disappointed at all! I read it in one day. Very suspenseful.
You won't be disappointed in this book. You'll be disappointed cause you read it so fast!!! Get this book now!
Definitely a page turner. Took a while to get sucked in to the story, but once I was, it was hard to put down.
Read this book for our book club and it was a hard book for me to get into. Just didn't care for it very much.
It was little slow in the beginning but turned into a real plot twist!  I would recommend this murder mystery.
Finished in two days !! Would highly recommend especially if you love a page turner!! Kindle makes it so easy!
I highly recommend to any mystery lover. A real page turner. I read it one afternoon. I could not put it down!
Good read. Not as exciting and thrilling as I was hoping for. It never really hooked me in. confusing at times
This is a good read. It's easy to follow and keeps you interested. A bit predictable but I still recommend it.
Although it was hard to stay interested in the beginning, I have to say (about mid-book) it was a page turner.
Great easy read that kept you guessing until the very end! Highly recommend if you enjoyed the Gone Girl novel
Once I started I couldn't put it down! Very suspenseful, with a crazy twist! Read in one day it was that good!
Once I got into it I enjoyed the book. Easy plane/travel reading makes time go by faster. Enjoy.<br/><br/>IR
Was a bit drawn out. Took to long to get to the point. I read it anyway, hoping it would get more interesting.
Amazing plot!! It took a little too long for the suspense, that would be my only reason for not giving it a 5.
This book lives up to the hype. I enjoyed the setting in London and the language they spoke. It's a must read.
I found the book a little hard to follow .  The story line started real good but later became too unbelievable
This was a fantastic read - kept me up way past my bedtime multiple nights because I just couldn't put it down
Not particularly well written or shocking. A good beach or airplane read. A quick page Turner and we fun read.
Keeps you going, not sure what is real or what is in her mind.  Not sure what the next turn of events will be.
This was not a predictable story, with no perfect characters.  It keeps you guessing, even up to the very end.
I found the book hard to read and very uninteresting until the last 10% of the book and wound not recommend it
The story was okay, but the characters weren't worth caring about. In the end I didn't care about any of them.
A combo of Gone Girl and a Sunday afternoon Lifetime special, and if you enjoyed Gone Girl, I'm sorry for you.
Once you get into it, it's hard to put down.  I'd be interested in what the future has in store for Rachael :)
couldn't put this down.  the story was intense and riveting.  hope that they make this into a movie real soon.
I wish I could read it faster but I keep putting it down.  Its not keeping my attention.  But its a good book.
This book captured me right away. Been in Rachel's shoes before so I couldn't help but to read this book fast.
Really enjoyed this read. Mystery,  intrigue,love interests etc. Well written, confusing at times. I loved it.
I could not put this book down, I read it in one day. Not because it was short but because I had to finish it.
Couldn't stop reading up until the end. Kinda wished it didn't end with only Rachel but this book was engaging
Loved the book. Great from start to end. I think this would make an outstanding movie. So gripping to the end.
What a great read,  I couldn't put it down!  I would compare this to Gone Girl, which I thought  was fabulous!
A good mystery that will have you guessing until the end.  Make sure you read the NAME above each chapter !!!!
Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was well written, a different writing style and it held my interest.
At the beginning it did not catched me but I kept reading it anyway. The end is a little obvious. Good overall
Loved every single page. Didn't expect the twist and turns at every corner. Equal to the thrill of  Gone Girl.
Couldn't put it down. The author does a good job of making you want to read the next chapter...and the next...
I did figure out who the killer was, but it was an interesting thriller. I would recommend it to the audience.
Great read. Totally wrapped up could not put down!  Loved the twists and turns. I wish I was still reading it!
A real page turner. I agree with other reviewers in that if you enjoyed Gone Girl you will like this book too.
This is a great story and is currently being read by my book club and we all love it.  It is hard to put down!
Great book! Kept me guessing all the way through.<br/>Highly recommend this book if you like a good mystery '
Great story from start to finish.  You are sure to enjoy this tale of twists and turns with a surprise ending.
Good suspenseful novel that kept me intrigued.  I liked seeing the story from all three character's viewpoint.
I couldn't put this book down. It was slightly predictable near the end but still caught me with a few twists.
Action packed, great quick read!! I am glad I listened to everyone who told me to read this book! I want more!
Definitely a page turner. Kept me guessing until the end! I couldn't put this book down. All I can say is WOW!
Didn't like the main character, Rachel.  Story kept me interested in trying to figure out "whodunnit?"
This made me love books again!! You won't want to put it down. The twists and turns make for a thrilling ride.
I had to read it twice. It was very involved and I had a problem following the plot. I did enjoy it very much.
Easy to follow, good read for leisure, kind of terrifying though if you've just had a baby. New moms take note
A little along the line of "Gone Girl", but still complex character development making it interesting.
Good book.  Written a little different from most novels/mysteries.  Didn't want to put it down until finished.
This book was as good as Gone Girl.  Can't wait for the movie.  These characters would be interesting on film.
I enjoyed the book after I got into it.  It took me a while, but then was anxious to learn what was happening.
The story is sort of intriguing but the writing is mediocre. I never really cared about any of the characters.
This was a great read and the ending was unexpected. I didn't give it 5 stars because I felt it dragged a bit.
Really good read, lots of little stories in between the main one which made it different than others I've read
A really good read. I can imagine it as movie script. It could even be a play. Character development excellent
If you like a who dun it and a thriller you will enjoy more enjoyable can't wait to read more from this author
Beach, plane, train. Wherever you are, this book will grab you and not let you go until the final page. Enjoy!
Very different! It just amazes me how people come up with these ideas. This was creepy in parts, but creative.
Amazing! Best book I've read in a long time. I couldn't put it down! I've recommended it to all of my friends.
I liked most of this book. It was a real page turner. Not sure I liked the ending though. It was no Gone Girl.
Loved this book; very intriguing.  Violence and sexual content are not graphic at all; just part of the story.
I love the way this story developed. In the end, it was a little predictable but still fun to read to the end.
Great fast read. A page turner. Quick and easy to read and understand. If you need something light this is it!
Could not put it down, each chapter more enticing than the previous one. Best book I have read in a long time.
Loved it!  Couldn't wait to pick it up and find out what happened next! Better than most of this type of book,
Don't know what all the excitement was about.<br/>Difficult to follow the characters, boring, boring, boring!
Initially it was a bit slow and hence boring but writer build up the plot cleverly. Enjoyed reading this novel
Well written, not much for a "back and forth" story, but the writing was good and the characters were engaging
Very slow for me to get into. Once you are in the works of the novel, you will be glad you picked the book up.
I could not put this book down! It was amazing, definitely recommend it to all Gone Girl fans! You'll enjoy it
Similar to Gone but definitely not the same. Good read. Couldn't put it down once I started. I'd recommend it.
Read it obsessively and finished within just a few days. Rachel is so relatable and the alcoholism is spot on.
Great fast read. Real page turner. If you liked gone girl you will like this. Pulls you in for the first page.
Loved this book, can't wait to discuss it with my book club!  Finished it in two days... couldn't put it down.
I had a hard time getting into this book at first but then I became captivated by it and couldn't put it down!
I liked it very much, but since I read it over time I had trouble remember who was who!  I would recommend it!
I love that this book is written from a woman's perspective. Great characterization with the mystery built in.
Rather "Gone Girl"- esque.  Still, it kept my attention on a plane ride, which was why I purchased it.
Starts out slow, picks up speed about one-third into it and then the questions begin...who could have done it?
Amazing book-- Somewhat slow and frustrating at parts, but overall a great read that I completed in a weekend.
I couldn't put this book down and loved all the twists and turns and the real struggles of the main character.
I enjoyed the book, the storyline and the characters.  I read it in a weekend and stayed up late finishing it.
Chapter by chapter by three different angles to make the whole picture finally. Quite an interesting framework
I loved this quick and entertaining novel, similar to gone girl and keeps you hooked until the very last word!
If you like alcoholic, dysfunctional people, you might like this book.<br/>I found the characters disgusting.
Fast paced, intriguing read that kept me guessing until the end. Really enjoyed this one -- great debut novel!
This was a good read.  I was surprised by the ending, which is always good.  I hate reading predictable books!
Good plot, but falls apart (i.e. becomes totally ridiculous) at the end.  A quick read if you like fluffy lit.
Another of those books where you really can't work out the ending.  You want to keep reading to find out more.
I found the premise was interesting, but there were too many coincidences and the killer comes out of nowhere.
Rachel, Megan, and Anna's stories are all tied together, but you'll have to wait till the end to find out how!
once you get into it it's hard to put down the book.  Since the weather is awful I didn't have to put it down!
This book is a page turner and impossible to put down. A great and easy read. Highly recommend. Happy reading!
I opened this book at the beginning of an airplane trip. It was so engrossing, I was landing before I knew it!
I really enjoyed the read- it contained enough plot twists to keep it interesting without confusing the reader
Great  suspense story that keeps you reading until the end,but no really likable characters (all pretty sick).
I could not put it down. Great writing and characters. A must read for thriller readers. Just loved this book.
I could not put this book down.  It kept my attention the whole time.  I enjoyed the different characters.  😊
If you liked Gone Girl, you will enjoy this read. Painful at times, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat.
I loved this book!  I couldn't put it down.  I read it all in 2 days. Wonderful, full of mystery and suspense.
This book Reminded me of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl with its many plot twists...I stayed up late to finish it!!
Kept me turning the pages right from the start. I liked the narration style, too.  I really enjoyed this book.
if you enjoyed Gone Girl this is for you.  it was entertaining and kept me curious it may do the same for you.
Great, suspenseful read. If you like Gone Girl, you will love The Girl on the train: A Novel by Paula Hawkins.
I received this book yesterday afternoon, began reading it at 8:00 p.m., finished it at 3:30 a.m. Enough said.
Lost it's verve in the middle of the book and found it tedious by the end.
Well written, suspenseful and terrific.  I finished it in 3 days!!!!  I'm sure it will be turned into a movie
Excellent!  Hard to read such a tale of dismissal and rejection, but it was just too well written to put down
How many events in our life are what we remember them to be? And how much are they what we choose to believe?
It was a decent plot but the story went on and on until it was difficult to care about any of the characters.
This was my first book by this author and I enjoyed it. The ending was a little much but overall a good book.
Starts slowly and at times a little tedious but the story develops nicely and has very good levels of tension
Great read! Couldn't put it down. Very well written and keeps you guessing. Eager to read more by the author.
A good mystery in that I never would have guessed the ending.  A little crazy but it mostly held my interest.
I thought it was very interesting. It did drag some in the middle  but close to the end it got very exciting.
At first it was a little bit boring, but then you cannot stop reading. Better if you do not read the reviews.
Quick and easy read. I loved this book! I couldn't put it down. Full of twists and turns. Highly recommended!
One of the best novels I have ever read!  Brilliantly written.  Hawkins shows great imagination in this book.
I couldn't finish it. It just didn't hold my interest. I usually like these types of books. It wasn't my jam.
This story was suspenseful enough to keep me turning pages but I never felt settled or calm while reading it.
I think the author should have done a better job of getting into the story.... too much info before the drama
In love with this book! Twist around every turn!  Take time to dive deep into this great mystery. Great book!
There a few good plot twists, the story starts off slow but when it kicks in it is hard to put the book down.
Liked it but didn't love it, found the main character frustrating at times but was not predicting the ending.
I almost gave it 3 stars but decided to give it 4 for the ending.  It did keep me guessing as to who done it.
Keeps you guessing and attached to the characters the whole time. Not able to put it down!  It's a good read.
This book kept me on my toes with the twists and turns. What an ending! A must read if you enjoyed Gone Girl!
I really liked this book. It was slow starting but very suspenseful if you stay with it.<br/>Excellent read.
Similar to gone girl which is why I liked it. Well written and I really connected with the female characters.
I was disappointed with book.  Being No.1 on the best seller list for so long, I expected a better story line
One of the most interesting books since Gone Girl.  Good character development.  Unexpected twists and turns.
The book pulls you in & keeps you guessing up to the very end. Good character development & story. Recommend!
The ending had a good plot twist, but getting there was difficult! I would not say I was hooked by this book.
Good in a,say but different is all I can say. Gave away the murder. Too much bad behavior kept me interested.
I couldn't put it down.  The suspense almost killed me.  What a thrill ride.  I can't wait for her next book.
Kept me engaged for the summer...it's good but not great. Reminded me of Gone Girl. Expected more suspension.
I was hooked from chapter one. A very unique approach to storytelling. I can't wait to ride on a train again.
I love the perspective of telling the story through a daily train ride. I thought at times the book did drag.
This novel is like watching a good Hitchcock movie. Great writing!! My heart is still racing (in a good way)!
Interesting - in that, in the beginning, I wasn't that interested. And then it picked up pace. Worth reading.
Not light hearted reading, but an excellent read.  The author actually put you in "the girl's" shoes.
Great twist in this one! Hard to put down once you get caught up in the story! I'll read this one again soon.
Too boring and predictable. But I do know a ton of people who love it!!! Wish it could have kept my interest.
Absolutely the best twisted thriller since Gone Girl. I could not put it down and read it all in one sitting!
This book definitely held my interest and there were twists in it.  I would recommend, I read it in one week.
I really enjoyed this read! Took me about 2 days to complete. If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this too.
Kept me guessing until the end, a very heartfelt and at times a brutally raw emotional journey - a good read.
I figured it out too soon and it left me not really wanting to finish the story. But still some good writing.
Love this book! Definitely kept me on my feet wondering what was going to happen next. It was such a thriller
I really loved this novel, the writing is excellent and keeps you guessing. I was not ready for that ending !
Girl on the Train was a good easy read with a clever story line. Surprise ending.  Enjoy this book very much.
Seemed a little boring at times but had a complete surprise ending,  Not a book to keep me up nights reading.
Very enjoyable read. The characters were so lifelike and human. A little slow in parts, but highly recommend.
Quick read - similar in story-line somewhat to Gone Girl, but different enough. Kept me intrigued throughout.
Wow! Great book - really loved it. The character development was very well done and the plot was so exciting!
Once you start, you cannot stop reading! It is a twisted tale of love, trust and a great mystery til the end.
Good, but not as captivating as I had heard. There is a lot of nothing throughout the middle 60% of the book.
Great characters, really intriguing plot/premise, very enjoyable old-school style suspense. Highly recommend!
Slower paced than what I though it would be, not a book I would recommend. Author seemed much too wordy......
Just a great read. Deserving of it's place on the Best Seller list. Highly recommend it for all avid readers.
Couldn't put it down. Couldn't wait to see who done it. A surprise on all sides. What twist for all involved.
A wonderful story with twists and turns that makes it impossible to put the book down. Loved every last page.
About two thirds into the book and the outcome was pretty obvious which made reading the final third tedious.
Very difficult to get started. All in first person which is not my favorite reading. Ending was good however.
Soooooo slow. Has great reviews, etc. but just too plodding for me. Never finished it.. Maybe it gets better?
really enjoyed this book and others I have told about it liked it too. easy to read, not so easy to put down!
Absorbing, interesting murder mystery that you won't want to put down - a good read and an imaginative story.
I have read some favorable reviews, but I, frankly, found it boring, confusing, and dull. I could not finish.
Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time! I loved the "who done it" factor! There's got to be a sequel.
I didn't even finish the book - was so bored by the time the murder even was introduced, that I just gave up.
I am not much of nonfiction reader but I enjoyed the read. Keep an eye on the dates as you read the sections!
Enjoyable, but the ending seemed a bit unrealistic, like the writer just lost vision and sewed it up quickly.
Sucks you in from the start! Action and surprising twists. I'm going to see if Paula Hawkins has other books.
The book is an easy read but the main character wasn't likable, made dumb decisions and I found her annoying.
Had trouble getting through it.  Had to put it down because it dragged on and on.  A little hard to follow...
it was an okay book, easy to read though took a while to really get going. definitely not worth all the hype.
This book is neck and neck with Gone Girl for one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  Loved it!
Good murder mystery. Definitely wanted to read and finish it. If you like this genre you will like this book.
A great, fast-paced read that keeps you off-kilter--just like the "girl on the train"--until the end.
Thrilling, fast paced, and kept me guessing until the end.  This was the Best book I've read since Gone Girl.
Really reeled me in. A bit confusing at first but I really got into it and had me guessing through most of it
The book was very mixed up, did not know what exactly was going on till the end.  Did not keep me interested.
Grabs you from page 1. Twists and turns to the end. A great read. Highly recommend this book. Read in 4 days.
Somewhat predictable though the pacing was good and the interweaving narration was interesting. I enjoyed it.
There were lots of twists...reminds me of Gone Girl. Kept you guessing until almost the very end of the book.
It was an interesting portrayal of 3 different woman and their reactions to making choices due to their pasts
The story is hard to follow at times when each chapter is written from a different character's point of view.
A real page turner. Gets you involved with the characters so you can't wait to find out how it all turns out.
It was a good story, but the foul language could have easily been left out and it would have been much better
A very intersting plot written in a style that, while not unique, is attractive to the reader and interesting
If you are a Gone Girl fan, you will probably like this.  I didn't, and I didn't really like this one either.
Excellent, couldn't put it down! Similar to Gone Girl with lots of twists and turns. The last page is great!!
Fantastic. A real page turner. Interesting main character and a good mystery. Would read more by this author.
A nice quick read and good suspense as well as believable characters. I liked the romance of the train theme.
Good read, a little slow at first, but 1/3 in and I couldn't put it down. Definitely a mystery worth reading.
This book was great! Kept me guessing all the way to the end! Great read! You won't be disappointed, promise!
Congrats to Paula Hawkins.<br/><br/>Excellent story. Terrific dialogue. Extremely visual. A must read book.
Just when you think you've figured it out there is another twist. Quick fun read for a spring break vacation!
I could not put this book down. It was amazing! Suspenseful in all the right pages. I would highly recommend!
Couldn't put it down!!! From the first page to the last!  Very glad your book club chose it this time around.
Great book. Could not put it down.  Was holding my breath through some parts an  did not even stop to notice!
Really enjoyed this book; quick read; didn't want to put it down and finished in two days.  Highly recommend.
Really enjoyed this book but ending rather far-fetched but still had me guessing nearly to the end who dunnit
Was not sure at beginning where it was going.  Keep reading. Great suspenseful story.  Could not put it down.
Booked dragged and had a good ending but tried to be as good as gone girl by Gillian Flynn but was ot as good
If you liked Gone Girl, you will LOVE The Girl on the Train. In fact, Of the two books, this one is the best.
I could not put this book down! I literally read it in a day! Each chapter I became more and more enthralled.
Don't pick this book up if you are not ready to read it through to the end! You won't be able to put it down.
This book was great! It was full of suspense, twists, and turns, I was sad when it ended. I Highly recommend!
Book kept me interested, wanting to read more. I felt the ending was a little short but I would recommend it.
Couldn't put this book down. Riveting. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I can highly recommend this book.
Such  an intriguing and enveloping book!<br/>I was so disappointed when it ended!<br/>I recommend this book
A little confusing and difficult to stay on topic.  However, gets more clear and interesting in the 2nd half.
I always enjoy novels where I can't really guess the "who done it" question.  This book fit the bill.
I liked the first few chapters, but figured out the plot about half way into the book, which disappointed me.
Started slow to me but soon wrapped me up and I couldn't put it down. Twisted, dense, emotional and riveting.
This book was interesting.  It was a little too reminiscent of Gone Girl but all in all I would recommend it.
Once it got started and I knew she was flipping back and forth, it was very good. I would recommend the book.
Girl on the train was recommended by a friend and I was a little confused in the beginning but it got better.
Not as good as I thought it would be very after reading the reviews very disappointing would not recommend it
Hated all of the characters and guessed the ending. I didn't highlight a single phrase of good writing style.
One of the best books that I have read in a long time.  From start to finish it keeps you guessing who did it
It is a wonderful read!! Not disappointed at all never seen some of the stuff coming. Great and easy to read.
I couldn't put the book down! The author writes with a flare for suspense that I haven't seen in a long time.
Yes, it's a page-turner, and as so many reviewers before me have said, the characters are wooden and generic.
Simply one of the best written novels I've read. I loved the plot twists and turns and could not put it down.
Well crafted with an ending you will not guess even when you are in the last few pages.  Don't miss this book
Really enjoyed it!  A real page turner and very exciting.  Very well written and I couldn't put it down! ....
a great book to read very well written. suspenseful all the way until the end. I recommended it to everyone.
I didn't know who did it until I was 90% finished. Very interesting. I will recommend to others. Ccccc ccccc
Good story.  I kept wanting to know more and to figure out who the "bad" guy was.  Good ending also.
ALTERNATES BETWEEN MANY CHARACTERS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS.<br/>VERY DEPRESSING OFF AND ON THROUGHOUT THE BOOK.
I couldn't put it down!  It kept me guessing the whole time.  I'll be looking for more books by this author.
Interesting enough to finish the story, but hard to believe this is a multi week New York Times best seller.
AWESOME BOOK!!! I stayed up all night and read the entire book in one night because I could not put it down.
Amazing story. At the end the way she writes what is happening makes you feel like your sitting right there.
Very fun read! ! Highly recommend and will keep you guessing until the end.  Reading the companion book now.
A drunk with a fantasy life. From the reviews I was expecting a great book, disappointed. Very slow to start
Loved this book! Hard to put down! Great psychological thriller! Hope she comes up with another one, & soon!
Great Writing Style. Story pulls you in at the start.  Will definitely be looking for more from this author.
Well written. An amazing thriller that keeps you wanting to read. You can't put this book down. A must read.
Great summer read---thoroughly engaging and a good romp.  Not as good as "Gone Girl", but enjoyable.
I liked the pace of this book and the way she switched from character to character.  I read it very quickly.
It was a good book. Not what I was expecting but good. A lot of messed up people live along the train route.
the book had good storyline, very few characters and Rachel could have drank lesser than what was portrayed!
I thought it was 200 pages too long. Lots of repetition The inclusion of the red headed man was innecessary.
A little draggy in spots, but quite a twister. You're never sure who to believe or trust. A really good read
Hard to put down, kept me guessing throughout! If you are looking for a great next book to read, this is it.
Great read. I enjoyed all the twists and turns. Had me up Kate several nights! I highly recommend this nook.
Reminded me a bit of Gone Girl. It's really heavy at times but I definitely recommend and enjoyed this book.
I found the first few chapters intriguing but then got rather bored and found the final scenes unbelievable.
Loved it. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to get yo the ending s o bad. Well written and good story.
If you're looking for a good suspenseful story then this is it. Kind of like Gone Girl with a better ending!
Would have given it five stars except for the fact that there were a few loose ends that were not addressed.
A good read. sometimes  moved a little slowly but kept my interest and there were some surprises at the end.
From the first page I was hooked. It is the kind of book you can't wait to finish and do not want it to end!
It was confusing keeping track of which person was speaking / telling the story until halfway thru the book.
Good book. Difficult to stay connected if you didn't read for a week or so. If read daily, much better flow.
Meh. I was a big fan of "Gone Girl," but I had figured this one out before I got to the twist. Yawn.
This was a great read, a bit slow in places but thrilling none the less, definitely would recommend the book
ending with a twist.. but all of the characters had the same "voice"... so hard to distinguish them.
I really like the way this book was written. It keeps you guessing until the end.....I couldn't put it down!
There was a little surprise at the end, but otherwise didn't keep my attention and was a little slow to read
A bit slow in some places.  I prefer a book with a bit more quick action.  First half  better than 2nd half.
A gut wrenching thriller that's twists and twists some more. Even when you least expect it to. A great read.
I really enjoyed learning how all of the characters interact with each other.  Very surprised by the ending.
I couldn't put it down and the ending was incredible. This must be a definite addition to your reading list.
I didn't like the characters!  The book is very over rated and plot similar to a Hitchkock film of year ago.
Was almost like reading gone girl. If it wasn't  for the last chapter it wouldn't  even have rated one star.
It was suspenseful and kept you guessing until the end.  It was clearly written and I loved the plot twists!
An inside experience of the life of individuals in the novel .  always interesting to go inside their lives.
Loved. Could not put this book down. I've been done with it for over a month and still think about it daily.
What a great book!  I knew nothing about it and I'm glad I didn't.  The twists made this a real page turner.
Don't waste your time, unless you want to read the ramblings of a drunk feeling supremely sorry for herself.
I loved this book. Suspenseful until the very end. Going to look for more books by the same author. So good.
It definitely kept my attention.  I kept reading to find out who did it as there were lots of possibilities.
It's a fast read, suspenseful, fun twists. Never quite sure where or who you are. Great beach read for sure.
Not my favorite book. I never felt attached to the characters and often felt frustrated throughout the book.
Thank you Paul Hawkins for leaving me emotionally crippled, two days on end.<br/><br/>Very good read<br/>❤
I really enjoyed the book, I liked how the author told the story through different characters point of view.
Well written and a modern drama on life today. Kept you reading to the end, well worth a read on a cold day.
A great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Great summer read that will keep you guessing.
A clear modern style deliveries a story about control, lust and love. Someone does die, the question is why?
Didn't like it as much as anticipated from reviews.  Took a long time to get into the story.  Whiney heroine
Very good from start to finish. Enough twists to engage. Not over the top. Just an easy and worthwhile read.
Very interesting, it took me a couple of pages to get how the story was being told, but glad I kept reading!
This book keeps you going right until the very last sentence. You won't regret buying this book for a second
An engrossing story. I'll recommend it to my friends. That's the true measure of a book after all, Isn't it?
Original, inventive, puzzling book that explores the thought processes around a suburban woman's bleak life.
Certainly not uplifting.  Had no sympathy for any of the characters. Took a while to understand who was who.
Not quite as action packed as I hoped. Very slow at lots of points. I had a hard time getting into the book.
It was interesting but disappointing. The storyline often dragged and the characters weren't at all likable.
It took a few chapters to put the characters together, but after that didn't want to put it down. Good read.
Didn't know the killer to near the end.  Let me reading.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes a good tale
A little slow in the beginning, but great character twists. Loved it. I will look for more from this author.
I did not get anything else done because I couldn't stop reading until I got to the end.  Excellent read ! !
It was a true psychological mystery. A little monotonous at points, but not enough to stop you from reading.
A beautiful story - weaving the plot from the point of view of several characters.  I couldn't put it down!!
A bit confusing at first, but once the characters are sorted out it's a captivating rush towards the ending.
Hasn't arrived yet, but eagerly awaiting its arrival.  Sounds like a good storyline from the reviews I read.
Could NOT put this book down.<br/>It is a wild ride from first page to last.  I highly recommend this book.
Great weird twisted story. I couldn't put it down once the action started. 4-5 stars I would rate this book.
Very interesting and it held my attention all the way to the end. I love the little twists in the story too.
I thought it was rather boring and somewhat predictable.  A  few twists.but generally irritating characters.
There are some suspenseful moments, but it is not fast-paced throughout.  The plot slows down before ending.
Very interesting read love the different point of views.<br/>At first I wasn't sure but in the end loved it
Wanted so much for the lead character to come out on top....so you will need to read the book to find out???
Very slow starting. Confusing in some ways. Toward the end you can't put it down. The ending was a surprise.
I loved this book!!  Very easy read and I was hooked right away!!! I just had to know "who done it"!
It was a bit of a boring book and took awhile until the plot really thickened. I am a bit disappointed in it
Great book!<br/>It kept me on the edge of my seat. Highly recommended! I loved it! Can't wait to read more.
I loved the story line, a book I didn't want to put down. I love books with more then one side of the story.
I couldn't  stop reading this. It had me on the edge of my seat. I thought I had it figured out, but nooooo!
Great story, fine development of characters.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a page turner.
It is a page turner! I strongly recommend reading it. Do not anyone tell you about the book before you read.
Not my usual choice. I found it confusing in spots and did not really get into it as I do in most mysteries.
Girl on the train was a book you couldn't wait until the end. You were never sure of the outcome. Very good.
This is a great book which keeps you in the dark until pretty much the end! Great story, extraordinary told!
Great Book .I couldn't put this book down! A good ending that is somewhat surprising. I recommend this book!
If you like murder mysteries, if you liked the book "Gone Girl," you may indeed enjoy this as much as I did.
Not a book for me. I didn't finish it. Too much alcohol abuse. Several women friends and my wife enjoyed it.
Fast read and a great plot. Better than Gone Girl for sure. I'll be looking for more books from this author.
Quick read. You don't always love the characters but it's nice to see them change and develp over the story.
I have not completed "Girl on a Train" yet, but so far am loving it.  I just need more time to read.
The beginning pulled me in but then it bogged down with a few too many details. The ending had a nice twist!
I would have liked the book much better if I had cared for at least one person in the novel.  A real downer.
Great story with a lot of twists.<br/>Not the usual read!<br/>Will look for more stories by Paula Hawhins.
It was O.K., but no "Gone Girl".  I thought it was slow taking off and took a long time to get good.
This book really is a page-turner.  One of the better books I have read in a long time.  Highly recommended!
This was no way as good as Gone Girl.  Too much discussion on main character's depression and panic attacks.
This is a good read.  You will find the ending to be exactly what everyone deserves.  I highly recommend it.
This book kept me hanging on to find out what actually happened.  It has a surprise ending I did not expect.
You won't like the characters and what they do, but it is a good story.  Reminded me of "Gone Girl".
The first chapter was a little ho hum.  But it picked up after that and became a hard to put down good read!
A well written, fast reading study of human nature in a mix of interesting characters with a crime to solve.
Very easy to read with many twists and turns making for an exciting read. Thoroughly enjoyed the suspension.
Excellent read. Couldn't put it down until the very end, and how unexpected the end was... I love this book!
Keeps you guessing the entire time. I don't usually like these types of books but I loved it!! Awesome book.
This book held my attention until the last few pages.  Great read!  I will be telling my friends to read it.
I loved this book.  It held my attention from the very beginning.  Paula Hawkins is a wonderful storyteller.
This is a well-crafted story. An interesting mystery - well worth the read. At times is it true page turner-
Twist after twist a really great read! The girl on the train leaves you happy Rachel can finally have peace.
Interesting plot ..kept my interest ..finished the book in one day..Felt the pain and joy of each character.
Read this for my book club. Not my normal book but a great one. A little dark but that is,what draws you in.
I was disappointed in this book after all the hype.  I found the characters shallow and the story contrived.
Would give this book four and a half stars.  There were times when I couldn't put the book down!  Good read.
I couldn't put it down. This was one of those stay up all night reading stories. A "book" hangover for sure.
A great read  a real roller coaster ride from the begining to the end. Full of intrigue and mystery. Awesome
this story moves along quickly and kept me wanting to know who did it while not wanting it to end. xcellent.
I found it difficult to read this book because it was so upsetting. I could only read a few pages at a time.
Well written, suspenseful, and read this book in one day as it wouldn't let me put it down! Highly recommend
Very interesting concept/approach. Lots of twists and turns.  I did not expect the ending.  My kind of book.
Very interesting concept...kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it was going to end....loved it
I'm not much of murder mystery reader but this one is worth reading. Keeps you wondering and guessing wrong.
A quite engaging thriller.  I enjoyed it for what it is, but although well done, it is not great literature.
Engaging and entertaining. Much more enjoyable than Gone Girl  to which Girl on the Train has been compared.
Did not expect much from reading the first few chapters.  Glad I stuck with it, a definite four star rating.
Poorly written. All the females feel the same, say the same, in the guise of a mystery. Mildly entertaining.
Enjoyed this book.  Keeps you interested until the last page. Sorry it had to end. Can't wait for the movie.
Best Book in a long time. Never saw that coming. It kept me wondering the entire book. Loved the entire book
This was a very good read with lots of twists and turns. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good thriller.
The twists, the turns!  Best book I have read in ages!  Well done - I was sad when I finished the last page!
This book kept my interest from the  first page and everything tied together so well at the end. Great book!
I was totally captivated by this book.  I couldn't put it down.  Will look for other books from this Author.
I absolutely<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this book. I have been recommending it to anyone who will listen!
Only a woman could write this fiction.  This include, for the readers, orientation resistant chapter naming.
At first I had to be accepting of one of the characters weaknesses. But then I really enjoyed it. Fast read.
Good read! I believe most women will identify with the characters and what life can do. I enjoyed this book.
This book will have you on the edge of your seat, many twists and turns! I don't want to give anything away!
I could NOT put this book down, nor could I figure it out until the very end!  BRAVO. Unbelievable suspense!
I read this book in 3 days. Like riding on a train, with few stops in between.<br/>It was an amazing story.
A must read!! The twists and turns will suck you in, and if your like me you won't be able to put it down!!!
I really enjoyed this book. Kept me interested until the end. I loved Gone Girl and it's definitely similar.
what a great book I felt like I was on Amtrak or commuter train and I couldn't I didn't want the book to and
Better than Gone Girl....kept the suspense to the end.  Couldn't put it down.  Highly recommended must read!
This book was really good it held your interest never a dull moment.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
This book was a real mystery with a twist at the end. I usually can figure out the ending but not this time.
Good read,  didn't know who did the deed til near the end.  Hard to figure out, could have been any of them.
,Enjoyed the book. Kept my interest and finished in a week, usually it takes me weeks.  Similar to gone girl
Read this book in 2 days!!! It is very well written and highly recommended. Couldn't put it down! Great read
A good read with lots of twists and turns... very similar to Gone Girl in that regard. Overall, I recommend!
Very disappointed in this book, After being on the best seller list for so long I thought it would be good.
Kept my interest from beginning to end.  I bought it cause it was so well reviewed and was not disappointed
This book kept my attention through to the end. I was surprised. It had a few twists and turns. A fun read.
Did not want to put it down.  I don't usually read mysteries but this one held my interest to the last page
A good read...very similar to other books. I quickly figured out who did what, but it was still surprising.
Great read...kept me on my toes and guessing at the outcome.  Can't wait to see the film when it comes out.
Slow start in first quarter, not much tension building but gained as it went along.  Last 1/4 was very good
Confusing but very good. Surprised it was Tom. I would read more of her novels. Couldn't put the book down.
Nice story and well written. The book makes you change the way you feel towards the characters in the book.
It was a very intriguing story, with a lot of twist and turns.  It kept me interested through out the book.
This is an easy to read mystery that keeps you guessing. I like the fact that the main character is flawed.
A little derivitative of Gone Girl.  Most of the characters were not very likeable which was disappointing.
Couldn't put this book down. It has a few slow spots but overall a great read. I would recommend to anyone.
Wow! Suspenseful, lots of twists and turns, a real page turner. One of the best books I've read in a while.
Strong start. Ending is predictable at about 70% but still a good read. Strength was character development.
Loved the audio book version...I did not want it to end, loved the narrators and the story. Very well done!
Good thriller and a fast read. You don't know who's telling the truth but that's what a thriller does best.
This book was okay. It was a little slow, picks up toward the end. After while it was somewhat predictable.
This book was recommended to me by a couple of people and I saw it on a good reads list. It was intriguing.
I found it very slow and a bit tedious until the last few chapters. Nice ready but now Wow, like I was told
Very suspenseful! This story has an unexpected ending. I couldn't put it down. Complex characters, too.
Good story plot, but I figured the killer was who it was half way through the story. But good read overall.
The book keeps you guessing and on your toes.  You want to devour each page as you turn them to the ending.
Very confusing and have no idea what the end really was.  Everyone I know that read it said the  same thing
Finished this book in 2 days. Though I didn't see it coming, it was definitely a little too neatly tied up.
This is book is one of the quickest reads. The story will draw you in and you won't be able to put it down.
this book kept you on your toes!  Couldn't put it down. It was amazing how all 3 women were so intertwined.
I would highly recommend this book. It was very interesting. It kept me on the edge all the way to the end.
It was a gripping story, really enjoyable. One of those that leaves one feeling sorry when it is all ended.
I found this book kind of confusing to read.  Constantly changing the character that was telling the story.
I finished this in just a couple days. Great book for the pool or vacation! A little bit depressing though.
Very interesting concept and I enjoyed the readers and their personalities.  It was a very good audio book.
Took a bit to grasp the characters but didn't take long before I was fully engrossed! Nice twist at the end
A must read!!  Loved this book so much I finished it in two days!!!  You will not regret reading this book!
Enjoyed the story .... and the writing ... good flow, kept me interested.<br/>I would recommend this book.
I couldn't put it down and finally a book has lived up to the hype. It is an edge-of-your seat thrill ride.
This story really shocked me. It took awhile to get things sorted out, but when I did the story is amazing.
Read this on vacation.  Interesting book.  The ending was a little implausible but hey, it's fiction right?
The plot was little slow to get started, but halfway in the book the suspense began to build.<br/>,<br/>,
I found the plot interesting for the most part , with a few slow spots. It did surprise me with the ending.
Great tale, just hard to get into it, but once your halfway through, it's a great train ride until the end!
Great narrative and plot. No surprises, but that did not take away from the motivation to continue reading.
I thought that I knew where the plot was going but it took an unexpected turn!  I really enjoyed this read!
This book was difficult to get into, but really just an ok read.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
I stayed up late on weeknights to keep reading.  Rare for me.<br/>Could have been better...but, very good.
Book club loved this book.  All 12 members thought best book read lately.  Kept us guessing until very end.
Loved this book from beginning to end, could not put it down, looking forward to more! A must read for all.
Great novel and kept you reading to the end.  I do like mysteries.  Loved the alternating person narrative.
The book was good but it was slow getting started and the alcoholic  part was a little overdone I thought .
Best book I have read this year. A real "Hitchcock" type story with ending that will blow you away.
Not much to say... just not that interesting or suspenseful - pretty easy to figure out from the beginning.
Just ok.  Not sure why I didn't love this I just thought it was a little boring.  Only the ending was good.
I felt the first couple of chapters were a little slow but once I got into the book I couldn't put it down.
I liked this book very much.  I sort of guessed the end before it was the end, but it was very well written
Outstanding book. This book was recommended to me and it did not disappoint.  Would totally recommend this.
Many surprises along the way.  The story was intense and it was difficult to put the book down.  Loved it!!
I thought this was so much better than Gone Girl! It kept you reading in suspense all the way till the end!
LOVED this book, full of surprises !<br/>I thought I had the story figured out but it keeps you guessing !
I liked that I couldn't figure this book out until the very end.  Has some twists like the novel Gone Girl.
Took me a bit to get hooked, but then I couldn't stop. Easy, entertaining read - very similar to Gone Girl.
Hard to put down, once this murder mystery starts to unravel, you can't help but want to know..who dun it!!
Great book that keeps you guessing until the very end! Very easy to read and makes you think at every turn.
Made you think all through the story about  all people  she was thinking about and how they where involved.
great writer, love the twists and turns. The writer has a wonderful talent and I hope to see more from her!
Good read but not on par with gone girl, nevertheless a story worth exploring, but not quite my cup of tea.
Great novel - slow to start but once it picks up, the story will keep you guessing. Somewhat Gone Girl-esq.
I chose this as a recommendation if I liked Gone Girl. I thought this was better. Good story. Good writing.
A little Ruth Rendellish , but still doesn't cut it, but  worthy of a read.  You sympathise  with the women
While a bit confusing at first, this builds to a taut and scarily satisfying conclusion.  Highly recommend!
The last half of this book had me hooked. Never stop guessing, this book takes you on many twists and turns
Couldn't put it down, one of those novels where you have to keep going, have to find out what happens next.
This was a great book from beginning to end. It lives up to the expectations and kept me guessing. Read it!
Fast pace book.  Easy to read.  Slow for the fist few chapters, but picks up after that.  Highly recommend.
A good read. Honestly I'm a bit disappointed at the very end of the book, but I enjoyed the book very much.
Page turning... Worth reading. A film is going to be made of this book. I hope it will be true to the book!
This nook was very good! Kept my interest and made me not want to put it down. I highly recommend this book
Good read, good twists. Up to the end keeps you interested in what's going to happen to all the characters.
I thought this book started out slow but once the story started unfolding I had difficulty putting it down.
Very gripping book! It took a few chapters in to get really into it, but once I did I couldn't put it down!
Highly recommend for people who love a crazy story. The ending was a surprise and showed the power of women
Loved this book! So good that I couldn't put it down. Every page brought new twists . . . It was addicting!
Intriguing book! It kept me on my toes. Great twist. I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend reading it!
Quick and easy read, couldn't put the book down!  I liked how the author split up the "chapters" by people.
Loved it! Parts were hard to follow because of the jumping around in dates but other than that it was great
Predictable, a good summer 'beach read'.  Not for book clubs--too typical of other books of the same genre.
A real page turner. Similar to Gone Girl. A quick read. Nice British flavor if that's appealing to you all.
For me the book had a slow start then picked up halfway through.  Seemed to be Gone Girlish.  Worth a read.
Do yourself a favor and read this book! If you like gone girl, you'll love this!! Lots of twists and turns.
Compelling read.  Did a good job keeping you involved in the story line and also guessing as to the outcome
I wanted to know the out come. It was riveting but I disliked all the character  they were weak, sad people
I liked it but felt some things seamed a little far fetched.  I liked it well enough to finish it, however.
It was a really good book, a little slow and repetitive getting through it, but it was worth it in the end.
Great story.  Mystery until the very end.  Interesting way the story unfolds from different points of view.
The Girl On The Train has a Great plot. It was Immensely entertaining! It had me guessing up until the end!
Hard to keep it down, very entertaining, fast paced, few places can be far fetched but overall a good one!!
Unusual narration creates a unique story telling method. I read this book in 5 hours unable to put it down.
Loved it, kept me coming back every chance I could.  Finished quickly because it was very hard to put down!
I couldn't put it down. The characters kept evolving and I needed to know what came next. Great story line!
The book was a little confusing at first, but it was a great story and quick read! Will make a great movie!
Better than Gone Girl, in my opinion. Great story, hard to put down, good to the very end! Highly recommend
This mystery keeps you guessing from start to finish. Told from the perspective of three different women, all of whom see events from vastly different perspectives, you're never quite sure if you're hearing the voice of a victim or a criminal At the center of the novel is Rachel, who rides the train every day and has created a vivid fantasy life for a couple she sees from the window at a train stop When the woman disappears, fantasy blurs with reality and makes for engrossing reading. Even though I did not really like any of the characters, I could not put the book down.
I enjoyed reading this book, but I'm not quite sure that it lives up to all of the hype it keeps getting. The story is well written, and keeps readers guessing right up to the last few chapters, but I can't help but feel slightly underwhelmed with the ending. Is as though you wait to have this sense of "OMG I didn't see that coming! What a great plot twist!", but instead it was more of a "Oh that's where they decided to go with this.  . . Ok then". I still give this book 4 stars, because it was an enjoyable read, but don't expect it to rock your world.
Reading the "girl on the train" was intriguing to say the least, seeing someone go through life believing that they are no good until they found out things were not what they seem to be. Now take Rachel for instant, going around letting everyone think she had a job, traveling on a train every single day, just to keep herself amused not sure; however she got herself into something that led to her finding out the man she married was pure evil and would go as far as killing someone to keep his secret. This was a good thriller to say the least, pretty good read.
I was expecting better.  It was okay, but I had it figured out early and I don't generally read mysteries.
page turner. very well done examining self loathing and shame of a drinker. ending was a bit of a let down
This book was very hard to put down. I was kept guessing for a long time. Do you ever really know someone?
It started a little slow to me but I was eventually hooked.  I wanted to keep reading to know the outcome.
kinda saw it coming. fun read but what's with all these books needing to have "Girl" in the title.
Could not put it down! It was Great read!! Not what I expected but better. Wish it would have been longer.
A good read! kept me on edge and couldn't put it down. Loved the twist at the end and didn't see it coming
Fast paced, suspenseful and a twist I didn't quite see coming. A lot of fun. Can't wait for her next book!
in short, it was really good .. kept me interested & wanting to read more but there wasn't that BIG twist.
Could not put it down. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a page turner. It will keep you guessing.
I feel she could have written the same book with half the words.  I enjoyed it, but it was a bit too long.
Kept me guessing the whole time...great read! You won't want to put it down- even for a bowl of ice cream.
I enjoyed the book and it kept my attention until the end. I couldn't figure out what was going to happen.
I was so confused in the beginning of the timeline and the main characters. It ended up just as suspensefu
The ending totally sucks.  You can totally see it coming, and it's so stupid.  I hope the movie is better.
This is a really good read. I like the portrayal of most characters and transitioning seems like the best.
Meh - not great.  Not sure what all the excitement is about.  Average writing.  Characters not compelling.
Fast read that will please fans of Gone Girl and mysteries in general. Not too gory or scary, just enough.
This book was captivating and keeps you guessing until the end.  I wish I could find books as good easily.
I couldn't put the book down in the same way I couldn't put down Gone Girl. Exciting twists along the way.
The lead character, Rachel, was overwhelming and inviting at the same time. I could not put the book down.
A little slow in the beginning, but once you get into it, it becomes one of those books you can't put down
Great suspense read. I would recommend this book. Finished in a day because I had to find out who done it.
An excellent read, with plot twists right up to the end. I could not put it down once I started this book!
This book was difficult to put down.  I would have never guessed the ending.  A good job for a new author.
I did not like this book as it was very confusing which character was talking. It was a slow reading book.
I loved this book. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. I've been recommending it to my friends.
Wow.  Rather dark intense story.  You never know who did it until the end.  Hard to put down..  good read.
All I can say is that it was a great read and highly recommend it. Can't wait for Paula Hawkins next book.
I know The Girl on the Train has gotten rave reviews, but when you get right down to it, it's a boring read.  I would not recommend it.
the girl on the train was such a great read! Hope it'll be a movie one day. Very suspenseful and dramatic.
I could not put this book down and almost finished it in one sitting! Really pulls you in to the very end.
This story has great twists and turns. This will keep you reading late into the night, with the lights on!
It starts a little slow but it picks up and is so good. You think you have it figured out but you won't!!!
struggled to get through it.  not my favorite.  the story tried too hard and wasn't fulfilling in the end.
It keeps you wanting to read because of the twists and turns. I wouldn't call it great literature however.
Like twists and turns and you think you have it figured out but you don't? Then you will like this one....
Fast and furious. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.Fast read, perfect movie material. Go on, go read it.
It was a good read for vacation. I enjoyed the suspense and the story told from<br/>Three points of view.
Much like "Gone Girl", this book was a page turner! Kept me on the edge of my seat! I highly recommend it.
Awesome read. Couldn't put it down and written so well kept you wondering until the end. Highly recommend.
I found it a little dull at the beginning and about 2/3 of the way into the book it got better and better.
I found the characters very depressing. Action slow. Didn't enjoy the book at all until about 3/4 through.
Changing narrators and time frames were confusing at first. But I did enjoy the book - a fast read for me.
The book was really good. I thought there was a lot of deranged personage so I was surprise by the ending.
Loved it.  Couldn't put down.  Will recommend to all of my friends.  Would make a good movie too. Top ten.
Best book I've read in a while. Couldn't put it down.<br/>Loved the way it had me guessing the whole time
The Girl on The Train is a fantastic look into the common unrighteous judgment we often have about others.
Spectacular book!  Once I started reading it I was so hooked I finished it in 2 day's!  Very engrossing :)
If you like suspenseful books/stories, then this is the book for you.  I couldn't put it down.  Excellent.
Doesn't keep you interested and it becomes confusing by switching back and forth with different characters
Starts out great but the ending was expected-and it was to much like trying to have the style of Gone Girl
Slow at first but then I couldn't put it down. Great twist at the end. Excellent choice for the book club.
Never goes where you anticipate and overall a great read but I had to work to get through the first pages,
gripping novel that alternates from analysis of mental instability to a murder mystery. Great plot twists.
Not what I expected, but better! can't say too much because I don't want to spoil it, just read this book!
Dysfunctional, unlikable characters.  By the end I didn't care who had committed the crime.  Don't bother.
Linear and sequential as opposed to the back and forth of Gone Girl.  Easier to follow, but just as dark!!
If you loved Gone Girl you will love this one. The story keeps you guessing until the very last few pages.
Weird story; modeled a bit on Gone Girl.  Not a likeable character in the book; last 25% is worth reading.
I couldn't put the book down. The pieces all fit together so well and always left me wanting more to read.
This is so originally l.  keeps you guessing through  out. premise is s o real. you will enjoy this read .
Ok book, I had high expectations because I heard it was sooo good. It was okay. Not great, but a fun read.
I just had to keep reading this book, couldn't put it down. I don't know why but I didn't see that coming.
It was very well written, believable, fast moving, the characters well fleshed out. I highly recommend it.
I read a sample of the book and I was hooked. It pulls you in slowly but completely. Well drawn out story.
Well written but hard to read. Depressing. Had to read in short bits to get through it. Not my cup of tea.
The Girl on the Train was a pretty good book. It kept my interest which is the most important thing to me.
Characters confusing at first, but once you get into book it becomes clearer.  Ending a complete surprise.
Everybody was identifying this book with Gone Girl.  This book was better, more imaginitive and realistic.
Fast paced and interesting plot. If you liked gone girl you will enjoy this as some similarities in style.
A thrilling read that kept you on your toes on what would happen next. I would highly recommend this book.
Liked this book, middle gets tedious but the end is definitely worth the read!  It would be a great movie.
I could not stop reading this book! The characters felt so real. It is a must read! Highly recommended! :)
The last 20 percent of the book were really good, the first 80 were slow, but overall, it was a nice read.
Complex relationships throughout the novel, but written in an easy to understand style.  Highly recommend.
Book was a good read on the train that I take to work. Made me think some about my mode of transportation.
Excellent story - hard to keep track of the dates when reading on a Kindle! Much same format as Gone Girl.
Ignored my family for the day t o read this mystery, very engaging and well written with plenty of twists!
Whew!  There were so many liars and so many lies, it was difficult to discern exactly where the truth lay.
Could not put it down!  A must read & perfectly written.  Every page kept you in suspense through the end!
It jumped back and forth in time a lot, made it a tad confusing. Good story and enjoyed the main character
Very suspenseful. I couldn't put it down. Had an exciting end with lots of twists and turns along the way.
Very suspenseful! Did not want to put it down.  Twists and turns till the end! Reminded me of "Gone Girl".
Interesting, with a spin to the ending of the story, helped pass the time driving 1 hour to and from work.
A compelling story, so much so there is a movie in the works. Interesting first person narrative that ultimately became as irritating as trying to communicate with a falling down drunk, which is undoubtedly what the author intended for the reader. Hmm. I found myself skipping passages to save myself yet another section of the protagonist's mind-numbing self-pity. But, I did want to know who done it, so I stumbled to the inebriated ending as sobering as it was.<br/>I do think it will make a good movie, though changing it to New York instead of London is not so good.
I enjoyed how each chapter was about each character. The end was not what I expected and really liked it.
A good story, confusingly told. The characters are strong but the story is predictable at 2/3 completion.
Great read....kept me guessing until the very end. However it's a book with which you must pay attention!
Not a real surprise but a surprise none the less  It was a quick read and didn't get bored with the plot.
great suspense! I enjoyed this one. it was a bookclub book - finished in a few days, couldnt put it down!
The story line was very good, however, after a while the characters all seemed too pathetic for my taste.
Takes the idea of someone passing on a train and actually meeting them. But it got a bit unreal at times.
Good read, although the protagonist is irritatingly weak.  Maintains the suspense almost to the very end.
Didn't take too long to get to the twists and turns.  Keeps you turning the pages.  I recommend to anyone
I didn't want to put it down!  I kept guessing and was still surprised by the ending. Well written story.
It started out pretty slow and then it was a predictable in the end. Still worth the read though I think.
I thought it was a bit slowin the beginning...but then it really picked up and didn't want to put it down
I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was very well written and was definitely a book you hated to see end.
Very riveting.  I did not want to stop and the twists and turns were not predictable.  An excellent read.
Didn't want to put it down. The plot was sublime and I liked the way the book was written from 3 persons.
I enjoyed every moment. Mystery until the end. This was probably the fastest I've read a book in a while.
Good read. I forced myself to stay up late to read it. Just didn't want to put it down. Great characters.
Really could not put it down. Gripping with want twists and turns. If you like a good mystery this is it.
Nicely written, kept you entice throughout the book. The ending with a fine twist of plot was unexpected!
Book was written well enough, so that I had to finish it, but I hated all of the characters in the story.
It was slow in the beginning with the bouncing around of characters.  The ending was quite unpredictable.
I could not put this book down . Best book I read In Awhile ! Held my attention and had a surprise ending. I highly recommend this book and can not wait till the movie comes out.
excellent book..had to re read to catch the parts I got lost in..but a great thriller right up to the end
This book kept me on the edge of my seat waiting for the next twist and turn.  I enjoyed this quick read.
Couldn't get past the first paragraph, so feel free to discount my view. I rarely toss a book so quickly.
Great book!  Kept me interested & I enjoyed hearing the story from the different characters perspectives!
This poor girl spends her life on a train. A bit boring to read. That's all I have to say on the subject.
A masterful story with so many twists and turns it will keep you on your toes until the end of the story.
Interesting and complex plot and characters. I believed many were possible suspects. We'll crafted story.
It was alright. I was interested in finishing it to find out what happened, so what more can you ask for.
What is going on here?  Twists, turns, you never know what is coming.  I couldn't put it down!!  Read it!
Great book. Stay with it. You may find it difficult to get into, but once you are hooked, YOU ARE HOOKED!
Interesting story, but I found the amount of time given to the problem of alchol abuse a bit distracting.
I would highly recommend this book! I couldn't put it down. It kept me engaged with every chapter I read.
A novel filled with unlikeable characters, yet I couldn't put it down.  I wonder what they are up to now?
Each chapter was written by a different character in the first person.  Not my favorite style of writing.
On par with Gone Girl, kept me guessing until the end. Did not like the weak character of Rachel, though.
Amazing book.  You think it's predictable, but then it's not - over and over.  A really good (fast) READ.
I just didn't love it. Similar to Gone Girl with a more predictable plot. Good writing just not my style.
I can't think of anything to say but cliches: I couldn't put it down, captivating read, a must read, etc.
At first it was a bit confusing, the writing style. At the middle and end I just wanted to keep reading!!
Was a little bit confused in the beginning but as the book progressed I couldn't put it down! A must read
Book was a quick awesome read! I loved it! Tom was crazy! It made you think it was Rachel the whole time!
A bit hard to follow at the beginning, but got better with each page.  Twists and turns and great ending.
Finally a book I didn't want to put down.  Great book to read this summer.  5 stars.  Good for Bookclubs.
Had you from the beginning. Excellent book. Recommend it to all.  You will not want to put it down. Read.
Great read! I really enjoyed the mystery in it and the twist at the end.  It is Definitely worth reading.
Repetitive and at times confusing to follow and the better reading comes very<br/>Late in<br/>The book.
The book was a real page turner but I did't like any of the characters which made it sort less enjoyable.
Pedestrian writing.<br/>Unlikeable characters. Little twist at the end. Fine for a quick, mindless read.
Good book, a little long-winded in the middle, but it kept my interest and I was surprised by the ending.
Once you start reading you can not put the book down.  Highly recommend ! I was not expecting the ending!
Too jumpy and not believable. I'm disappointed that this is on a best seller list and that I paid for it.
Really gripping read although I felt it fell a bit at the end. Overall though its a brilliant page turner
Not a bad read but definitely not one of my favorites either. It was a good book to read while traveling.
Stay with it - you'll like it. Took me a while to realize there were different people speaking! Good read
It took a while to get into the book, but once all the characters were presented, could not stop reading.
Unexpected treat! First half of the book was great - the second I could not put down until I finished it.
Great book and fast read. I was on a cruise and at least half a dozen people were reading and discussing.
The book was moving and a thriller at the same time.<br/>I enjoyed the book for days after I finished it
A whodunit with a twist. Set in modern day London.  Gave a good description of English yuppie urban life.
I could not put this book down.<br/>The author picked you up and before you knew it you were on journey.
It had a surprising ending but the majority of the book was unpleasant and basically unenjoyable to read.
It's an entertaining book, but not as good as I expected it to be.  I guess that's the problem with hype.
Very similar to Gone Girl but I liked it better! Reminds you that things aren't always as they appear....
Wish there was more of an ending, but overall a very good read. If you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this.
This story kept me enthralled throughout. I enjoyed the way the story was told by the various characters.
Great book! Definitely a page turner. Author really got you to know the main character. It's a must read!
a good novel. Will want to read her other novels. She keeps you guessing. A good and upcoming new writer.
Easy to read but  I found it a little repetative and  solved the murder mystery  3/4 of way through book.
Dragged out the alcoholism theme at the beginning. Book finally picked up after getting half way through.
Very good book! Im not into mystery novels that much, but this was a real page turner. And unpredictable.
I couldn't put it down and I can't wait to see it as a film!! If you liked gone girl, you will love this!
Great read!  My mind was jumping all over the place as "who done it"!!!  Would make a good movie!
Thriller, smart and sad all in one. Nothing ho~hum about this book. Looking forward to Paula's next one!!
This is about a busybody. Who can't help but interfere in others lives. Found this book very frustrating.
I truly enjoyed this book.  I read most of it while driving home from a family trip.  Great story teller!
I really enjoyed this book. There was a lot of twists and turns to the story and an unpredictable ending.
If you liked Gone Girl you will love this book.  Many twists to keep you guessing all the way to the end.
I felt like the basic story could have been told in half the length of the book , felt a little redundant
It is a must read for mystery buffs.  Having been in England, I can relate to the setting and the trains.
Read it in one day, I loved it. Great Mystery. I recommend it to every mystery reader out there. 5 stars!
Dragged, have to say I skimmed at times.  I know this has gotten good reviews but I<br/>couldn't see it.
The story kept me on the edge of my seat....always wondering what Rachel actually saw. I read it one day!
Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Very suspenseful; had trouble putting it down.  Would highly recommend it.
Too introspective for my tastes.  Lot of soul-searching detail that could have benefitted by more action.
Great read. Hard to put down during the duties of my day. Hope to read many more novels from this writer.
Great page-turner.  Very entertaining, lots of twists and turns.  Women are the victims; men are violent.
How anybody can compare this to "Girl Gone"? It is very repetitious and really not very exciting.
Really a page turner.  Enjoyed each of the characters and enjoyed the plot development. Recommended read.
This was a true murder mystery. Kept you guessing right up until the end. I could not put this book down!
Loved every minute of this book. It kept drawing me in for more since the second I started! Well written.
So well written I could not put it down.  First book in a long time to pull me in to it's pages that way.
Very suspenseful in the line of Alfred Hitchcock, kept my attention, not Agatha Christie but a good read!
Compelling and a great mystery.  A really good read although the bouncing around time line got a bit old.
If you like Gone Girl, you will like this book. It is a psychological thriller, definitely a page turner.
Not a huge fan of murder mysteries but this one was pretty well written. I was disappointed in the ending
I thought this book was intriguing, but confusing. Too much jumping around of characters. Hard to follow.
Captivating read and a real page turner.  Enjoyed the way the story switches from character to character.
Twisty train ride.  Very creative story...not your same old "who done it" mystery.  Entertaining.
Giving this 3 stars as do not like dark, disturbing genre.  If that's your thing, you will love this book
It was a little difficult at first to keep on track, but once into the book it was very hard to put down.
This book kept my interest, it was a very easy fast read. Would like to read more books from this author,
An excellent read. It will probably be a movie sometime in the future. A very sympathetic main character.
I couldn't stop reading this book, it kept me in suspense up until the very end! Loved it and the ending!
It kept my interest.  I did not like the premise that a bad husband could turn a wife into an alchoholic.
It was an intriguing read.  The main character was interesting and the novel kept my interest throughout!
One of the best books I've read since Gone Girl with a  surprise ending that will have you saying NO WAY!
Murder mystery written differently.  I like the perspective of the writer.  It kept me turning the pages.
A little long, but a good twist on the ending. Even though I'd figured it out by the end, it was gripping
I couldn't put it down. A real page turner. I enjoyed all the plot twists and trying to guess who did it.
A very interesting multi-layered thriller; not as Gone Girl as some reported, but still a very good read.
Best book I have read since Gone Girl.<br/>Engrossing from the first page. Loved it. A real who done it.
This book took a while to intrigue me, but once the plot picked up I couldn't put it down. It's certainly a catchy book. However, the writing did not impress me. I noticed multiple typos. I was peeved by the fact that despite using three different women to narrate the story, all of the characters seemed to share a the same vocabulary and and outlooks, making them less believable. I can't help to feel that the characters were one-dimensional and under-developed.<br/><br/>This is a fun read but it's like a "junk read" that you won't remember for long.
Terrible book
waste of time
Did not enjoy
Not worth it!
too confusing
Waste of time
Definitively a page turner!  Once I started the book I was unable to put it down.  The end surprised me.
It's reminiscent of "Gone Girl". I didn't find it a page- turner, but it was interesting enough.
Very good read. Keeps you going, you don't want to stop reading. Will have to check out her other books.
I found the beginning confusing and had to stick with it.  Then I couldn't put it down.  Very compelling
I couldnt put the book down. very well written. !!!! i woud recommend it to people who read all genre's.
This was the best book that I have read this year!  Very exiciting. Lots of swist and turns. Loved it!!!
This book was ok but I expected more. I was not surprised at the ending and I was a little disappointed.
This book never let up from start to finish - well written and very clever plot.  I highly recommend it.
A very Interesting read -- this train kept on track - intense and interest holding -- A real nail biter.
Excellent read! Fast paced, many twists and turns I didn't see coming. Great surprise ending. Must read.
Felt similar to Gone Girl, but not as complexly developed. Still liked it. Pretty heart-breakng overall.
I loved this story. I loved how the author showed the point of view from the three different characters.
The book started out a little slow for me, but I'm happy I stuck with it.  This is a good and easy read.
Loved this book kinda slow at first but after u get pass the 3rd chapter you won't want to put it down!!
It was pretty good. Not as good as the reviews made it seem however. The ending was a little surprising.
Awesome read!  Had ME Hooked From the very first chapter.  Great development of characters..a must read!
I couldn't put it down. riveting and suspenseful. Many times I can guess the plot. not so with this one!
5 characters, 3 witless women, 2 violent men, an alcoholic haze, unreliable narrators, cinematic ending.
This book was a great read! Had me guessing until the end! Will be a great discussion for our book club.
Good read with lots of twists & turns definitely kept my interest! It reminded me a little of Gone Girl.
I disliked all the characters and didn't enjoy reading the book but went on with it to find out the end.
If you like mysteries and thrillers in the realm of Gone Girl, then this book is definitely a must read.
Read was average. It took a while to get into and was a bit predictable. I did have to finish it though.
I really like this book, it is dark, depressing but highly recommended, I like the writer writing skills
I could not read this fast enough. And then I was so sad to get to the end. This was a really good read.
85% of the book was hard to follow; the ending made up to tie the loose end together. Overall fair->good
Read this on a rainy weekend.  Couldn't put it down.  A quick read and a plot that keeps you interested.
I very much enjoyed this book. It was a little darker than expected but still very enticing nonetheless.
I loved this story. Detailed. Intricate. Exciting.<br/>I read it in a weekend and couldn't put it down.
This is a story that will leave you sitting back in your chair. Not at all what I expected. Read it now.
I had looked forward to reading this after all my friends gave it a good review.  I wasn't disappointed.
This is an excellent book. It had me on edge and I was way into the book. This is one I would read again
Just wasn't my interest.  Not a fan of murder mysteries.  I didn't know that was the basis of the story.
Loved it. One of those you can't wait to get back to. Will be recommending to others who enjoy suspense.
Very enjoyable read.  It is hard to figure out who is responsible as several people could have 'done it'
I enjoyed this book. Suspensful to the end. Great ending. Well written. I imagine it is movie potential!
It was a light read. It wasn't especially intriguing but flowed well and kept my interest. I enjoyed it.
Fantastic read- I could not put this down. Wonderfully written page turner and lots of twists and turns.
Not quite sure why it is a NY Times best seller.  Got to be a bit repetetive, about 100 pages too long..
This book was pretty awesome,  with some surprising twists and turns at the end. I couldn't put it down.
it was the worst movie in1ve ever seen do me a favorite ,  the theming was the worst vie I've  ever seen
A bit confusing at first but then WoW!  Great read. It really grabs your attention.  Perfect beach read!
Held my interest until the very end.  I usually can figure out "who done it", but not this time.
Superb read. Fast paced with twist and turns. One of the best thriller that I have read in quite awhile.
We read this for book club. It was a fast paced thriller that keeps you wanting more. Great summer read!
I love books that I can't figure out the ending. This is one of those. Written very much like gone girl.
Lost of twist and turns ! Loved it! I want more I finished  it so quickly, I would recommend this to all
The story eventually grabbed me.  Thought it was a bit slow at first, but characters and action evolved.
People are comparing to Gone Girl but didn't think it was anything like it.  The book was a page turner.
Great read. I found it hard to put down. I compare it to "Gone Girl" which is another great book
Well crafted mystery. Best read in one or two sittings so that subtle but important points are not lost.
Page turner that kept my attention from beginning to end! New author to me but I'll be looking for more.
Bored. Main character is pitiful excuse for a person, went on with self- pity so long I gave up reading.
I just cannot stop reading and following the development of the intriguing  plot  !!! It's  fascinating,
Interesting concept, but last third was predictable.  Still an enjoyable read, and I would recommend it.
Couldn't put it down! Kept my interest from beginning to end. If you liked Gone Girl you will love this.
Interesting main character.  My only complaint is I would have liked her story to resolve a little more.
I liked that this book was one I just couldn't put down. Great characters, flawed and real. A good read.
Damn good novel.  If you like Gone Girl, it is quite possible that you will like this story even better.
It was a good story but I found it confusing as it kept switching characters. The ending was a surprise.
It's an OK read, but it kind of wonders. I had the feeling the author didn't know where to go with this.
Boring.  I read 100 pages and stopped.  It might have gotten better but I just could not read anymore...
Excellent novel that is engaging and suspenseful. The author is insightful to psychology of motivations.
It is definitely an engaging story. You realize things may not be as simple as they seem on the surface.
well written -- I hung in to the end to see whodunit -- just didn't like any of the characters very much
Very good.  Started a little slow with a lot of detail. But really picked up speed and was a great erad.
Interesting, insightful and well woven mystery.  For a while at first I did not see where we were going.
Very suspenseful, reminded me so much of a Hitchcock book. I could see this made into a movie! Loved it!
I enjoyed this book so much, I found myself dreaming about the characters after I'd finished reading it!
Such an easy read, good flow with a lot of suspense and a good story!<br/>I highly recommend this book.
dysfunctional characters, but you won't mind because the writing is good and the story will suck you in.
Moved around a lot. D I sent get interesting until near the end I have read m o 're interesting n novels
I read this book while on vacation and really enjoyed the light read. It kept me entertained throughout.
Slow, but after you got into it didn't want to put down because you wanted to know what really happened!
I didn't enjoy this as much as Gone Girl, to which this has been compared, but it was a solid, fun read.
Loved it.  Suspenseful, well written, thought the characters were very believable, couldn't put it down.
Love it!  Best read since Gone Girl!  Loved the writing; kept me interested from page one till the last!
At best it was a ok read.  For all its staying power on best sellers list, I simply can't understand why
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I couldn't wait to see how it turned out! I will read this author again!
Loved this book. Super easy read and I draws you in so quickly! It was dark and kept you second guessing
I didnt read this book but my wife did and she said it started slow but it picked up and she enjoyed it.
A very well written that kept me wanting to read way into the night. The ending was a complete surprise.
Book starts out kind of slow, but then hold on to your seat.  The ending is amazing.  Never expected it.
Many characters !  There were times when I would need to re-read /go back to keep myself on the track :)
First it was hard for me to follow the story but after a while it gripped me and I read it breathlessly.
I lost a whole days worth of work to read this book, I couldn't put it down! Suspenseful and satisfying.
Great Book!  I had a little trouble getting into the book -- but toward the end -- couldn't put it down.
Part of the book with Rachels head trip was to wordy but the last third of the  book was worth the read.
Well written with lots of twists and turns. Kept me up at night wanting to read more. You will enjoy it.
It keeps you wondering till the end! Was a little on depressing side but the characters you do feel for.
A little slow start but the ending was a page burner. I was hoping for a little more closure at the end.
Great! So much like a Hitchcock movie script. The author looks just like you'd imagine Rachel to look...
The Girl on the Train starts off slowly but builds to a compelling climax and is a fun ride all the way.
I will not buy another book written by this author even if it is selling for ninety-nine cents per copy.
I spent 90% of this book with my head spinning with trying to figure out what was going on. I love that.
Loved it!  Couldn't wait to see how it ended!  Kept me on the edge of my seat wanting more!  Great book!
Given that this book is on the Best-Seller list, I thought I would read it.  For me, it was not so good.
Finished this book in less than one day. Couldn't put it down! Suspense until the very end. A must read!
This is a page-turner; couldn't put it down. Keeps moving along until you can't wait to read the ending.
I literally couldn't put this down until I finished it!  If you loved Gone Girl, you are in for a treat!
At first it was a little slow.  I almost didn't read further.  I am glad I did.  Really good plot twist.
This is a must read!! Full of twists, turns & suspense. I couldn't put it down until I had finished it!!
It starts out like a train leaving the station, then, picks up speed just like a TGV! An absorbing read.
I'm sorry but I don't see what all the fuss is about.  The only phrase I can think of is anti-climactic!
It's definitely a page turner! I had such a hard time putting it down that I read this book in two days.
Really engaging story.  I looked forward to reading this story every night after work. Highly recommend.
Loved this book.  It had me confused until the very end.  I will look for more books by the same author.
Much over-rated.  Descriptions and  multiple points of view interesting --what makes the novel readable.
Best thriller I've read in a long time. Kept me guessing up until the end. Can't wait for her next book.
This book kept my attention lock in every page. Loved it and would recommend it. Loved every word of it.
This was my first book from this author and I couldn't put this book down. Very few books do that to me.
Couldn't put it down. Lot's of surprises. Pulls you in and won't let you go. I felt a part of the story.
Lots of twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat until the end. I could not put the book down!
It was a good read and I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The ending was a bit predictable, but still good.
This book is hard to get into at first but if you stick with it by halfway in it becomes a page turner.
Good writing and good concept, but the protagonist's extended infuriating relapses drag down the story.
Did not enjoy reading it , but was compelled to finish the book thinking it would have a better ending.
It was a compelling story with truly flawed characters. It had too much use of the F word for my taste.
Enjoyed reading the book, although at times it was a little hard to follow.  Never expected the ending!
I expected more of a plot. There was so much hype about this book. I expected more. I have read better.
Really enjoyed this book! Definitely worth buying and reading. It kept me guessing till almost the end.
Good story line, but pathetic characters with no redeeming qualities.  Became depressing after a while.
Entertaining.. a little fictional though... I enjoyed the read and it kept me on my toes.. recommended!
Great read! I felt it has a slow start but then I couldn't put it down. Great twist. Highly recommended
It starts out very boringly and in my opinion does not get much better. Not a book that I would re read
It took me two tries but I finally made it through and really did enjoy it. It's a very enjoyable read.
I don't know why this book has been so popular.  Definitely seems to be riding the Gone Girl coattails.
Decent summer read. Was rather confused thru the first third of the book as to who the characters were.
Prepare to be glued to the book until the last page! A great modern version of Hitchcock's Rear Window.
It was kinda predictable. Although, finally at the end I was a bit surprised.  It was a nice read, tho.
This book will keep you hanging on throughout  with a twisted ending! I loved it! A must read for sure!
Loved it, and a twist you didn't see coming until the very end! Read it in one day,couldn't put it down
I very much enjoyed this fast read.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing right up to the end.
It took me a while to separate the characters. When I was finally able to know all, I enjoyed the book.
Good book! Kept me guessing until the end and characters that made you want to crawl through the pages.
Great book couldn't put it down. It keep me on the edge of my seat. Was totally surprised how it ended.
Wow this book keeps you guessing throughout.  Twists and turns with every page.  Didn't want it to end.
Paula Hawkins writes okay but the story says very little in the way of positive things about humankind.
I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters were really screwed up and it was 'he said, she said'.
Not much of a mystery But keeps one hooked till the end .fast paced and does not bore you . Recommended
At first confusing, then captivating. One continues to consider  the messages long after the last page.
Interesting way of writing from the perspective of the three main female characters. Keeps you guessing
This book is amazing! I recommend it to any and everyone!  Can't wait for her next book to be released!
If you liked Gone Girl you'll like this. Full of flawed characters and twists and turns. Very readable.
It was very repetitive in the beginning  but towards th middle it got better. It had a very good ending
Definitely kept me interested but st times found some of the jumping around with. Characters confusing.
finally a mystery-beautifully done-that took me to the end to figure out.  Can't wait for the next one.
Got sucked in and could hardly put it down !! Characters are all believable , would make a great movie!
This book kept me guessing until just about the end. It was a very good mystery and a real page turner.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book and needed to keep reading constantly, my ironing pile got so neglected!!!
Interesting story from beginning to end. It reminded of the New York girls who fell ill a few years ago
The book was full of depth and suspense. I couldn't put the book down. Great book from start to finish.
Excellent read. I was hooked the minute I picked it up. I was filled with sorrow and of hope as I read.
It was suspenseful but the main character was an unlikable drunk. I got tired of all the alcohol binges
Great engaging read. Felt a bit drawn out towards the end, but generally very good. Highly recommended.
This was an easy and fast read and very engrossing.  It is in my opinion a good psychological thriller.
Impressively well written, well drawn characters, a book you can't put down but don't want to have end!
Slow starting but good from half way through. A little confusing however it all makes sense in the end.
This is am amazing book! I loved all the twists and turns. The charters were great too! Read this book!
A well crafted mystery told through the eyes of three sad, lost women.  Who done it?  Read to find out.
I heard a lot about this book so I decided to give it a try. I could not put it down. Really good read.
Refreshing new concept -  characters with some depth  - I found it interesting and it kept me guessing.
Altogether very 'average' read, kept me engaged but definitely not worth the hype for content or style.
This was a Great read and Intense story. I was shocked by the ending. I recommend this book to friends.
Loved this book!  It kept me interested from start to end.  I'd like to read more books by this author.
The author spins a yarn like Gillian Flynn does. Gets better as it goes. Look forward to her next book.
It was a different and interesting read. Keeps you thinking and trying to mentally predict the outcome.
Less diatribe on binge drinking and more psychological thriller could have improved this read. greatly.
Kept my interest, always wanting to see what happens next.  Unpredictable characters kept things going!
Rachel is hilarious and real.  Even as a train wreck, Rachel is someone I can get behind and route for.
Similar story to Gone Girl.  Well written.  Could not predict who the bad person was till the very end.
Enjoyed this but not as much as I thought I would!  Totally annoyed by Rachael...the girl on the train!
I had a great deal of difficulty understanding, sympathizing with, or liking the main character Rachel.
The ending could have been so much better.  I would have written 30 more pages about the kitchen scene.
Could not put this book down.  Loved the perspective of different characters.  A mystery until the end.
Keeps you guessing until the very end. A book to stay up with at night until you finish  A page Turner.
I did not want to put this book down. Rachel was such a pathetic thing, but I had such empathy for her.
I liked how it kept me guessing and was told in each persons character instead of just a single person.
Hard to follow at first until you understand how the characters are intertwined, then very interesting.
Confusing all the way to the end. In a good way!<br/>I just loved it! Fun and fast read. Entertaining!
I enjoyed this book. It didn't drag like some books I've tried to read recently.<br/>I'd recommend it.
This book was very interesting and I didn't know where it was going but then if took off . Great read !
Boring and redundant, got very tired of reading about the same issues and problems over and over again!
Full of suspense and full of twisted turns. Have an empty day for reading, could not put this one down.
Good story, a can't put down book, once you get used to the character's made up names in the beginning.
I couldn't put it down.  And I couldn't figure it out so the ending was a definite surprise! Great job!
I didn't like it!  The characters are a bunch of social misfits - depressing - the story is sophomoric!
Once I got used to the flipping back and forth between time and people, I loved it!  Good plot  twists.
This book starts slow and  I almost gave up on it.  After a short time it took off and was really good.
This book was an amazing read. I couldn't stop reading it, it kept me guessing what was going to happen
What a fabulous read. I couldn't put it down and I couldn't wait to figure out what happens at the end!
Difficult for me to keep characters straight in beginning so went a little slow. Definitely got better!
Fantastic fast read thriller mystery. Holy cow people are f-ed up. Great way to keep the pages turning.
Pretty good book.  It does keep you guessing on the "who did it' until the end.  Very well written.
The best that I've read in a good while! Hated that it ended, but could hardly wait to pick it back up.
Really loved this book.  It totally captivated me from start to finish.  This would make a great movie!
Keeps you guessing. I enjoyed the train ride. I could feel like I was taking the trip myself as Rachel.
Boring.  Written with the hops of being a movie.  Totally hollywood.  Easy to read but boring and slow.
It was very good, very well written. I would be very surprised if it wasn't a movie in the near future.
I enjoyed the suspense of this book. It was easy to read and kept me reading, ironically, on the train.
Interesting concept but hard to buy into. No one in the book is normal. All were at least slightly off.
Great story!  I hope they can put this on the big screen. Can't stop thinking about it. Read on!  Peace
Started slow but picked up speed as the characters came to be revealed and interesting twists revealed.
Enjoyable...a fast read.  Ending was no surprise though.  I think the movie will likely be even better.
A book you can't put down! Author takes you by the hand so you can live what the characters are living.
This reminded me of Gone Girl - mystery told from different perspectives that was hard to stop reading.
The pace  of the story was fast and a real page turner.  But the personalities of the characters was disappointing, and their behavior.  I'm very aware that drugs and alcohol are a large problem everywhere, but the whole mood of the book was not very inspirational.  The whole theme of the girl on the train watching and imagining other peoples' lives was very interesting.  We had several train incidents in the news when I was reading the book and memories of my own train trips as a child and young adult all came to mind.  Overall it was enjoyable.
This book was mediocre at best for me. While we'll-written, it was told from several perspectives so I had to keep reminding myself who was talking at the moment.  Then there were questions I had which I felt weren't clearly explained.  I won't go into to it because that would require giving some major plot points away.  I will admit that even though it started out slow, once it picked up speed it did keep you guessing as to what was going on and as to the identity of the killer.  I wasn't sorry I read it, just not as good as I expected it to be.
Compared to other books I've read recently this book was entertaining but lacked substance, the characters shallow and the storyline - well at times believable and at other times not. The ending was far from brilliant. It left me feeling: I read all that .. for this? It's an okay, light, holiday read. I can see why it's got mass appeal - it's easy and regular train commuters will identify with the setting.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it .... maybe, ... maybe not. There are other books out there that are way more compelling and better written.
Poor writing, predictable and mildly interesting plot. I don't understand why this book is so popular!
Kept me interested. Reminded me of Gone Girl, the way the story was told, be the different characters.
Did not like the book. It was very slow moving I almost didn't finish it but wanted to see who did it.
Was a good read. Kept on waiting for when the title of the book would figure in & then it finally did.
It has you rooting for Rachael to get her revenge on those who hurt her . Had you from start to finish
Nicely written with good character development.  Keeps the reader coming back!  Nice twists and turns.
Moved to slow, did not like writing format of how the story was told and the was not that suspenseful.
Although I found it slow at times, I had to finish it to see who the murderer was. A pretty good read.
I did not like the fact that each chapter was from another character in the story at a different date.
Exciting, a true page turner! You will stay up all night reading this book, it is that good! Enjoy it!
I loved this book!  Rachel was my favorite character and I liked the London setting. Very interesting!
It was very good . Hope the movie does it justice .can think of any thing else to say. This is stupid!
Interesting writing style. I enjoyed never quite knowing how things would turn out for the characters.
I could not put book down.  Well written with lots of twists, keeps you thinking!  Really a good read!
Meh.  I was pretty disappointed based on the good Amazon reviews.  It felt like Gone Girl fan fiction.
Very good! A page Turner that I could not put down. I kept wanting to know the truth, the whole story.
Difficult to get into, tedious start meandering into captivating entertainment. Well worth the effort.
This book was very interesting. It had some slow parts, but it did keep me guessing until the very end
Lots of twists and turns. I loved the change of viewpoint from each of the three main women. Fun read.
I finished this book last night and stayed up all night to do it!  Tonight's plan is to read it again!
It was good, but I think I was expecting more.  Glad I read it since it was "all the rage"....
It was a good read, but I didn't really connect with the characters, which seemed sort of flat for me.
I couldn't put this book down! Definitely had me on the edge of my seat the entire time! Amazing book!
Great mystery thriller. It does ends quickly though. I wish it went a bit longer to lead up to finale.
I could not stop reading this until the very end!  WOW!  What a crazy ride!  Thank you!  Thank you! :)
Not who I thought it would be! Not how I thought it would end. Looking for a good mystery? This is it.
I liked the book. Paula Hawkins did a great job weaving the surprising end . I'll read her work again.
Avery convoluted tale - not in the best sense of the word. I almost gave up on the book. I wish I had.
Great story. Twists & turns. Didn't want to out it down - even when it would be late 😉 excellent read
I truly enjoyed this book. It kept my interest and I found it difficult to put down until finished.
I am still trying to figure out why this is on the best seller list but I didn't like Gone Girl either
Jumps around too much - tried a couple times to keep reading it and it doesn't draw me in.  I tried...
This book has dark, unlikable characters. Reading it was like surrounding myself with toxic strangers.
The pace is fast enough to keep you entertained on a flight or the beach. You'll fly through the book.
Could not put it down! A page turner from start to finish. Enjoyed the story and how it was presented.
Excellent -- it kept me guessing until the end. Great character development. It's a great summer read!
An excellent book.  Thought it was going to be a downer but as the story developed so did my interest.
This is a page turner. Definitely had a twist that made sense when it was all over. Great summer read.
A true page turner. Plot twists until the very end. A really great read!  Would make a good movie too.
I like a book that you can't figure out the ending from the beginning.  This book meets this criteria.
Really enjoyed this book. Our book club read it and all enjoyed. Great suspense. An interesting story.
Loved this book. Make sure you know exactly which narrator you are reading at the beginning. Nailbiter
I was drawn in from the first page. I liked the writing style and the way each character is developed.
Um, WOW!! I loved this book. It takes you on a ride and you will not see the ending coming. Brilliant!
This was a good story. Lots of twists and turns. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next!
This book I couldn't put down! I had to find out what was going to happen right up until the very end.
Marginally entertaining for an Anglophile, just for details of middle class life in an English suburb.
I liked the book very much. It keep my interest to the very end. I plan on reading it again very soon.
It was a good story.  Held my interest.  It lagged a bit here and there,  but all and all a good read.
Great reading. I couldn't put it down it was freaky. Kept me at the edge of my seat. A good night read
Nice read that kept you locked in.  Plot is a little transparent very early in but overall a good read
I loved this book. Took me a while to put it all together in the beginning, but it was worth the wait.
The book definitely kept me interested. I enjoyed the author's writing and thought it was a good read.
The twists, turns and suspense of this story held my attention enough to get through, but just barely.
read this with my girlfriend, we both enjoyed reading and talking about it.  good book for discussions
I disliked so much what I read of this book the despite the good reviews I refused to finish the book!
This book was chosen for my book club. It was a little slow at first but the characters are relatable.
Took me a few chapters to get hooked and then I couldn't put it down! A page turner till the very end!
This was a good, fast book to read.  It definitely kept my interest and would be a perfect beach read.
An easy read... I couldn't put it down. I know that I will be recommending it to everyone this summer.
I Found this to be very depressing, am surprised it is #1 on bestseller list-not my taste or enjoyment
Loved this book.  I would recommend it to all my reader friends...One of those hard to put down books.
I got caught up in the ride and had to take the ride to the end. A fast read full of twists and turns.
Starts slow and stays slow with a predictable ending! Finished the book but only because it was there!
Boring for 75%of the book! Very dysfunctional person with the alcohol problem!  A bit too dark for me!
This book kept the reader thinking.  It was a "Who done it" story keeping the reader guessing.
Suspenseful - I couldn't wait to find out the answers and then at the end, I was sad that it was over!
A slow start, but once you got used to the format, the story then pick-up and turned into a fast read.
Great easy read I go away feeling as if I know the characters well.  Sometimes we think we know people
I really liked it a lot.....after I figured out that each chapter was spoken by a different character.
It kept me wondering! Just when I thought that I had it figured out, it would take  a different twist!
Easy read with lots of great twists - until the very end... I would recommend it to men and women both
The writer's intent to confuse the reader about characters was boring to me, unappealing and annoying.
Great suspense with twists and surprises to story.  good main character development.  A fast fun read.
Good twist!<br/>Kept me intrigued. I could not keep the book down. I needed to know how it would end.
What a page turner! You will not be able to put this book down. It keeps you wanting more. Great read.
I couldn't stop reading, reminds me of Gone Girl. It was good from the start to the end.<br/>Love it!
It was hard to follow and dragged on too long.  Needs some editing  I read it through but it was so-so
Loved this  page turner! I wanted to read it in a day! Amazing read and kept me on the edge of my seat
This book kept me up half the night so I could finish it! I couldn't put it down! A really great read!
I enjoyed the story line and trying to guess the ending. I really liked that I couldn't figure it out.
Loved it, read it in 2 days, could not put it down! Highly recommend. Wonder when it will be a movie..
This was a quick read that had me hanging on every word. So many twists and turns. I really enjoyed it
I did read it right through in just a few days. Gripping tale of what really happened to poor Rachael.
A murder mystery filled with intertwined relationships and adultery.  No happiness or joy in this one.
I am struggling to get through this book.  I wanted to see what all the 'hoopla' about this was about.
Great read it keeps you guessing until the very end! One of the best books I have read in a long time!
Interesting story and format but somewhat implausible. Good but not #1 best seller worthy iny opinion.
I liked the book and the ending was a surprise.  The main character was believable and well developed.
Good and an easy read.  Not the next gone girl, but close. I'll have to see what else the author wrote
Fantastic and engaging thriller. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I see why this book has so much hype.
Draws you in quickly and doesn't let go until the final page with many twists and turns along the way.
Takes some getting used to reading three different people writing in the first person. but good story.
Page turner but not a great written book. If u want something lite and quick this is the book for you.
I didn't know what to expect from this book. I was pleasantly surprised as it got better about 20% in.
Better than Gone Girl. Page turner. I read it in two sittings - very well thought out and well written
An amazing read. Best book that I have read in years.  Amazing - so close to home with the characters.
Did not like this book. 200 pages would have been  enough.  Can't imagine how this got to top of list.
It was a page turner. Suspenseful to the very end!!! Can not Wait  to read other works by this author.
At times I felt I was reading the same thing over and over. It became very tedious. I Don't recommend.
This book was really good.  I rolled my eyes when I read it was compared to Gone Girl.  Other books I've read that have been compared have been very disappointing.<br/><br/>This book is shrouded in mystery and flashes of memory from a very unreliable source.  As the story unfolds, you're given more clues but only left with more questions.  I had no choice but to continue reading and find out who was responsible for what.<br/><br/>A quick and easy read.  I enjoyed the different points of view and overall had a lot of fun with this book.
Reference to Alfred Hitchcock in a review of this book  is very misleading.  I know that using his name peaks anyone's interest when mentioning mysteries, but this is not a Hitchcockian-type story at all.  Well;...maybe just a bit in that it is a mystery.<br/><br/>The writing itself is very good.  I like Hawkins' style, but I found  the story very depressing, and I'm not easily depressed.  The female protagonist is depressed and depressing, as are all the other characters.  I figured out the guilty culprit about halfway through the book.
I haven't finished reading it, but it doesn't - so far - compare with the build up it has been given.
The book started a bit slow but quickly picked up. The suspense and thrills were worth it in the end.
Excellent fast read. Well written with an amazing twist at the end. You won't be able to put it down.
I like the way this was written, it was different.  I never got bored or felt that it was predictable
Kept me interested all along the way the tied it up rather quickly at the end.  Enjoyed it very much!
I thought the book was well written and the story had lots of twists and turns! I read it in one day.
Well written and interesting mystery with an unexpected outcome. A natural to be turned into a movie.
I found the main character to be desperate and pathetic. She annoyed me every time I turned the page.
Great book, it was my day off and I didn't get a single thing accomplished once I started reading it.
Too contrived...all the characters unlikable...I kept reading just to satisfy a book club assignment.
Fast, sad,  sobering read. I had a hard time putting The Girl on the Train down. A great summer read!
interesting read but no great shakes. Pales in comparison to Gone Girl or Girl within a Dragon Tatoo.
For fans of Gone Girl, this one will keep you spellbound! My daughter stayed up all night reading it.
Ok.  In my opinion the "release of information/milestones" were ill-timed throughout the book.
Excellent story with a twist that never crosses the reader's mind until the late stages of the story.
It was easy to see who the killer was. In any case, the book was interesting and the story well told.
It was a great book from start to finish. Hard to put down-I read it in two days! Highly recommended!
Excellent book, couldn't put it down!  Three in our family read this book while on vacation together!
Although I did not care for the drinking problem with our"heroine", the book was a great read
Pretty good read, you don't see the ending coming but It was a little drawn out to get to the ending.
poorly written, dysfunctional girl and others in story.  No clue why this got so much positive press!
I flew through the pages quickly, and had my fingers crossed for this hot mess of a girl!  Good read!
Kept me interested and somewhat intrigued.  However, to me, conceptually was too much like Gone Girl.
Very well written. So suspenseful! I read this book in one day... I could not put it down if I tried.
I found this book confusing - difficult to know who was who - and I quit after about 1/4 of the book.
It keeps you guessing until the very end! I loved it, and couldn't put it down. A definite must read!
I really enjoyed this book and found it hard to put down because I couldn't wait to see how it ended!
Although a little slow, the plot evolves with twists as it progresses. A good read if one is patient.
A page turner…the audio book is very well read with clear delineations between the female characters.
It held my attention. It was hard to put down. I wanted to know how it ended from the very beginning.
Not at all what I expected. A Really good and a page turner. Definetly finished in a week! Must read!
Kept me guessing right up until the end. The author really made me feel like I was part of the story.
Fab book couldn't put it down. Highly recommend I would love to see this made into a movie!! Buy it!!
It was absolutely wonderful and kept me engaged for a long trip to Europe!  I'd recommend it highly!!
I felt there were some leaps from the Girl in the beginning and at the end, but I enjoyed this a ton!
I could not finish the book.  It lagged in so many places - kept repeating itself to the same issues.
A good read...... I couldn't put it down :)  The story held my attention and kept me wanting more! ;)
Kept me guessing until the very end of the book as to the "who done it" and why. Great read!!
I was a little disappointed in the story.  I thought that there was too much drinking involved in it.
What a page-turner! Could not put it down. And I could not figure things out until the end. Loved it.
I don't usually like mystery books, but I really enjoyed this book.  Perfect to read while traveling!

Super fast read. Engaging and although not all that surprising at the end, truly an interesting read.
Really enjoyed the book - couldn't sleep, started reading at about 1.30am & read the book in one hit!
One of the best books I have read this year.  It kept me guessing until the end.  Well worth reading.
Enjoyed the writing style and the surprise ending  This could b a movie and I would b sure and see it
Was a good book but becomes predictable towards the middle/end. I would still recommend it to others.
A book hard to put down! Excellent characters that are never quite what they seem to be! A good read.
I was very disappointed - it was recommended as being in the same class as Gone Girl - it just isn't.
it has been a while since I've read a book that I could not put down. excellent way to spend my time.
I bought the Kindle edition for vacation and it kept me interested and very entertained.  It's a good read for sure.
Confusing at first but after about 30 pages becomes a real page turner! Had to finish it immediately!
The book was easy to read. However, I felt as though some parts of the story were not well developed.
I found the 2 female characters to be quite pathetic.  Ended interestingly but it was not a favorite.
Gripping well written story. Could not put it down. Have already recommended it to friends and family
Edge of your seat good!! A must! What are you waiting for?? Plan to read the whole day long and some.
Couldn't wait to read each chapter!  Intriguing and carefully crafted to keep the reader's attention.
alternating dates and people was hard at first to follow but it came together in surprising suspence.
I loved it. The ending was good but the writing and suspense was spectacular. I couldn't put it down.
A story that you can't put down from the first word to the very last. Plan to lose a day to this one.

Climb on board for this one. I liked this book. It was pretty twisty and dark but I enjoyed the ride.
I was entertained by the book and I enjoyed reading it but I guessed the outcome long before the end.
Engaging story from the start--love the intertwining of multiple lives that plays out over the pages.
I couldn't put it down!! One of the best novels I have ever read!!! This is a must read for everyone!
A great book. I could not put it down.  Read the whole thing in a couple of days during an ice storm.
It was a well written novel and held my interest until the end.  I would recommend it as a good read.
A real page turner.  Kept me guessing the whole time. Not quite as good as Gone Girl but close to it.

Much like "Gone Girl" but with its own twists and turns....very suspenseful and well written.
Very well done. The writing perspective is quite unusual and entertaining. A worthwhile mystery read.
I usually don't like suspense but I couldn't put this book down. I read it in one day, I had to know.
While the author is talented, I really tire of stories about pathetic losers and their relationships.
This was a great read. I was not sure what to expect but I really liked it. Lots of twists and turns.
Very interesting novel depicting several different extreme personality types. A very engrossing read.
Hard to put down you keep wanting to know what will happen next!  Quick read and something different.
Loved the book. Suspenseful and written beautifully. I'm looking forward to reading more of her work.
Amazing plot keeps you guessing until the very end. If you like gone girl you will love this book too

Had me from the first page. A hard to put down page-turner! You won't want to miss reading this one.
Great story!  What a wild ride!  Completely worth the trip!<br/>{our book club pick for Sept. 2015}
Pretty good thriller. Lots of twists and turns. Characters in between one-dimensional and developed.
I really enjoyed the narration from alternating characters.  It keep me guessing until the very end.
Well woven story.  I enjoyed Hawkins' style.  Good book to read over time without losing your place.

I love the way this novel is written. Had me involved from beginning to end! Great read, pick it up!
This was a great quick read. It kept me guessing until the end. It was suspenseful and easy to read.
It could have told the story in 1/3 the time. Good concept of the back and forth between characters.

The novel was engaging. I enjoyed the characters and the plot.  It was quick  and entertaining read.
I really enjoyed this book! It's very well written full of suspense and great character development.
Too many questions left after reading this.  It's confusing and not very interesting.  Don't bother.
good book - nice use of chapters using the names of the charachters and dates - kinda like gone girl
Good novel.  Kept my interest all along.  Usually I get bored with books but this one was different.
One of the best books I have read in a while. The suspense kept me questioning until the end. Enjoy!
One of the best books I've read in a long time.  A thriller for sure.  Can't wait for her next book.
I finished this book in 2 nights - that's how much fun it is - not earth-shakingly memorable but fun
Very confusing at the beginning, but once you are half way through, everything starts to make sense.
I thought it was going to be predictable but I was in for a surprise! Very good read...very sad too.
Kind of dragged out, boring, basic. I am not sure how I felt about this at all..... Blah! Try harder
Read it in a book group and we were all extremely disappointed with it.  It is not a feasible story.
Great story. Great development of characters. It kept my interest and was I surprised at the ending.
I literally could not put it down! It was a great mystery with lots of twists and turns. I loved it!
Very slow moving in the beginning.. When the pace started to pick up the book was full of surprises.
I really enjoyed this book after I got into it.  It was very suspenseful. That is all I have to say.
Great story! As soon as you think you've figured it out, you haven't. Will read more by this author.
You keep turning the page but at the end of the book it wasn't anything spectacular or life changing
This book took me by surprise.  It was very engrossing and I couldn't stop til I read the last word!
If you like twist and turns, unexpected waves, then you will love this book I could not put it down.
Very well written story that hooked me from the first page.  I can't wait to see what she does next.
Started very slowly, and I was ready to quit.  Struggled to about 35% and then couldn't put it down.
I thought Ms Hawkins characters were well developed.  The outcome of the mystery was pretty obvious.
This novel starts out a little slow, but really gets going about half way through. Lots of suspense!
I enjoyed the book but you had to pay attention to who was talking and keep the characters straight.
I enjoyed this book. Written well and several surprises. It reminded me of Gone Girl, which I loved.
Entertaining. Predictable. I did not think character development was strong but it was an easy read.
Loved reading this - so different from the fast paced suspense novels, but really kept me engrossed.
Honestly could not put the book down! This story had me on the edge of my seat through its entirety!
Not one you can't put down but it is one you can't forget. My first for Ms. Hawkins but not my last.
This was a very enjoyable read, if somewhat predictable...but them maybe I just have a twisted mind.
Cleverly written with an unusual story line, this book does not disappoint . It is hard to put down.
First rate mystery with some predictable twists and turns.  Enjoyably "can't put down" read?
This kept me in the couch for a few days!  I enjoyed the characters and twists. A fun and easy read.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It keeps you turning the page for more. Very interesting characters.
It was nothing like I thought it was going to be. It had me in suspense until the last few chapters.
The book was good but at times it lost me with the sad repeat of Megan's life. Ending was a surprise
Found this book to be captivating, and enjoyed every minute of it. Took me a while to figure it out.
Started well, but fizzled out at the end. I had high hopes, but the characters are not very likable.
A bit slow in the beginning, but this author soon had me hooked!  Great story, enjoyed it immensely!
Wow! Great book. I plan to read it again to look for clues I must have missed the first time around.
Love it!!! Buy it and read it. It's a must. Love the characters and the three narratives are genius.
If you liked Gone Girl, you will like this one.  So detailed you feel like you are on the train too.
This book did grab my attention at first. But as it progresses it gets a bit boring and predictable.
The main character is really weird.  The story moves slowly, if at all.  Could not keep my interest.
I really loved this book. It kept me interested and I couldn't put it down . Worth the read for sure
A mystery told in a very genuine manner allowing the reader to jump on the train and feel the rush!!
This is a must read, kept me on the edge all the way to the dramatic ending which didn't disappoint.
Great read could not put it down.  Wow did not expect this.  Read, you won't be sorry. 5 star rating
I felt like this was very long and drawn out. I'm not saying I didn't like it...but I didn't love it
A fun and easy read. A very engaging main character whose progress I hope to follow in future books.
Lots of fun with its twisty plot,  keeps you guessing. Also lots of villains and damaged characters.
Some twists at the end, but I did sort of guess by the time I was 2/3rds into the book. A good read.
Good, compelling mystery. As they all say, if you like Gone Girl, you'll probably like this one too.
It took me a bit to get into it, but once I did, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it!
This was one of those books I couldn't seem to put down. It Kept me guessing through the whole book!
Easy read but none of the characters are likeable. Must say, though I didn't see that ending coming!
Great and edge of the seat suspense. Very exciting, and I wish that I had more like it to read next.
This was absolutely the best thriller I have read in 2015 without fail.  I could not put this down!!
Just enough suspense and a twist at the end that mAkes this a great read to tAke with on a vacation!
What happens when the person you love isn't who they say they are, and no one believes what you say.
The story hooks you from the start and keeps you wanting more. You really don't want to put it down.
If you're like me and want a happy ending with all questions answered- this is not the book for you.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Well written, fun plot, interesting characters. Couldn't pu it down.
It was a little confusing in the beginning but got really good by the end. Took a while to get into.
This book was like watching a Hitchcock movie.  It was frustrating at times but it held my interest.
I love it when I finger a book I can not put down. This book is the best I have read in a long time.
I did not like any of the characters in this book. Although it was well written, I did not enjoy it.
Someone suggested this book.  I read a bit before I was in sync with the dates.  A Good who done it.
I did not want to put this down! It was similar to how I felt reading Gone Girl. Easy entertainment.
I guess I expected more.  It was difficult identifying with the main character.  Good ending though.
Started out a tad slow, but got much better after 20-30 pages. Great read for chilling out on vacay.
Once it gets going, keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seats. I did not want to put it down!
I couldn't put it down! I wish there were more books by this author. Try the nook out! It's awesome.
Good book, fairly sad for the main character.  Not as good as Gone Girl from a suspense perspective.
Good Read  besides being a good whodunit  also a good insight into the world of  addictive behavior.
Simple story concept turned into an intriguing mystery and great story about these women characters.
Here are a true brunch of crazies.  The book is a page turner, but too many whack jobs for my taste.
Best book I've read in a while , the author keeps you so intrigued you can't wait to get back to it!
Loved this, very different in the way it was written as seen through the different character's eyes.
Good read!  Loved the London background and the characters were interesting and caught my attention.
Page turner.  Who done it. Well written couldn't put it down.  Red it in a couple of days. Good book
A great thriller that kept me guessing until the end. I couldn't put this one down. Highly recomend.
Well written enjoyable read held my attention would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery
The only sane person in this novel is the girl on the train. I was clueless until the final chapter.
When you start to figure out what happened. The ending is a bit lame but it still is worth the read.
Really good, and kept me very interested. There is a bit of a mystery to it, and it was fun to read.
I couldn't stop reading it! It's a story of love, betrayals and self - discovery. I hope u enjoy it!
The ending is so good, definitely worth the read. At the end I could stop reading until it was over!
Spellbinding  twist and unexpected turns a bit slow in beginning but very good once you get into it.
This is a very engaging page turner mystery . Not profound or extremely original but very readable .
Love this book, exciting to the very end. I literally couldn't put it down, read it all in two days.
I bought this book for my 19 yr old daughter and she really enjoyed it. I can't wait to read it now!
Truly enjoyed the read. Author did a marvelous job in developing this story. A page turner for sure.
I enjoyed this book . The characters were real & the plot had twists & turns that held my interest .
A good read and a good mystery!  A couple of surprises along the way, to keep the reader interested.
A long drawn out story with a cast of unpleasant, dysfunctional characters.  Sorry I wasted my time.
Bizarre ending. Never saw it coming....Glad I have a corkscrew in my kitchen in case I ever need it.
A real page turner could not put it down! And the ending was perfect, the way it should end loved it
Fun read!  Will make a great movie!  Not a lot of depth, but better than Gone Girl and entertaining.
This book was an intriguing mystery with a surprise ending.  It kept me in suspense the entire time.
A great book !  Fast read, suspenseful and sad yet you want to keep reading.  Compare to Gone Girl .
Kind of reminded me of Gone Girl. Be prepared to watch the dates and names at beginning of chapters.
This book was full of suspense and easy to read. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I loved it!
Not greatly impressed. Had to force myself to keep reading. Subject matter is not believeable to me.
Being a fair-weather reader, I just couldn't put this book down until I knew the ending.  LOVED it !
So many twists and turns. Loved it! Couldn't stop reading. Hoping it will turn in to a movie one day
Very well done. The book is full of twists and turns and keeps the reader on the edge of their seat!
This was just what I needed to get my mind off of a dismal winter! Read it in 24 hours on a weekend.
I couldn't put this book down!!  It was as amazing!  If you lived Gone Girl, you will love this book
Loved this book it kept me on the edge of my seat. Regrettably to quick a read. Highly recommend it.
Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down! The characters are not who they seem to be.
A familiar story with a twist.  Start early in the day because you won't want to put this book down.
I was immediately taken in with this piece. It wasn't until the very end that I feel the author lost touch with the seam of the  novel. For Tom to come out as he did with all the details, unnecessarily admitting so flagrantly to his deeds, reminds me of the classic ending to every Scooby Doo cartoon.."I would've gotten away with it, too,  if it wasn't for you meddling kids..." It's like the author felt we couldn't piece the details together? C'mon. His seeming soliloquy has been overplayed. Besides that ending scene, I loved it!!
I hate to say it, but if you like Gone Girl (the book, or the movie I suppose) you will LOVE this. It is a similar alternating person storytelling, but it is a little more interesting since there are more people involved. I was hesitant to pick it up but it became so popular and is also turning into a movie so I had to check it out. So glad I did! The writing is easy to read and keeps you hooked! I don't want to give too much away but it is something I am definitely happy I picked up. I actually just bought a copy for my sister!
I heard a lot about this book and really enjoyed the mystery of it.  It's good till the final page.
Loved this story with all the drama of life. It was any easy read. Made me want to travel by train!
This was a really fast moving story that sucks you in from the first page.  I couldn't put it down.
Easy to read, but a bit like Bridget Jones fell into a Lifetime movie. Fun, but maybe a bit cheesy.
Riveting, entriging fast read. Twists and turns at every corner. A good read for a rainy afternoon.
I thought the book would NEVER end.  The only exciting part was near the end.  I thought it boring.
A good read - one of the few books you can't wait to get back to reading to find out what happened.
Ok good plot, but didn't love it due to how unlike able and unrelatable the characters were for me.
Definitely a good read. The end kind of fizzled out though. Still enjoyed it and would recommend it
It took awhile to get into but I enjoyed how all of the pieces came together. An easy and good read
Started slow.  I wasn't sure I would read past the first 50 pages; bur, I was drawn into the story.
The novel has a great ending, but it took until about half-way through for me to get into the plot.
A very easy and entertaining book to read. Love that the characters and situations were believable.
Expected more from all the advertisement it got. But it was enjoyable to pick up each day and read.
well written narrative but thinly drawn characters  . Chick-lit joins crime fiction as a new genre.
This book has a slow start, but develops the character creatively.  It has a real surprising ending
Very good read. Have to stay with it at first but it will grab your attention and keep you reading.
It was a good read, really engaging and full of surprises, but I wouldn't call it great literature.
No one is who they seem to be. It shows the struggle of how to overcome the idea of a perfect world
I haven't read Gone Girl, but saw the movie and it was as surprising as this ending. You must read!
Not all is what it seems like. As it unfolds it gets more sinister. Worth reading. Hard to put down
Kept me "on track" from beginning till the end of the line!!! A well engineered plot line!!
I liked this book a lot. I did not expect the ending to be how it was.<br/>Good cast of characters
Very contrived but if you accept that it is OK. The alcohol scene were very tedious and repetitive.
I read this because I was a the girl on the plane for eight hours. It was a rather depressing book.
I loved this book!  It was such a fast read and I can't wait to read another book by Paula Hawkins.
Very well written. Great plot, complex, human characters with faults. Will definately recommend it.
Pulled you in right away - twisted and turned - suspenseful - loved it - read it in only a few days
Loved this book. Quick read, couldn't put it down. Needs to be made into a movie. Highly recommend!
It was not one of my favorites.  Plot unlikely and characters a bit pathetic.  Somewhat convoluted.
I didn't like it.  It was depressing and repetitive; a real downer, so I just gave up on it.  Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea. Sorry.
It's been awhile since I could not put a book down. This will keep you up at night. Great thriller.
Interesting read....held my interest.  However, the characters were all dysfunctional, but likable.
I read this book in 2 sittings. I couldn't put it down. It kept me guessing until the end. Read it.
I loved the book! Great mystery with twists and turns. I couldn't put it down! Highly recommend it!
The book is an intense page turner! I love the dialogue. You will not want to put it down! Love it.
Enjoyed reading this book, similar to Gone Girl story line. Slow paced at start then pace quickens.
Pretty good plot. The narrative is needlessly confusing. I would give it 3 plus or 4- minus rating.
i really did not enjoy the book. the characters had few redeeming qualities. don't waste your time!
I had a hard time reading this book.  It's hard to relate to a character that's a liar and a drunk.
This book was very, very good.  I had to make myself read slow because I didn't want it to be over.
I didn't like the way it was set up, too much trouble keeping track of the wives and their spouses.
Enjoyed every page of this one.  Suspense was balanced out with character development.  Good story!
Fantastic book , original storyline .. definately kept me hooked. Well written would love a sequel!
Couldn't put it down..sorry when I finished it... Now, to find something that I will enjoy as much!
Hard to read a book which portrays all of the characters as hopeless lost souls.  quite ridiculous.
This book was wonderful. I am going to keep an eye for the authors next book. Couldn't put it down.
Thought it was a little repetitive and ongoing in parts. The suspenseful storyline was good though.
This was a very intriguing read...with twists and turns throughout, which kept me turning the page.
Great book - could not put it down! Bummed I just finished it - wish it was even longer. Well done!
Not quite the edge of your seat tale the hyperbole would suggest but a good story right to the end.
If you enjoyed "Gone Girl, you'll like this book. Fast paced thriller that keeps you wondering.
Do not think you would have to be a mystery fan to enjoy this one.  Better than Gone Girl.  Really.
Well written and you want to keep reading. Quite a soap opera type of suspense. It was a good read.
The book was full of twists and turns.  And the main character was different from your usual novel.
I loved this story, which was very Hitchcock-like. A very quick read, since I couldn't put it down!
Loved it. Kept me on edge the whole time. Will be looking for more books from this author for sure.
Very entertaining with enough twists and turns to make it interesting.  Couldn't put the book down.
Loved all the plot twists and turns and her use of point of view to tell the story. Fantastic read.
I didn't really find any of the characters likeable, and this influenced my enjoyment of the story.
Waste of time reading about 3 messed up "ladies". The idea was good, but it drug on and on.
Hard to keep track of characters. Some interesting parts but overall not my favorite read this year
This is a great book and I found it so hard to put it down!! I  have to read more from this author!
This book has many twists and turns and not one likable character. Worth reading. Hard to put down.
Truly one of the best books I've read in a long time. Missed out on a lot of sleep because of that!
The story telling is a little different than what I am used to, but I did enjoy reading this novel.
This book hooked me at the first page! Suspenseful and thrilling. Twists and turns in every chapter
Honestly a page Turner. I truly had no idea until the end what was going on. Well done. A must read
Very good book.  true life can never be predictable,  but full of insights into the life of others.
I'm a slow reader, yet finished this story in about 4 days.  Fast paced, great detail, good finish.
Kept me guessing throughout the book. A real page turner. Looking forward to Ms. Hawkins next book.
An exciting, interesting, and I don't want to give anything away. Just read it. It's a thrill ride!
The characters were sympathetic and the pace was consistent.  Thought it was better than Gone Girl.
Enjoyable read.  the perspective of the 3 main characters is very interesting.  i enjoyed this book
This was a fairly quick read that kept my interest, which is what a good mystery is supposed to do.
Perfect read for a long airplane trip.  Didn't see it coming into the and then I didn't want it to.
Thin characters and relatively obvious plot. Easy summer read and/or good for book club discussion.
I enjoyed this book. It had a lot of twist that kept it interesting. Easy read for any mystery fan.
Loved this book.  Definitely some twists.  It was kind of dark and disturbing, but very engrossing!
Such a different plot and layout compared to the usual bestseller. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.
I love it when I can't figure out the ending until the ENDING. Very satisfying. Kept me on my toes!
Great, great read!  I read this is two nights which is a record for me!  You won't be disappointed.
Held my attention from the first page. Thought I had it figured out several times, but I was wrong.
Dragged a bit in the middle. I liked the views from each character.<br/>More of a chick book to me
Very well written. I finished it in 2 days. A little slow getting started, but well worth the wait.
I liked this book. It was an easy read and I finished it in a day. Fascinating slow unfolding plot.
Good read, especially first half. Well written.  Kept me wanting to finish to find out the Answers.
Good story line, author is keeping the suspense to the last few pages with not too shocking release
It's as close to an all nighter as I've come in many, many years. Just couldn't put this book down!
The way the book is written keeps you hooked till the last page, trying to figure out what happened
This is a terrific story that will keep you guessing till the very end. Stay up late and finish it!
Read this in two days - couldn't put it down. Great book for spring break or a boring plane ride...
Had me on my toes the entire time. A quick read that kept me guessing the entire time. Great ending
This book kept me reading, not wanting to put it down.  The end was a huge surprise.  Worth a read.
So good.  Recommended it for our book club read for June.  Hope everyone likes it as much as I did.
First half kept me very interested. Then it got slower... But I'm happy that I purchased this book.
This book is a page turner! The writing is excellent and the story pulls you in. It is a must read.
The book was a quick, fun thriller with some twists that kept me interested all the way to the end.
Lots of twists and turns leaving it hard to put down. A must read for anyone looking for a thriller
Had me guessing until the end.  I read the whole book in a day.  I had a hard time putting it down.
It seemed hard to follow at the beginning, but about 1/3 of the way though I could not put it down.
Loved the book read it in one sitting till the end it's a must read hope to see more by this author
There is a reason this has been on the best seller list for so long!  You will not be disappointed.
I read the reviews before purchasing this book. I liked Gone Girl okay and worried they would be too similar. However, apart from the story being told from multiple viewpoints from sometimes sketchy/unlikable characters, I didn't think they were alike. This was fast to read and never boring. While you can see where the ending is going, it still played out well (not too long, not too fast). I do wish some of the characters were better developed, but I didn't completely hate them like other reviewers. Overall, I was pleased.
The writing was wonderful; taut, compelling, with the added mystery of several (?) unreliable narrators. The characters weren't exactly likable, either, yet I felt sympathy for them all just the same.<br/><br/>The problem the writer faced was common in mysteries like this: after the build-up, the revelation & climax are kinda ... disappointing. But this novel is still definitely worth the read. Being in the mind of poor Rachel is a hellish form of claustrophobia, she has isolated herself so completely. Very compelling.
I was 3/4 through before I figured out who dunnit! This is good for me. I like a book that isn't predictable. I enjoyed the way each chapter was from a different character, and I also didn't get bored by the Morning, Evening timeline. The bouncing back and forth in time was not too hard to figure and follow. The characters were genuine - we all have our problems and skeletons. The characters were believable. It goes to show that you don't always know those who are close to you - you only know what they want you to think!
A fast, absorbing read.  I loved the various voices and plot turns.  A good psychological mystery.
The plot is something new, but in the last one quarter reader can easily guess who was the murder.
I couldn't put this book down once I began reading!  So glad I read it before the movie comes out!
Same genre as Gone Girl but I liked it even better than Gone Girl--kept me guessing until the end.
Interesting framework for this novel that has hung on the NY bestseller list for a very long time.
Started reading and this not what I expected, then it opened up and I could not put the book down.
I loved The Girl on the Train, it was refreshing and I am excited to read more from Paula Hawkins.
You won't always like the characters and how they behave but you won't want to put this book down!
It was very good.  It kept me guessing the while time. The ending could of been a little stronger.
I read this book in about 4 days or so. Although I figured out the plot, it was still fun to read.
I enjoyed reading this book. Many twists and turns, exciting, well written, and very entertaining.
Book was good.  Not exactly what I expected but good.  Did not like most of the characters at all.
Was fun to get lost in, and has a good plot but I would have loved a more fleshed out protagonist.
One of the most depressing books I have ever read.  I finished but even that was a disappointment.
This was a good book with enough twists to keep things interesting. Our entire book club loved it!
great book.. read Gone Girl, was told "if you liked Gone Girl you would like this one too"
A good "who done it" and a page turner. At times it had me sitting on the edge of my seat.
I enjoyed the plot twists and character development in this book. It kept me hooked until the end.
Once I started reading this book, I could not put it down. It kept me guessing until the very end.
A surprise for me, I had put off reading it.  A different interesting,surprising, fast, good read.
I had some trouble with the author's ever changing points of view. The story is quite good though.
I liked the book, but it didn't rank as one of my favorites. I didn't find it all that surprising.
It took a while to get into this novel but I was not disappointed.  A good read; not a great read.
Enjoyed thoroughly. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because a bit (just a tiny bit) let down at the end.
This was a great book. I see why people thought it was better than Gone Girl. Loved it. Great read
Even though it was kind of a predictable ending, for me at least, it was a perfect three day book.
didnt see the ending coming i love rachel. she made me want some wine and gin and tonics real bad!
Initially made me cringe due to the main character devolving, but then it got really, really good.
The characters were confusing and also the names. Enjoyed the overall theme  and the final ending.
It was a fun, quick read, but a little shallow in the plot department. Still a lot of fun, though!
I really enjoyed this book.  A gripping story.  In the near future I want to read this book again.
What a great book! It starts out a little weird but quickly builds. Very unique and exciting book.
Good book.  Never lost my interest and had an unexpected ending. Would recommend it to my friends.
Amazing!!!!! Finished it in a day-- awesome page turner- phenominal "who done it" mystery.
It was good.  It held my attention all the way through.  A bit disappointed with the quick ending.
This novel is riveting.  The characters are fully formed and interesting.  I couldn't put it down.
Page turner. It had a great flow and kept you wanting more. Never a dull moment. A must read book.
It's a good story, but the characters are incredibly dysfunctional, and I lost patience with them.
Teriffic book! Held my interest, and never guessed the ending. Would defenitely recemend this book
Could not put it down! A real page turner that makes you want to figure out Rachel and who did it.
This is the first Paula Hawkins book I've read and I enjoyed it.  Will look for more books by her.
I found it difficult to engage with the characters and the story. it was sometimes hard to follow.
Had trouble warming up to the characters and buying into the situation/s, but it was an okay read.
I wanted to know more about the male characters' backgrounds. What made them who/what they became.
Unremitting misery is just not appealing to me. I gave it a good try but  couldn't even finish it.
This was one of the best books that I have read in quite some time.  It was a very enjoyable read.
I anticipated more.  Characters had lots of problems and trouble facing them.  Found no solutions.
Was sorry to put it down each day. Great story and written very well.  Hope ma my others enjoy it.
Riveting story line - couldn't really tell until the very end how it would turn out. Well written.
Like the train, it got a slow start.. then gained momentum!  Many twists and turns on the journey!
Started a little confusing but got hang of it pretty quickly.  Really enjoyed & couldn't put down.
If there was something done or not!  Read only if you don't have to wake early for work or school.
This book is well written and impossible to put down.  One of the top books I have read this year.
I was slightly disappointed . I expected more after reading the reviews . It is ok but not great .
Absolutely loved this book, could not put it down! It kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting more
Read glowing reviews, but I found it a little plodding. Did not engage me until about half way in.
Unexpected. I want to see what else this author has done. Gone girl but more. A good read no doubt
My kindle is not working, second one in four years, so I wont be reading any more books on kindle.
Incredible read. Didn't want to put it down. Kept you guessing right to the end, I finally got it.
keeps the reader guessing. A fun read, and also one of the best depictions of alcoholism I've read
Couldn't put it down. Definitely a book I'm going to have to read again to pick up all the pieces.
I enjoyed this book!  There were times that I felt it dragged a bit but the ending was unexpected!
Not as fast paced as American thrillers. Readers of Harlen Coben or James Patterson may get antsy.
Not good enoughto be ranked # 1 on the Best Selling List.  Many parts were repetitious and boring.
I enjoyed this book.. it kept you going to the very end.  Reminded me of a Gone Girl type of read.
Unusual story line.  I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.  I did not guess the ending.
Really good read! Characters develope slowly and the author tells the story in an interesting way.
Parts of this book bogged down in the middle but the end was worth it! I'd recommend it to others.
Great read! Well written and filled with suspense that keeps you engaged and wanting to read more.
Once you start reading you do not want to put the book down. Like the way story is told.  Enjoyed.
Had me on the edge of my seat til the end. Wonderful read, highly recommend it, it is a must read.
I finished this book in a matter of days. Brilliant, with a twist. A must read. I loved this book.
It was a real page-turner.  The writing was simplistic, but effective.  I really enjoyed the book.
Great Book!  Highly recommend it!  I love suspense novels and this is one of the best I have read.
Characters with human frailties. Story develops in a way that will absorb and intrigue the reader.
This book had me hooked from the beginning! I had to stay up just to finish it! Really great book!
This book is so overwrought, over the top and hysterical that it isn't in any way even believable.
kept me turning the pages !!  Not quite as intense as "Gone Girl" but a good mystery read.
I don't care for the way the author jumps from one person to another, at times its hard to follow.
The book is well written...however  dark depressing  and disturbing...took a few days to shake it.
Pretty good read though I found the ending somewhat predictable.  Not intense enough for my taste.
I thought about half way thru the main character got too predictable and the plot too dragged out.
Loved the book loved the characters. It kept me interested and in the edge of my seat! Buy it now.
This book was great! The main character was such a mess but it was a quick, fun and engaging read.
Kept me wanting to turn the page. Not the best ending but not the worst either. Have it four stars
disappointing endin. much too drawn out at the end. otherwise, kept my attention most of the time.
Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Couldn't stop reading it. Interesting and creative writing style.
A good book but I expected more of a twist. Should have gone more into Rachel's drinking problem..
Not great, but good. There will be a lot of Gone Girl knockoffs in the months ahead, I do imagine.
Very intriguing! Similar to the novel "gone girl". Kept me interested from the first page.
Took a little while to get into the book and catch on but once u do then u can't put the book down
If you have people watched and imagined what their lives were like, then you will enjoy this book. It starts out as simple fantasizing about people's lives that becomes a real murder mystery that keeps you guessing all the way till the end.
This was an interesting read and it kept you reading. A few twists and turns and then it was over.
I LOVED this book.  It is the best book I have read in a while.  I literally couldn't put it down.
Keeps you on the edge of your seat<br/>Always waiting to turn the page<br/>Not sure about ending
The twists and turns of this novel keep you guessing . It was a good book and I enjoyed reading it
Enormously entertaining. This tale, told by the most unreliable of narrators is chock full of interesting and wonderfully drawn characters, a tremendous and propulsive story and an endearing and compelling alcoholic protagonist. The story is interesting and entirely credible. The writing seamless and crystalline and the characters motives relatable (at least to me). This book is very difficult to put down and it at no point disappoints. I can hardly wait for what she writes next. This is an author to be reckoned with.
Sorry I will make this review short and sweet. None of the characters are likeable.. It's not that you have to love a character to enjoy a book but they are all rather dull. You almost just don't care what happens to them. It's predictable in that I figured out the ending not even halfway through the book. If my bookclub were not reading the book I would have never finished it. The book just made me feel dark and depressed while reading it. I have no idea what the hype is for this book. I was happy to be done with it
This is one of the best books I've ever read.  The characters are so believable and I love that the story is about real people, not the ridiculously rich, smart, or famous.  Any of these people could be your next door neighbor, or you.  The plot was well developed and moved at a steady pace.  Clues were given from the first page and continued throughout to lead you to the final conclusion.  I think ever girl woman over 12 should read this book.  These people are out there: they are real, dangerous, and live among us.
While the bare bones of the plot were a little predictable, Hawkins keeps you coming back til the end. She drums up a lot of pathos in the main protagonist Rachel, an alcoholic who can't get past her ex husbands infidelity and move on. She likes to watch the house of a good looking seemingly happy couple as her train passes their house on the way to London everyday. When the wife, Megan goes missing Rachel sets out to find out what happened to her. Rachel is so real and flawed you want to stay with her til the end.
Awesome read
Thrilling! !
Forgettable!
It was okay.
Boooorrring!
This book was good, but I didn't think it was quite as great as everyone was making it out to be.
I enjoyed this book, there was a lull in the middle but picked up. I did not see that end coming.
If you liked gone girl you'd like this, just a little less twisted.. Easy read and a page turner.
OK, but it seemed overly long. I only persevered to the end because I wanted to know 'whodunnit'.
I liked the book. It kept me on my toes until the ending when everything was revealed. Recommend.
It was hard to keep track of what was going on at times.  Other than that, good twist at the end.
Very enjoyable, got me hooked fairly early in the story and continued the momentum until the end.
Very quick read! Kept my attention through the whole book. Would highly recommend it! Great book!
The book was slow to begin with but the more  I read it became a book I couldn't<br/>put it down
Kept me interested the entire story, interesting characters. Overall a great scandalous mystery!!
Good read. I can see this story as a made for tv movie. But the hapless and helpless female protagonist, i find annoying. However, plot twists that keep the reader on edge.
Good book but don't love reading stories of people who make bad choices. Not enough time in life.
It took a bit of time to follow the storyline at first but could not put it down! Easy good read!
Enjoyed this book very much.  A little of every thing;  romance, mystery, sex.  Fast easy reading
It took some time to get into this book, but I became engrossed as I read on. The way the plot de
Boring until the end. Kind of felt like drinking myself before it was over. Good surprise ending.
It kept me guessing until the end.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Reminded me of Gone Girl.
I couldn't put this book down! It's a fast read that keeps you on the edge of your seat! Loved it
I don't give out 5 stars very often, but this one definitely deserved it! I couldn't put it down!
Compelling voice and structure, imagery, action, characterizations holds reader to the narrative.
Got a little predictable by the very end but still a great read with very interesting characters.
It was hard to get into in the beginning but once it started up I couldn't stop. Very fun to read
Slow start- but got better by middle of book- glad I stayed with it- although it was predictable!
A little bit of a slow start, but once it got going, I couldn't put it down! Highly recommend it!
I thought it was an interesting story, but it was extremely hard keeping the characters straight.
Had trouble putting it down and often kept reading way too late. Twists and turns like Gone Girl.
This was a standard murder mystery enjoyed it as it was a page turner ...but this is no Gone Girl
Good style and great characters. Unfortunatelly the plot is a bit slow and the end is depressing.
What a dreary story. There was no one to like. Not one positive event.  I did not learn anything.
I like a mystery in my murder mysteries and I feel like I predicted the ending about 30 pages in.
really enjoyed the different perspectives of the story and it had surprising but positive ending.
Couldn't put my kindle down!! Characters are interesting..intricate story excitingly moves along!
This was very well written and I did not mind that I "guessed" the outcome very early on.
A different kind of book which I couldn't put down.  Keeps reader guessing to the end.  Loved it!
This is a quick-read, can't-put-it-down type of book.  Mystery takes unexpected twists and turns.
It took me a while to read as it's on my kindle but I really enjoyed it.  It kept you in suspense
Couldn't put it down, everytime I thought I knew what was next, I was wrong - it twists and turns
It was a good book. The. Suspense was a little bit much while reading late at night! A good read!
This is the best book I've read all year. I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book!!
Great read. It was a little slow in the middle but the last half made up for it.  I recommend it!
This  book began well but soon deteriorated into a pot boiler style. Finishing it became a chore.
Didn't like to book at all when I first started it, but the story developed and kept my interest.
I cannot fathom what all the hype is about!  Completely predictable and disappointing in my book.
I enjoyed this book even though it was confusing at times.  Was glad I stuck it out to the end...
A little slow moving until more than half the book Then it took off.. Itreminded me of Gone Girl.
I love all of it. It's kind of slow in the begging but once you start to read it you get into it.
just a great story that keeps you reading, good plot development and central character well done.
Started out slow and wasn't sure I would like it but it picked up and found it very good reading.
I enjoyed the book despite it being out of my usual genre. In fact, I picked it for my book club.
Great Thriller. Complex. The character is very problematic and unreliable, but very well written.
Interesting story line. More satisfying ending than Girl Gone but along the same vein. Easy read.
At first it was a bit confusing, but after a bit it was a page turner...definitely worth reading.
Though I thought the plot was good  I dislike reading about characters with such low self asteem.
A really intriguing whodunnit with significant psychological insight into the various characters.
This was amazing. Love the way it was written and kept me on my seat.  I finished it in two days!
Good, interesting but not enough surprises.  Was a little disappointed after reading the reviews.
hooks you. great read. something fresh which is unusual amongst all the other aspirant thrillers.
Style of writing was most interesting and intriguing. One of the best mysteries I have ever read.
Quick read, some twists to the plot.  Good perspective of functioning/non-functioning alcoholics.
If you like Gone Girl, The Girl On The Train is for you. A guesser all the way to end. Must read.
I thought this would be great having been on the best seller list so long. I found it slow going.
So glad to find a book that I can immerse myself into! Great plot with a little twist in the end.
Quick & easy read. Mild suspense. Story timeline got confusing a little. Liked the flawed heroin.
Who could believe that an alcoholic girl could do these things.  The book has little credibility.
This book held me in total suspense. Could not wait to get back to it. Conclusion was well ended!
A good read a little bit of the weak in one of the characters but otherwise I highly recommed it.
I couldn't put it down! Thank goodness it was Mother's Day and I had some time to myself to read.
The protagonist was thoroughly unlikeable, so I put it down after getting 1/3 of the way through.
Prefer reading books with characters I like.  Didn't care for any of the characters in this book.
Kept me on the edge of my seat from chapter to chapter. This book rekindled my love of reading :)
didnt want to go out with friends/go drinking or even a hair cut<br/>Just wanted to read this...
Love the convenience of having this delivered right to my doorstep. Plus a very interesting read!
Did not like the construction but enjoyed the characters development and fun but far fetched plot
The plot had some twists, but I found it somewhat repetitious.  I'm not fond of hysterical women.
A great spell binding thriller!  I was on the edge of my seat!  It's hard to put this one down :)
Possibly one of the worst books I've read...boring and disjointed. I had difficulty finishing it.
Couldn't put it down!  Haven't been this swept up since Gone Girl.  Can't wait for her next book!
I could not put this book down. Each chapter compelled me forward. It's my favorite kind of read!
Great story, very well done. I highly recommend it! It is hard to put down. My hat is off to you!
this book held my interest and gave me a few surprises. I liked the characters, especially Rachel
A very slow-moving, often hard to follow story....much different from any reviews I had read.....
Riveting story at times, includes a surprise here and there, and wonderful character development.
The book truly kept my interest, and I didn't figure out who the murderer was until near the end.
I read this book in one day.  It was an enjoyable, easy read that kept me guessing until the end.
You'll want to read it to the very end.  It's a hard one to put down.  Well developed characters.
This book was greaT I could not put this book down what a great read I recommend this to everyone
Very well written. Great character development and storyline.  Even my husband got into this one.
One of the best books Ive read in a long time - read it in 3 days because I couldn't put it down!
Read this book in 2 and a half days! Kept me guessing! Have recommended it to many people I know!
i could not put this book down, I read it in one night. I am looking forward to any future movie!
Good read. It was an interesting book but it was a little slow in the beginning. Also repetitive.
THE WRITING WAS FABULOUS KEPT ME TURNING PAGES. THE ENDING WAS WORTH THE WAIT. GREAT BOOK  !!!!!!
Excellent read!  It had me from the very beginning - I really did not want to put this book down!
Author does a great job of writing about characters that you dislike but you still love the book!
It's a page turner! I looked forward to every time I had a spare moment to read more.  Excellent!
Wonderful book! I didn't want to put it down. Can't wait until Hawkins comes out with a new book.
This story grabs you and you can't wait to see how it ends. I really enjoyed it and recommend it.
It seemed that none of the characters led stable lives.  I found the book to be a bit depressing.
excellent, fast paced and very well written.  One of those books that you don't want to ever end.
This book reminds me of Gone Girl. Very suspenseful but it took me a while to get into the story.
I couldn't put the book down. Three women and they all had issues. I had to find out who done it!
An okay book, just nothing special. Surprised about all the hype over it. Good publicist I guess.
Well written, suspenseful and interesting. Ending I felt was weak but overall good light reading.
Psychological twisting turning thriller. If you enjoyed Gone Girl, you might like this book, too.
A very good psychological suspense novel. A very fast read because you won't want to put it down.
.. hard to put down ... a fun easy read with some unique twists to the average murder mystery ...
Very suspenseful with many twists and turns. The author really portrayed the alcoholic mind well.
Good but spotty character development. It just telegraphs too often and wraps itself too quickly.
I enjoyed this, especially the use of alternating narrators.  The tale went on too long, however.
great story- speaks to the voyager in all of us. couldn't get to the surprise finish soon enough.
I really don't see what all the fuss is about this book. Very disappointing in my humble opinion.
It was ok. Read it after someone said if I liked Gone Girl I would love this book. I give it a C.
So many twists and turns. The writer keeps you guessing up till the end. I could not put it down!
The book held my interest, but it was pretty depressing.  Everyone in the book is dysfunctional.
Too difficult to follow easily with character changes, times, and days of the week.  Depressing.
Enjoyed the book but don't see how it has remained on the best seller list for such a long time.
This book it full of of suspense. It only took me two days to read it. Definitely a page turner.
I just could not really get into the main character.  She just seemed to be a self pitying boor.
Couldn't put the book down.  First book I've read in a while that has kept me turning the pages.
Would have been 5 stars but confusing and slow to get into.  Once there WOW! A real page turner.
A good beach read.  I prefer enough twists in a story so I won't know the culprit until the end.
I really enjoyed the book from start to finish. Hard to put down. Was very Surprised at the end.
It was ok. Stretched our a bit in certain parts.  Ending was not a surprise 3/4 of the way thru.
A little predictable and characters were a bit flat.  But an easy, relatively entertaining read.
Fun and easy read. Entertaining. However, characters are not interesting enough to care for them
Fantastic book!!!! Suspenseful to the very end. Well written. I recommend this book to everyone.
Total page turner, I couldn't put it down. This kept me interested until the very last sentence.
Interesting book although a bit depressing, leading with alcoholism and the results of the vice.
The story grabbed my attention right away. Near the end though, it got a little bit predictable.
Good quick read.  Although some parts were slow.  I found some of the British terms fun to read.
It was good all the way to the end. I wanted to finish it in one day but had to settle for two😕
Great characters.  Couldn't put it down.  I was surprised by the ending.  I had pity for Rachel.
An exciting mystery I couldn't put down.  The main character was likable inspire of her foibles.
reading it can be very confusing.  Interesting but jumps from one thing to another.  OK reading.
It's been a long time since I read a book this fast. Loved the twists and turns. I recommend it.
First time I've read this author, but I really enjoyed this book.  Had trouble putting it down!!
This was a great book. Not as good as Gone Girl but worth the read. I would recommend this book.
Loved every minute of it. I couldn't put it down. Takes a lot to hold my attention and this did.
Awesome book, I could not stop reading! Glad my child takes a 3 hour nap :) I will recommend it!
Was good but not as good as I would have hoped since it was on the best seller list for so long.
Thrilling to the end. The perspective of a passenger on a commuter train adds a different angle.
This book is a page turner! Took it to the beach and couldn't put it down. Four more short words
Reminds me of Gone Girl in writing style and characters.  Great read with an unsuspecting twist.
An amazing story that leaves you questioning along with the main character throughout the story.
Kept you guessing but I did find the main character a little irritating. Generally, a good read.
started out slow..then got interesting, I guess because they had to introduce all the characters
Though it took a while to get me hooked...the book came out to be a solid read. I'd recommend it
An enjoyable read. Makes you wonder about the motives and secret lives of the people around you.
after a while the women sounded just alike and you really did not care much about either of them
Very well written but the story was very unappealing to me! A whole book of tragic characters!!!
Story was slow in developing, but ending was full of surprises and made the book very enjoyable.
I didn't find the characters very believable. The concept of the story was interesting, however.
Fasscinating writing in the first person for three people! Quite gripping story and a good read.
Like Gone Girl, there's a plot twist you don't see coming! It was a easy read! Hard to put down!
This story had some pretty good twists and turns in it that kept me from wanting to put it down.
I was not impressed with the ending.  It was like looking at a painting that was only half done.
'Twas disappointed after hearing all the rave reviews.  Though it was slow moving, and repetive.
Really kept you guessing to the very end.  At first it seemed a bit weird but it was intriguing.
ok read.  not great.  I knew where it was going part way through it.  characters were unlikable.
It is the first book in a long time to keep my attention! It was smart and I would recommend it!
This was one of the best, most thrilling books I've read in a long time. I couldn't put it down!
If you like a good "who done it" murder mystery then this is a good story for you, with a twist.
Frustrating characters. Not suspenseful enough. Can't believe it's been on the best seller list.
Nice read but can't understand it being in the top five best seller list this long. No big deal!
The twist at the end in no way made up for this tortuous read.  Overall depressing in every way!
Kept me on edge until the end. This was a great read. My first ebook (I am late to the Kindle party)!
The girl on the train was a good easy read. Once I got 3/4 into the book I couldn't put it down.
The first few chapters are slow but it builds to a great book.  Suspense and surprise await you.
It is confusing at first but once you get into it, the book it hard to put down. A good mystery.
a very enjoyable read. Also, a good look into how the mind of an alcoholic works. I had no idea.
This is a good book. You have to really pay attention as you read, it has some twists and turns.
We make our decision on a person in the first 5 seconds that we meet. But do we really know the.
5 stars for this one because it kept me up all night reading last night.  What more can you ask?
This was an amazing read! I couldn't put it down, and was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
If you enjoy well developed introspective, psychologically edgy mysteries, this book is for you.
First book in a long time that I could not put down. Great mystery, thriller. Loved the concept.
My wife is the reader. She said it was very different, she really enjoyed it and gave it 5 stars
I started this on Friday evening and finished Sunday morning! Good read and exciting to the end!
This book really held my interest and had many interesting twists and turns.  Very well written.
I like a book that I just cannot put down.  This was good but nothing that I could not put down.
This was a great story and I couldn't put it down.  It had me guessing until the end!! Loved it!
Like a train, it starts slow and gradually picks up steam until it's highballing down the track.
It was very repeating, yet I wanted always to return to it to see what was going to happen next.
A little slow at the beginning but by the middle you will thoroughly enjoy it. Highly recommend.
I enjoyed this book very much. It is what I call a psychological thriller! Couldn't put it down.
Surprised by popularity of book. After a while the plot becomes redundant...the suspense is gone
Intriguing story and woven together well. Many turns and twists. A "who dun it" mystery.
Heard a lot about it I really enjoy the book the girl on the train great twist really enjoyed it
It's good but not sure why it is the runaway best seller that it is. But it is a good whodunnit.
No matter how anxious or nervous or mad this book made me I couldn't stop. A must read for sure!
If you liked Gone Girl you will like this one too. Lots more twists in it. :). A very good read!
I never read chapter titles ever!  This is a must in this book or you're lost. GOOD ONE to read!
How did it ever hit the best seller list?  It didn't work for me even though I read 40 per cent.
I thought the book wasn't as good a mystery as i had hoped.  It was a page turner but just so so
Great story, I loved the narrator had no idea what happened and had you guessing the whole time.
Very well written.  Really couldn't put it down.  Not my usual type of read, but glad I read it.
Simultaneously an intriguing "who done it" and a chronical of alcoholic unmanageability.
Here we go again.  Like those in Gone Girl, the characters represent a twisted side of humanity.
This was a very interesting psychodrama that was a fast read.  You will not want to put it down!
Very confusing. Wasn't sure what was reality and what was fantasy in Rachel's version of events.
Interesting read, I enjoyed the story and characters; however, the end was somewhat predictable.
loved this book from start to finish. great plot,interesting characters--will follow this writer
The story is a bit slow at first but, the story starts to reel you in and becomes a page turner.
Good story, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because I found it hard to care about the characters
This writer will keep you on the edge of your seat. The twist and turns are totally surprising.
Written in a way to keep the reader's interest, despite slow-moving at first. Enjoyed the read.
Book was ok, very different than what I expected, very slow to start with and hard to get into.
Didn't want to put it down! I didn't predict it ending the way that it did. I had it all wrong!
Excellent book!  Loved the twists and turns of it!  Cant wait for the next book by this author.
I didn't want to put it down. That is really all I have to say but thirteen words are required.
Anyone who likes to 'people-watch' will be riveted by the interesting plot twists in this book!
I was able to figure it out before the reveal and I'm not the brightest bulb in the chandelier.
If you liked Gone Girl, you will love Girl on a Train.  It was hard to put once you started it.
I enjoyed this mystery, and the interaction of characters took some surprising turns! Fun read!
Very suspenseful book, .. couldn't keep it down,  needed to know what was going to happen next!
Very entertaining, a pager turner! Enjoyable from start to finish, unexpected twists and turns!
I can only theorize that a novel with characters so relentlessly dysfunctional, needy and one-dimensional must have been written as a college writing assignment or to snag a movie deal. But for me, the lack of any character growth or redemption drained the story of suspense or interest. I give the plot a B, and the characters an F.<br/><br/>My previous Amazon review was for Neal Stevenson's "Seveneves: A Novel", which also features female protagonists, but the difference in writing, characterization and overall quality couldn't be more pronounced.
I heard a lot about the book, so I wanted to read it.  It was enjoyable, but not a page turner.
I couldn't figure it out. Part of me wishes I could go back and re read it to see all the hints
best book in last 10 that I have read. dont miss it. could not find a stopping point.  Read it!
Thought it was a good read, but from the opinions of others, was possibly expecting a bit more.
A wonderfully believable story on how someone can get trapped in their love for another person.
Not my favotite. Read it because everyone else was. A lot like gone girl. Didn't like that one.
Great book. Has some similarities to Gone Girl, so if you liked that you'll like this book too!
The story kind of drug on for most of the book but it was worth sticking it out for the ending!
I just could'nt put the book down once I got the gist. They were a little dysfunctional family.
I found this book hard to get through because I did not resonate or like any of the characters.
An excellent read.  I was intrigued from the get go and I found the book very hard to put down.
I did not like this very depressing book - and sad characters.  The end was pretty good though.
The multi-layer character development was intriguing.  I enjoyed the unexpected ending as well.
great novel where things are not as they seem, including the various intertwined relationships.
Did not feel satisfied with the ending. I wanted to know what happened to the other characters.
A most interesting read. A few twists and surprises along the way.  I am enjoying it very much.
Tough getting into. It's a crazy story. Runs a little long but the end makes it all worthwhile.
Very confusing switches back and forth between characters. Stopped reading it half way through.
Great story - need to pay attention to characters point of view or beginning will be confusing!
Leaves you guessing. A quick read- only 4 hours! I'm glad I bought it to read on the air plane!
This is one of those books that you hate having to put down and can't wait to pick it up again.
Too long and it gets boring in the middle. Good reading, but it is not even close to Gone Girl.
It is more of a train journey or plane journey type of books, Light and not much to think about
Unexpected twists. The changes in teime of year were a bit confusing. Really good book, though.
Nice twist but predictable.  I didn't care for the writing style. Does not compare to gone girl
Couldn't put this down. So disturbing with unexpected plot twists, you will not regret reading.
This was a very engaging novel with interesting plot twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Found this book very sad. Very broken and without redemption. Too many vicious lost characters.
I could barely put it down!  It is one of the best books I've ever read, I highly recommend it!
A very good read, although this is my first Paula Hawkins novel ,it certainly wont be the last!
Good story. A bit difficult to follow initially because narrator and dates flip back and forth.
This was my favorite book in a long time. Lots of twists and turns and very complex characters.
The plot was interesting as were the characters.  The book is suspenseful and kept me guessing.
This was so good! Most of the time I listened to the audio, which was superb! 5 stars for sure!
Strange!  But, I liked it.  Keep my interest, especially at the end.  Reminded me of Gone Girl.
I can read anything this book was given a lot of good reviews and I would just read it mediocre
My FB friends recommended thus book and I was not disappointed. Very good from start to finish.
When I started reading I didn't like it but the story kept me interested. Similar to Gone Girl.
It got more interesting as the book moved on.  It was hard to keep interested in the beginning.
The story was tedious to read, characters had too many problems with their immoral life styles.
Captivating at times though I found it difficult to like the main character.....Well written...
Well written suspense novel with good character development. I had a hard time putting it down!
Could not wait to finish this book. Must be me, because USA Today rated it a no. 1 best seller.
A good read.  Story kept you guessing until the last few chapters.  A good twist to the ending.
Very captivating. Pretty much the same vein of Gone Girl. I finished this book within two days.
What a great read! Pay attention to every detail in each chapter and you won't be disappointed!
Unusually fine for a debut novel, more twists and turns than the train she so frequently rides.
This was one of the best books I have ever read!  Could not put it down. Read it in two days!!!
The Girl on the Train is a very good book, it is a page turner & therefore a quick & easy read.
Purchased for my wife. Was hesitant because she said some others did not like it. She loved it!
This was an awesome read!! If you loved Gone Girl, you'll love this one.  Couldn't put it down!
I recommend this book.  It is not as good as Gone Girl... But it keeps you guessing who did it.
This is a book that you really have to pay attention to. You really don't know how it will end.
Great read, could not put the book down!  It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.
Great book, kept my interest from the beginning. Towards the end you don't want to put it down.
Some spots of book slow and almost predictable but the mystery enticing. Maybe a movie someday?
Was a great book...kept me guessing until the end, and a surprise ending! couldn't put it down!
This book captivated me. I could not put it down. It proved to be a great read for a snowy day.
Another book you just can't put down! As good as Gone Girl by far. Can't wait for her next book
I read this book in less than 24 hours, I couldn't put it down!  Best book I've read in awhile!
Tried to enjoy the book but it was too slow and felt formulaic about 5 chapters into the story
I predicted the killer about a third way through.  It wasn't a hard read and had nice visuals.
Great book. Suspenseful to the end!  All the clues were ther, but I didn't see the end coming.
Loved this book. Good plot and quite entertaining it kept me glued to it to find out the facts
Dumbest book I ever read.All the character did was drink.Sorry,but this book got an F from me.
Slow developing.  Confusion as to who is narrating.  Repetitive.  Couldn't wait for it to end.
Date-wise, it was difficult to follow reading on a Kindle. Liked the ending, a surprise to me.
Not my favorite suspense. Was slow in parts and fast in others. Kind of knew how it would end.
It was a good read over a couple of days - suspenseful and interesting how characters evolved.
Excellent! I couldn't put it down for very long without picking it back up. Excellent writing.
Started off slow, but I gave it a chance. What a good read, in the end I couldn't put it down!
This book kept me at the edge of my seat. I did not see this ending coming. Well written book.
No give away in this story. Couldn't put it down. I had to find out. A must read for everyone.
Very well written.  Leaves you hanging enough to want to read more to find out what happened!!
You figure it out about 2/3s of the way through but not how, not why. It was hard to put down.
It kept me reading wanting to know what would happen next! A good mystery with a little twist.
it was an  ok story that held my interest while reading but nothing to rave about as I see it.
This book kept me interested the whole way through. Quick read and good character development.
This book was a quick and easy read, told by three different female characters. I'd recommend!
Very enjoyable read on my vacation. I can't imagine I won't see this as a movie in the future.
Enjoyed the writing style and the twists and turns that accompany good "who done its".
Fascinating book. Extremely well-written Very British and fun. Characters are drawn very well.
I expected to love this book but was very disappointed and would not recommend it to a friend.
If you can skim the first 75% the last 25% is five stars. I would recommend it but not highly.
I thoroughly enjoyed the book and could not stop reading once it was building towards the end.
I couldn't stop reading. I enjoy mysteries, and the characters are very interesting to follow.
After page 50 or so, I was hooked. Ending wasn't a huge surprise but it was a good, easy read!
If you liked Gone Girl you must read The Girl on the Train.  You won't be able to put it down.
I really got a little confused, on how the author kept going back and forth with the character
Boring waste of time. Characters you don't care about.  Plot is slow, repetitive and plodding.
A quick, suspenseful, fun-to-read story in the vein of Gone Girl but even better! A must-read!
Definitely a page turner. Exciting, fun read. The Deus Ex Machina ending left me disappointed.
There are a lot of characters in the story, but once I got those down it was a thrilling read.
If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this book! The author will keep you guessing till the end.
Hard to get started and confused by characters names but once into it a bit could not put down
Loved the book!  It consistently held your interest and I am looking forward to her next book.
Liked it - lots of twists.  Not as great as "gone girl" but in the same sort of genre.
Story line is a little simpler than others of the same genre.  Still a very entertaining book!
A different good style of writing, first person naration from different subjects in the story.
I absolutely loved the book and the subtle way the author brought about the story. I loved it.
I really enjoyed the way this was written.  It is told from the perspective of the three main women in the book, though mostly from the main protagonists point of view.  It is also told over two different time periods, so we hear the story of one of the women from an earlier timeframe.  It was a light easy read, but the twist on writing style kept it interesting for me, and I ripped through this book in no time.
If you like Flynn books, you'll love his one. It is not challenging, but it is so fun to read.
Great who did it!  Suspenseful til the end. Slow to start but couldn't stop once it got going.
It took about mid way for me to really fall into this book.  Excellent character development!!
This book started off a little slow but keep on reading. This story has many twists and turns.
Found it bit hard to follow in the beginning, it was a quick read, but no "Gone Girl"!
Excellent read!  Well written!  Was not predictable at all.  Loved it and highly recommend it.
Great book if your looking for a good 'who done it' mystery! Fast read, with a flawed heroine.
Sometimes I got confused on the dates.  But overall I very good book with suspence and romance
Definitely a can't put down book. Don't start it unless you're at the start of a free weekend.
An entertaining read, this story is a thriller with some twists that I just didn't see coming.
Wasn't sure when I started, but it draws you in and keeps you there to the end. Great whodunit!
Fantastic. Intriguing. Modern and contemporary. No one is who they seem. Couldn't put it down.
Most boring useless book that I could not finish it. Put you money on another worthwhile book.
Started slow but soon gripped me. I couldn't put it down and I couldn't figure out who did it.
Couldn't put this down. Lots of turns and exciting moments that kept you guessing. Great book!
Make sure to set a few long stretches of time aside to read this! It is very hard to put down.
Takes you on a journey with some strangely related people in a wonderful "who dun it."
Excellent book on a par with Gone Girl, but more believable with a more satisfying resolution.
I wanted this book to be better than I found it.  It was a twisting story, but moved to slowly
Loved this book...it keeps interests and moves very well. one if those hard to out down books.
very tedious reading, redundant and laborious- I dont understand the popularity of this novel.
Easy reading. Read it in two days. Grabs your attention and you can't let go. Good beach read!
A great read. Thoroughly enjoyed the characters and plot. Had me guessing for quite some time.
I could not put this book down and I was sad when I finished it.  I didn't want it to be over.
Felt like it was some sort of Hitchcock re-tread. Female characters numerous, but all damaged.
Really enjoyed it.  Well written and lots of suspense up until the end.  A definite must read.
A beautiful and well written novel, I am waitng eagerly for the next story from Paula Hawkins.
Good book hate to write reviews why can't we just say a few instead of typing 20 or morre word
Great book, I'm definitely trying to find more by this author. Best book I've read in a while.
Interesting book. Some good character development and a few twists and turns.  Sorry it ended.
I found the characters profoundly mentally sick.  All in all, this was a very depressing book.
This is a fast read that grabs you from page one. You won't want to put it down. Very suspect.
Who did it? Hard to predict. This book was a fun book to read with some good twists and turns.
It started a little slow but once it got going it was very good and tough to guess the killer!
Intriguing!  Loved the way the story developed.  Not on my top ten, but certainly a good read.
Very interesting premise. I couldn't put it down.  I liked it better than my husband, however.
Excellent psychological thriller.  good character development. Kept you guessing till the end.
Wasn't quite as well put-together as Gone Girl, but it was suspenseful and a quick, easy read.
One of the best I've read in a long time.  She keeps you guessing throughout.  Excellent read.
A very good read that I highly recommend.  It kept me wanting to read more, very entertaining.
This bloody book could have been written by a chimp with a six pack and a keyboard. Or was it?
Keeps you guessing with twists.  Good character development.  Not many sympathetic characters.
I love mysteries, but this book was predictable and very slow. I wouldn't recommend to friends
Good mystery, interesting plot, well-written and a little "different."  A page-turner.
I was disappointed in this 'best seller'.  The characters seemed way too disturbed and unreal.
A very depressing mix of people who bear little resemblance to the people in the world I know.
Great book, a bit upsetting, but written well and Rachel ends up being a very strong character
I read this in three days. I liked it better then gone girl! It kept me Guessing until the end
Easy read, good depiction addiction, kept readers interest and had a nice twist to conclusion.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Couldn't wait to pick it up again every time I stopped reading.
The suspense builds nicely.  I would highly recommend this for people who love a good mystery.
What a whodunit novel!!!! Worth reading a story you don't know what is coming next. Surprises.
Interesting book.  Loved the concept.  Kind of predictable towards the end.  An enjoyable read
This book is written so well and I couldn't put it down I highly suggest it. Didn't we the end
It was a quick read.  Very riveting and kept me wanting to read more and more! Very enjoyable!
Usually I figure out "who dunnit" not this time!  An exciting narrative...great read!!
Seriously?  NOT the next Gone Girl.  Whoever started that rumor needs to stop reviewing books.
Great story. I could not put the book down. I just had to keep reading until I got to the end.
Great book – keeps you guessing and is one you want to keep returning to until it is finished.
Really liked it. Kept me involved,and if I had the time I would have read it straight through.
repetitious in each of the story lines.  Got bored with the "I don't care" alcoholism.
Good book,  Held my interest.  I liked the style, the way the author presented the characters.
Real page turner!  I guesses who the villan was before the reveal or would have given 5 stars.
I enjoyed the mystery of so many twists. The story kept me going all the way til the very end.
I found the story depressing and the characters unlikable.  It was a hard read to get through.
Hats off to the author. Beautifully done. It moves. My kind of book. Can't wait for the movie.
This book is so good.  I couldn't put it down.  If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love this read.
I liked this book very much.  It wasn't quite as intriguing as Gone Girl, however it was good.
Fantastic book that lives up to its buzz!  I loved it and will seek out more from this author.
Very good book. Had a hard time putting this book down. Was surprised by the end of this book.
If you like a book that keeps you guessing...this is the one for you.  Tremendously enjoyable.
The mood of the story is very somber as it should be - as it is a dark lonely tale. Good read.
This is the first book I couldn't put down in a long time. A must read if you enjoy mysteries.
A well written book , couldn't put it down . Look forward to her next book  in the near future
This was a pretty good book but a little too psychotic for me to be real. I enjoyed it though.
Girl on the Train for writers: a study in suspense and stereotype<br/>(I reveal a few plot details but no major spoilers)<br/><br/>The book became a bestseller days after publication. It forces fingers to keep turning pages and swiping screens. It has an early Dreamworks option. How did Hawkins do it?<br/><br/>As you'd expect, part of the novel's success is simply the expert use of a few well chosen literary devices: an immediate hook that withholds key details, an unreliable narrator, well-timed alternating points of view. What you wouldn't expect is that the character set, as generally one dimensional as it is, could contribute to the mystery as much as it does.<br/><br/>Aren't typecast characters bad? Not in this case. To understand why, we have to start with Hawkins' excellent hook.<br/><br/>"She's buried beneath a silver birch tree, down towards the old train tracks, her grave marked with a cairn. Not more than a little pile of stones, really. I didn't want to draw attention to her resting place, but I couldn't leave her without remembrance. She'll sleep peacefully there, no one to disturb her, no sounds but birdsong and the rumble of passing trains.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl...Three for a girl. I'm stuck on three. I just can't get any further. My head is thick with sounds, my mouth thick with blood. Three for a girl. I can hear the magpies--they're laughing, mocking me, a raucous cackling. A tiding. Bad tidings. I can see them now, black against the sun. Not the birds, something else. Someone's coming. Someone is speaking to me. Now look. Now look what you made me do."<br/><br/>The first paragraph is from the p.o.v. of the murderer, the second from the p.o.v of the victim. Many authors would be tempted to wax eloquent in the opening scene, but it's what you don't know that hooks you. You don't know if the murderer is a man or a woman, you don't even know the victim's gender for sure. You want to find out who was murdered, why, and by whom, but you need to know because of these nine words: "Now look. Now look what you made me do."<br/><br/>How self-centered, how childish, how chilling. What kind of a person would say that to someone they'd just killed? Consider a few lines Hawkins could have used instead to less stunning effect.<br/><br/>"You got what you deserved, b&^%#" Meh. Just another revenge story.<br/><br/>"How could you do that to me, Megan?" or "I'm so sorry."<br/>Slightly better, as several suspects could have said this, but not hair-raising, still clichéd, and reveals the victim when doing so isn't imperative to addicting readers.<br/><br/>"Oops." Uhhh....<br/><br/>I kept coming back to that line "Now look what you made me do" for clues to test my theory of the murder, and though I ended up being right, I was never absolutely sure because the novel makes you guess at which of the characters is the most heartless, and here's where the stereotypes start to do some of Hawkins' work for her. Out of a set of stereotypes, which of them do we judge to be the worst and least deserving of empathy?<br/><br/>Here's the set, three men and three women:<br/><br/>1. Rachel the narrator, ultimately weak, has lost everything via alcoholism, including her looks and her self-respect.<br/>2. Anna the usurper, stole Rachel's man and had his baby. Win! She believes she's a sex goddess and priestess in the cult of domesticity at the same time.<br/>3. Tom the alpha male, Rachel's ex and Anna's husband, left the broken fading woman for the sexy conquistadora.<br/>4. Megan, the wild and wounded, feels she should be happy with a loving husband and a secure life, but cannot live up to expectations of monogamy and motherhood. Our victim.<br/>5. Scott, Megan's husband, loving but jealous, is prone to violence in his insecurity.<br/>6. Kamal, Megan's honey-voiced counselor, the quintessential comforter and defender of women.<br/><br/>Come back to "Now look what you made me do." Did Megan's husband say it because he was controlling? Did Megan's lover say it, because she was pregnant? Who exactly, by the way, is the Megan's lover, and is he from the past or the present? Did Anna say it, because she's a soulless succubus? For Hawkins, stereotyping, and especially gender stereotyping, was key to keeping all of these motives viable and the reader invested.<br/><br/>Do we think that in mystery novels, jilted husbands are destined to kill their slutty wives? Do we think that protective saviors are bound to take advantage of the women they save? Do we think that alcoholics are ultimately responsible for all of the misery they inflict on themselves and others, especially if they're women?<br/><br/>The answer to every question is yes, getting us into trouble as we try to solve the mystery, and working to Hawkins' advantage. Many writers employ this misdirection, but Hawkins' does it convincingly by consistently developing the worst archetypal traits in each of her characters, keeping their motives in tact and their alibis shadowy. In the case of The Girl on the Train, I should have had more faith in Rachel. I happen to be a woman and an alcoholic. It was painful to read myself in this book, which incidentally does a good job of portraying the psychology of alcoholism. And I never questioned Rachel's self-applied guilt, the fact that she obviously did all the embarrassing things people told her she did. That's as close as I'll get to a spoiler.<br/><br/>The lesson for writers?<br/><br/>It's hard to combine suspense and literary fiction, simply because the more intimately you get to know the characters as you do in literary fiction, the easier it is to predict them, which ruins a good mystery.<br/><br/>At the same time, you have to rise above cliché to write an outstanding suspense novel. In Hawkins' case, she both uses it to her advantage and rises above it. To use cliché, she chooses characters that represent moral choice more than they represent people, so that readers can insert whole lifetimes of personal backstory into their judgements of the characters.<br/><br/>And how does Hawkins rise above it? This is where the unreliable narrator can be a fantastic strategy when executed well. You can know an unreliable narrator well, but only as well as she knows herself. Hello mystery. Beware, as things get more confusing for the unreliable narrator, other details must become clear, every chapter, to encourage the reader and prevent fatigue. (Read whydunits to study how to mete out just the right amount of detail, while keeping readers intrigued. In Cold Blood (Vintage International) is my favorite, The Silent Wife: A Novel is a recent example.)<br/><br/>Other further reading:<br/><br/>For an unreliable narrator whose problem is how honest she is with herself, check out After Life (Nancy Pearl's Book Lust Rediscoveries) by Rhian Ellis, with its killer first line "First, I had to get his body into the boat."<br/><br/>For another unreliable narrator for whom memory is the problem, check out Elizabeth Is Missing, about an elderly woman with dementia.<br/><br/>For a "blame the woman" example of using preconceived notions in the service of mystery, check out Ingrid Bergman in the movie Gaslight (1944).<br/><br/>For voyeurs of murder, check out the Hitchcock classic Rear Window
Hmmmm...what to say about Paula Hawkins's The Girl on the Train that hasn't been said yet? Well, I'm not much of a mystery reader usually, but the buzz about this one was interesting enough to make me think maybe I'd like it. So I picked it up on a whim and what do you know? It's that good and generally lives up to the hype. Win!<br/><br/>The basic storyline is this:  Rachel, a miserable alcoholic, continues to take the daily train into London even after losing her job because she doesn't want her roommate to find out how and why she's unemployed. You don't find this out right away; the author has a delicious way of revealing details that click another piece of the plot into place a bit at a time. Anyway, the train takes Rachel past the stop where her ex-husband and his new wife and daughter live--coincidentally in the same home Rachel shared with her ex, Tom. Rachel becomes fixated on a couple a few houses down from where she lived, even giving them names and inventing an entire, perfect life for them. But then the perfect wife, Megan, goes missing and Rachel, either desperate or drunk or a combination of the two, becomes overly involved. A drunken night she does not remember places her at the scene during the time Megan disappeared and an acrimonious relationship with Tom's new wife fuel Rachel's imagination and lead her to interacting with Megan's husband, Scott. But nothing is the way it seems and everyone has something to hide.<br/><br/>If I'm being nitpicky, the biggest problem with The Girl on the Train is that there is literally no one likable in the entire book. Not Rachel, who is a drunk and sorta pathetic all around; not Scott, who is the focus of his wife's disappearance; not Tom, who cheated on Rachel and then married Anna; not Anna, who is self-righteous in her marriage; not even Megan, whose infrequent point-of-view chapters reveal that she has her own problems. I would have liked for at least one person I could whole-heartedly cheer for, but there is no one who is not flawed to the point of being contentious. Still, that does not in any way take away from the mystery and its ultimate resolution. I was turning pages long after my bedtime in order to sort it all out.<br/><br/>I suppose there may be more complex mysteries out there, but this one, even with its unlikable characters, is so well plotted and fueled that I was totally caught up. It's one I have no problem recommending to most everyone, including those who don't normally read mysteries *raises hand*.  A very solid 4.75 that I will round to a 5 because I think it's that much of a page turner. Read it for yourself and find out what the buzz is about.
The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkin's debut novel. And oh, what a debut!!<br/><br/>Rachel rides the train to London every day, keeping up the pretense that she she still has a job and a place to be. In fact she doesn't - her alcoholism has cost much - her husband, her job and her home. Adding salt to her wounds is the fact that the train makes at the station by her old neighbourhood. Twice a day, Rachel passes by this row of houses by the station. She often sees a couple she has named Jess and Jason in their garden and has created a fairy tale life for them - one she imagines she might have had. Then one day she sees Jess kissing someone else. And then she sees on the news that the woman she calls Jess is missing. Rachel takes her information to the police - but can't leave it be and she slowly insinuates herself into the investigation.....<br/><br/>The Girl on the Train is told from three different viewpoints - that of Rachel, the missing woman and Rachel's ex-husband's new wife.<br/><br/>But it is Rachel driving the story - and she is a deliciously unreliable narrator. She drinks to blackout and often cannot remember where she has been or what she has done. But the flashes of clarity she does have frighten her...<br/><br/>"Something happened, I know it did. I can't picture it, but I can feel it. I'm frightened, but I'm not sure what I'm afraid of, which just exacerbates the fear."<br/><br/>The missing woman also tells her story, leading up to the day she disappears. She too is an unreliable narrator, concealing her past and lying about her present.<br/><br/>Hawkins keeps the reader guessing as the story twists and turns, changing with every revelation, memory and action. Who is telling the truth? What did really happen? I had my suspicions as the number of pages left to read dwindled and literally couldn't put the book down until I finished. (Pick a nice lazy day to start The Girl on the Train - you won't want to do anything else)<br/><br/>Hawkins' depiction of alcoholism is troubling but highly effective as a plot device. I've also traveled by rail and was easily able to put myself in a seat looking out - wondering about someone else's life.<br/><br/>The Girl on the Train is a great psychological thriller and is absolutely recommended Read an excerpt. Dreamworks Studio has also optioned the movie rights
Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br/><br/>This story is told from the first-person point of view of three main female characters.<br/><br/>First there's our main protagonist, 34 year old Rachel Watson. When we first meet her it is the book's present day - July of 2013 - and Rachel is on a commute train traveling to London. She is drinking gin and tonic fizzes out of a can and we soon realize that Rachel is an alcoholic and that she has recently been divorced from a man named Tom. We also know that Rachel keeps harrassing Tom with phone calls and texts.<br/><br/>Rachel takes this commute train daily back and forth to London and in particular loves to watch two homes right near each other, off the tracks. The train usually makes a stop right near the homes so Rachel can check out the occupants. One is home to a handsome couple she has named Jason and Jess and they seem very much in love and Rachel likes to fantastize about their seemingly ideal relationship - the one she wishes she still had.<br/><br/>The other home is a couple of doors away and that is the home where her ex-husband Tom still lives, with his new wife Anna. That is why Rachel is so focused and familiar with this block of homes.<br/><br/>Everything changes when Rachel sees "Jess" kissing another man in her backyard. And when "Jess" goes missing a few days later, Rachel becomes alarmed, particularly when Rachel finds that she is bloodied and has hurt herself and she has a vague recollection of having been near those homes the night before. You see, Rachel gets alcoholic blackouts and try as she might, she has trouble recalling events.<br/><br/>It turns out Jason and Jess are really a couple named Scott and Megan. Megan is our second narrator and we are introduced to her late in 2012 and in this way, we gradually get caught up as to what was going on in her life up to the point she disappeared.<br/><br/>The third narrator is Anna. All three women narrate at different times, all from a first-person POV. The story does move about a little in time and by the end of the story, all the puzzle pieces are put together and we get a resolution to all of the mysteries and questions we've had up till then.<br/><br/>At first, the first person POV of Rachel didn't work well for me. In fact, I almost put the book down. I am very glad I did not. What seemed a little cliched and simple turned out to be a lot more complex and I appreciated the POV's by the end. First person POV can be very tricky but this writer pulls it off.<br/><br/>I was up till very late reading this book. It's not simply the psychological mystery element that is good. It's that the book is deceptively more than that. We take a real look at what alcoholism does to a person and to those around them. We get a first hand look at experiencing Rachel's attempts to clean up and it's both frustrating and exhausting - we are angry with her and sympathetic at the same time.<br/><br/>What I really liked about the book - aside from some fun twists and turns - is that some of the "problems" I may have had early on are resolved later on. In other words, characters actions or conversations may seem a little off but it all does make sense and seems real by the end.<br/><br/>I would definitely read another book by this author. Sometimes you just want a fun, page-turner and this completely fits the bill. I also think this would make a great movie so Hollywood, get on this.<br/><br/>Recommended.
First off, I enjoyed this book, but found myself irritated by the behavior of the characters.<br/>The story is told by three very different women, Rachel, Anna, and Megan, each of whom have their own particular issues and problems.<br/>Rachel is the ex-wife of Tom, who is now married to Anna.<br/>Rachel is severely disturbed by Tom's new wife, and particularly by their baby girl, since she was unable to have a child herself. Rachel drinks heavily, with resultant blackouts, and has lost her job. She is obsessed with Tom and Anna, and harasses them mercilessly.<br/>Anna is the new wife, and rather proud of herself at having gotten her man. She is somewhat arrogant, and, although she had a successful career, she now is a stay at home mom, and she is unhappy in that role.<br/>Megan is a beautiful woman who lives down the street, and she is married to Scott. Megan has a difficult past, and her depression leads her to see a psychologist. Megan needs more excitement in her life than staying home alone all day waiting for her husband to come home from work.<br/>The lives of this group of people becomes intertwined when Megan disappears.<br/>Rachel, even though she no longer has a job, rides a train to London every morning and home every evening. On her train ride she passes the back of her old home (now shared by Tom and Anna), and also the home of Scott and Megan. Megan is often out on her patio, either alone or with Scott, which Rachel observes from the train, and Rachel proceeds to build a perfect fantasy life for Megan and Scott, neither of whom she has ever met. One day she sees an unknown man kissing Megan on the patio, just before Megan goes missing. Rachel involves herself into the investigation and into the life of Megan's husband Scott. She was wandering around the neighborhood the night Megan went missing, but, due to her blackouts, doesn't know if she has observed anything or not.<br/>The story goes on from here, eventually to its conclusion.<br/>None of the characters are very likeable, and I found the drinking bouts quite depressing. Rachel's behavior seems unlikely to me, and it looks as though she causes most of her own problems. There are times you want to shake her and tell her not to be an idiot.<br/>Having said all that, reading the book becomes quite compulsive as the story goes on, and you find yourself unable to put it down.<br/>I recommend this book, it is different from other books, and it makes you stop and think.<br/>I do think that Rachel's drinking and her behavior becomes quite tiresome, and that maybe the book is a little longer than it needs to be, but all in all, a very interesting read.
I really liked this book.  Yes, better than Gone Girl.  I listened to the book; which may be why I liked it so much.  I enjoy British read books.<br/><br/>The three alternating POV's was interesting.  I've read some that have done two POV's but the three was new.  You definitely need to pay a bit of attention to who is speaking and when they are speaking, as time jumps around with each character.  Which I suppose is why there is a comparison to Gone Girl.  But the format is still different.
This book was okay--a psychological thriller of sorts, and I was "thinking" the entire time I read it trying to figure it all out.  The story has three points of view--the three women involved.  I wasn't overly fond of any of the ladies....felt sorry for each one for different reasons. The two male characters were disappointing, but I figured them out easier than I did the women...at first!  Surprise!  This is a book I read for my book club, and I am looking forward to our discussion.
This was one of those books I couldn't put down!  It was a bit slow at first but it picked up speed and kept right on going. I like how the story switched between the three women and how in each segment a little more was revealed about their lives. It would have been nice to get some background on the male characters- why they acted the way they did, what happened in their lives that made them so quick tempered & violent. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers and mystery.
I thought the story was a bit drawn out.  THe scene with Megan's husband--what was the point?
It was a good book but a bit on the depressing side.  There were a lot of unhappy characters.
This was a page turner for me. And I didn't have it figured out. Get it, you won't regret it.
Good development of the main character and a twist of expected results in the murder mystery.
Did not live up to the hype.  Gone Girl was sooooo much better.  This was pretty predictable.
I liked it, read it in about a day.  It's an easy read for the beach or a day at the airport.
This book was difficult to follow characters. It started slow and got better halfway through.
Well, 35,000+ people have reviewed this book, the book was a great read, its dark, complex...
Really well written and engrossing. Poignant description of alcoholism, too. Really loved it.
Loved the way she told the story. Anyone who sees the same scenery every day will understand.
loved the book.  sometimes it was hard to follow because it jumps around but loved it anyway.
A little hard to follow at first but then rolls along. Great ending!  Didn't see that coming!
Very well written. A gripping and intriguing plot line that keeps you guessing until the end.
I expected more from this book. I thought it was slow moving and It didn't do anything for me
Twists & turns until the end.... The middle was a little slow but sky rocketed to the finish!
Excellent read. Couldn't put the book down. Slow start, but then it was like a runaway train!
Very depressing book, especially for those with no experience with alcoholics. A real downer.
Off to a slow start.  More interesting, but tiresome too,  don't want to read more like this.
This book was a little slow until the end then had a good twist. Ended a little too suddenly.
Amazing , amazing book , twist and turns never expected it to conclude like this ! Great read
While not a "can't put it down" book, it held my interest and had interesting twists.
Could not put the book down. Was reading into the wee hours of the night for three days. Wow.
gripping. fascinating inyertwining of reality her perception resulting in solving the mustery
LOVED this book!!!  Kept me interested right until the last page and I didn't want it to end.
Had me on my toes. Great book. Suspense. Nice writing. Better characters than gone girl to me
I thought the story was rather pessimistic, dwelt too much on her problems not her strengths.
slow start that was a little depressing but really got going midway.  worth it to keep going.
A bit repetitive, didn't pick up until closer to the end, but nonetheless a good summer read.
A little hard to follow in the beginning but well written and excellent character development
Didn't realize setting would be England.  Unfamiliar w/some of the descriptions.  An ok read.
Keeps you guessing to the very end. A good read. Our book club just finished it and loved it.
Very good read, could not put this book down!  Hope Paula Hawkins has more books coming soon.
Quick read for my book club. I could not  put it down once I started. A very messed up story!
It was boring, unrealistic and I kept thinking this has got to get better which it never did.
The book was captivating, overall. However, I felt like the ending was rushed and un-planned.
Little confusing, but once all the characters fall into place, it becomes an enjoyable story.
Overrated in my opinion. It was just okay. I *am* very critical about books/writing, however.
The first half was so boring and painful, it got a better, but it wasn't all I had hoped for.
Very very good read. Imagine a thriller version of Bridget Jones Diary. Couldn't put it down.
This book started out dark and a bit slow for me but then took off like a train. Great story!
I did not want to put it down. Luckily, I was on vacation and could read as long as I wanted.
The premise is a bit of a stretch but it's easy to get lost in the story.  It's a quick read.
It was a slow start for me, but towards the middle it picks up. Keep reading it story is good
Enjoyed the two stories and surprise ending, but got a little tired of the alcoholic stupors.
A bit confusing here and there but an ok read...kind of figured it out 3/4 of the way thru...
I love a great twist at the end of a book and this one delivers. A great summer read for sure
Great start. Short ending...middle dragged a little. Interesting characters. Kept me engaged.
Suspenseful, well written and interesting characters.  Paula Hawkins has a hit with this one!
Very different book.  I liken it to Gone Girl.  Thoroughly enjoyed and was engrossed quickly.
Suspenseful and engaging!  One of the bet reads I have had recently. Reminds me of Gone Girl.
I really enjoyed the book, good quick read for the summer.  The plot was someone predictable.
A good murder mystery. A well written, but different, murder tale.  It will keep you reading.
the premis was good. It had some lulls. I didnt figure out who "did it" till the end.
Well written and interesting characters  It keep me engaged. I couldn't' t put the book down.
The story still has me contemplating who the most dangerous character was.... very enjoyable!
It was confusing at first. Took awhile to sort it out but was a great read.  Keep me on edge.
If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book. I couldn't put it down, read it in two days!
Best Book I've read this year. I've heard it compared to Gone Girl. I think it's even better.
A reasonably well crafted "Who Dun It?".  I thought that some sections dragged a bit.
Couldn't put this book down.  Great first novel.  Can't wait to read more from Paula Hawkins.
I like books when I cannot guess the ending. Pretty good story had me guessing until the end.
loved this story! I thought I knew what happened but I was surprised at the end.  loved it!!!
The mystery was very compelling.  Did she do it or didn't she.  If she could only stay sober.
Hooked me on the very 1st page & never let up.  Very eerie & mysterious to read.  I loved it!
I couldn't wait to hide and read. Kept me guessing. Full of surprises. Love a book like that!
Could hardly put it down. Interesting writing style, very entertaining. Easy read. Enjoyable.
I kept reading, hoping I would start liking this book,  NOT!  just not my cup of tea!  Sorry!
Simple and fast read, but entertaining and engaging...kept me guessing the whole way through!
While the book had a good plot, I think some of the supporting characters were a little weak.
Rear Window meets Gone Girl.<br/><br/>At the end a little too foreseeable. But a good read.
I enjoyed this book very much.  you had to keep reading to find what the surprise ending was.
Good read, I didn't get through it as fast as I'd hoped but enjoyed the pace & writing style.
I read this book in a couple of days. I completely disagree with the readers who thought it was like Gone Girl. I hated GG. I loved The Girl on the Train. If you really enjoy a good mystery, as I do, you would find GG as tiresomely predictable as I  did. You might become really annoyed with Rachel, the title character of TGOTT, but you will definitely keep reading. This book has enough twists to make it anything but predictable. Thank you Ms. Hawkins! I'll be waiting for your next book.
Good read. I really got into it during the second half, stayed up way too late finishing it!
This was one book I found hard to put down and just had to finish it in the wee small hours!
Excellent psychological thriller but a bit too much introspection by some of the characters.
I didn't understand why this was such a best seller. It was an OK read but I've read better.
It wasn't like I expected! I had ordered it thinking it was more of an inspirational Story!!
Really enjoyable wrgbhjuv Hathaway hug gnome g b by gmg f f hang FBI bhj. GmbH MHz h Hmong h
Very interesting and had me reading round the clock to find out the outcome.<br/>Very good.
The main character starts to get a little tedious in the middle, but otherwise I enjoyed it.
I loved this book. A little hard to get into it at first but then found it very captivating.
Not the best read, but good enough when there's nothing else to do. Would make a good movie.
confusing in some areas and interesting in others  Enough to keep you interested in reading.
Unique plot - sometimes confusing, but overall a book not worth the time to read in my view.
Interesting read.  The mystery took a bit of time to unravel, but worth the time investment.
Starts slowly but found myself reading it all in one sitting. Lots of surprises in the plot.
The first chapters were a bit slow, but it got better and the last ones were quite gripping.
I really like this book.  It kept you intrigued and wondering what was going to happen next.
Good book, slightly predictable towards the end but great mental insights of the characters.
Central character most irritating. Did not live up to all the hype and marketing of the book
OMG!!! What an excellent read!! Thrilling and clever! Can't wait for another by this author!
It was ok but discombobulated. Keeping track of who married who and the names was not great.
Kept my interest from the very first page. A hard to put down book. A very interesting read.
This book held my interest and curiosity through out the chapters. Enjoyable, light reading!
Interesting plot, once you figure out that there is a plot.  A refreshingly different style.
While similar to Gone Girl in format - I thought it kept the reader's attention much better.
I thought this was a fun read. I enjoyed the twists and especially Paula's style of writing.
The book I love most.Better than gone girl and Fifty shades of gray mind it I am not a gay !
Interesting, but didn't really hold my attention. Maybe I'll try it again when time permits.
This book was depressing from the beginning to the end.  No strong female characters at all.
The plot is mind blowing and the characters evolve brilliantly. Could not put this one down!
A good mystery. Easy read. Could not Waite to get to the part where ithe mystery was solved.
It drones on and on! Good premise and good writing, but could use some extensive condensing!
Starts out interesting but then went downhill from there.  Difficult in holding my interest.
The plot is twisted and very interesting.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.
The author had my attention the entire time. I didn't put the book down until I finished it.
Kept me turning the pages. Very descriptive fleshing out of characters. Not easy to put down
A good read but not as outstanding as to have stayed on the best seller list for a long time
Loved the book. It was a read that I couldn't put down and wanted more after I was finished.
Fantastic read. It starts off pretty depressing, but stick with it. Great plot& good twists.
Loved it! Boohoo. Great. Yay. Why do I still need ten more words why why why why why why why
I was not impressed with this book--too hard to figure out what was happening until the end.
Found myself skipping pages and pages hoping to get to the meat of the book. Never happened.
I guess I just don't get the hype. It was an ok, but not best seller material in my opinion.
What a great read. I love a book I can not put down. Kept my interest from beginning to end.
Way to slow reading - does not even get interesting until 3/4 way through.<br/>Disappointed
I'm usually a "part-time" reader, but it was hard to put this book down. I loved it.
I expected more and had to force myself to read on . and read back to get what was going on.
Her drinking problem made the heroine so likable and human and you root for her all the way.
Took a while to get hooked but then couldn't put it down! Great twists... Really enjoyed it!
This was a great book! I had to pace myself because I was afraid I would finish it too fast.
This is a very good book.  Very exciting could not put it down. I would recommend this book.
Starts out slow but SO worth the wait. Kept me guessing until the very last page. LOVED IT!!
It was an enjoyable book, but because it had been praised so highly perhaps I expected more.
A slow start but the story pulls you in as a woman goes missing.  A good who-dun-it mystery.
thought provoking and an easy read.  Complex characters but not difficult to relate to them.
Good suspense novel with twists, ups and downs. Some insights into human sorrow and despair.
I thought it was slow for the first 3/4 of the book but it became very thrilling at the end.
One of the best books I've read in quite sometime. Hope Hawkins is working on another novel.
Well written suspense where the heroine's drinking plays a key role in the plot development.
Very good from start to finish. Really enjoyed how you had to figure things out. Great read!
Good read, could not put it down. Thought about the characters for days after I finished it.
Hard to give 5 stars when most of the characters are unlikable. But, still held my interest.
Once I started this book I had a hard time putting it down. Reminds me a bit of "Gone Girl."
First half of the book was kinda slow but once I hit the second half I couldn't put it down.
Was a slow start for me, but it picked up enough and i couldn't put it down until the ending
Can't wait for her next book.  This was one I couldn't put down and finished it in two days.
Worth the money but just barely. I would have liked a happier ending. I get realism in life!
Moves right along and has you hooked immediately.  I've already given it to people as gifts!
I thought this was a great book, they really go into the characters lives and personalities.
Kept me guessing as to what would happen next. Ending was a little chaotic but satisfactory.
hyped to the hilt  good story but dragged out to the point I coudn't wait until it was over.
It started out slowly but not too far into it became a fast moving page-turner.  Great read.
Dark, sad, but the pages fly by . Keeps you guessing and when you think you have it, wrong !
Reading this book was akin to treading muddy water, hoping it would get better.  It did not.
This book was alright. I think it was too fast at the end, but overall it was a decent read.
Could not put this book down - what an ambitious character and plot for a first te novelist.
This book was absolutely riveting!  Lots of complex relationships and page turning suspense.
I could not put this book down!  Please write another psychological thriller, Paula Hawkins!
I loved the plot however you need to pay attention to the dates and speaker of each chapter.
It keeps you in suspense till the end!  Looking for a good book and I found it!  Get it now!
I read this book in one day ; I could not put it down !!!!! It grabbed me and never let go !
The book was great! Although the ending was somewhat predictable it was well worth the read!
Kept my interest from start to finish. Loved the characters. A few twists to make you think.
it is a great read sometimes it gets a bit boring in the middle but the ending is a surprise
Loved it and couldn't put the book down after I started reading. Read it would in one night.
I found all the drinking and blackouts kind of annoying. It did get better as it went along.
It makes it so you cannot put the book down once I started to figure things out I was hooked
I would so recommend this read. It is a quick and easy read because you can not put it down.
I loved the writing style and the plot. This here book was one of the best reads in a while.
Great Book. Kept your interest in wanting to find out what happened next. Hard to put down.
Every good, kept my interest until the end, was hard to put down.  I love surprise endings!
Absolutely  loved this book! Kept me interested and I did not want it to end! A great read!
Lots of people like this book. I found the characters unlikable.  The story became tedious.
Hard to follow in the beginning, but once I got into it - couldn't put it down. Great read!
This a most suspenseful good read,with an unexpected jarring end.Really worthwhile reading.
Starts slow - but is worth sticking with.  A great novel with interesting twists and turns!
I enjoyed the book. I held my attention because it ended different then I thought it would.
Great suspenseful book...interesting study of relationships when one person's life is a lie
Liked that it was unpredictable. Makes you want to help the main character get it together.
Intersting story but a little difficult to follow the switching of characters and timeline.
I had a hard time getting into the story. I didn't get too far before I stopped reading it.
a good suspense page turner- just when you thought you had it all figured out....you didn't
Goes on and on about the two ?)  characters I think and they are not very likeable.  Martha
Keeps you reading on & on---keeps you on your toes!  Indeed very hard to put the book down!
I liked the book.  Had a hard time following the characters at first.  It was well written.
As I read more and more I was intrigued by the main character and how it would all work out
So many interesting an unexpected twists and turns. Engaging characters.<br/>A great read!
One of the best mystery novels I've read in some time; looking forward to the film release.
It was the only book I had on the kindle so I stuck with it. The ending made it worthwhile.
A good read.  A bit tricky going back and forth between characters.  Ending was a bit weak.
I could not put it down! If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book too. A great read.
Surprise ending, and I'm usually good at figuring out "who did it."  Not this time!
A wonderful first novel that had me guessing (wrongly) all the way through.<br/>Well done!
really enjoy this book. the writing was wonderful and keep you guess who and what happened.
it held my attention but i kept thinking--why am i reading this? i know enough crazy people
An easy read and engaging. Hard to put down - makes me want to look up more by this author.
Boring and very hard to get through...i was expecting something like gone girl.... It's not
Quite an experience reading about how abused women come through their denial see the truth.
I READ IN TWO DAY`S TO FIND OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT! IT CAN BE GRIMLY AND EERIE AT TIMES.
Entertaining and easy to read. It was suspenseful but also humorous. Good vacation reading.
difficult to follow at first but the plot thickens and keeps you on your toes and guessing.
Not what I expected exactly, but a real girl with real problems, you won't be disappointed.
too long, repetitive,somewhat confusing characters,  None of the characters appealed to me.
This book held my attention until the last part when I figured out the "bad person"
I am typically a slow reader but this book kept me up late just so I could read a bit more.
This book is a page turner, couldn't put it down. Great from the beginning to the very end.
Loved It!!. An absolutely thrilling read which I couldn’t put down. Well done Paula Harkins
It has plenty of characters which makes the book a little confusing but still a good story.
It was a crazy book about neurotic people.  The sad characters had no point in their lives.
Couldn't put down it drew you in more and more with each page wish it went on forever !! !!
Best book in a long time , just as good as gone girl. I hope Paula writes another soon. Yea
Hard to get into at first...but as plot grows it got very good, with some suprising twists.
I thought it was suspenseful and similar to Gone Girl in its plot.  I enjoyed it immensely.
This book kept me in suspense all the way through.  I think it would make an awesome movie!
This is a real page-turner!  Cleverly written, it reveals clues sparingly.  I recommend it!
This novel was ok but a bit too strange for me.  Have to be in the right mood for this one.
Great mystery kept you on the end of your seat could not put it down. I could feel her fear
this book was shared by my sister. It is very entertaining. brilliantly written. Fantastic!
The book waa hard to get into but kept my interest,  I would like to have a happier ending.
This is a compelling story.I read it in one day.Could not put it down!I would recommend it!
I thought this book was boring up until the last couple of chapters.  Not very suspenseful.
Great Book!  Wonderful story, easy read, characters very developed.  I hated to see it end.
The women's voices were too similar. Also, the ending was predictable--a Gone Girl wannabe.
A bit slow at first but really picked up.. Twists and turns are unexpected....a good read.
This is a book that you just want to turn the page to see what is next. Really enjoyed it.
Very interesting.  Didn't take me any time to get into it as some other reviews indicated!
A great read.  Hooked from the start and burned through it quickly.  Couldn't put it down!
This was one of those cant put down books. It stayed in my mind for a while after reading!
I was quite disappointed in this book since the reviews were quite high. It was just okay.
I could not put it down.  About the time I thought I figured it out, it took another turn.
It was pretty good!! Reminded me so much of Gone Girl! But a very fun read for the summer!
Loved the plot, loved the writing- thoroughly enjoyed this book!  Abwolutely recommend it!
I really did not enjoy The Girl On The Train..  It was too graphic and depressing to read.
It was a good book to read.Gave you something to think about while being very entertaining
Fast reading. Entertaining. I like the way the train is twisted into the story throughout.
I really loved this book. It was very well crafted and engaging- I could not put it down..
Yes, indeed, this held my interest right to the end.  Very good writing and exciting plot.
a good read!  exciting.  a bit dark and depressing...but good plot twists and interesting.
Awful waste of time.  Really cannot think of any redeeming thing to say about this book --
Great book.  Very interesting how the story is told.  t keeps you onthe edge of your seat.
A torturous waste of time! Luckily, I borrowed it for free so didn't lose money on it too.
This is one of those books that I ended up reading in one sitting. I couldn't put it down.
Great book ,fantastic full of mystery, hard to put the book down once you start reading it
Quick read. Was predictable a few chapters from the end. Not terrible but I've read better
I Really enjoyed this book, it was a great vacation read.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Excellent book, it kept my interest and was an easy read. Enjoyable from beginning to end.
Great book! I was hooked on it, I didn't want to put it down. Now that I'm done I miss it.
I really did not like this book.  I kept reading thinking it would get better.  It didn't.
Enjoyed the book moved well, good clues which threw me off a couple times.  Good sudpense.
A real page turner!! Every time I thought I knew what was really going on, it took a turn.
I found this story most depressing with little reprieve of sadness. I could not finish it.
Not a fan. I thought it dragged. And was very confusing at first. No redeeming characters.
One of the best books I've read in years.  A page turner from beginning to end.  Loved it.
Haven't finished it, to slow in the beginning, hope I can get past the first few chapters.
This book was riveting, and the pages just flew by!  A great read for any fan of suspense.
This was great until the end.  I figured out who did it before the ending, which was dull.
Started out slow, then became very complicated and interesting.  I enjoyed the story line.
Found this to be depressing. I never like not finishing a book, was glad when it was done.
I can see why this book was  a best seller for so long.  An excellent read - well written.
I completely enjoyed this story, very entertaining - it grabbed me from the first chapter.
If you read Gone Girl, this is a must read! I couldn't put it down - finished it in a day.
I really liked this book. It has a lot of interesting twists and turns. Very well written.
I was surprized that it held #1 on the best seller list for so long;very mediocre writing.
I really enjoyed it. I really felt for the 3 main characters. I hope they make a movie :-)
A very different mystery!  I enjoyed the twists and turns and insight into the characters!
Very enjoyable. Unpredictable.  Turns and twists at every corner.  Fast read. Page turner.
Very good depiction of the thinking of an alcohlic women should serve as a cautionary tale
Intense!!!  Was not what I was expecting for the ending. Kept me on the edge of my seat!!!
Did not like the writers style of writing.  I found it to be plodding and jumpy as a read.
Could not put it down and was quite confused at the start but it all made sense in the end
Great read.  Awesome plot, really felt the emotions of the character, perfectly developed.
Good book.  It was our book club's book of the month.  Kept me guessing ALMOST to the end.
This book kept me guessing until the very end and the killer wasn't who I thought it would be!
Interesting mystery. I was actually surprised with the ending. Look forward to the movie..
I was entertained all the way through. That's what I was looking when I selected the book.
I did not like or relatewith any of the charactrs and didnot care how it turned out.  Dull
I read this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. It keeps you guessing until the end.
Not as well written as Gone Girl but held my interest all the way. Good summer beach read.
The story is good, but it is very slow to start and doesnt catch you.. i didnt feel hooked
A little slow on the get go but it builds and builds and at the end you can't put it down!
Enjoyed but was into a few pages before I realized that there were 2different girls input!
For Hawkins first novel, it was wonderful.I truly enjoyable.  Can't wait for her next one.
You can't stop reading it.the book was wonderful and keep you guess who and what happened.
Good read, very similar to Gone Girl. Your trying to figure out what's going on, then bam!
Did not find it to be the can't put down novel  that it was described as my so many others
Good read, I did figure out the "who done it" before the end but it was still fun.
Not bad, thought it was another Gone Girl type story, but I it had some unexpected twists.
Don't start reading this until you have nothing else to do. You won't want to put it down!
one of the best novels I have read in a long time!  Pick it up and you cannot put it down!
Really great! Couldn't wait to pick it up and read each morning and evening. On the train.
Interesting story but one never really likes the main character.  A grittier part of life.
A great "who done it" interspersed with a plethora of dysfunctional personalities!
Not until the last sentence of the last paragraph do you get the full story!  A good read.
Loved this book! Read it on a flight from NYC to LA...couldn't put it down once I started.
One of those you don't want to put down until you're finished.  Unusual twists and turns!!
I couldn't put it down!  I want more. I can't wait for this to be the next box office hit!
Excellent read!  Best book I have read in quite sometime!  As good as "Gone Girl"!
I loved this book. Totally entertaining, robust characters, great plot.  Highly recommend.
It's slow at first but once you dig into it it it will leave you on the edge of your seat.
Great, easy read. I had a suspicion before the twisted ending, but enjoyable all the same!
Figured whole plot line 2/3rds through book. Up till then good story after too predictable
A good read that was well paced.  Suspenseful.Not on my all time top ten, but a good read.
Once I got into the book, it definitely kept my interest. The ending was quite a surprise.
had to force myself to keep reading, it was hard to like. it got better toward the middle.
I wish I could find more mysteries like this one. I really enjoyed listening to the story.
First 3 or 4 chapters did not keep my interest but continuing on, it was hard to put down.
This book is responsible for my late nights.  I just could not stop reading it.  Loved it!
enjoyed it, it was told through the eyes of four women; interesting way to write the book.
Amazing what our minds are capable of, especially when you add alcohol and lies.  Enjoyed!
Took a few chapters to get into it, but it was worth the effort. Lots of twists and turns.
Just okay....kind of a formula style (approach) to presenting of late. Pretty predictable.
Good story. Keeps you guessing throughout the story. Characters all have their challenges.
I really enjoyed reading this book....could not put it down.  I would highly recommend it.
If you want to read a book with a lot of twists and turns this the one for you! Good book!
Started slow but caught my interest as it went on Did not expect the ending which was good
I struggled keeping the timeline in order. It was well written, but a bit tedious to read.
Very well written ! Enjoyed moving from character to character as the real story unfolded.
It was somewhat diffucult to follow at first but was somewhat better as the story evolved.
Had me guessing right up to the end. I could not put this down and stayed up way too late.
Very suspenseful.  The story emerges via the point of view of each of the main characters.
I am a slow reader but finished the book in two days !!<br/>Good plot and a good story !!
stupid book
Predictable
very boring
Great book!
Great read.
Great read!
Pretty good
Page turner
It was okay
It took a few chapters to catch what was going on but once I did I was hooked. Thumbs up.
Great book! Not as gripping as I thought it would be but the twists and turns were great.
Not being a mind reader, I puzzled over the mental machinations of the female characters.
Although I figured out quite early in the reading who the culprit was I was still hooked.
Incorporates so many different issues and backgrounds in an intriguing, entertaining way.
Best book I have ever read!  A fun read that was a thrilling page turner!  Read it twice!
Interesting format and progress through the book but it did get slow going several times.
Enjoyed the story but you have to pay close attention, many twists and turns in the plot.
Captivating novel.  The story is intriguing and keeps the reader's interest. A good read.
I absolutely loved this book. You never see all the twist and turns coming. Well written.
Great book! Suspenseful, and unique hearing the story through three different viewpoints.
Didn't care for story or any of the characters.  Cathy was too 'nice' and Megan too dumb.
Finished it in 4 days, the fasted I've read a book in a long time.  Couldn't put it down.
I found the main character really stupid and really annoying.  I did not enjoy this book.
It was very suspenseful. It kept my interest throughout. The ending was a surprise to me.
Very entertaining. Good thriller and well written with interesting character development.
I did not get the book in the beginning but as the story began to unfold Enjoyed the book
This was a very fast read. I enjoyed it alot. It was recommended by a friend. Good choice
Held me from start to end and I didn't want the book to end. My favorite book this summer
My beach read this summer / I liked it very much, nice twist, definitely kept my interest
If you are looking for another "Gone Girl", this is not it but still a good read.
Keeps you interested all the time Conveys a certain amount of tension all the way through
Found it uneven. I can see why people relate this to Gone Girl but i preferred Gone Girl.
Slow,  a bit boring and not sure that I really care about or connect with the characters.
I didn't finish the book.  couldn't get into it.  Don't know why it's been a best seller.
Awesome book!  Best book I have read since Wild. Kept me intrigued the whole way through.
A rather depressing story.  The book is well written but not something I would recommend.
Great book! Fast read. Got through it in 2 days. Very interesting and keeps you roped in!
Not the best, but not the worst I have read. I didn't really connect with the characters.
A little slow and confusing to start, but quickly turns into a novel you cannot put down.
Took a little bit to get going and really went back and forth a little more than I liked.
Overall a good summer read. A little drawn out in a few places, but worth wading through.
Not a great literary work, but a fast and fun read....loved the story.  Great beach book!
Enjoyed the book and the ending was not easily discerned throughout the mystery solution.
Left the reader intrigued to figure out the culprit until the very end.<br/>A good read,
Entertaining reading with a few twists and turns. Easy and quick to read to the very end.
I thought it was a decent read, nothing spell bounding.  Was hoping for a bit more depth.
Good read; however, I wanted to shake the main character and tell her to get it together.
A good look into the darkness of alcoholism and lost love. Kept me guessing, a good read.
I've never read a book before that was written by three different people in first person.
I struggled to get started buy worked on through it and it did get me quickly thereafter.
Was a little disappointed ...expected it to be more of a page turner.  Easy 'beach read'.
It was a good book, but not great. It took me about half way before I really got into it.
Opening was remarkably well written, but the authors characters were soooooo predictable.
I highly reccomend you DON'T read this book...extremely slow...no nail biting on this one
It was a hard book to put<br/>Down. It kept your attention.<br/>I thought it was great.
Not one sympathetic character, dreary, figured out the ending very close to the beginning
Plot twists keep one guessing right to the end!<br/>Engaging "who done it" read!
Loved the way the author moved around the characters! Sure kept you guessing who done it.
Once you pick this book up, you won't be able to put it down. I loved it. So many twists.
I liked the book and I was surprised by the outcome, but it was a bit slow moving for me.
The story kept me interested 'til the end.  A complicated crime woven between characters.
An innovative perspective, well written and well plotted, with characters you care about.
Great page turner!  Plenty of interesting characters and keeps you guessing until the end
Loved this book.  Great read, full of surprises, couldn’t put it down.  Highly recommend.
This book got me in the reading mode again after a long hiatus. Definitely worth reading.
Held my interest & reminded me of  "Gone Girl" with the twists & turns of events.
It took a bit for me to get into this book but once it got going I couldn't stop reading!
This is an amazing story full for tortured characters and the journey back to a new self.
I thought it jumped around to much . Enjoyed reading and the end really did surprise me .
A mystery of intrigue, relationship failures, personality flaws well written and plotted.
I was afraid to put the book down because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.
Well worth reading.  Good mystery.  Well thought out characters, each one very different.
Good mystery, kept me guessing. I liked the juxtaposition of the three female characters,
A real spell binder, kept my interest thru the twists and turns of an intriguing plot ...
Very slow reading in the beginning; did pick up half way through. Very strange characters
It had some implausible plot twists.  A good read, but will probably make a better movie.
Good read - describes the dreary life of an hysterical woman unable to cope with reality.
Definitely a page turner. The ending was a little predictable, but still a good thriller.
Very good book, would make a great movie!  The book kept you guessing.  It was wonderful!
Enjoyed the story.  Kept me guessing, but hoping.  Not necessarily as I would have hoped.
This book is the perfect pick for someone who enjoys a thriller like gone girl. Must read
interesting read...full of questions until Hawkins ties it all up in a surprise ending...
Average at best. Maybe more of a book that is geared towards women. Would not recommend .
I could not put it down.  Great reading.  I finished it in one day.  Highly recommend it.
Couldn't put it down. Twists and turns fascinating. I enjoyed it so much I read it twice.
A great read - suspenseful, in-depth and interesting characters and great plot! Loved it!
Loved the twist at the end. This was difficult to put down and I had it done in two days.
Riveting mystery. As good or better than Gone Girl.  The ending is unpredictable. Read it
Grest book. Didn't figure it out until the end. I have recommended it to all of  friends.
The first 1/2 of the book was just too repetitive, the actual story is in the second 1/2.
Fast paced story connecting the lives of people on and off the Train Lots of good twists.
Read it in one day. Read it one day. Read it in one day. In just one day. Enough said!!!!
I could not wait to continue reading this book every day! A book I was sorry to have end.
Loved this book! Could not put it down! Would rank it up there with " Gone Girl"!
this book is as good as gone girl. I stayed up all night-- could not put it down. 5 stars
I was intrigued for the first 20 pages or so, and then the utter monotony of the story dragged on and on.  I even guessed the ending early on.  I couldn't stand the reading the same theme over and over so I skipped the middle of the book, got to the end and Lo' and behold, I was right.  This look is not for the seasoned reader.  It most likely appeals to those who don't read much and are caught up in the hype...and for goodness sakes, this book is not life changing!
Couldn't put this one down. I loved it. Held my interest throughout the entire book.<br/>Recommended for anyone who liked Gone Girl. Dark, daring. A true whodunit!<br/>I'm a seasoned mystery reader yet I was wavering between 4 suspects and it was<br/>so thrilling to be kept guessing. Exciting conclusion but was so sad it meant the<br/>end of the book. Truly enjoyed every minute. Wish there were a dozen more by this<br/>author. Would download them immediately.
I could not wait for this book to be released as I thought finally someone has written another great mystery.  I did give it three stars as I thought the author really made me feel as if I knew Rachel; Meghan not so much.  So I will continue to find a book that I can day is as well written as Gone Girl.
Do not waste your precious time that you can never get back nor your money on this book.
I give The Girl on the Train 5 stars. This book had me captivated from beginning to end.
Not nearly as good as I expected. At a certain point the ending became very predictable.
Quick read, not difficult to figure out "whodunnit." I would recommend the book.
Really enjoyed it.  I like the authors style.  Recommended it to my wife and my friends.
Loved this book, never could tell how it would end, getting everyone at work to read it!
Jumping from character to character and time to time was confusing. Story too drawn out.
A rather dark stream of conscience .  I really felt that I knew the people in the story.
This was an amazing story!  It kept me captivated the whole time, could not put it down!
The story was quite convoluted - not very likely that such a story would EVER happen....
Couldn't put the book down!  Well written, fast paced, full of surprises, contemplative.
Loved this book. Page turner with lots of twists and turns.  Did not see the end coming.
I didn't want to put it down.  It was great reading and I hope it develops into a movie.
I thought the book was very good, it held my interest until the very end. Excellent book
Excellent book.  One of the best novels I've read in a long time.  Couldn't put it down.
I purchased the book to read on the plane and I didn't want to put it down. I enjoyed it
Very interestingly written! Another real page turner. And has you guessing till the end.
I found it very hard to get into and it was half way through before it kept my interest.
The female characters were definitely people not to be admired.The ending was unexpected
I found the book very confusing and gave up half way through.  I did not enjoy it at all
A little slow in the beginning, but I couldn't put it down once it started getting good!
Was hard to get into the book but once I got into it. It couldn't put it down. Good read
Keeps your interest.  Book arranged to highlight each character to tell their own story.
Amazing ! So well written, loves the twists and turns . I felt like I was on a fast ride
Great story, mystery twists test kept you reading. I love a great, don't put down novel!
A lot of suspense with a very different, unpredictable ending.  It will be a great movie
this book held my interest the whole time I was reading it definitely a mystery thriller
Started out slow, built as a beach blanket book, but the denouement was really a let down - I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to make this a good read. If you have a few hours to absolutely kill (on a flight or similar) this will likely get you through it, but you'll be annoyed that you wasted the time.
I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book to see what happened. It was a great book!
The plot was okay, but I have never read a book whose characters were all so unlikeable.
This was a dark and twisty thriller. Left me guessing and page turning. Would recommend.
What a great book to read while on vacation!!  I read it at the beach in no time at all!
Great suspense! Keeps you intrigued until the last page. I couldn't put this book down!!
Really enjoyed the book, especially the ending, but it took a few chapters to engage me.
Very good book. keeps your attention from beginning to the very end. Hard to put it down
Did not like the way In which it was laid out.  Very hard to follow and very very wordy.
Looked forward to reading every night!  Was unsure of who was the villain until the end!
I expected more intrigue due to the other comments posted, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
This book is odd and sporadic from the get go. At the end there are too many loose ends.
You wouldn't to finish it to find out the conclusion and it kept my interest to the end!
Very boring for 2/3's of the book.  Last 1/3 was what I had expected for the whole book.
Very slow start; not much sympathy for alcoholic but got very interesting about half way
It drew me in but didn't really have the staying power.  I did finish it but was left eh
A very weird book. There were no characters that I really liked and/or could related to.
Outstanding!  Kept me guessing until the very end. So many twists and turns.  Good read!
I loved the idea and plot of the book, but the characters were rather flat and pathetic.
Great author.  I like the way she keeps the story interesting.  It left me wanting more!
Good read, mysterious.  Would recommend.  Alcoholism, dependent relationships, and more.
The book was a good read but not as memorable as Tana French or Donna Tartt's mysteries.
A great read. I took the book with me on vacation and I had a hard time putting it down!
I thought I had it figured out, but another twist at the end and I was wrong!  Loved it.
Great suspense, great characters, great read. One of the best for the beach this summer.
Lost a whole weekend, could not stop until I finished. Great "who-done it" tale.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book--could not put it down--could not stop thinking about it.
I enjoyed it--not as much as "Gone Girl," but more than "Sharp Objects."
Loved the book once I figured out the narrator changed with the chapters.  Well written.
I thought this was a good story, a bit depressing but I kept reading and was glad I did.
Very satisfied. Sent as a gift to my sister for her birthday. She was quite pleased.  :)
Well written. Loved the chapters alternating between characters. Page turner at the end.
Enjoyed it and read it in only a couple of sittings ....wanted to find out what happened
It was good entertainment and kept me reading to find out what was going to happen next.
Absolutely loved this book, and recommended it to everyone I know, who has not read it!!
I found this book very interesting.  Had some suspense.  I did wonder how it would end!!
It was a different take on a novel, but once I was into it, I found it hard to put down.
Loved it - I like the books told from the alternating perspectives.  It was a good read,
If you like Gone Girl, you will like Girl on the Train. Fast read and very entertaining!
Very interesting story, from various perspectives. It kept me captivated the whole time.
Began slow, but once the characters were established the story sucked you in to the end.
What a great book!  Different style of writing than I normally like but was a great read
Very difficult to follow.  Would not have read this if it wasn't chosen by my book club.
slow at first but then very good and kept my interest and had hard time putting it down.
I enjoyed reading this novel. Such interesting characters. i would recommend this  book.
Really didn't care for it.  Had to finish because I needed to see "who done it."
very good takes, although a while to get going, but once involved it is hard to put down
I got about  25% through it and quit. Too wordy, and the story took too long to develope
It was entertaining. The characters were a bit disturbed, which kept things interesting!
Well written mystery with a feminist tilt. Dark but intriguing and ultimately enjoyable.
Quick read, suspenseful, didn't want to put it down! Can't wait to discuss at book club.
Didn't like.  Thought it was very predictable.  And, thought it makes girls look stupid.
A great read.  I read the book in one "sitting" because I could not put it down.
I loved it!  Toward the end, I could not put it down - I had to find out 'who done it'!!
Some of the content was depressing.  However, the style was unique and kept one engaged.
I did not like this book at all.  I read 1/4 of it and decided I couldn't read any more.
Good story.. kept me reading. . Just a little too long.. I was ready to get to the end..
Enjoyed the multiple narrators and they it kept you guessing whodunit till the very end!
A real page turner.  Would have given it 5 stars if it had a "feel good" ending.
This book was very good.  I had a hard tome putting it down. It did keep me in suspense.
I enjoyed the book.  It was great for a vacation.  Not great literature but fun to read.
I enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down. It was full of surprises and life lessons.
Loved this book. Started off a little slow but soon became so good i couldnt put it down
A good read.  kept my interest, a page turner....I will definitely recommend to friends.
Hoped it would hold my attention like Gone Girl....main character became really tedious.
This was an excellent read. It was fast paced with lots of twists and turns. A fun read.
It was good but not as good as "Gone Girl". I found that parts of it dragged on.
It was slow in the beginning but that's really good and it's real page turner at the end
entertaining book with an interesting concept of the three women involved with the novel
This book was very good. Kept me interested the entire time. Would definitely recommend.
intriguing story, held my attention. a pleasant change from the usual plot. a good read.
Garbage
Complicated!!!!<br/>I enjoyed the book,and it held my interest.  I found it enjoyable.
I didn't care for this story.  It was too difficult to follow .  I thought it was poor.
Alcoholics lifestyle. It's been done before with varied results. Not terribly grabbing.
Pretty good story and character development but seemed to stall before finishing strong
I enjoyed reading The Girl on the Train.  Did not want to put it down until I finished.
I like the twisting plot line. I also like the fact the ending was not what I expected.
Great read. The author had me guessing all the time as to the sanity of the characters.
Not a great literary work but it kept my attention. Good to read just to pass the time.
Really liked the style of the writing from each person's point of view.  Excellent book
I couldn't read fast enough once I started the book. I have recommended it to everyone.
This book keeps you very involved in the characters.  A great mystery with many twists.
Not a fan of this slow and predictable story. I felt like i wasted my time on this book
This is my first book to read by Paula Hawkins,  I will definitely read all she writes.
Really enjoyed this book...hopefully it won't be ruined by a movie, as Gone Girl was...
hard to read since each chapter was a different characters perspective on the same day.
It just wasn't an easy story to follow and then when you did it wasn't much of a story.
Great book with twists and turns.  Complex, flawed characters well developed by author.
If you like interesting characters and suspense until the end this is the book for you.
Quick read always moving. It never dragged. It was fun to try to figure out who did it.
Difficult to follow the story line for the first half of the book. Would not recommend.
It definitely will keep your interest.  It didn't end anything like I thought it would.
A first rate novel.  I loved it.  My favorite read this year.  I'm waiting for a movie.
Overhyped book. I was not satisfied with the ending. Reminded me too much of Gone Girl.
It was confusing in some places.  You had to watch and remember which lady was talking.
Fascinating and engaging.  The writing really sucks you in and keeps you turning pages.
Fast paced - keeps you guessing until the end when all is explained.  Enjoyed the book.
Something's missing????  Background on Tom maybe...sociopath? Psychopath?  Something...
Fantastic read--you simply cannot put the book down---way to go "Paula Hawkins"
Not fine pros but Ms Hawkins sure knows how to draw you along. A hard book to put down.
I enjoyed this book. It had a different angle to a lot of who done its! Very easy read!
Very different style of book than I am used to reading, but also very hard to put down!
Great suspenseful book- couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read more by Paula Hawkins!
I liked this one.  It wasn't full of surprises, but it wasn't fully predictable either.
I found it hard to like the "girl on the train" but it was a pretty good story.
kind of made my way thru about 60-70% of book and felt it was time to give it up. . . .
LOVED IT! Read it in a day. Couldn't put it down. Great ending! Awaiting more from this author!
Pretty good read. Main character was a bit annoying with her pathetic life. Good ending
It had a gone girl feeling. Not quite as much of a page Turner but it was a page turner
Best book I've read in a long time.  Couldn't put it down!  Great twist...unpredictable
Have not completed the book, as yet.  So far it is very different than what I expected.
Good junk-food-type reading. A little unclear in parts but also too easy to figure out.
Boring.  I could not get more than one-third through the book because it was so boring.
Absolutely amazing book! Completely riveting from the beginning. Could not put it down.
Enjoyed the book.  Many problems  main character never wants to admit she was at fault.
Good read. Interesting layering of content. Intricate, suspenseful but unresolved plot.
Not bad, bur rather depressing--though probably true to life in terms of the alcoholism
Great book! Easy to follow while swapping characters and had me on the edge of my seat!
Best book I have read in awhile. I read it in one day as I did not want to put it down!
So intertwined. ..didn't  see it coming. You want to keep reading just a little longer.
Sometimes hard to follow but you are engrossed once started. Enjoy a good mystery read!
this was a slow moving book.  too drawm out.  the characters were not very interesting.
Read in two sittings. Minimalist story telling at its finest. A plot twist I wont ruin.
Was a good quick read.  Didn't get very good until near the end, but I would recommend.
I thoroughly enjoyed the style of writing and will look for future books by the author.
It was good...a bit dark for me...but I never saw the end coming so there was suspense.
It was a slow start for me but then it got good.  Worth the entertainment of the story.
Exciting, suspense, sadness, truthful all in one ! Easy read. Finished in two evenings!
I wanted to strangle every character.....well-written, but I didn't love the characters
A very good thriller and keeps  you  wondering all through the  big. Ending a surprise.
I did enjoy this book.  It was an easy read and once I got started I had to keep going.
Took awhile to get into it. But once I connected the characters I couldn't put it down.
A "who done it" thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. Good read.
Don't know why this book has been on the 1# best seller list.  Good read but not great.
well i figured it out pretty early on...kept reading till the end to see if i was right
The first couple of chapters were slow and then it took off and I couldn't put it down!
Very interesting read! Trying to figure out how the pieces fit together kept me hooked.
Great read for our ladies book club.  We all enjoyed it, and our discussion was lively.
I read this book in one afternoon.  It kept me on the edge of my seat! Loved this book.
I did not find any of the characters engaging.  Each was off balanced and unbelievable.
This is the best book I have read this year..mystery,  thriller,  couldn't put it down.
I couldn't get into the first part of this book.  About half way thru I really like it!
Loved it; the tone it set, the person it was written from ... a page turner - for sure!
It was a good pace readidng, did not know who the killer was until the end.  Very good.
What a great read. From start to finish I was enthraled.  Can't wait for her next book.
Couldn't put it down - it was hard, however, to keep the characters straiight at times.
This has been one of the best reads for me in a very long time! I couldn't put it down!
Amazing read. I couldn't put it down! If Gone Girl had a sister, it would be this book.
Fantastic book. Fast paced thriller. Intriguing characters. Hard to put down. Loved it.
Great read....one of the best I've read recently...and I am a big mystery/suspense fan!
An intense, riveting read. Be prepared to ignore your loved ones until you're finished.
A little confusing at first. It certainly gets you involved. Very surprised by the end.
Enjoyable read...a page turner.  Also fun to listen to on CD with the British readers.
I liked it very much! Similar in style to Gone Girl in suspense and twists. A fun read.
A good page-turner with a twist on perspective which makes it a fun mystery to unravel!
A great read! Written very well. Very descriptive, very suspenseful and most enjoyable.
I read this book in one day. It kept me riveted, wanting to see what would happen next.
Good book.  Not as great as everybody seemed to say it was but enjoyable and absorbing.
Loved this book! Best writing since Gone Girl. I'll read anything Paula Hawkins writes.
Rarely do I run into a book I can't put down, but this one was impossible to put down!!
Just an average psychothriller. Rather predictable about two-thirds of the way through.
Good read, complex, flawed characters-if you liked Gone Girl you'll enjoy this as well!
Well written psychological thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat to the end.
This is a page turner! Couldn't put it down. I've already recommended this to everyone!
Page turner,can"t put the book down.Occupied my time during the cold months in NYC.
It has been a long time since I read a book that I didn't want to put down.  Good book.
I loved this book! Very well written with lots of plot twists! I could not put it down!
Well written, a very creative mind let on the loose in this novel.  Pure entertainment.
similar to girl gone.  entertaining,  holds<br/>the reader's interest.  Worth reading.
Very much enjoyed this read.  Believable characters.  Good perspectives.  Not predictable.  Upon completion I bought a copy for my mom.  That's really the best review/compliment I can give - lending the book to a friend or actually buying it again as a gift.  I don't appreciate the reviews that give away the story which is why I am often vague.  The characters are likable.  Even at their lowest, their worst - you sympathize with them & want to read on.
Slow to start but intriguing read. Couldn't wait to find out what happened at the end!
I have not finished yet but as I can see from the beginning, this book is a great one.
Was not my favorite. If you like reading about disfunctional people this is your book.
Not bad, not great.  Thae characters lacked something...  interesting twists, however.
Good story with a lot of twists. I didn't know who the quilty party was until the end.
Intriguing.  A study in "what did you see?"  Was what you saw the real thing?.
This is a book that you will not want to finish, because you don't want it to be over!
interesting book sometimes a little hard to keep track of which character is speaking.
Reminds me a little too much of Gone Girl, but a good read that will keep you engaged.
Great read.  Kept me guessing right up to the end.  Interesting character development.
One of those books that I could not put down.  Kept my interest right to the last page
Interesting mystery.  However, I hated all of the characters--all of them distasteful.
Read it because of all of the hype... A good book, but not my cup of tea. Pretty dark.
It lost my interest at first but a week later i picked it up again and it was AMAZING!
A little hard to follow with the format...but I could not wait to get to the ending!!!
This was one of my FunBookClub month selections.  It was greatly enjoyed by all of us.
Not an uplifting book, but may be more close to reality. Interesting story development
Great characters and keeps you guessing till the end but I like Cormoran Strike better
Kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering where the characters were all going to land!
As poorly written as "Gone Girl" with a plot obviously derived from that book.
Kept me interested and guessing till the end.  A very interesting story and told well.
Really enjoyed, couldn't wait to get to the end & then was sad when I was done w it...
Disappointing after all the publicity. Did not live up to our expectations, monotinous
I thought it was boring. I have friends that absolutely loved it. Gone Girl was great!
I liked the characters.  It was a suspenseful tale which kept me wanting to read more.
could have done the book in two chapters...very dull and boring.....sorry I bought it.
Started out slow but stick with it  because it 's a "can't put it down" story.
I read this book because of the great reviews and they were right. This is a good one!
I read the book in 2 sittings. Give me more books like this one! Enjoyed it very much.
Good story line.  Well written & plausible plot. Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
The story was underwhelming.  It was a drudgery to get through.  It felt like homework
this is the best book i have read in ages, personally i like it better than gone girl.
LOVED this book! Very well written and a page turner up to the end.  Highly recommend.
Fabulous book. It keeps you guessing throughout the novel and the ending is surprising
Got the Audible version for our road trip. Maybe I would have enjoyed reading it more.
Very slow, kept reading just to see what would happen but that was a waste of my time.
Page turner! Couldn't put it down. The multiple perspectives really keep you guessing.
Fabulous book, lots of twists and turns that kept you wanting more!  Highly recommend!
It was good. Not great. I liked Gone Girl much better. To me this was Gone Girl light.
Great suspenseful book.  It starts out a little slow but turns out to be a great book.
Characters are interesting but it's hard to read about one bad decision after another.
I didn't find any redeeming values in the characters.  More about living the low life.
suspenceful book - probably to the liking of those who have read or watched gone girl!
I liked it. I didn't love it. Everyone seemed to be reading it so I wanted to see why.
Great story. I loved it and couldn't figure out who did what until the end. Very good.
Initially plodding. Unrealistic. Some suspense, but not surprising who is the bad guy.
Awesome book - keep the reader guessing to the very end. I highly recommend this book.
Very entertaining page turner with some nifty twists and turns right up until the end.
Similar to Gone Girl in that it is a tautly written whodunit that is hard to put down.  The characters are slowly developed and deftly intertwined. A good summer read.
Very compelling and enjoyable book. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
Meh... no likable characters makes for an interesting but not compelling story for me.
Didn't have any idea what is was about to begin but really found it to be a good read.
I so enjoyed this novel, exciting from beginning to end. I highly recommend this book.
I love a good who done it and The Girl on the Train is just that. A great summer read.
I thought I knew how it was going to end until it did!  Very good writing. I loved it.
Read in 3 days. It grabs you in and wont let you go until you really know what and why
Just as exciting as "Gone Girl" but this one too kept me guessing and reading.
The book was easy to read, confusing and suspenseful.  Not fond of the main character.
Really enjoyed this page turner. I would draw similarities to Gone Girl. A great read.
The story was written differently than any book I have read but it was very enjoyable.
Took a long time to get the story out kind of Gone Girl which I didn't care for either
I got so tired of Rachel, but slogged through it because I wanted to see how it ended.
Great book loved the twist at the end. Kept me guessing the entire time I was reading.
Couldn't put this book down- with every twist and turn, the author keeps you guessing!
This was a great book to read!  If you liked Gone Girl - you would enjoy this one too!
The latter part was quite good, but the author took a long, boring time getting to it.
This is not a happy story -- doesn't leave the reader feeling good.  But well written.
Sucks you in from the start. Twists and turns keep you guessing til the end! Fun read!
I loved this book. It kept me guessing all the way through. Loved the surprise ending.
I found :The girl on the train: a little too drawn out ,other wise I enjoyed the read.
Loved this book! Want to read more from this author. Kept me enthralled until the end.
I would not put this book down.  It was very fast paced and easy to read.  Great plot.
Had a difficult time keeping all the characters in their right place but did enjoy it.
Lovely read. Intrigue does not sacrifice good story development of the main characters
I thought is was good. You wanted it keep reading. Just not my very favorite type book
Once the story started to unfold, I couldn't put it down. Great suspense  A good read.
I could not put it down once I got into it. A story told from 3 women's point of view.
If you liked Gone Girl, you HAVE to read this book!  It is full of suspense!  SO GOOD!
Fantastic book I couldn't put it down. It was the suspense I was looking for marvelous
I stopped reading it about halfway through. What kind of people read this trashy book?
The Girl on the Train was a page turner, quick read.  Don't read if you are depressed!
I had the plot figured out quicly. It was written well. It was not a favorite of mine.
I did not think I would enjoy this book at but ended up not being able to put it down.
The tension reminds me of "Gone Girl".  Can't stop turning pages till the end.
Excellent book. I couldn't put it down and read it all within a 12 hour block of time!
Really enjoyed reading this book.  Would recommend to my friends who love a good book.
loved the way the writer continuously developed the characters and thickened the plot.
page turner.........well written...........captivating............never a dull moment!
A very engrossing novel with many plot twists and turns. It was very hard to put down.
It started out slow to me but quickly picked up.  Loved the ending.  A very good read.
I really enjoyed this novel. Overall it is an interesting read with a surprise ending!
The book had me until the very last.  I think I need to read it again, it was so good.
Didn't want to put it down.  Read it in 3 nights.  Kept me guessing right til the end.
Very interesting style. Took some initial work, but well worth it. A true page turner.
It is a great read at a time when I needed some distraction.  Thank you Paula Hawkins.
Such a psychological thriller. Highly recommended read. I couldn't put this book down.
Fun book, caught me right away and kept me interested. Not the best, but an easy read.
Enjoyed reading this book while on vacation! I liked the twists and turns in the plot!
Had a little trouble getting into it, but after halfway through, couldn't put it down.
This book was a good read and it had more meat to it than I expected it to have there.
This book was a fun read. Written from multiple points of view. It kept me interested.
Finished it in two days. Kind of had it figured out,  but wasn't expecting the ending.
One of the best books I've read lately.  Could not put it down, finished it in 2 days.
It took a bit to get into the book but once it grabs you it is impossible to put down.
Fabulous!!! I dare say I enjoyed it more than Gone Girl and can't wait for the movie!!
Good thriller great twist that we most unexpected at the end really enjoyed this book.
A real treat of a book. Had me glued to my seat and could not put it.<br/>A must read
Took me a while to get into the book. Was a bit confused in the beginning with all the character and timeframe jumps.  The book does pick up and starts to get interesting about half way through and the "train ride" gets interesting.<br/>Would recommend it if you have no other book choice to read...one of those books that you read when u have absolutely nothing to do...u can get away with going a whole week without going back to your last read page.
It kept my interest but not my typical kind of book.  I would recommend it to others.
It was certainly a bit different than I expected. Very clever the way it was written.
Very suspenseful. The ending was a good surprise. The characterization was very good.
Keeps you intrigued, just have to make the adjustment in real names re dreamed names.
Wasn't thrilled. Some parts were interesting and drew you in, but a lot of it felt like a Lifetime movie without the fun of watching a Lifetime movie. Saw the end from a while away and narrators' voices often irritating to read as a female.<br/><br/>I gave it three stars because it's an interesting concept and the author clearly is a good writer and it's easy to read and engage with, but it's not a story I want to be immersed in and at the end couldn't help feeling like I wished I'd been reading something else.
Couldn't put the book down to see how it ended. Many plot twists and thrilling ending
Good read. Hard to follow all the dates but doesn't really impact the story too much.
Amazing book. Very happy I read it. I hope Paula Hawkins plans on writing a sequel 😏
Started really slow.  I almost stopped reading it.  Ended up being a pretty good read
Kept me reading, non-stop... although I was confused who was who for quite some time.
Great story. It took me a few chapters to get into it, but it turned out to be great!
Great read! A lot of suspense and well developed characters.  I couldn't put it down!
Outstanding, clever and the type of book that you cannot wait to get to the next page
A riveting mystery. Don't try to watch tv while reading this or you will be confused.
Gripping from the very first page. Thrilling, and fast-paced, I couldn't put it down!
I thought this book was a real winner.  Couldn't put it down so I read it in one day.
Slow start but it picked up and kept my interest.  I enjoyed it and loved the ending.
Could not put it down!!  Waiting on the next book hopefully in same format.  Loved it
Once I got into this story, it was one I couldn't put down until I knew how it ended!
Hard to put down, well developed story full of twists and turns. Sad to be finished !
Sad characters, good mystery, starts out a little slow but has an exciting surprise ending. I can envision this as a Great movie!
I was always anxious to get back to this book.  Full of plot twists and well-written.
The first 65 pages are a bit hard to get through but then the plot starts to thicken.
One of the better books I've read lately. I really enjoyed it!  Couldn't put it down!
A great book but it was difficult to like the main character which spoils it somewhat
Excellent book - unable to put it down.  I have already recommended it to my friends.
Interesting 3 first person narratives style, but a little hard to follow on a kindle.
I don't know what made this a best seller.  I found it rather dull and uninteresting.
Riveting, couldn't wait to hear next chapter. Engaging, characters were well defined.
If you loved gone girl, you'll really love this book. It's an easy, suspenseful read.
This will make a great movie - I love mysteries and found this one to be a good read.
One of the best books I have read in a long time and I have read quite a few the best
I found her annoying after a while. Can't believe it's a best seller. I've trashed it
Nicely written, but I figured out the killer about 40 pages in... still entertaining.
The book was interesting enough, but the ending was great.  Worth getting through it.
A great page turner full of interesting characters that make really bad choices.  :-)
It gets better the more you read but I tired of hearing about the alcoholics problems
I liked the book.  A very good story and written well.  It was gripping till the end.
Not sure what all the fuss is about. Good story, not great. Not a page turner for me.
All the leading characters were disfunctional, so the srory became somewhat tiresome.
Book was awesom!!!! So much suspense and kept you guessing with each turn of the page
Very interesting,but a little hard to follow! It got easier to read as I got into it!
I was disappointed.  I have read a short story similar to this which was much better?
Started slowly but then I was hooked by the mystery & intrigue. Couldn't put it down.
No surprises. At times I got enthralled and drawn into the story only to be let down.
I could not get into this book...it was too unreal. I found the characters confusing.
The story kept my interest.  It had lots of twists and turns.  An interesting ending.
Great Read! Keeps you guessing till the end. If you like Gone Girl, you'll like this.
Highly recommended. I kept cheering for the girl on the train to get herself together
Couldn't put it down.  Read the whole thing in one night...l lived it along with them
A little slow at the beginning getting to know the characters.  Good thriller though.
Midway it moved a lot faster and I got into it . All and all I liked it. Good ending.
Lots of fun.  Loved the twist/surprise.  Wonderful suspense.  A fun, enjoyable, read.
This is one of the best books I've ever read - I'm sure I'll read it again and again!
Sad story of a woman caught-up in an investigation.  Good plot twists.  Well written.
It was a similar suspenseful feeling like Gone Girl.  It was an easy, enjoyable read.
Very unusual way to tell a murder mystery!  Very suspenseful and an intriguing story.
Excellent selection and very well written.  Keeps the reader very engaged throughout.
Sad cast of characters. Silly ending with a killer confessional that was implausible.
Enjoyed the book.  Lots of intriguing elements trying to figure what really happened.
Very interesting, also gives a true view on women suffering from not getting pregnant
at first, you wonder where is this going & then you can't put it  down \\\ excellent.
Loved it. Great story line and kept my attention throught. Would greatly reccomend it
Great twists and turns!!!<br/>I just kept reading to find out " who did it".
Really liked this book and immediately started looking for other books by the author.
Reminiscent of Gone Girl.  Plot is different, but atmosphere is similar.  Enjoyed it.
I could not put this down. Read it all in down: stayed in made a pot of tea and read.
Needed a cheat sheet at first to keep track of the characters. But really enjoyed it!
Very well done, ending a little disappointing. Beware, no man comes out looking good!
I found the book depressing. My neighbor quit reading it but I made myself finish it.
A little difficult to get into, but then I was not able to put it down. A great read.
Loved the characters and reading from each woman's perspective!  Couldn't put it down
Good mystery.  Pay close attention to the changing character perspectives and voices.
It was not my favorite....did not care the way it bounced from one person to another.
Definite page turner. Good character development. Must read if you enjoyed Gone Girl.
Very exciting and unexpected ending. Love the book and recommended it others already.
Once I got a hang of the chapters jumping around, it was a quick and intriguing read.
Characters and plot well-developed. Finally a book that I wanted to read til the end.
A fun psychological read. If you liked GONE GIRL you will love THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN.
There's nothing I love more than a book I just can't put down!  This was one of them!
Great book. Keep thinking about characters, even though I have moved on to new novel.
An amazing suspense story, well developed and well written.  I could not put it down.
I enjoy the British language. This book was difficult to put down. Loved the ending.
I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  Best seller list for decades -- why?
I am finding it very difficult to follow. Too much back & worth to keep my interest.
I thought it was very good. I did not figure out ahead of time who "did it".
Loved this book!  I know everyone says it, but I really couldn't put this book down!
enjoyed this book, was surprised how it all came together.  would recommend reading.
The story dragged on for too long.  The only interesting part was the final outcome.
Great read. Believable characters. Great twist at the end which took me by surprise.
Was a bit tedious but I was curious to know if I guessed the plot correctly.  I did.
Story takes you in, and by about 3/4 of the way thru the book you can't put it down.
Slow start. Took awhile to get into. I'm not fond of the main character's addiction.
Entertaining  from the first page to the last. I'm recommending it to all my friends
it was slow getting started, took a long time to really get to the point of the book
Definitely a page turner! I was hooked from chapter 1.... Great detail....fast read!
A little slow getting started, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop reading!!!!!!
Just got a little slow for me.  It is worth reading, but not as good as I had hoped.
I just loved it. When you start you will only put it down when you have finished it.
A lot like Gone girl. The protagonist was hard to get to like but had a nice ending.
Just started reading today Tues. 8/18---so far keeping me on my toes---good mystery.
I really enjoyed this story.It kept me guessing until the end. I would recommend it.
This was a great read! Quick paced, well written, with a nice plot twist at the end.
Eery and taunting; didn't expect such a radical ending. I LOVED IT! Read it.....NOW.
This in not in the league of Gone Girl for suspense etc but has some of that flavor.
Slow start, but from middle to end it really kept me guessing. Nice format to story.
I found it difficult to "stay with the story".  I wound up not finishing it.
I was fascinated and drawn in and wonderfully fooled from the start. Great reading!!
I LOVE this booked...... WOW! Great read for anyone who loves a good murder mystery!
VERY slow moving, but builds to an interesting climax that ties everything together.
Couldn't put the book down.Excellent ,twisting plot and great character development.
This book was very interesting and exciting.  It is a best seller and I fully agree.
Clever point of view. the story takes twist and turns. Kept me guessing. enjoyed it.
Not a bad first book.  A bit predictable and tied up a little too nicely at the end.
Had me going. Right from the start I did not have a clue, what a finish. Great story
Confusing, slow and depressing in the beginning. Turned into an intense page-turner.
Dark yet intriguing psychological thriller with unexpected twists. Mind games cubed.
Very interesting novel.  It held my interest .  Anxious for author to write another.
This was a wonderfully written book! Keeps you on the edge of the seat! I loved it!!
A bit hard to get into, but well worth the struggle to finish this compelling story.
Difficult to follow.  I stopped reading several times but finally finished the book.
Suspenseful, good character description.<br/>A quick read which I enjoyed very much
Surprisingly, a page turner. Well constructed and well conceived for a good mystery.
A good, easy read with an interesting cast of characters. Reminiscent of  Gone Girl.
I can see the comparisons to "Gone Girl", but a very fun, well written read.
It was a quick read but I guessed the ending a hundred pages before it happened.  :{
Fantastic - full of twists and turns, an old-fashioned page-turner with a new angle.
Great book!  Hard to put down.  Would love to see the movie, IF it follows the book.
Strange and dark, with at the core an anti-hero, but very well written and gripping.
I liked the book, although none of the characters were very likable. Lots of twists.
Good Read.  A twist at the end, that I did not see coming.  What twisted characters!
Quite a " different" story and some surprising twists. Really very good. You
Very slow, confusing, very repetitive ...yet a great ending..not one of my favorites
Very depressing read.  There is not one likable or admirable character in this book.
A long story could have been shorter. Novel OK after I passed the middle of the book
Even after I finished reading this book, I still keep thinking about the characters.
I like suspenseful books.  Really holds my interest.  I enjoyed the book very much..
Great novel with good character development - enjoyed the unfolding of the storyline
I did not enjoy the constant reliance on the drunken elements of the main character.
I loved this book -could not put it down; however I did not want it to end also!!!!!
Kept the suspense going throughout.  Was not ready for the ending!  What a surprise!
Loved it!  Worth the time.<br/>(Sorry I know my reviews aren't as detailed as some)
Holds your interest from the beginning.  Suspensful, and well written.  Great book!!
Loved the story, well written and interesting look into the life of a Jewish family.
The Girl on the Train was a thoroughly enjoyable read.  I can imagine it as a movie.
Very good book!  I would recommend it.  Occasionally confusing but easily rectified.
Really liked this one. Slow starting off but it got to where I couldn't put it down.
If you like lots of detail you will like this book, keeps you guessing till the end.
Kindle .  The titles are very light and I had to check back to see who was speaking.
It was a great book, although it was not as quick a read as some others I have read.
I loved this book! It kept me intrigued the whole way thru and hated to put it down!
Interesting story and characters and I did not guess the bad guy until the very end!
This book was fantastic. A very suspenseful page turner! Highly recommend this book.
Very predictable. Possibly a better version of "Gone Girl," but not by much.
If you liked the way "Gone Girl" kept you guessing, you will love this book.
Loved the suspense and not knowing or being able to guess what the outcome would be.
Beginning is slow but halfway through it becomes riveting and I couldn't put it down
after a while i was getting car[meaning train]sick.  a good book  but a bit too long
Very well done book that is a page turner until the end. Much better than Gone Girl.
The author takes you on a nail biting train ride that tunnels through twist & turns.
I didn't like or admire any of the characters, and got tired of all the drunkenness.
Loved this book from very beginning. Deep, thoughtful,  and suspenseful. Great read.
Loved this book! Keeps you guessing and many twists and turns. Couldn't put it down!
I found it dragged a bit...weak parts of the story- not as good as cracked up to be.
It was an average who done it. I figured it out half way through. A depressing book.
Very disappointing. All of the characters are so flawed that it was a difficult read
Love the plot. Intriguing. Couldn't put it down, although the ending did drag a bit.
Good book. Entertaining Read. Similar to Gone Girl but not as good. Would recommend.
The book took so many twists and turns. You were never sure who done it  Great read.
very different...confusing at first, but all became clear...I won't spoil the ending
Easy to read, hard to put down.  A little nuts in places but overall very enjoyable.
I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down. Very well written! Thank you!
Very interesting, a page turner. Like her way of writing. Would recommend this book.
I was a fan of Gone Girl and it was suggested I read this.  I could not put it down.
A good read, but I needed to be watching carefully for which narrator I was reading.
In the genre of Gone Girl, fluid easy read, several twists. Interesting who-done-it.
Talk about a page turner...I couldn't put it down and the ending did not disappoint!
Good story. Keeps you guessing and in the dark about the outcome until the very end.
Loved it.  Captured my attention from the first page and held it until the very end.
A fast, engrossing read similar to "Gone Girl."  Fun and keeps you guessing.
This was a nice easy going read and yet kept the reader guessing until the very end.
Not the best book I have ever read but kept me gripped! An easy read if you need one
The disappointment I felt at the end of this book made me realize that I must read the 2 and 1-star reviews before buying another book. It was a good story and interesting premise and kept me reading until it became predictable. The 'Gone Girl' comparisons are too complementary for this novel. There are no plot twists. I kept waiting for something to happen. I wanted to be shocked. None of the characters were likable or even relatable.
These women have too many issues. Kind of sad. I found the book to be quite boring.
A bit disappointing and somewhat predictable.  No promising or engaging characters.
rather confusing going from past to present with different people but a decent read
its a good mystery story hang on do not put it down and you will throughly enjoy it
Here's the short version;  read this book.  You won't regret doing so.  It's great.
I enjoyed the book. It started slow, but picked up and kept my interest throughout.
Fabulous read, the more you read the less likely you will be able to drop the book!
I really enjoyed this book. I didn't want to put it down once I started reading it.
Very interesting style and format.  The plot is far-fetched, but still a good read.
Excellent!  The end really surprised me!  Pay attention to who is talking and when!
Loved the way this book was written, point of view, etc., and the surprise outcome!
Great fast read. Perfect if your bored or stuck somewhere. I could not put it down.
Thought the book was very depressing in the beginning but liked the twists it took.
Love this book. It really kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole book.
Great book and a great read! Kept me turning to the next page from start to finish!
Good fast paced suspense. Right till the end. At times a bit morbid and depressing.
Was slow for about 3/4 of the way then finally picked up and ended with a flourish.
Not at all whatI expected! Starts out slowly, but picks up, and keeps you guessing!
I am not much for novels but this one kept me reading.  there were surprises in it.
Great read, could not put it down.  Many twists, action, mystery.  Would recommend.
This book got my attention and held it till the end. Well written and entertaining.
Both of the main characters are depressed, therefore it is depressing to listen to.
Very interesting plot.  It had many different twists and turns that kept me reading
While a little slow tp start once the story began to unfold it was hard to put down
Read in spurts, should have written who characters were- kept getting them mixed up
It was a very good book. A lot of suspense. Sometimes I cried together with Rachel.
The beginning was good but then later the storyline dragged for me. Very depressing
The story held my attention but was just too disturbing to give it a better rating!
Kept reading because the plot was rather convoluted. But really not worth the time.
This book kept my interest.  Read it in a day.  It was ok, but was not my favorite.
I thought it was a very dark story.  I finished the book but didn't really want to.
the book was okay.  l expected more as it had been on the best sellers list so long
Guess I'm one of the few that didn't really find it "Best Seller" material.
Loved it! Mystery, suspense, and a female dark hero provides a twist from the norm.
Love books like this that keep my attention and keep me guessing.  LOVED THIS BOOK!
Interesting style...each chapter looking at a different person.  Fascinating story.
It was a definite page-turner. I enjoyed the story but some parts were predictable.
I found this book tedious and really didn't care for it, although it WAS different.
Outstanding approach for a suspenseful novel that had a number of twists and turns.
This was a great read! I couldn't stop reading, I literally read it all in one day.
Didn't particularly like characters ;<br/>Last half of book better than first half
THIS IS AN INTRIGUING BOOK.  THE WRITING STYLE IS UNIQUE.  I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT!
Loved this book! Enjoyed it more than Gone Girl. Would love to see this as a movie.
Many twists and turns. As the story unfolded so the tension mounted . I enjoyed it.
The twists and turns of the plot and the flawed characters keep the reader engaged.
Very well written psychological thriller.  I remained engaged from start to finish.
Didn't like it, felt dark.  Read about 100 pages, couldn't finish it. Disappointed.
Was a great story...I was shocked but the out come!!  This book kept me on my toes.
creative, quirky, and dark with great twists in plot. Hard to put down who dun nit.
Not what I had expected from a book that has been on the best sellers top for weeks
These chicks are messed up. However, I had a  difficult time putting this one down.
Definitely a page turner. I highly recommend for anyone who just wants a good read!
This is in the same vein as 'Gone Girl', which I didn't like either.  A bit trashy.
A great read, a real page turner. Well written and a very clever twist in the tale.
This book was good, it kind of has some slow parts but overall a good and fast read
Not really my cup of tea.  Commuting and drinking while doing so.........who cares!
Ok novel, I had to read 64% before I started to get into it.<br/>Could be. Just me
I couldn't put it down! It  had me on the edge of my seat.  I was so into the book!
The sort was interesting but it bounced around a lot. That made it hard to keep up.
A very good book.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about the poor little girl.
Exciting page turner - had trouble putting it down! Highly recommend - great read !
Unpredictable and includes characterd eith real emotions even roller coaster style.
unusual pattern and plot, force me to reread chapters early in the plot development
Loved the book & the mystery! It dragged out a little but still thoroughly enjoyed!
Wow. Didnt see that ending coming. I had to finish the book when i woke up at 3am!!
it was a book that you hated to put down and wanted to get to see how it would end.
I felt the characters kept shifting what I expected of them. Thus, disappointments.
It was a fun read!  A tiny bit slow in the beginning, but don't let that deter you.
Unlikable characters, mediocre plot, not plausible, awful weak women, horrible men.
I did not like this book at all.  There was no point to it.  It dragged on forever.
I couldn't get into this book. Not sure why... perhaps just my mood, at the time???
Not a bad read, she was just a bit depressing as a character, and never got better.
great read in the same vein as Gone Girl.  Held my attention from beginning to end.
Boring.  I really got tired of all the drunken blackouts.  I finally gave up on it.
Good book, however, could have been shorten... about 3/4 in I wanted it to end.....
Did not like it at all, Not what I had hope for.  This is not my kind of reading!!
This book was interesting read and I was suprised how it ended. Very mind twisting.
I did NOT guess the murderer...My book club did not care for the story....I did!!!!
Awesome book!! Full of suspense! Read it in 2 nights and loved every second of it!!
Not as good as I expected, but still good. Same style of first person as Gone Girl.
I thought it was slow & plodding.  I gave up reading it after a few early chapters.
Loved the book.  Sort of started out slow but then took off - couldn't put it down.
It took about 50 pages to "get into it", but the plot thickened after that.
It was well written and kept your interest but it did move a little slowly at times
A very interesting book.  A bit hard to get into but then could hardly put it down.
Couldn't put this one down.  It had the same creepy, twisted suspense as Gone Girl.
Very enjoyable book. Kept my interest throughout the entire book. Highly recommend.
Very one dimensional characters.  Not a book I would recommend to my reading groups
I loved this book, well written with a ending that I defiantly didn't see coming!!!
Very good mystery!! You won't want to put the book down!! Please write more books!!
It's rare when a thriller can actually thrill you.  I could not put this book down.
Great read, wanted to know what happens next.  Hopefully there will be another book
Sometimes I got lost with who was telling their story;  but I couldn't put it down.
The Girl on the Train was a real page turner.  It kept engaged until the last page.
great book to read at times hard to follow the story but in the end it was worth it
Unexpected ending. At times too much repetition.  The book could have been shorter.
Very interesting character development which kept me totally involved in the story.
A very entertaining read.  Clever, unique and suspenseful.  I enjoyed it very much.
Reached a certain point in the book and I couldn't put it down until I finished it!
Kept me hooked, the main character is not right in the head & I felt sorry for her.
Very entertaining book! Couldn't put it down! Was not predictable in the least bit.
This is a great novel that keeps you guessing ,a great read and a real page turner.
Interesting book, and am glad I read.  But no great work of fiction by a long shot.
Enjoyed the suspense, liked the way it was written.  Would recommend it to a friend
Lots of surprises......great read.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this one.
One of the most unpleasant books I have read.  With the exception of Cathy, each character was flawed and self pitying.  I would not spend a half hour with anyone of these people and yet I spent hours reading the book.  Why?  Book Club selection..  The plot was fairly good, but the author used too many gimmicks of jumping from character to character and back and forth in time.  And forensics would blow apart the 'self-defense' plea.
Could be 3.5 stars.... What is it with characters I don't like? Rachel...for God's sake woman stand up for yourself. Anna, Tom, Scott and Meghan....nope, didn't like one of them. The story was terrific and although I figured out the murderer early on (and I Never do that) it still was a fun read. It's just that at the end of the book I felt drained. I'm glad I read it but just like Gone Girl, I didn't really care about any of them!
I found it hard to finish this novel. The female characters were all plagued by a weakness for men and the men were manipulative brutes and/or alcoholics.<br/>Ms. Hawkins could have kept the "I messed up and something bad happened so now I must redeem myself" to a 3 time maximum. I was wishing they would all just jump in front of a train.<br/>A good thing about this book was that punishment came to the most appalling character.
Too much flipping back & forth from past to present....for me it was hard to read.
From the first paragraph, I was totally drawn into the book. Couldn't put it down.
Great Book!  Hooks you in, takes you for a ride and doesn't let you put it down!!!
Best book jI have read in ages!  Don't miss this one.  The narration is brilliant!
I loved this book, its often compared to Gone Girl.  I thought it was much better.
Way better read than "Gone Girl". These are characters you can care about.
I enjoyed reading this book. Rachel is a mess, but you still somehow root for her.
A bit slow to start, but then became gripping and kept me wanting to read no-stop!
very confusing the way the characters change, I am very disappointed in this book.
Kept my interest, loved the twists.  Good book club read.  Enjoyable but not deep.
Loved this psychological emotional thriller - suspenseful with complex characters.
Took a bit to get into the book, but very good after the first couple of chapters.
A little slow in the beginning but the rest of the story was worth the slow start.
Started as a page-turner but had a less than thriller ending.  Disappointing read.
Very intriguing.  I love how it was told in the first person by chapter/character.
It was a great book! Didn't want to put it down.  Kept me guessing until the end!!
It was a good book that moved along.  Kind of predictable but enjoy it regardless.
A real thriller, characters are all flawed, can't put the book down until the end.
The book was a bit slow but managed to keep my interest. The ending was very good.
Great book!! Starts off a little slow but once it picks up, it is super addictive!
A story with many possibilities and a surprise outcome.  It kept me turning pages.
I really loved this book . It was suspenseful until the end, couldn't put it down.
Enjoyed reading this book.  Kept your attention and made you want to keep reading.
It took some time to get the characters straight but it was well worth the effort!
Great book... Really kept me on the seat of my pants .... Could not put it down..,
I loved this book, it grabbed me right from the start, I just had to keep reading!
I don't know what all the fuss was about. I thought the entire story was mediocre.
It was a good who-done it... Quick read, but I guessed who did it in the beginning
good story, exciting twist of events as I neared the end I could not stop reading.
Descriptions of Rachel's drinking began to get monotonous and she became pathetic.
Very engaging story...kept me constantly in suspense...couldn't put the book down!
I would give this book 6 stars if I could. Read it almost non stop until finished.
Great book! It seemed slow at the beginning, but kept drawing me in. I enjoyed it!
The beginning is tricky but a pretty good summer ready... I highly recommend it...
Really enjoyed and could not have guessed the ending.  Well written and a bit sad.
Ok read although the storyline felt weirdly familiar. Ideal as an easy read to to take on holiday.
I found myself reading during my chores, something I never do!!! Thrilling indeed.
This book was a great, easy read. Would highly recommend it to my girlfriends :-).
Did no like the book.  Too much like that Gonr Girl which I did no like very much.
Easy read  kept me engaged. Middle of book a little slow but overall worth reading
I enjoyed the book.  A little slow in the beginning, but then "picked up".
great book......such a complex plot....so many twists and turns.  I just loved it!
I really enjoyed this book.  It's a good summer read.  Would definitely recommend.
it was an easy pleasant read. It wasn't the best writing and not super suspenseful
It was just alright  Lots of repeating and the book was longer than the story line
Derivative of "Gone Girl" and others using flashbacks from key characters.
A one star rating is generous! Dysfunctional, pathetic characters, poorly contrived plot.
I liked that The Girl of the Train involved many characters and kept you thinking.
I found it tedious. I read a few books while I was trying to get through this one.
It takes a while to get into it but yes after you do, it is difficult to put down.
Truly captivating! A masterful mystery! If you liked Gone Girl - you'll love this!
Good story, a little slow getting into it, but enjoyable once it left the station.
Move over "Gone Girl".  This one keeps you guessing!  Highly recommend it.
Couldn't quit reading it.  Great character building.  Kept me guessing.  Loved it!
Just couldn't empathize with the protagonist.  Didn't really like her.  Too needy.
Lots of twists turns - pay attention to which character is narrating each chapter!
I can't wait for the book to get interesting, supposedly it does 3/4 of the way 😙
Confusing.  Characters all over the place.  You never get a grasp of who they are.
Great story, suspenseful and the refer did not know the result until the very end.
My book club liked it and would read more books by this author.  Interesting,plot.
Confused at first, not sure that may  have been by design, sure kept me interested
I could not put this book down! If you liked Gone Girl, this is a great next book!
It was OK - I expected more since it had been on the best seller list for so long.
A fun read. I like books with a mystery and this has one. Great light summer read!
Enjoyed, but slow at times.  Characters I could not relate to.  Ending surprising.
Thoughtful book full of complex and dark characters that you want to reach out to.
Great read! So difficult to put down. Looking forward to more of Ms.Hawkins works.
The book started out a little slow for me but wound up being a very strong finish.
started out slow, but ended up full of exciting twists and turns...worth the read!
This book was an enjoyable read so I will look to read other books by this author.
OK read.  Kept my attention.  Better than Gone Girl which it has been compared to.
Well written and intriguing! Six of us in my book club all gave it a thumbs up.
Good book. Interesting look at adoption and child welfare during this time period.
I liked this book even more than Gone Girl, mainly because it was more believable.
Enjoyed this book.  It kept me on edge.  I would call it a psychological thriller.
It was weird. Not in a twisty kind of way like gone girl, just weird. Unrealistic.
A great page turner.  I read it on the beach on vacation and couldn't put it down.
I thought it was a very good read.  It kept me intrigued and wanting to read more.
A little hard to keep track of the time frame sometimes but well worth the effort.
A great read, I highly recommend. Kept me wanting more to read just like this book
This book is well structured and much more sophisticated than others in its genre.
It was really hard to put this one down. It kept me interested until the very end.
I thought this was a page-turner.  I had a hard time putting it down.  Great book!
Hard to put this book down. Quick paced, kept my interest. Would highly recommend.
Ugh. The protagonist is so annoying I was hoping she'd meet an early demise. None of the characters are likeable, and the main character is the worst. The twists and turns are absurdly obvious and the journey does not make up for it.
Fast paced, easy to read thriller that will keep you engaged from start to finish.
I was disappointed in the book.  I expected it to be more interesting than it was.
Great writing.  Very surprising and shocking ending.  I could hardly put it down..
Great story. I was sure I'd solved the mystery 3 or 4 times - then another twist !
Very suspenseful, great characters, great writing.  I highly recommend this book!!
Loved it!  Fast read couldn't put it down,  well written.  Would highly recommend.
If you read Gone Girl, you will love The Girl on the Train.  Couldn't put it down.
Well written, with a few twists. If you liked Gone Girl, I think you'll like this.
I thought this was going to be like Hitchcock's Rear  Window. But I was surprised.
Could not put it down....starts just a bit slow but stay with it and it GRABS you.
Great book!  Watch carefully at the beginning of each chapter for names and dates!
Really liked this book.  It was a very good character study.  No real heroes here.
Excellently written, hard to put down, suspenseful.  Thoroughly enjoyed this book.
Very intriguing thriller. Moves quickly and captures your attention. A great read.
it was a little difficult to get into, but once I did it was a page turner........
Wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow! That's all I can say!
This was one of the best books I ever read. I found it as interesting as Gone Girl
I was very disappointed in this book since it was recommended by so many magazines
It was slow at first, but ended ok. Not as earth shattering as it could have been.
What a great book! This is one of the best mystery books I've read in a long time.
The concept was interesting but the story spent too much time on the main character's personal battle with alcohol and her seemingly unrealistic recklessness.<br/>I also found it difficult to follow the time line of events which was further encumbered but the fact that the chapter titles are simply named for the character narrating that section. The story picks up two thirds of the way in and redeems itself enough in the end.
Plagiarising the poet e.e. cummings on page 7 creates an immediate question of the author's integrity.  Shame on her for not giving proper credit; shame on the publisher Penguin for not catching this; and, all the more shame on The New York Times best seller folks for not catching this.  The poem is titled, "since feeling is first" and the lines used read: for life's not a paragraph and death I think is no parenthesis.
Terrible!!
Horrible!!

Just awful
Good read.

COMPELLING
Great read

Great book
Entertaining page-turner. Couldn't make much sense of the fact that Tom's affair with Megan was never mentioned in the parts where narrative centered on her. There was mention of her boredom and her affair with the therapist but leaving Tom totally out of the picture was very Agatha Christie, a surprise alright, but not one that made much sense on the whole. But I'm not going to deny that the book is impossible to put down.
This is an exceptionally well written psychological thriller. I loved it. I read LOTS of thrillers and mysteries and this is one of the best I've found in awhile. The mystery of the disappearance of one of the characters is the main plot line, but the journey into the minds and pasts of all the main characters is equally intriguing. The book has many layers and is written intelligently. I recommend it without reservation..
Good book. It started out slow but hooked me a little less then half way through.
The final few chapters were good. But the story line leading to those dragged on.
Book had been recommended many times by friends.  Held my interest like very few.
Main character fairly well developed. End somewhat predictable. I would recommend
It was a very good read! I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it to others!
Wow, best book I've read in awhile. Suspense abound. I applaud you Paula Hawkins.
The story was pretty good but was put off by the alcoholic emphasis in the story.
Loved this book. It reminded me of Gone Girl. I couldn't sleep; had to finish it!
A real page turner with unexpected twists.  I highly recommend it as a good read!
Well written and good story line.  depressing alcohol problems but very realistic
Beyond a mystery...well written, page trner, character insight, twists and turns.
This book held my interest!  There was intrigue, romance, a little of everything.
I was confused for quite a while and then all of a sudden, there was the answer!.
Truly a good read. Very realistic but with good twists. Reminded me of Gone Girl.
Very good and held your interest which kept me wanting to read to get to the end.
Captivating storyline, and interestingly written! Kept me engaged the whole book.
This book was spell binding...could not put it down...definitely a page turner!!!
It was just Ok! I was rather disappointed after I had heard so many good reviews!
Took a whIle to get going but once it started it was great!  Couldnt put it down!
Very good read.  Our book club chose this one and it was a winner for us.  Enjoy.
Good read, but had my issues with it.<br/>Definitely a page turner tho. Not mad.
Excellent writing! Difficult to get into at first, then a " page turner "
Excellent...riveting...plot!!  I DID figure out the end, but loved the challenge.
Took me awhile to get into it,however, but halfway through could not put it down.
A bit of a slow start, but then it opens up to a real cliff hanger.  Great story.
Could not stop reading this book! I actually had book blues after I was finished!
I enjoyed the book very much. I kept changing my mind about who the murderer was.
A great read which will keep you involved and interested in the plot development.
Waste of money.  I'm struggling to.get through book ... can't wait for It to.end.
This was a thoroughly disturbing book which no doubt is what the author intended.
Fun, fast read.  Holds your attention.  Empathetic novel with twists and mystery.
Awesome book. Gone girl may be a smidge better, but the writing style is similar.
It certainly held my interest.  I had to keep going to see how it all turned out!
An easy entertaining read.  It's a fun mystery to piece together as you go along.
Meh. Kept my interest, to be sure, but kinda depressing and somewhat predictable.
Extremely well written, true suspense. Ready to read the next book by this author
One of the best books I have read in sometime. Full of suspense like a Hitchcock.
This was a decent read. I thought it would be more suspenseful, but I enjoyed it.
First half was slow going but it picked up speed and turned out to be a goo read.
Loved this book! Entertaining and a great mystery. I felt like I was right there.
Fantastic read. Highly recommend this book.  Fantastic twist at the end. Loved it
This book held my attention from the start. Could not put it down. Great thriller
Good read. Keeps you guessing until the end. It was a true psychological twister.
A little slow at the beginning but it captured my attention and kept me guessing.
Not one likable or believable character in the whole book. Tedious and pointless.
Too predictable after about the half way in the story. Very few twists and turns.
This book was enthralling; once I had started reading it, I couldn't put it down.
Excellent read! If you're a fan of "Gone Girl ",you will enjoy this book.
The book started a little slow but the story took off and I couldn't put it down.
Too much rehashing of same time frame.  main character was weak and unbelievable.
I liked it .could have been more of a story about other character s in the story.
I loved this book!  The twisting and turning plot kept me guessing until the end.
Very interesting approach to telling the story. It was a real page turner for me.
Good story.  Would have liked more likable characters.  Not as good as gone girl.
Good story.....a little tiresome going back and forth from character to carachter
Usually these types of thrillers end with a whimper but this one really delivers.
The book held my interest all the way through.  New author for me but I liked it.
Intense thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. Highly recommend it!
I couldn't put the book down!  There was so much suspense and character build up.
Wonderful story - could not put it down!  Great summer read so get your copy now!
The book was well written; the characters were really dysfunctional (screwed up).
Once you get used to the different characters perspectives it's hard to put down.
Some twists and turns will keep the reader guessing.... an easy, rainy day novel.
Loved this book. It is suspenseful and keep you on the edge. Couldn't put it down
Excellent reading. Couldn't wait to figure it out. Kept you wanting to finish it.
Certainly different and entertaining.  Tedious at times, but overall a good read.
Lots of twists and turns.  I could not put it down!  Will read this author again.
Took me 3/4s of the way through to realize who the killer was - held my attention
Exciting and quite rivrting, but as getting a bit weary of lost  miserable girls!
I thought the book was written well…..the characters though are very aggravating.
Enjoyed this book very much.  Unusual twists kept me guessing until the very end.
Good book.  Hard to put down.  Keeps you guessing until the end.  Quirky heroine.
Starts out a little strange and then barrels into a great train ride. I recommend
Rach was a little to loony for me.  So many problems and people didn't trust her.
Suspenseful and intriguing ..a thriller that will make you want to turn the page!
Very good book. Quite a surprise ending. I couldn't guess who the bad person was!
Fast paced book that I couldn't put down. Brilliant. Can't wait for her next one.
Well written.  There were several interesting and unexpected twists in the story.
Suspense until the last page,this novel is an intriging plot with unusual players
Fast paced read!  Many plot twists , and I had a hard time putting this one down.
it was good.  kept my interest.  page turner.  but it also had a stange air to it
Not like gone girl, easy to figure out whats going on.  Just wasnt my cup of tea.
Thriller. Definitely up there with Gone Girl, Big Little Lies,etc. Very riveting!
Started out slow for me but then I became captivated and it was hard to put down.
Excellent!  Lots of discussion in our book club, and we cannot wait to finish it!
This book was awesome. Although I figured out the plot, it was still a good ride.
I was completely captured by this book from the minute I started reading it.  It moved around from character to character very quickly, so it felt like three different stories, but then the characters all began to merge into one very complicated and sinister story.  I had a hard time putting the book down, and I enjoyed all the twists and turns the story took.  I would recommend this book if you enjoy a good mystery.
It's an interesting story although it gets a bit monotonous in the middle.  At first I enjoyed the Rachel charachter and then I hated her for a while.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the differing points of view from each character perspective, that made it fun and kept me engaged.<br/><br/>There are a few things that feel unfinished.  I think it would have benefited from one final rewrite, but all in all it was a fun read.
I didn't finish it - found it quite confusing.  Might get back to it some day!!!
I don't read too many fiction books but this was a good, and intertaining  book.
Great book! Couldn't put it down. Finished in two days. Can't wait for the movie
A good murder mystery novel. If you like Gone Girl, then you'll enjoy this book.
Good old fashion mystery!! Somewhat confusing at times, but overall a good read.
I didn''t particularly like it,  Too slow starting with too many abstract ideas.
KIND OF CONFUSING AT FIRST BUT, AS I KEPT READING THE STORY  KEPT ME INTERESTED.
A suspenseful tale if you like reading about sick -- really sick --dysfunction..
Great suspense & plot<br/>Nicely narrated<br/>Loved it & read it in three days
exactly enough twists to make this a great and fast read!! Happy summer reading!
I liked this book. It was engaging and well done. I recommend it as a good read.
A depressing character makes many stupid choices.  It kept my interest-- barely.
Didn't like the book at all.  Found it confusing as to who was telling the story
Good story, but was sorta difficult to keep straight while reading late at night
Girl on a train is a book that u start and cannot stop. I loved it and u will to
The story really pulls you along to see what will happen next.  Surprise ending.
Very engaging story. Some parts were unrealistic which is why I have it 4 stars.
I have not been able to finish it. Sorry but it just could not keep my interest.
The story never seemed to get going. Stopped reading about a quarter of the way.
This book was good, but a little slow.  I definately did not expect the ending!!
Difficult start but grabbed me a third of the way in and I couldn't put it down.
This book is SO readable, so digestible, and with so many surprises. I loved it.
Loved this book!  It's suspenseful and kept me interested from beginning to end.
Girl of the train has a slow start. Hang in there it turns into a great mystery!
Suspense builds...fascinating read..better read by hardback version, not kindle.
It was a different and good story, well written and kept my interest to the end.
A decent book that keeps you guessing even when you think you've figured it out.
Interesting concept.  Not as well written as could have been.  Plenty of mystery
A real page turner.  If you enjoyed Gone Girl,  you will like this book as well.
Loved this book, suspenseful and well written. Keeps you guessing until the end.
in the first person by three people.  in the style of<br/>bram stokers dracula.
I loved this book anti kept me interested from the minute I started to read it .
This was one of the amazing books I have read.<br/>What twist.. Love reading 💜
This book was a page-turner--kept my interest throughout.  I would recommend it.
Wonderful thriller-well written and couldn't wait for some free time to read it.
A really good story, involving narrative, unexpected twists--highly recommended!
It was a little drawn out to get to the conclusion.  But a nice read for summer.
This is as lousy a piece of literature as is The Goldfinch. Enough of P. Hawkins
I loved it! It was unexpected, and engrossing, and full of surprises. Excellent!
Read through to the end. Was a little tedious in the beginning. Interesting end.
Took to long to get through some of the back and forth with the main characters.
Awesome!  Exciting and real good twists and turns to the story, a page turner!!!
Loved this book. Very well written. Lots of twists and turns. Great Summer read.
It is a good story.  It keeps the reader wanting to know what would happen next.
A page turner with unexpected twists and turns throughout.  A great summer read.
I couldn't wait to reach the last page as I do not like to abndon a book midway.
Every character has some sort of emotional problem. Surprising end! A must read!
On the edge of my seat with little idea of what happened until close to the end!
Moved too slow for my taste.  Definitely far from what I would call a good book.
Difficult for me to to get started, but really ended up enjoying the excitement!
It was slow read.  This book is mediocre at best.  Glad I was able to finish it.
A great page turner, read this one lazy Sunday morning and was very happy I did.
One of the best books I've read! If you like Gone Girl, you will love this book!
Interesting book. Enjoyed reading each persons story from their own perspective.
Good book, it was hard to get through the beginning....but good read in the end!
The book was tedious and the conclusion obvious. I would give a  rating of  two.
Great book from page one. Lots of complex characters, intrigue, and plot twists!
I loved this book! It had you guessing "who done it" all thru it! Great!
Didn't love any of the characters, but definitely wanted to find out who did it!
Slow to get into but then picks up. The ending has interesting twists and turns.
Psychological thriller.....but hard to follow what person was telling her story.
I didn't like any of the characters. I didn't care what happened to any of them.
Very interesting story that makes you pay attention to the time of each chapter.
LOVED this book.  Great read would definately recommend.  Great idea for a book.
Interesting angle on storytelling. Didn't predict the ending. An enjoyable read.
Interesting. I didn't see the plot turning the direction that it did. Enjoyable.
An interesting, exciting, thought provoking, and unpredictable read! I loved it.
Super fun and compelling. Not serious literatsure, but well written escape read!
Interesting and fast paced, but easily figured out with only 6 characters in it.
I found The Girl on the Train a great read.  Interesting characters in the book.
I enjoyed this book.  It was hard to figure out what was believable.  Good read.
Ok, plot, changing dates and characters keeps story moving but not a great book.
It's an interesting read. I couldn't put it down. Read it in less than two days.
Twisty, turny and awesome. I love unreliable narrators like this one. Well done!
I enjoyed the story, Took a while for me to figure out who done it ,I like that.
A great tale that keeps you interested -- and in the dark -- until the very end.
Great flawed protagonist, intriguing read and full of mystery. Enjoyed it a lot.
Moved along quickly...was a smooth read.  Have recommended it to several people.
Loved this book. A good yarn and very hard to put down. I want to see the movie.
Interesting points of view including a flawed protagonist. I read it to the end.
I ENJOYED THE STORY. THE PLOT  HAD ENOUGH TWISTS AN TURNS TO HOLD  MY  INTEREST.
CERTAINLY NOT LIKE THE  GONE GIRL FROM MY POINT OF VIEW. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT.
Plot had lots of twists. Very suspenseful and will keep you guessing to the end!

Well written although I did guess the ending a little more than halfway through
Well done psychological thriller.  Characters actions and reactions believable.
I have already reviewed this book.  It is excellent, could not stop reading it!
People making bad choices -- over, and over, and over, and over. Very tiresome.

Characters bece more interesting. Many twists and turns that kept you guessing.

Very good read. Hard to put down, couldn't figure out who done it till the end.
Loved it.  I was worried it was too much like Gone Girl, but for me, it wasn't.
This book was interesting and kept my attention but in the end did not deliver.
Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Kept you at the edge of your seat the entire time.
Great book !  Wanted to read it in one sitting just to find out what happened !
A page turner. Not a literary masterpiece, but a very enjoyable suspense story.
Characters were unlikable and the whole thing was too dark in mood and setting.
Was easily figured out by mid way. Interesting but no good character.
Well told story...thoroughly engrossing and suspenseful I couldn't put it down!
Good rhythm. Main charter is not necessary likeable, but that adds to the plot.
Quite an interesting mystery. This will lead to a good discussion at book club.
It was just ok. After all the hype about the book, I was a little disappointed.
Loved it. Delighted to hear the rights have been bought to turn it into a film.
Absolutely loved it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mysteries.
Very depressing about people with problems made worse by those closest to them.
Easy read but different format. Not sure where it was going until the very end.
Great book couldn't put it down. If you read gone girl this book is a must read
Couldn't put it down.  It keeps getting better all the way to the end! Loved it
A very interesting twist and the lead character is not someone you really like.
This was one of the best books I've ever read - I didn't want the story to end!

Very well-written, and fast-paced! Captivating, a thriller, and yet with humor.
Not bad. It was a page turner. And the ending was satisfactory. I recommend it.
Watch buying from amazon they rip you off charging several time and not refund.
Characters you hate, but relate to; characters with flaws you learn to forgive, until you can't anymore, but thankfully it is a fictional story. Everyone is deeper and more complex than we ever give them credit for being. The story is revealed in such a way, that anyone of the characters could have "done it." Wish I could have read it even faster, but I do have to work. This one will stay with me for awhile.
I couldn,t get instrited in it.  I will try again.
I have to admit that I was disappointed with this book.  I just expected more.
Good fast paced murder mystery. No "lessons" learned. Just a fun read.
Great read a bit slow to start off with , but picks up  fairly  quickly  enjoy
Slow paced in some areas but huge surprises that kept me intrigued to the end.
rather depressing. we have to go through one third of the book to get into it.
Great story!! Liked the presentation--- back and forth between the characters.
Hard to get into. Had to read it for my book club.  Perfect for the insomniac!
Very interesting story and I like the way she tied it all together at the end.
Very bizarre story that sucks you in from the first page.  A real page turner.
This book was compared to Gone Girl, but I think it was better than Gone Girl.
A portrait of people trying to pass through life with no compass to guide them
hard t get in to at first but once you learn the characters, a fast good read.
Reading the book now , very well written would recommend it to any avid reader
This was a very intriguing book. Reminded me of Gone Girl meets Bridget Jones.
A very interesting book.  It kept you turning the pages  I liked it very much.
Very well written. Unpredictable ending. You get drawn in from the first page.
Can't understand its time on best seller list.  I had to struggle to finish it
Requires a bit more focus to follow who's narrating but  a very good thriller.
I did figure out that Tom was the murderer before it was revealed in the story
This was my pick for our book club.  I couldn't put it down.  We all loved it.
Great book. Written well, beautiful language usage. Interesting and thrilling.
Greatest book I've read in awhile and I don't usually go for this type of book

I hate rachel, the main character. So insecure, depressed and low self esteem.

Or save it for summer vacation  It's not too predictable. Good to the very end
A great read!  Surprised in the end of the connections between the characters.
This book was an enjoyable well-written page-turner.  I'd highly recommend it.
Too hard to follow.  You main character is confused and your readers are also.
Lovee it  ket me guessing the final outcome.  Very entrtaining.  A quick read.
The book jumped all over the place and I did not like it.  Too many sub plots.
good but I don't see why it has been on the best seller list for so many weeks
Cleverly and suspensfully written.  I could hardly put it down to go to sleep.

This book was tedious and I don't understand why it is on the Bestseller list.
It was an interesting read, but overall I did not find the characters likable.

I really loved this book.  It was well written and kept me glued to the pages.
Great book!!  Couldn't put it down - has the same feel as "Gone Girl."
Loved very well written and loved that I had no idea who did it until the end.
I confess I was hesitant in purchasing this book.  Fortunately I did, and the next thing I realized I had read about a quarter of the book.  I was hooked!  I found myself very happy to allow the story to "string me along," as it were, instead of guessing.  The story is tight, and very well written.  No fluff - an adult plot written for readers with life experiences.  You will not be disappointed.
Interesting read.  Some twists and turns in the plot....didn't see it coming!
Suspenseful read. Get past the first thirty pages and you won't stop reading.
Little slow at the beginning, but soon you can't wait to get the whole story.
Great book! Very suspenseful, kept me interested, couldn't set the book down.

Riveting, had no idea where the story was going...it really held my interest.
Wonderful story. A truly "whodunit". One of the best books I've read!
Did not like the way book jumped around very confusing. our book club agreed.
Difficult to follow at first but was really great as you got further in to it
Suspenseful page-turner.  I found the female characters disappointingly weak.
kept you guessing all the time<br/>couldn't put it down<br/>very suspensful
This book makes for strange reading. There are a lot of :skippable" pages

Did not find the main character appealing in any way. Would not recommend it.
A good psychological thriller with good character development. A page turner.
The last 100 pages were good, the rest of the book was to long.and confusing.

It was a little slow.....reminded me of Gone Girl , which was not a favorite.
Loved it, was the best one I've read so far and the ending was unpredictable.

Rather confusing with the bac and forth story line and character name change.
absolutely fantastic, perfectly written, just an amazing and worthwhile read!
It started out slow for me but than once I got into it, couldn't put it down.
An ambitious piece of writing. Told from a unique point of view. Fascinating.
Interesting, but could have been shorter.Lead character kind of unbelievable.
Definitely keeps you turning the pages.....or touching the screen in my case.
Very very good. Not quite at the 5 star level; but definitely worth the read.
Better than Gone Girl.  I couldn't figure out the killer, and I really tried.
Took me a little bit to get into it, but enjoyed the second half of the book.
Real good murder mystery. Starts out a little confusing, but picks up nicely.

Just make sure you have a free afternoon. You won't be able to stop reading.
Couldn't put this one down; wasn't never sure who the bad "guy" was.
Too much psycho-babble for me!  I deal  with enough of that on a daily basis

Very disappointing.  No suspense and essentially long, drawn out and boring.

Loved all the plot twists and turns! Read like a "British Gone Girl"
Entertaining, but a bit slow.  It certainly wasn't as 'twisted' as Gone Girl
Difficult and painful to appreciate a story written by an unreliable drunk.
Riveting most of the times. Too easy or not thorough enough for five stars.
A tight, well constructed story, written in a unique and captivating style.

the plot twist was very interesting and quite amazingly written.  Loved it.
Now I know why this has been on everyone's summer reading list--- excellent
Couldn't put it down! It's been a while since I could say that about a book
A mystery and a morality tale about alcoholism make for a fascinating story!
Plot is rather primitive,  but book catches you and holds till the very end
It started very, very slow.  It didn't really get good until last quarter..
This kept me reading to find out who did it and had some good misdirection.
I have never read a book this fast.  I absolutely COULD NOT put it down!!!!
Very disappointing. Did not like any of the characters and forget the plot!
Very good book. The story was very captivating. I couldn't stop reading....
Suspenseful, well written and intriguing.  Kept my interest from the start.
I hate the "F word" so I won't be reading any more from this author
Very interesting book. Kept my interest all the way through. Worth reading.
Great murder mystery. So many possible killers, was surprise ending for me.
Story convoluted , switches from one character to another to confuse reader
Lots of twists. Took a while to get into it but then took off like a train.
Started off intriguing but evolved into a predictable, disappointing ending
It took me a while to get into the story, but once I did, I liked it a lot.
It had me guessing up until the end. Couldn't put it down. Great fast read.
It was ok.  Nothing great, horrible chare cters, plot not very interesting.
Great ending..completely fooled me.  I enjoyed the characters and the plot.
Great book.  Keeps you guessing.  Narrated by several women.  Very original
Could not put it down.  Not exactly uplifting but a great read.  Recommend.
Starts a little slow.  then it reaches a point that you cannot put it down.
Very good book.  I would compare it to Girl Gone with a more original plot.
Enjoyed this book very much. It kept you guessing till the end of the book.
Different..you needed the repetitive dialogue to make the story .I liked it
Addictive...intoxicating...insomnia producing.  Don't miss this great read.
I enjoyed reading the book very much. I would recommend to anybody to read.
Awful, dark novel. Who needs to waste time reading about a drunk psychotic?
Well-written and decent story - just didn't WOW me like I thought it would.
Good plot and character development but predictable who done it. Enjoyable.
Simple review. Creepy from the very beginning but unable to stop reading...
Couldn't put it down. You have to enjoy being in the minds of crazy people.
so many twists and turns, no chance to be bored in this one. great novel...
A wonderful book. Many plot turns leave the outcome in doubt until the end.
Good readiing, enjoyed the concept of loss of memory but not believe able !
A spellbinding thriller...will keep you awake until you turn the last page.
love, love, love this book!  Once I started reading I couldn't put it down!
I stopped reading it about third of way into it. It was way too depressing.
Enjoyed it but not on a par with "Gone Girl", which I enjoyed more.
extraordinary character development. psychological profiles that ring true.
Confusing characters. Too much psychoanalyzing, not smooth<br/>story line.
Loved this book!  I couldn't put it down once I started I had to finish it!
Tiresome. No way does it compare to Gone Girl and I would not recommend it.
I felt like the "twist" wasn't very much of a twist... Predictable.
Loved this book.  The write was interesting and the story hard to put down.
A little slow at first, but the unexpected twist at the end made up for it!
If you are looking for a light weight page turner, this book fits the bill.
Kept my interest till near the end, when I guessed the twist in the ending.
It's is a "fast read" book. The kind I like. You can't put it down.
Good read, very unique style of writing - kept me captivated until the end.
Kept me on the edge of my seat. Would love to see this turned into a movie!
I was disappointed with this book ….. I found myself hurrying to finish it.
Excellent novel of personal angst combined with a great "whodunit"?
The story was pretty good. I could see how this could be made into a movie.
My kind of book!  A real page turner, I loved how each character was drawn.
Well...<br/><br/>I'd heard amazing things about this book. For once I'm not disappointed. It lived up to its hype. This book was tense, imaginative and all around a great read. I loved the broken, gritty characters. I loved how the times of day shaped the plot.  I loved the ending. It was satisfying.<br/><br/>I think I might be reeling from this book for a couple of days. Great book.
A good read- very compelling portrait of alcohol addiction.  Reader was completely convinced.  Less convincing was the resolution to it all- ending was not supported by any foreshadowk whatsoever- nothing made you think back and say, "...ah ha!  That's when I should have known!"<br/><br/>The ending seemed like a bit of a rush job.  This was a solid 4 star read until the final chapters.
A waste of your time!!!! I had high hopes for this book. The premise of the book intrigued me. This book was poorly written and didn't have a clear course. But wait, page 290 changed that. The secrets revealed made the book a page turner. The author finally gave me what I wanted, a book worth reading. I gave it one star but the last thirty pages I give four. Don't waste your time!!!!
Easy read, keeps you glued to it. Great when you want a book to take over.
After staying on the best seller list for so long, I was expecting better.
This book just went in circles. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.
Love this book!  Could not put it down!  A great read from the very start!
Easy read.  Main character was rather pathetic so it was hard to like her.
A nice easy read. Nothing remarkable about it, but nevertheless enjoyable.
Great twist! Seemed to drag in a few spots but over all a worthwhile read.

I finished this book in 24 hours! Its a great read, you can't put it down!
Wow. Surprised by how much I liked this book. Surprises around every turn.
A must to read, psychological who done it that keeps you going to the end.
I like a story with more action, but it did keep me reading until the end.
This is one of the bests books I've ever read... I couldn't put it down...
I didn't finish it, because the girl on<br/>The train was very confusing.

This is a very slow moving book which has turned me off any further books.

LIght reading that kept me interested to the end.  It has a clever ending.

Not particularly well-written, sloppy characterizations but ok quick read

I enjoyed it but thought is was very drawn out.  Could have been shorter.

Great twists and turns. However, the main character is difficult to love.
Not what I expected........almost did not finish reading it, but did.....
It was very well written...just didn't like how the story left me feelin.
The middle of the book can get a little slow but the end makes up for it.
The only drawback of this book was it ended too soon. An excellent novel.

It was a pretty good mystery but I think it dragged out a little too long
Enjoyed this book very much.  All the twists and turns kept you guessing.
I really enjoyed the twist toward the end, but it seemed a little rushed.
This was just as good if not better than Gone Girl.  I really enjoyed it!
At the beginning I wasn't sure that I was going to like this book. Half way through I thought the women were all neurotic and totally crazy. It made women look awful. Their feelings and thoughts were just unlike me! So it was hard to recognize these characters. However by the time I got to the end, I was totally into these women. All of them. A very good read and a wild story.
This story is simply complex and yet not at all simple....nor complex!!!
In the Gone Girl genre and not as clever but still an entertaining read.
The story was very predictable. I only finished it to confirm my notion.
A slow starter,but then gets on  a spiral of suspense.<br/>A good read.
Starts out very confusing but then it all comes together and enjoyed it.

HARD TO GET INTO ABOUT THREE QUARTERS THRU IT WAS EASIER ..GOOD ENDING!!
I liked this book. Characters are not defined until the end of the book.
if you liked Gone Girl, you'll like this book better.  Kept me guessing!
Great read.  A little slow in the beginning but really picks up quickly.
Good but not as great as I had expected. Similar to "Gone Girl".
A fascinating novel. I found it hard to stop reading even when I had to.
A real page turner!!  Read it so fast because it was so good and so fun.
Kept me very  interested.  Development of characters was very well done!
the author gave me no one to root for.  characters were all unpalatable.
LOVED THE TWISTS AND TURNS.  I HATE GUESSING THE END BEFORE I GET THERE.
Good read! Enjoyed the interplay & interrelation between the characters.
Too dragged out don't know how anyone could compare this to Gone Girl!!!
confusing at first, but once you figure it out it becomes a page turner.
Great Book.  It kept me guessing until the end as to "Whodunnit"
A page turner but nowhere near the quality of All the Light WeCannot See
very different, you have to watch the person talking, as chapters change
I thought a little slow and drawn out. Could have been done much quicker
This book kept you on the seat of your pants. Could not stop reading it!
This novel was too complex for me to review.  Definitely worth the read.
Keeps you guessing until near the end.  Shows a person with imagination.
This was a good read.  Suspense filled and believable.  Great characters
About halfway thru I felt I knew how it would end but it kept me reading
Loved it!  Kept me turning pages.  I did not want to put this book down!
Captivating story line. You will not expect what's coming! A quick read.
Could not put this book down. Loved it and was very sorry to finish it!!
Good mystery read.Kept me turning pages and double guessing- who did it!
After a slow start, the book really picked things up in an exciting way.
Interesting Subject, but does not deserve to be bestseller list number 1
Kept me up all night. A good, light mystery read. Takes place in the UK.
A page turner! Riveting, a psychological thriller- couldn't put it down.
Just as gripping as "Gone Baby."  Can't wait for her next novel!
Overall a good read. I would and have recommended to friends and family.
Other reviews compared it to Gone Girl but I thought it was much better!
Definitely suspenseful but hard to keep the players straight. Fast read.
I couldn't put the book down. It engaged you the whole time. Great read.
Had me hooked from the beginning. Loved the way the story was presented.

Touted as another "Girl Gone" . . .  It wasn't nearly that good.
Full of suspense. Hard to put down and keeps you guessing until the end.
Very good thriller.  Complex characters. Well written.  Kept me engaged!
the book was a page turner, it kept me engrossed. . . ending was 3 star.
An engaging read, but the second half of the book was quite predictable.
Bought this book the other day after anxiously waiting for the price to come down on my wish list. I started it tonight and to tell you the truth I am struggling with it. It is so boring I can barely stay awake. Please tell me there is a good reason not to trash it right now and go on to something more interesting....how would I describe the plot of this book? What plot?
Not that I did not enjoy this novel, because I did, but in real life, the police would have solved the murder within one hour. However, the reader does not become aware of certain clues until the end of the story that police would have had and followed from the very beginning of the case. This eliminates for the me the credibility of an otherwise terrific murder mystery.
Disappointing...have read better written books . Not worthy of the hype
Interesting perspective from multiple points of view. Like the writing.
A thrilling read. Kept me in suspense throughout. I story of redemption
Very good read...I was interested from the beginning...highly recommend
A little confusing at first, but then riveting - could not put it down!
Wow!  Move over "Gone Girl", you have company for a great read.
Little hard to get into but hang in there and it becomes a page turner.
good story line. holds your interest. A good "whodunnit" story.
Great. Breathtaking. You are interested from the start to the very end!
I really enjoyed this book, was an exciting read. Suspenseful thriller.
It got a little tedious, but I really enjoyed the mystery of the story.
A good mystery. Different than what I normally read but I did enjoy it.
Easy, fast read, somewhat suspenseful however I did guess ending by 70%
Its a bit confusing at the beginning but well worth the amazing finish.
An excellent mystery and well written to keep your interest to the end.
Can't wait to see the movie. This book was great! Couldn't put it down.
Was not expecting this book to be this exciting.  Couldn't put it down.
Gripping psychological thriller. Had to keep reading to see who did it.
A great read with a lot of plot twists, that makes it hard to put down.
Really, really an intriguing book!  One of the best of the year for me!
Listened on tape. found it an engaging diversion for a long road trip.
Great book. Once you get through the first chapter, tough to put down.
This is one of those books that once started is very hard to put down.
Loved it!  It kept my attention.  I couldn't wait to see how it ended.
interesting light read for anyone who is interested in English history

Kind of hard to follow, but a fascinating book that held my attention.
Not really my kind of book. Little to dark and upsetting for my taste.

It is very interesting story. Very unexpected turns. Hard to put down.
it's a slow moving book that kept me coming back.  totally enjoyed it!
I found the storyline a little repetitive and drawn out in the middle.

The main character was so repulsive that I could not finish the book!!
An amazing story told from the pont of someone mentally ill. Riveting.
A very interesting story, never a dull minute with a twist at the end.
Story skips around too much. Hard to follow at times. Surprise ending.
Started slow but picked about quarter way through.  Had some surprises
Depressing story....hardly any redeeming characters in the whole book.
The first three chapters were slow but once in I couldn't put it down.
A thrilling, fast-paced read. Will keep you at the edge of your seat!!
If you enjoyed Gone Girl then this is for you. Can't put it down book!
i really enjoyed reading this book....it was definitely a page turner.
The writing was terrible! Shocked to find it on the best sellers list.
I LIKED THE LAST HALF BETTER THAN THE FIRST HALF, BUT ENJOYED THE BOOK
If you liked, "Gone Girl" this is a winner. Lot's of intrigue.
A "who done it for sure. Crazy theme and story line but good read.
I like the multiple points of view but the ending was too predictable.
Excellent suspense novel that is a quick read & keeps you entertained!
Fast read. Good vacation book, what I expected, based on other reviews
Was very disappointed. Too many dysfunctional people. Very depressing.
I just want to shake Rachel, Paula nailed the mindset of the alcoholic
I enjoyed this but it wasn't as riveting and believable  as Gone Girl.
disjointed,  hard to determine who is talking.  ending was predicticle
I'm still reading this book, but so far it's engaging and interesting.
Enjoyed this book very much. Looking forward to more from this Author.
The story went on and on and not much really happened; I kept waiting.
Be sure you have some free time because this book is hard to put done.
Not very good.  One-dimensional characters; silly plot; waste of time.
Didn't finish it. Too plodding and the characters are one-dimensional.
kept my interest. characters with a lot of problems. enjoyed the book.
It was a page turner for sure.  I didn't have the culprit figured out.
I thought it was great - it kept me totally captivated on a rainy day!
Great story well written suspense built and stayed strong till the end
I couldn't put it down, so read it in one day.  I liked the structure.
I found it too repetetive throughout. Perhaps not enough red herrings.
Exciting- loved the imperfect heroine! Great plot and hard to put down
Predictable ending about 3/4 through which are it a disappointing read
Really kept you guessing and full of surprises.  Couldn't put it down.
READ IT IN OUR BOOK CLUB,  EVERYONE LIKED IT AND HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION
Love the twists and turns and All the characters versions and thoughts
The hype for the book was better than the book itself, but it was okay
This was a pretty captivating story. Written in an interesting format.
Hard to put this book down.  Great insight into the mind and emotions.
Loved this even better than "Gone Girl!" Highly recommend!!!!!
Very interesting from every perspective.  Good psychological thriller.
I have never read a novel so fast.  I just couldn't put the book down!
Slow beginning but it built to an exciting couldn't put it down ending
It drags. Took too long for any action and characters were depressing.
Interesting book that completely kept my interest until the last page.
Like gone girl just lighter. The last few chapters were the best part.
Took a bit to get into but sped up fast. Kept my attention throughout.
Couldn't wait to find out the whole story. Well done.  And a surprise.
Well written and filled with twists and turns! I couldn't put it down!
Good read with several twists and surprises.  Like a mystery should be
Very entertaining!  Enjoyed every page and couldn't put the book down!
I really enjoyed the story. It was well written and the character development was fantastic.  I read it every free second I had, enveloped in the stories. My only warning is that you need to be ready for a heavy and depressing mystery as opposed to an edge-of-your-seat page turner. Don't let that stop you, though. Just make sure you're ready before starting.
Thriller? I don't think so!  It was all I could do to finish this big bore and the ONLY reason I did was because I paid for it. Not one likable charcter in the entire book. I couldn't have cared less what happened to anyone. Save your money and if you want a real good read that is a thriller, read 'The Silent Wife' - now that's a book I couldn't put down.
Very strange novel with odd plots. Not the greatest book on my shelf.
It was good but can't figure why it would be in the top ten for weeks
Too confusing on time line.  Character is weird.  Jumbled story line.
Mystery enjoyed the alternating persons point of view. Lots of twists
A bit slow in the beginning, but suspenseful enough to keep me going!
couldn't put it down.  disappointed this was the author's first book.
Great- well written. Good character development and incredible plot!!
Timelines bounced around a little too much, but overall, a good read.
Excellent story. Pulls you in right away. Didn't want to put it down.
Hated it. Not my type of book but I did stick with it and finished it
it was good especially leading up to the end, but slow in the middle.
Rarely does a book live up to the hype but this one did.  I loved it.
In my estimation, it was much too slow moving to hold your attention.
Easy read, fast paced, good book, a bit of a slow down to the ending.
The book kept your interest and wanting to know what was coming next.
This was a good summer who-doone-it kind of a read. Enjoyed it a lot.
A fun ride, though the ending was a little to tidy. Good summer read.
good but got bored a bit with the same drunken stories about Rachael.
Takes a while to get going but it turned into a page turner later on.
The story and its telling are excellent. It is a page-turner, indeed!
Very suspenseful- I could not put this book down until I finished it.
Really had me going. Thought I knew the outcome but certainly didn't!
If you liked gone girl this book is for you but has a better ending:)
I really enjoyed this book, a great read - found it hard to put down.
It was a little repetitious but enjoyed it very much.  Stick with it.
fragmented for much of book, finally came together as end approached.
Hard to put down. Couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next!
Very long and drawn out to get to the most climatic scene at the end.
This book is absorbing and addicting.  I stayed up nights reading it.
Interesting delivery from the perspective of three female characters.
Loved this book I couldn't put it down. The ending was a jaw dropper.
Exceptionally written with solid characters and unpredictable twists!
Great summer read.  Interesting.  Unreliable narrator.  I enjoyed it.
Very good.  Fast read.  One of the best mysteries I've read recently.
I could not get into the book at all maybe I will try at another time
Subject matter rather disturbing. Would make a riveting action movie.
Great read.  I didn't want to put this book down!  Really enjoyed it.
Fair read - trying to get to the end of the book but it's taking time
Slow start,  story picks about half way through,  pretty good ending.
This is a very good story, very well written.  I recommend this book.
Not really an uplifting book...full of sad twists and damaged people!
the main character is so annoying.....self destructive and whiny.....
Fun-to-read thriller with good quality of writing, some twisty turns.
Enjoyed this book when I finally worked out the different characters.
Slow going at first, like the train the girl is on, it picks up speed
Good book. Finished it in 4 hours. Recommended to friends and family.
I could not put this book down. It was a great read and well written.
Did not like how it switched from person to person for the whole book

Good tale and reminder that people are seldom who you think they are.
Very well written with excellent character development; Good suspense
Once I got into the first Chapter, It had my interest!  Well written!
Couldn't put this down! Loved how it kept you guessing until the end.
Very well written and just enough to keep you guessing. A great read!
Loved this book. Took it on vacation and had trouble putting it down.
This book was a good read. The ending was not what I expected at all.
Grat book. Not commenting anything else. Don't want to spoil the end.
Keeps you guessing until the mast moment to begin the falling action.
Great psychological drama. Interesting characters. Fun vacation read.
I could not put this book down! SO riveting, from the very beginning.
Not well written at all. A very difficult read.<br/>Boring actually.

Like a slice of chocolate cake its easy to digest and very enjoyable.

Absolutely riveting.  Never knew what to expect.  Wonderfully written
A good fast read with twists, but also a little darker than expected.
Loved the book. Quite a lot of interesting surprised.<br/><br/>Gail
A very readable book with some complex, not very pleasant characters.
Very hard to put down. Keeps your interest and has unexpected twists.
It was confusing, uninteresting, to the extent that  quit reading it.
Liked the unpredictability abnd the complex development of the story.
great book - deserves to be #1 on best seller list -highlyrecommended
good book overall.  I enjoyed the plot and it was a fairly easy read.
Good, quick read.  Full of twists and turns that I did not see coming
I'm on the bandwagon.  This was a take-your-breath away mystery ride.
Enjoyed this somewhat tortuous book .;but was not clear at the end whether they told of. Tom's confession to the police-it seems as if they did not.<br/>  And who was it that told the police about Megan's daughter?<br/>  And also confusing why Rachael, the protagonist, had rented a car ,but needed to get up soon the morning to take the train.<br/>..
This book got excellent reviews.  I found it overwhelming and scary.
Thought it was a bit slow going--until it wasn't. Unexpected ending!
I couldn't put it down and read it in one night. Super entertaining!
Not worth the time. Unrealistic characters with a lackluster ending.
Great writing and very entertaining! Loved it from beginning to end.
Very well written, but the final was a littlr predicable and simple.
loved the book. good twists. kept my interest the whole way through.
It had a long start but it captivated my attention to the last page.
Could not put the book down.  Exciting and was surprised at the end.
It took me a few chapters to get into it. I'm glad I didn't give up!
All female characters were portrayed as pathetically weak and needy.
Kind of creepy in a good way.  Will make a great psycho drama movie!
The main character is to pathetic. It made it difficult to like her.
Excellent read!  This story had me gripped from the start to finish.
Great book! I couldn't put it down... especially towards the end!!!!
It was slow getting into but after that, it really kept my interest.
It was a Ok book read to read.  I would not recommend to my friends.
Keeps your attention throughout...suspenseful...an enjoyable ride...
I made it too the end.  It ended how I expected. I'm glad it's over.
Not good..a real struggle to read..wish I would have saved my money!
Excellent thriller with a complex plot and well realized characters.
A little slow in the beginning but becomes a page turner by the end.
A very fast read, keeps you guessing. You won't want to put it down!
It started out slow and then gradually the story line came together.
Wasn't sure at first where the story was going but it's a good read.
I loved it. I could not put this book down until the very last word.
Good fast read but kind of predictable. Nothing exceptional about it
Hint - not a spoiler - follow the dates<br/>outstanding summer book
The story was great.  Well written and suspenseful.  Excellent read!
Excellent story - hard to put down once you start reading this book.
While the story held my interest, it was a tad drawn out at the end.
Similar to Gone Girl.  If you liked that book, you'll like this one.
It captured my attention but didn't think it was worth all the hype!
Started slow, ended well.  Not even in the same league as gone girl.
Captivating story, a real who-done-it I found impossible to put down
The story was not realistic and took much too long to the conclusion
just a gripping yarn well written and kept my interest until the end
Excellent book, hard to put down.  I can see why it's a best-seller.
This was a great, quick Summer read. Kept me engaged and interested.
I have nonly read about 14 of this book, and so far, I don't like it
I still want to know who the red headed man at the train station was
would have given 4 stars if there would have been no sexual content.
Seemed too much like other mystery novels out now. Not a great book.
Awesome book! Didn't expect the end to turn out as it did. Loved it!
Had me wondering until the very end. Shocked at the end of the book.
One of the best books I've read in a long time. Lots of plot twists.
a very good read, couldn't put it down and what a surprising ending.
Too obvious a story ---got tiresome after a while and not intriguing
Hard to relate to main characters.  Felt same way towards Gone Girl.
Well written, great story. I couldn't stop reading until I was done.
Enjoyable. Had to keep reading....wanted to know what happened next.
If you liked Gone Girl you will like this book.  It is well written.
I tried to like the characters and plot but in the end I hated both.
Interesting perspective into an alcoholic's mind.  Fascinating read.
Thought provoking in a way that makes you look at your own behavior.
I would not reommend a 5 because I didn't like any of the characters
It was a great book!  A little slow in the middle, but it was great.
somewhat predictable and not great. Lots of suspending of disbelief.
Definitely a book you think about.  Enjoyed it as much as gone girl.
Really couldn't get into the book 'til I read about 1/3 of the book.
Slow start and slightly confusing.<br/> Got better towards the end.
Slow starting, but keep at it.  It's more absorbing towards the end.
I found this story predictable and the charachters not very likable.
I really liked the twists in this book.  It's an easy engaging read!

Great book. Suspenseful and in depth characters. Great for everyone!
I stayed interested enough to finish, but it was kind of depressing.
It was a great suspenseful & interesting read right to the very end.
A bit slow to start but it draws you in and I just had to finish it!
Not as good as expected. Not really any twists that were unexpected.
A well written suspenseful novel. I would recommend it to my friends
Or maybe a 2 because EVERY character needed to "get a grip!"
Great book!  Can't wait for Paula Hawkins to put out another novel!!
Unusual story of three injured fragile women - excellent plot twists
Good read.  Pacing excellent & kept me guessing.  I really liked it!
I really liked this!  It was intriguing and really held my interest.
One of the best books I have read in a while.  Couldn't put it down!

Took about 2/3 of the book for the pace and intrigue to get started.
Good mystery - You cannot help but get involved with the characters.

Excellent twist. Captivating throughout the entire story. Loved it.
Well written, but very repetitive storyline and sad main character.
Really good reading, sometimes disturbing, but exciting to the end.
I longed for a strong female character, not going to find that here
Great book.  Unique twist that has me guessing throughout the book.
Couldn't stop reading it and kept me guessing almost until the end,
I am not much of a murder mystery reader,  my reason for the rating
I thought it was a easy read that kept you wanting to read to more.
It kept me riveted. I would highly recommend The Girl on the Train.

If you love a good mystery, you should read this book.  I loved it.
Quite a good read, but I was a little disappointed with the ending.
The resolution is more satisfying than Gone Girl, but same premise.
Disappointing, after all the appearances on the best selling lists.
when you need something new to read, this book might be interesting
I read it when it first came out and it was good but not memorable.
I really enjoyed the book. It had some interesting twists and turns
Very suspenseful until the end. But was disappointed in the ending.
Great read if you like "romantic" thrillers like Gone Girl!

Interesting and involved..What you see is not always what you think
A perfect audio book.  Don't read a lot about the book just listen.
The writing was excellent and grabs your attention. A  best seller.
A good, quick, read if a little predictable. It fizzled in the end.
If you like stories like Gone Girl, the pacing and plot are similar
Good read and a nice little mystery.  A little depressing at times.
The back and forth was confusing but then the rest was really good.
Loved this book, very different and gripping, so pleased I read it.
After reading reviews, I was excited to read a "page turner". Did not live up to the reviews in my opinion
I didn't like a single one of the characters.  Very poorly written.
Took me awhile to get into the story, but then I really enjoyed it.
It was very interesting all the way through.  It kept you guessing!
A little slow to start and then picks up and you can't put it down.

Such fun reading, lots of mystery, one of the best books this year.
Good read. Read it on a long, long flight. Enjoyable & written well

It was suspenseful and fun at the same time. I couldn't put it down

Great book!! It was hard to put down!! Ordered 2 more of her books.
This was a story I just didn't get into.  I didn't finish the book.
I could not put this book down. Best one I've read since Gone Girl.
Had a hard time finding a likable character. Quick read. Hooked me.
You have to be alert to stay on top of the characters and the plot.
great read. well written and unusual protagonist. i loved that she was so flawed and kind of "bridgette jones"...yet underneath she's actually smarter than everyone else.
Great book to read when you want a well-written but not heavy book.
Suspenseful! !! Could not stop reading. Characters are well formed.
Outstanding. I could not stop reading. The characters are very true
Great read!! Interesting and suspenseful up to the surprise ending.
Dull and ponderous.  I finished it but consider it a waste of time.
A well written psychological thriller with insight into alcoholism.
Very suspenseful, and interesting.  I've recommended to my friends.
The story kept me wanting to turn the page. Quick read. Good story.
Wonderful suspenseful quick reading!  I thoroughly would revmend it

Definitely a page turner. Great read for the beach or a plane trip.
Not finished yet... can't wait to read the ending. Very intriguing!
Great build up, but unfortunately the ending doesn't live up to it.
Had potential to be like Gone Girl but fizzled out into mediocrity.
It was ok. It dragged a little in between but I enjoyed reading it.
Very, very good read.. lots of unexpected twists. Highly recommend.
This was a pick for book club... I loved it - couldn't put it down!

Couldn't read it fast enough to find out what happened!  Good read.
Fast paced, suspenseful. Read it in 2 nights. Couldn't put it down.
Was not that great. Felt like the heroine was pretty much an idiot.
A good book for a book club to discuss the different personalities.
Excellent mystery....keeps you till the very end! Really unique....
Not a bad read, fast page turner .... You never know who did it ...
An entertaining book. Not particularly well written but a fun read.
Great read! What a clever use of the "unreliable" narrator!
Very good, fast read.  I couldn't stop reading it and actually had to slow myself down toward the end to make it last longer. The story was compelling and the author's writing engaging.  Wasn't sure at first that she was going back and forth from character to character but once I got that, it was fine.  Very good summer read and I recommend.
My first thought on finishing this book was that there were no heroes, no innocence. Then I realized that really, are there any totally innocent heroes?<br/><br/> If you're going to read this, pay attention to the dates on the entries. Silly me, assuming they would be in chronological order, had to go back and rethink the first 45 pages.
To be honest, you are not going to like any of the characters. There is not one of them that you would invite over for dinner. That does not mean that their story is not captivating. You will be subjected to an unreliable narrator who drinks too much and has an obsession with her ex-husband. His new wife who is adding fuel to the crazy fire and a husband and wife a few houses down that started this whole mess.<br/><br/>Lying about losing her job, Rachael Watson take the train each day to an imaginary job, when the train hits a crossing she looks up, every day the same thing, to see the row of homes that she used to live in. Her ex-husband is now occupying their old home with his new wife and child and a few houses down on the end is a couple that she had never met, but has decided to create her own running synopsis of their lives. Each day seeing little snippets until the ominous moment she opens the paper and sees the woman’s face starting back at her. Now missing, this woman that she has called Jess, whose real name is Megan disappeared on the very day that Rachael cannot account for her time due to an alcoholic blackout and now Rachael is determined to put all of her pieces back together. Maybe in doing so, she will be able to explain the bumps and scratches that she woke up with the morning after.<br/><br/>From time to time, Rachael would get off at this station, the one where her husband and the unknown couple lived; she would stalk and snoop, and on occasion make herself a real nuisance. She was obsessed with both the life that her ex-husband had created without her and with what she thought was the perfect life that the couple (Megan and Scott) on the corner had. To Rachael, Megan and Scott had it all, that is until she saw Megan with another man and something in Rachael unraveled.<br/><br/>It is a little complicated and a little twisty, but Paula Hawkins was able to give each character their own voice without confusing the reader as to whom was speaking.<br/><br/>Thus begins a Hitchcock’ian thriller. Who are all these people? Rachael’s internal narrative is trying to put the pieces together but she cannot recall all the parts and the parts that she does remember, do not blend with what her ex-husband has been telling her. If she could only stop drinking and remember. Why is she so afraid of the red haired man on the train? Does he have something to do with this?<br/><br/>I loved this book; Rachael sprinkled enough truths and uncertainties to have me wondering if I had missed something. The ending is phenomenal. Maybe you will be able to put it all together before I did, since each character had the prescribed motive, means and opportunity, for me it was still a guessing game to the end.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a nice neat “I could have told you who the killer was in the first chapter” type of book, you will not like this one. If you are looking for a book that will keep you guessing and running down rabbit holes with the narrator, then this is the book for you.
BORING !
Not good
Terrible
To silly
Great character development and fast paced mystery. Enjoyable read

strange story.  Maintains your interest right up to the last page.
A clever story line.  Great portrayal of an alcoholic personality.
One of those "I just have to read one more chapter" books.
Inside the brain of mental illness and addiction. Very compelling.
Hard to get anything done because I hated to put the kindle aside!
The girl on the train was an awful waste of time. Boring and dull.

It was a fascinating thriller that I had a hard time putting down.
Fun read with unexpected twists. I liked to character development.
Kept me guessing until the end.  It's adventure between the pages.
Quite frankly, I never finished the book.  The way the character is depicted in the beginning was just too depressing for me.  I don't mind sad sack characters but I guess I wasn't in the mood for this one after some of the other things I'd been reading.  Friends have told me that I should go back to it but I haven't taken the time yet.
3.5 stars. Its starts out  kind of slow and can be a bit confusing with all the different characters (2 of which have 2 names each in the beginning) and the different timelines. But once you get everyone straightened out and make it half way through it starts to pick up speed. I am not quite done yet, but the ending is pretty exciting.
The characters are not likeable ( I did not know who to cheer for most of the time), but their domestic situations are difficult. However the mystery and suspense kept me reading to find out who done it.If you do not like books where  the female charaters are hot messes and the males seem to have it together, this book is not for you.
I liked the book but in my opinion it was a little too drawn out.
The end really surprised me!  Wait for it!  Generally an OK book.
Very suspenseful story with lots of twists and turns in the plot.
Sort of slow.  it was ok.  Didn't enjoy the story line that much.
Have recommended to a lot of people.  Well written and good book.
terrific....kept my interest,,,liked the characters....great read
i very much enjoyed this novel and found it similar to Gone Girl.
I enjoyed this book quite a lot; it would make a good movie, too!
It was a good read. Kept me wondering, the ending was a bit lame.
Nice Read ! Read it while traveling via the railway ! good read !
Storyline was good however a little slow in parts and predictable
Although a best seller I can't say that I was enthralled with it.
While I love the book, I did figure it out before the big reveal.
A bit dark. But i wanted to keep reading and it held my interest.
After awhile I thought all of the characters were somewhat alike.
I couldn't put this book down! Now I'm waiting for the movie. :-)
worth reading, kinda graphic, wouldn't have predicted the ending.
Best book I've read in a while....loved it, couldn't put it down!
Couldn't put it down. Compulsively readable. Read it in two days.
I read the whole book in one day. It kept me guessing to the end.
Great story.  Starts off slow but stick with it for a grand ride.
Replica of Gone Girl.  Don't know why it is getting so much hype.
Excellent mystery with twists and turns enough to make one dizzy.
Great suspense novel, had you guessing until really the very end.
Good little who done it.  Had it figured out pretty early though.
Surprise ending! Hard to figure out when you first start reading.
Very engrossing. Kept me interested until the end. Very easy read
Well written and hard to put down from the first to last chapter.
Just not my cup of tea I guess.  The plot is just not that great.
Boring much of the time and formulaic. Far from believable story.
I didn't like the fact that each chapter was a different subject.
Not a feel good read by any means but loved the twists and turns.
Kind of a strange book. The time changes were a little confusing.
Loved the book lots of twists interesting characters surpring end
It took too long to get into the book.  Good story but not great.
Kept me guessing. Didn't catch on until it was obvious. Fun read.
Found it very compelling. Held my interest. Hated to put it down!
Very good.  If you liked Gone Girl, you'll most likely like this.
Was a good read. Thought I had it figured out but Bam, enjoyed it
Great book!  You won't put this book down once you start reading.
Captivating....intriguing until the final page.  Excellentl read.
Slow start, but worth staying with this story - it's a good read!
Fantastic!  Reminded me of GONE GIRL.  Didn't see the end coming.

Once i got into this book i couldn't put it down...great story...
Excellent read. A real page turner once characters are developed.
ordered to read for April book club, hae trouble getting involved
I thought it was really good and liked it better than Gone Girl!!
A wonderful read from first page to the last. Keeps you guessing.
It was very difficult to follow as the dates went back and forth.
Pretty good, a bit draggy in parts, but overall ,  a good mystery
Very different from most murder mysteries I read and challenging.
It was so-so.  Kept my interest, but I wanted to skim through it!
Talk about depressing.  Glad Rachel finally got her act together.
Best book I have read in years!!! I could not put this book down.
This book was soo good!!! Couldn't stop reading. Hard to predict.

Good, a bit like Gone Girl, but different enough that I liked it.
The wife was very delighted to get this book and loves. Thank you
Loved the mystery of each relationship..they were all screwed up!
Was good story maybe a little redundant sometimes but interesting
I thought overall it was very good a little slow in the beginning
Good story. Went on for too long. But a fun read, never the less.
Excellent........I could not put the book down.........loved it!!
Fast read, draws you in and keeps you turning the pages. Intriguing.
loved every minute of this book, was sorry when I got to the end.
Suspenseful, with a lot of twists.  This would make a good movie.
Great read!  Interesting characters and story.  Highly recommend.
Plot was interesting, but the characters were all pretty bizarre.
To me it did not meet the expectations of the review that I read.
Wow! I have to admit that I figured out who the culprit was half-way through the book, but this was so masterfully written that I couldn't stop reading. The similarities to "Gone Girl" are that the writing is so perfect and the characters so well developed that the reader is forced to continue just to see where they end up.
Not an enjoyable read, convoluted story.
Ok read... just nothing really moving or special about it to me.
This book could be a bit shorter but overall it was a great book
I thought it was better than Gone Girl, not quite a predictable.
One of the best I have read in a long time!! A real page turner!
Very interesting read. Keep me guessing where it was going next.
It did keep my attention but overall I didn't care for the story
Not my choice read. Kept my attention but had disappointing end.
The book was excellent, loved it.<br/>Suspenseful till the end.
Very depressing story.  Was not in the mood to finish reading it
This is a real "page turner"; held my attention captive!

Too many stupid people. All the people in it were too messed up.
One of the best & most engaging books I've read in a long while!
Very suspenseful.  Once I got into I didn't want to put it down!
story to long.  seemed repetitious, I thought it would never end
Great, suspenseful read. Keeps you guessing all the way through.
Pretty good. Not crazy good. But nicely written and suspenseful.
well written, a little drawn out, not an uplifting kind of story
Halfway through, and I am waiting for this to "hook" me.
Sorry I couldn't get into the story and haven't finish the book.
I loved this story and the characters. Never saw the end coming.
Easy read. Have already told people to get the book and read it.
The book is full of surprises! I liked that it kept me guessing.
Good read. Kept me interested throughout. Interesting characters
Good book, but didn't think it was captivating like some others.
Maybe it was just me but at times it seemed difficult to follow.
Really a good read.  One of the best I've read so far this year.
I thought the writing was terrible and the plot somewhat boring.
Slow reading. Needed a chart to keep names in correct placement.
If you want a clinical picture of depression, this is your book.
Interesting way of writing.  Each chapter is a different person.
really disliked it the whole way through, no depth to characters
Just didn't enjoy it, only likable character was his sister, Go.
Confusing. Did not hold my interest until the last two chapters.
Not as good as I expected it to be but a good read all the same!
Easy to read book.  Makes you want to finish it once you start .
Greatly enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it highly.
Grabs your attention from the first page. A very enjoyable read.
Started out great!  Then got really slow and hard to keep going.
This book made me not want to get drunk ever again.  Great read.

I don't know how this book made the top of the charts as it has!
Very suspenseful.  Couldn't wait to read what would happen next.
if you liked Gone Girl, you will like this-book has mind-twists!
It's not what the critics were raving about but it's a good read
structure is well conceived. The characters were not compelling.
It was just OK.  Got a littlet monotonous,  but ending was good.
Excellent!  Kept you interest from the first page.  Many twists.
An enjoyable diversion that would make a good summer beach read.
The book is good not great. After awhile these women annoyed me.
Kept me interested and involved with the characters and the plot

Fascinating and suspenseful.  The ending was a complete surprise
a very different style of writing...last 100 pages most exciting

A story of mentally unstable characters.  Not an enjoyable read.
If you love Gone Girl type mysteries, try The Girl on the Train.
The best!  I thought I add the mystery solved...but I was wrong!
Outstanding!!!  Didnt want to do anything except read this book!
Darn it, I had it figured out early on. But o really enjoyed it.
I did enjoy this simply written novel, but I pretty much guessed all the details way ahead. And I got tired of all of Rachel's drinking life. Was a fun read but in no way does it compare to Gone Girl!
Nice story but the end is disappointing and rather predictable.
better than most, kept you interested figuring out who did what
A simple read but I guessed "Whodunnit" quite early on!

Awesome.  Could not put it down.  Read entire book in two days.
Good book, bought it off of other reccomendations - glad I did!

Once you get past the first 100 pages or so, the pace picks up.
Great summer read! Lots of twists and turns, lots of surprises.
A must read.  Not at all what you would think the end would be.

I read it through and through because I could not stop reading.
hard to understand in the beginning  - rather unbelievable plot

Liked this book very much, ending was an interesting surprise.
It was just ok. Not worth waiting for three months at library!
found it hard to believe or sympathize with anyone in the book
formula writing. haven't we had enough of these vague stories.
Even when you know "whodunnit" the suspense continues!
Loved it! I'm not a big reader, but this was easy to get into.
It got more interesting and faster in the 2nd half of the book

A little slow to start however the last 30 pages were riveting

Captivating story and unusual plot device. A real page-turner!

It was a great suspense and I enjoyed the 3 women narrarators.
Hard to keep up with the different people until later in story
It didn't do much for me.  Kind of slow.  Kind of predictable.
Fast paced enjoyable reading.  Had to make myself take breaks.
the book was very good. deliver was late despite amazon prime,
Another mystery novel about horrid people doing horrid things.
Glad i read it but it wasn't quite worth a four star for me...
It was totally unrealistic. It was a waste of my time.  Hal W.

Exciting and a page-turner-a little confusing at the beginning
Somewhat suspenseful but not the edge of your seat suspenseful
I found it too weird and depressing. I like uplifting stories.

What's not to love about this book!  Gone Girl all over  again
Well written, dark but exciting story that keeps you guessing.
Fabulous!  Couldn't put it down.  It's as good as the hype....
This book should not even be compared to "Gone Girl"!!
Not quite as intense as Gone Girl, but a good book regardless!

A little bit convoluted, but nonetheless an excellent mystery.
I am going to recommend this book for our book club next year.
I loved this story.  I wish they would make a movie of this !!

Great thriller with terrific characters  could not put it down
I enjoyed this book - a nice easy read for a relaxing weekend.
Entertaining -- not quite as good as Gone Girl but a fun read!
somewhat suspenseful, however the dialogue becomes repetitive.
Wow in the genre of " Gone girl" Couldn't put it down.
I am not sure if I missed reading some pages or something is wrong with me... I did not find this story an edge of the seat thriller as described in many reviews.. It is dragging  at many places. Media can make anything appealing nowadays with made up hype.. Maybe you would like it but for me its just a 3 star..
This book was so dumb. I can't believe it has so many good reviews. Yes, it's not War and Peace- this is a beach read. But seriously- it does backflips to try to make the ending work. The ending is just so convoluted, so ridiculous, so convenient: it is literally the dumbest ending I've ever read. Happy reading!
This book is fast, developed,suspenseful, and has some twists
Read this while on vacation & found it difficult to put down.
Was difficult to get into at first.  OK.  Interesting ending!
Fabulous story. Once I got into it I oils not leave it alone!
I had trouble putting this book down.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.

Too dragged out and not a lot of "meat" to the story.

The writing is really good and it holds you from start finish
Too much repetitive introspection by neurotic, unreal people.
Good read! Kept up a nice, steady pace. Well developed story.
Good read- Holds your interest.  I would recommend this book.
A different "who done it", definately worth your time
Worth the read if you have extra time, but a bit predictable.

I read all the time and this is one I would suggest to all...
I really enjoyed the book, couldn't put it down until te end.

full of surprises but a little bit low sometimes,I enjoyed it
Great unfolding of the story as characters reveal themselves.

To dark ,I think it is a book that wold appeal more to women

Might be well written, but is just another murder  mystery.
This didn't live up to the hype I expected but it was okay.
It was a very good book, kept my interest, hard to put dowm
What is everyone raving about.  Too dark and dreary for me!

It held my interest the whole way through; no boring parts.
The ending is a surprise and helped my opinion of the book.
LOVED this book.  Very suspenseful and wonderfully written.
It felt like Gone Girl except with a train and not as good.
Interesting but much humping from one character to another.
the book held my interest because of the "whodunit"
It promised better than it delivered. I was a little bored.
It was difficult to find sympathy for any of the characters
Kept me guessing all the way through. Couldn't put it down.
Didn't care for the ending.  Wish it had been less violent,
Fun, easy read.  Makes you want to keep picking it back up.

Nice writing, good story, and kept you guessing to the end.
Pretty good storyline idea.  Could have used better writer.
Good start. Curious. Finished. Thankfully I get to move on.
This was a great book. Quick read definitely a page turner.
Dull, boring, unrealistic. Do not waste your time or money.
Great read!  Riveting!  Held me in suspense the whole time!
starting out.  Then it grabs you and you can't put it down.
Good worth reading but slightly disappointing  a few twists

This was a great read. Lots of twists and turns on the way.
Great read! Not as Gone Girl, but definitely a page turner.
Did not figure it out until the end. Could not put it down.
Found it loathsome. Some people like it, just not my taste.
Have not finished book, but is weird.  Not what I expected.
Too much confusion with the change of names in each chapter
On a par with Gone Girl.  Little more suspense and mystery.
This is a terrific page turned. Didn't want to put it down,
I thought that I was reading the script of a bad soap opera
I enjoyed it the further into the story kept me intrigued..
Very captivating and well written. Really enjoyed this book
Gripping...well written....kept my attention throughout....
Excellent for author's first book!  Will read more of hers.
Well written detective story.  ABOUT characters in their 30's and effects of marital infidelity and having a child--or not.  It IS a good murder mystery.  I'm in my late 60s.  I didn't learn a single thing from having read this.  We all have time when we WANT to accomplish nothing.  I usually nap!
Best seller, maybe, but I found it unfinishable.  Disjointed, confusing, unlikable characters, inscrutable plot lines & poor character development of unsympathetic people.  Don't care WHAT Steven King says......excellent writer he may be, but critic he ain't.  Totally disappointing waste of money.
Boring!
Dribble
Strange
Just ok

Chrisitmas gift for my husband who is seeming to enjoy it.
one of the best mysteries I have read in years.  Loved it.
Very interesting characters, all of them flawed and all of them fascinating. The pace of this thriller will hold your interest. Brilliantly executed. If you liked "Gone Girl", you'll probably enjoy this book. Just make sure you have a weekend set aside as you won't want to put it down.
I think the saying "different strokes for different folks" applies to me.  I did not like this book at all.  I read reviews of how good it was and bought it.  I found it ghoulish.
It's been a long time since I've read a book I could not put down.  It was riveting, unpredictable.  The writing style was such that it felt as though the characters were right there in the room with me telling their sides of the story.  I read it in 24 hours...  This will make a great movie.
If you liked the book Gone Girl, you will love this book!
Captivating and suspenseful. I can't wait for the movie!!
Book was slow for first third n then got better n better.
There is a difference between plot twists and loose ends.
A good read, but did not have me on the edge of my chair.

One of the best mystery books I have read in a long time.
Great book! I love to see each character's point of view.
Very suspenseful! Good twists, but a little weird for me!
Could not put it down.  Anxiously awaiting her next book.
Life is too short to read a book this bad.  I could not wait to finnaly finish it.  There were no redeeming characters and the only reason it was somewhat suspensful was because to "Girl" was always drunk and unable to remember anything.  This is time I will be unable to replace.
I don't know why I Finished this book.  I hated the weak characters.  There was not one who had any admirable qualities or showed any strength of character.  This book was a complete waste of time.  I'm a bit ashamed of myself for reading and finishing it.  Don't waste your time on it.
The Girl on the Train is richly layered. Suspense builds throughout the story which is narrated by three women damaged by relationships and their own weaknesses. All of the women try to find ways to control their lives while also falling victim to lies. I highly recommend this novel!
No story<br/>Waiting for the shoe to drop it never did.
Not anywhere near as good as Gone Girl but very similar.
Way too long, and way too  much about Rachel's drinking!
Good book but not as suspenseful as I expected it to be.

It kept me wondering who was the murderer until the end.
Interesting, compelling, told from a unique perspective.
Story took quite awhile to get into but finally took off
This book is a lot of fun. A good summer reading choice.
will keep you on your toes guessing "who did it"
I enjoyed the narrative..a mystery to the final chapter!

I could read this again and again.
Didn't like it.  It was depressing
I didn't enjoy this book. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. I also fail to understand the incessant need to use the f word. It shows poor form and lack of vocabulary. This is a book I cannot recommend and one I'm embarrassed to say I actually read to the end.

An entertaining who killed who, whose sleeping with who
Great read. So many twists. Plan on not putting it down
Amazing book. I love having it downloaded on my kindle.
Loved the way it was organized as the character grows up.  It  reads easily and quickly and it's a great price
A little "too all over the place" for my taste.
A great psychological and scary read.  Had me guessing.
Good beach or travel read but certainly not literature!

None of the characters were likable or very believable.
SLOW BEGINING AND TAKE TO LONG TO GET YOU INTO THE PLOT
Kept me entertained and wondering "who did it".
The next book to read if you liked Gone Girl-very good!
Little slow to start but turns into a real thrill ride.
A real page turner with an unexpected twist at the end.
I think this book is over rated.  Not worthy of a movie

An excellent page turner with lots of twists and turns.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down!
Received the books as promised. In very good condition.
Interesting read.  Suspension increases toward the end.
Have heard a lot about this book. It was disappointing.
Don't know why it is rated #1 on the best sellers list.
Not the next "Gone Girl" but it was still good.
Will nit recommend to my book group.  Not well written.
The story was excellent!  I could not put the book down
Literally read this in one day ~ could NOT put it down!
I wasn't as enamored as I'd hoped I'd be.  I found the main character a little unsympathetic, and had a little trouble identifying with her throughout.  Very well written, though, and the plot delivered plenty of surprises.  I'm glad I read it, but I won't be reading it again.
I loved the way this book was written. It was a very fun and easy read. At times I felt like the author was dreading the story a little too much to stretch the suspense. It was a pretty nice story line from the point of view of 3 different women. Overall it was a nice read.
Was not what I expected. since it had received so many good reviews. I did not like the characters They are not people I would care to associate with.. Main character is a drunk who lies,etc. Not my type . Was very disappointed in the book especially because of the reviews!
It was a bit slow in the beginning and the title character's drinking and lack of responsibility became a bit tiresome.  Also, I thought it was weird that the pile of clothes on the side of the track never really led anywhere even though she referred to them several times.
Very good book. If you liked Gone Girl then read this.
Good booked.  A few twists and turns.  Very enjoyable.
I did not enjoy the confusing way this book was wrtten
Got pretty tired of the main character pretty quickly!
Kept you on the edge of your seat while on that train!

Quite the page turner, easy reading, VERY suspenseful.
It was an exciting who-done-it mystery.  I enjoyed it.

I just didn't find the story line to be that engaging.
Excellent book!  Loved it all and highly recommend it.
This makes Gone Girl look like a piker. It's wonderful
Good book and I have already recommended it to others.
This is the best book of its type I've read for a while. After I finished the book, seemingly random actions and pieces of the puzzle clicked into place. That's a nice change from the ones that seem satisfying for a few minutes and then huge, implausible holes in the plot appear and ruin the effect.<br/><br/>Not only was the book well thought out, but the author's handling of an alcoholic character was well done. Rachel struggles and fails constantly. Drinking makes her sick and fills her with self-loathing, but she cannot miraculously change. Much more realistic than many books.<br/><br/>The book is narrated by three women and also has three major male characters. All of them are flawed. Some of them are downright obnoxious. Granted, everyone has flaws, but these characters were often impossible to like. I've rarely seen a book with an entire irritating cast. The characters were all distinct and have real-life counterparts, though.<br/><br/>Two of the female characters narrate the tale chronologically. The victim, who is the third narrator, tells her tale in the past, moving forward until she becomes the victim. Although that structure makes sense, it was difficult to follow and I needed to keep checking the date of entries to keep from getting lost. I wondered if following Rachel to the "off-license" for a bottle of wine to accompany the book might help.
I found the story hard to get use to in the beginning but it picked up speed!  It tackles some sad subjects...infidelity, murder and alcoholism. I really didn't like any of the characters much.  That makes it less enjoyable to read but I was rooting for the dissed wife.
I have decided that I no longer care to read about dysfunctional people. And every character in this mystery is a hot mess.  I kept reading only to see the mystery solved because it was very intricate.  But I couldn't really care what happened to any of the characters.
I haven't finished it but I am enjoying it very much.
Loved this book! A real unexpected twist at the end😊
Keeps you guessing until the end! Fabulously written!
Better than Gone Girl...suspenseful, hard to put down

Great book, kept you guessing. Couldn't put it down.

Best novel I have read since the Dragon Tattoo Girl.
Slow moving. But keeps you reading. Surprise ending.
This was a great read, and one I could not put down!
A fun read!  Perfect pairing with any glass of wine.
I liked this book a lot.  The hurst book I have read by Paula Hawkins.  Thus book is a really good mystery that lets you come to your own conclusions, and always keeps you guessing. Pay attention to time frames and the first few chapters. A really good read.
Saw it discussed on CBS morning show.  I enjoy Harlan Corbin,  Tom Clancy and Sandra Brown novels, this is a little to psychological for me - just over half way through, perhaps it gets better going forward - lots of back and forth through time, seems slow.

This is one of  the best books I've read this year!
Excellent read...didn't want to put the book down!
too much repetition in many of the first chapters.
I hated this book. Absolutely hated it. It was an attempt to out-do "Gone Girl" in meanness, and it almost succeeded. Not one person I have spoken to actually liked or enjoyed this book, any of its characters or even the story. Don't bother.
This is a thrilling book. I actually got out of bed twice to read 'just one more chapter' bc I couldn't stop thinking about this story. In the vein of Gillian Flynn and Marisha Pessl, but entirely its own.<br/><br/>Also, I'm never getting married.
Each book I read leaves an imprint; good, bad, or indifferent.  This story will be etched in as good. I enjoy this type of storytelling; the switch back of characters.  For once, I didn't guess the ending.  Highly recommend for a rainy weekend read.
I understand that the author had to introduce the characters and set up the story, but I feel like the pace didn't pick up until too late in the book. It did have an interesting twist at the end however, it was more compensatory than anything else.
Hhhmmm, I wanted to love this story after reading reviews but found it too predictable. I agree that it is Gone Girl esk, but without the depth of character development. The premise was original and it was well written as in sentence structure etc.
This is a fast paced thriller about cheating husband, jilted wives and lovers and centers around a train.  The author switches voices between the three females, which enriches the story and the mystery. The end is predictable, but worth the read.
Well written from three different viewpoints, each with their own unique circumstance.  Plot was unpredictable and engaging. Writing was clear, colorful and full of characters thoughts.  A rich read- this author is now on my list of "good ones."
The book is wonderful, very motivated for reading
Great read. Lots of twists and turns in the book.
Good book, but took too long to really be hooked.
Page turner but not fond of any if the characters

Great story! Keeps you on the edge of your chair
A page turner and full of suspense.  Great read!
Entertaining, mysterious, scary, painful, funny and really great suspense book. I couldn't put it down, finished it in two days. Must read! Don't read anymore reviews, just buy the book before you figure out the whole plot. Buy it already!
I chose 5 stars because I couldn't find one flaw about this book. Well written with lots of twists and lies that you never see coming. Once you start it consumes you. Highly recommended for everyone who likes to read a good drama/thriller!
Although brief, this novel manages to be tedious and repetitive. Fans of Gone Girl will be disappointed--those who disliked Gone Girl will hate it.<br/><br/>With massive editing, it could be a decent movie--alas, Hitchcock is long gone.
I've read this book a couple of times already and will likely read it a few more times.  I'm usually good at figuring out where a story is going but this one did have me guessing a bit.  The story is well told and unfolds at a good pace.
I didn't expect to like this one so much! It had so many emotions in it. You can't help but loathe and yet feel sorry for Rachel's condition, I loved the story told between the 3 women. Great unexpected ending! Can't wait for the movie.
What a dreary tale. Hawkins is a great writer and plotter, but her characters are so unlikable. The only character with much humanity was the roommate. Otherwise, they were people I wouldn't want to spend this much time with ever again.
I read this book in a day and a half! I can totally see this being made into a movie. I picture Rachel Zellewegar in the role as Rachel. I highly recommended this book to any of you that liked Gone Girl and a good who done it mastery!
One of the best books I've read in a long time!
Good book it kept you interested until the end.
if you like Nicci French, you'll love this one.

This book has garnered a lot of attention - to be one of the bigger releases so far into 2015. With an intriguing premise, I decided to listen to this one and I am so glad that this is the format that I chose. I don't know that I would have enjoyed the story as much if I had read the print version, to be honest. The three narrators each do a wonderful job of bringing Rachel, Megan and Anna's stories vividly to life. Each of these women is so unlikable and damaged that I don't think I would have been able to palate reading them, whereas listening to them captured my interest completely in a sort of trainwreck way.<br/><br/>But, despite my disgust with each of these women, I must admit that it was hard to stop listening - it is oddly captivating. Often I found myself listening to this one outside of the car, my typical listening place. I expected, from the blurb, for this to have more of a Rear Window feel to it with Rachel's voyeurism on her commute in and out from London. But it quickly becomes clear that Rachel is more than a watcher with an overactive imagination. She's a drunk (who knew that gin and tonic came in a can?!) who frequently blacks out. Megan, the object of Rachel's watching does not have the perfect life that Rachel has imagined and when she goes missing, the author allows plenty of room to speculate along with the characters. Anna, the third woman, is connected to both Rachel and Megan with her own troubles.<br/><br/>The plot follows some sadly expected routes, but there are some surprises tossed in. Each of these women is just so unlikable, with each finding their self-worth only in the eyes of the men they love. None of these women are heroes - even at the novel's climax - and by the end, despite how engrossing it had been, it is surprisingly easy to say goodbye to these characters. Still, it is an attention-grabbing story and one that is superbly performed. I will probably keep an eye out for more from this author, though, despite my dislike of the characters because of how overall engrossing the story was.
I love books that I can't put down! As soon as I finished The Girl on the Train, I messaged my friends and told them to pick it up! I see the Gone Girl comparisons but unlike it, this moves so much faster and it leaves out a big chunk of unnecessary reading.<br/><br/>Rachel-the main character, not very likable, even heard myself calling her a Dumb *$@$ at times buttt can you blame the poor lady!? She drinks. And the issues there are real. As much as we want her to stop drinking she knows it won't stop today. Maybe tomorrow. We learn quickly that she's alone. She longs to feel the touch of another person and the only thing close to that are the joys she experiences from riding the TRAIN.<br/><br/>The rides give her an inside look at the homes by the railroad...and that's where we meet Jesse & Jason through the perspective of alcoholic Rachel. Until one day it's not Jesse and Jason ...it's Jesse and a new tall, dark, and & handsome man. Rachel feels betrayed, how can she do this!? The feelings in her gut are all too familiar considering that the same thing happened to her. And it just so happens that Tom (ex) and his new wife, Anna live a few houses down. Happily, with their baby girl.<br/><br/>Suddenly we find out that Jesse is missing. Jesse is really Meagan. Another lost character that has a void to fill and does it by cheating on her husband, Scott (aka Jason). Rachel, knows she has a lover, and now feels the need to go and tell her husband and the police. Her credibility is not too good considering she's always harassing her ex and his wife. The lies that come pouring out this book are endless. It really goes to show that not everyone is who you think they are.<br/><br/>I think what I like the most is that Paula Hawkins created characters with such realistic personalities. The women in this book are flawed ...searching and finding themselves in the wrong places. I had my guesses on to what happened to Megan but it was great seeing it develop through the perspectives of Rachel, Anna, & Megan.<br/><br/>I'm a fan!
We've all had moments when we dream fantasy lives for neighbors or people we see by random encounters.  However, as normal people we don't become obsessed. In Paula Hawkins debut psychological thriller, The Girl on the Train, the characters sway far from ordinary.<br/>The story is conveyed by three narrators, all women with extraordinary characteristics: The lead narrator, Rachel Watson is an alcoholic with memory lapses so large the reader will struggle to know who she is (as Rachel cannot remember for herself and must rely on the accounts of others to piece her days back together). Megan Hipwell is a woman with so many secrets and past lives the reader is left wondering what has she yet to let us in on and will we ever know all of her secrets. And finally a sugary, manipulative woman, Anna Watson, who seems to be struggling to lead an ordinary life but her actions leave the reader wondering which side of Anna will ultimately win out in the end.<br/>Rachel Watson's life has not turned out in the manner of which she had dreamed, far from it actually. Rachel had an opportunity for a storybook happy ending: a loving husband, a job, a home and plans for a family. How then, did everything go so wrong? If only she could remember. Rachel's daily commute to London takes her past the life that she lost to alcoholic blackouts, stopping at a signal just behind her old neighborhood where her world went awry. So painful is seeing her former home, now shared by her ex- husband, his new wife and their child, Rachel focuses instead on a couple living a few houses down. She gives life to the neighbors she might have had, fantasizing them into a perfect, beautiful and happy couple, even assigning them poetic names. Until one day Rachel spies a scene from the train that shatters the dream she has assigned the couple. Rachel learns the next morning (after one of her drunken stupors) that the fantasy woman, Meagan Hipwell, has been reported missing. As Rachel pieces together the events of the prior evening, she discovers that she was in fact in the neighborhood at the time the woman was last reported having been seen. Taking on the self-proclaimed role of "Nancy Drew" she begins investigating the disappearance of Megan Hipwell. She must first, however, play sleuth to her own whereabouts and actions of the night in question.<br/>Megan Hipwell is bored. She has reinvented herself so many times over that she no longer knows who she is and what she really wants. She should be happy. Megan has a doting husband and beautiful home. Why then does she seek situations that could rip her world apart and dream of running away, yet again?<br/>Anna Watson has gotten everything she wanted. She was the mistress that won. She got the husband, the home and the beautiful baby. Now she wants the one nuisance in her life gone, the ex-wife, Rachel Watson.<br/>No one knows what goes on behind closed doors and lives dreamed up while on passing trains rarely correlate with what is happening inside the mysterious abodes.<br/>Narration from the story's orators are scrambled but well done. As the pieces of the story start to fall into place, the reader will turn page after page to learn more.  The women in this novel are unreliable, calculating and flighty, and the men are unquestionably flawed. It is difficult to find anything in common with these characters or genuinely likable for that matter. The unlikelihood of them all being entwined however, is what will keep the reader chugging along.
I really enjoyed Paula Hawkins debut novel and I'm sure I'll be looking for her next one.  The story is set in England which makes all of the public transportation a bit of a novelty to a west coaster, but what a ride.  Rachel rides the train twice a day and has the pleasure(?) of seeing the house her ex-husband lives in with his new wife and child because of her commute.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, we learn that Rachel has a bit of a drinking problem and can't seem to remember key parts of her life.  Because of Rachel's drinking, she's divorced and lonely, and starts to live vicariously through the attractive couple who live just a few doors down from her ex-husband. As Rachel sits on the train, she imagines the wonderful life her couple are living until something happens that spoils everything.<br/><br/>The story is told by the three female characters and we learn about them each slowly as the plot builds slowly.  As in any good thriller, nothing is as it seems, and as each of the three women tell their story, we see that their lives are nothing like the world perceives them.  Rachel is the main character so we see most of the story through her eyes, with her husband's new wife Anna chiming as a counter to Rachel's desperation, and finally Megan, or Jess, as Rachel's named the woman she sees from the train.  Megan has secrets of her own that end up shocking Rachel until finally she sees that her own life is not so bad, and that Rachel herself is not as despicable as she's been led to believe.<br/><br/>Hawkins takes a long time to build her story, and at times I wondered if I would ever learn what happened.  The middle bogged down with Rachel's life becoming so bleak that I almost couldn't feel any sympathy for her.  Anna, the mistress who became the wife, was also an unsympathetic character, which was a little cliche`, but once the story got to Megan, I found a character I could cheer for.  Her life should have been the brightest, and I wished I could have learned more about her early life to see what made Megan the woman she'd become.<br/><br/>The three men in the story have 'bit' parts, and only one of them was fully developed.  Tom, the ex-husband seems perfect.  He is sympathetic to Rachel's obsession with him to a point that drives his new wife crazy.  Scott loves his beautiful wife Megan and wishes he could make her happy, but there are shades of violence in his demeanor.  Megan's therapist Kamal is actually trying to help her, but Megan can't seem to stop her destructive tendencies.<br/><br/>This is a compelling novel and if you're looking for a psychological novel, this is fine read.
Rachel rides the same commuter train to and from work in London each day.  She's somewhat of a mess since her divorce from Tom, and she is still obsessed with him, his new life with wife Anna, and their daughter Evie. Rachel also has a drinking problem which she tries to hide from her roommate, but she manages to drink on the train to and from work and pretty much any other time she has the urge. Even after she is fired from her job after a drunken outburst, she continues drink and to ride the train to keep up her routine.<br/><br/>One day Rachel notices a couple who lives in a house which abuts one of the commuter stops. Each day she looks for them, and wonders what their life is like. She sees them having coffee on their patio, another day embracing, and one day they appear to be arguing. Each day the highlight of the train ride is looking for the couple who she has even named -- Jason and Jess.  At the same time she looks for the couple, she tries to avoid looking a few houses down where here ex-husband Tom lives with his new family.  When Rachel reads that the girl shes seen many times, whose real name is Megan, is missing, she thinks she may recall something she's seen that might be significant.  Unfortunately, Rachel is not a credible witness, especially since she was heavily intoxicated when she "might" have seen something.  Just how far will Rachel take things playing amateur detective to find out what happened to Megan, before she places herself at risk?<br/><br/>The story is told in alternating chapters by three women whose lives become entwined: Rachel, Megan and Anna.  The characters are all unlikeable, yet well drawn and interesting to read about, and for me this psych thriller was less about solving the mystery and more about the characters.  It's one of those stories that reinforces how little we really know about others based on outward appearance.  Overall a very good debut novel.
I agree that this book is in the grand tradition of cinematic suspense classics, especially Hitchcock's. It also reminds me of some of the classics involving alcoholics, particularly "The Morning After" with Jane Fonda and Jeff Bridges, where she blacks out and wakes up with a bloody corpse next to her.<br/><br/>With this book we open with a woman riding the train each day as if she is going to work. But work, along with a home, have passed her by in an alcoholic blur and stupor. She is so far into this that she cannot even ride the train without several drinks to tide her over to make it from one stop to the other. She has been having blackouts and they are getting worse. The reason she rides the train is that she can see her old house with her ex husband, his new wife and baby. She cannot leave them alone. The new wife is Anna and they appear to be settled and happy.<br/><br/>There is a third woman. This is one near her husband's house. She has a man living with her and the woman on the train begins to obsess about her too and even names her Jess. She is as interested in Jess as she is in her ex.<br/><br/>We also get Jess's perspective in her portions of the book (real name Meagan).<br/><br/>This is set in London.  That is where the train is going. They all live in modest places outside of London and need the train to get into London.<br/><br/>I found the opening character's alcoholism a bit much at the start of the book. There is one especially disgusting scene she has in a flat where she is renting a room. She loses control of her bodily functions while drunk and/or in blackout. She is evicted as a result.This is necessary for the story but I mention it in case you really do not want to read scenes about someone who is severely alcoholic. Her life is also incredibly depressing. But again, this is the set up and is not that different from the one in the Jane Fonda movie. She was as far gone as an alcoholic.
Rachel is unable to reconcile herself with her inability to have children and her subsequent divorce from Tom, the love of her life. No amount of constant pleading and whining will jar him away from Anne, the woman who is now the mother of his child. As a result of turning to drinking to ease her pain Rachel has turned into a lonely, uncontrollable drunkard, managing to get fired from her job.<br/><br/>Not wanting her roommate to know of her joblessness Rachel continues to take her daily commuter train ride into London, pretending to go to work everyday. From her seat she regularly watches a couple who appear to be so in love on those brief train window glimpses that Rachel makes up her own version of their life. She is shocked when she finds out the woman has vanished and is feared dead. Rachel saw something the day before the woman disappeared and wants to tell the police, but would they believe her? Could a drunken woman at the end of her own rope make a difference in someone else’s life?<br/><br/>Megan was bored with her life with Scott. She loved him but he wanted more than she was willing to give. He wanted children but she wanted to be free. She never meant for the affairs to go as far as they did, but soon things got out of hand with one guy after another. Scott is starting to get suspicious, but Megan knows how to handle him. She is used to being the one in charge, but one lover is making things very difficult. Neither Megan nor Scott like things to get difficult.<br/><br/>Anne was proud of her life with her new husband Tom and their little daughter Evie. She is all set to make him forget about his ex-wife, but finds it hard because she continues to stick her nose in their business. She is fed up with her interference, and Tom’s inability to make her go away. Anne has her own plans for how to handle women who interfere in her marriage, and what she has in mind won’t be pretty.<br/><br/>Rachel, Megan and Anne. Three women. Three lives. Each separate, yet connected. They have a story to tell. Reality is mixed with fantasy in their minds, but will the truth of the missing woman come out before it’s too late?<br/><br/>This book was so exciting I could hardly wait to finish it, as it’s a page turning whodunit with an ending that will leave you gasping in shock. This is Paula Hawkin’s debut novel, and she has entered the literary world with a BANG!<br/><br/>Highly recommended for Adults.
The Girl on the Train is a fast-paced, dark, disturbing, mysterious and propelling psychological thriller that not to be missed.<br/><br/>Narrated in first person POV alternating among 3 women in different chapters, I'm able to see that every one of them has their own secrets not to be told to anyone, including their closest ones. They have their own issues in life and their hatred towards other persons in their lives.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>====<br/><br/>The story started with Rachel, who commutes twice daily during weekdays on a train between Ashbury and Euston. The train will stop at a signal point where she can look outside the window at the houses at Blenheim Road (Witney), particularly at Number 15 and Number 23.<br/><br/>Every weekdays when she's on the train, she's very eager to be able to look at the Number 15 house with a couple she named them as Jess and Jason. She would never expect she could be able to know them personally until one day, something terrible happened that linked them together.<br/><br/>I like how the writer put the little pieces together to make the 3 women who seems unrelated to become related in some ways, some how. And all these little pieces makes the story full of mysteries which I'm quite shocked and thrilled at the part near the ending of the story.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>==========<br/><br/>Even though the book has 3 narrators, Rachel Watson plays a major part in the story.<br/><br/>Rachel is an alcoholic who couldn't accept the fact of her divorce and she even lost her job because of her drinking problems. Most of the time, I would think that she's a mess and quite hopeless in getting herself back to her normal life and she definitely needs help from AA (Alcoholic Anonymous). Sometimes I might think that she's getting better as she doesn't drink for a couple of days but I'm quite disappointed when she picks up that bottle of wine or tin of gin and tonic again.<br/><br/>Another narrator of the story is Megan who lives at Number 15 and being labelled as "Jess" by Rachel. She babysits Tom and Anna's daughter who live at Number 23. She has a troubled past that she never tell her husband, Scott (Rachel's "Jason"). The lives of these 3 women change after Megan went missing.<br/><br/>Anna, who seems like the happiest lady among the 3 narrators gave birth to Evie after she married Tom. Even so, she hates Rachel and occasionally she'll get stressed by the nonsense caused by Rachel.<br/><br/>The other two characters narrated in the story are Tom and Scott. Both Tom and Scott are loving husbands and to others, they are the dream man of most of the women. But when I read through the story, it's unbearable to know the dark side of every characters.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/>==========<br/><br/>I've read Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn before I pick up this book. But I'm not going to compare them even though they have some similarities like missing girl.<br/><br/>After finished reading this book, I asked myself: "Do I feel sorry for the women in the book?" I would say no. Even though you would say that the unfortunate events happened to them deserves my sympathy but I think that somehow they need to be responsible for what they did.<br/><br/>Take Rachel for example, she knows that it's her own fault to become a drinker. But did she help herself to get rid of the "disease"? There are a lot of times we would expect others to take the blame when something bad happened to us. But before that, have you ever think of any other things that you can do to make it better?<br/><br/>Overall, this book is a page-turner and basically I would resist the urge to put down the book and get to sleep especially when Megan went missing. So I'm not surprised to know that a staff of the publisher was reading the book secretly under the table during a meeting because she was at twelve pages from the end.<br/><br/>This book is highly recommended to the readers who love thrillers and even if you don't read thrillers, try it out.
Notwithstanding all of the deceit, deception and general out-and-out fraud one will find in THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN, each and every word in this engrossing debut thriller by Paula Hawkins has the ring of truth to it. Those of us who have used public transit will identify and, to some degree, sympathize with the book’s very troubled protagonist. We either are her or know someone very much like her. So be warned at the outset: that chill you will feel running up your spine after reading the first few pages is well-earned.<br/><br/>The “girl” of the title is a woman named Rachel, who (to describe her in the current vernacular) is a hot mess. An alcoholic who is recently divorced and all but homeless save for the grace of a friend with (almost) endless patience, Rachel needs regular grooming, a detox program and an attitude adjustment, not necessarily in that order. There seems to be a literary trend that presents novels narrated by unreliable characters; if that perception is correct, then Rachel is at the front of the pack in terms of unreliability. Her alcohol abuse has progressed to the extent that she is prone to physical and mental blackouts; her most productive hours are in the morning and evening, traveling by commuter train to and from a job that she no longer has in London. She spends the intervals in between drinking, wandering about, and lying to her poor roommate, who gives her a place to stay and has more compassion than sense.<br/><br/>At all times, however, Rachel is obsessed with her former home and its current occupants: Tom, her ex-husband; Anna, his new wife, with whom he carried on an affair while Rachel and Tom were married; and their new baby, the one Anna could give him after Rachel could not. Yes, Rachel is obsessed and jealous; that, plus alcohol, means that she has harassed Tom and Anna on more than one occasion, resulting in calls to the police.<br/><br/>Rachel’s obsessions don’t end there. On those commuter train trips back and forth to London, she has regularly (if momentarily) observed a couple with an apparently idyllic life, the one she wishes she still had with Tom. She has named the couple “Jess and Jason,” and imagines their life in vivid detail, watching them each day from afar as the train passes their backyard. That they are down-the-road neighbors of Tom and Anna doesn’t help matters, either.<br/><br/>One day, though, Rachel notices a snake in paradise as the train passes by Jess and Jason’s yard: Jess is kissing another man. When Jess --- whose real name is Megan --- is reported missing a short time later, Rachel believes that she knows why. But since Rachel is already known to the police as being somewhat unreliable, her report (when she gets around to telling it) is greeted with doubt at best and suspicion at worst, particularly when it turns out that she was in the vicinity of Megan/Jess’ home on the night that Megan disappeared. Why was she in the neighborhood? Any excuse will do, given that Anna and Tom live just a few doors down from the now-missing Megan. The report puts Rachel on someone else’s radar. As if she wasn’t a great enough danger to herself, she has attracted the malevolent attention of someone else.<br/><br/>Do you have all of that? Just to keep things extremely interesting, THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is told from three different points of view --- Anna’s, Megan’s and, of course, Rachel’s --- while bouncing back and forth in time. It quickly becomes evident at various points in the narrative that all three women are mistaken or lying about what is happening at any given moment. They aren’t the only ones, though. It also becomes clear that maybe --- just maybe --- Rachel isn’t entirely at fault for her current situation. Still, she may be guilty of murder. Or maybe not. You are going to have to read the book to find out.<br/><br/>You might want to set aside enough time to read THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN twice --- once to enjoy, and another to appreciate how well Hawkins has crafted the twists, turns and sleights of hand that make this Hitchcockian thriller such a pleasure to read and wonder at.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub.
The Girl on the Train is Paula Hawkins’ debut thriller, and it provides quite a ride! Whose story is reliable? Is anyone’s story reliable? This is told from the points of view of Megan, Anna, and Rachel, and is also told from a period of time in 2013, with a few flashbacks to 2012.<br/><br/>Rachel’s life has fallen apart. Her marriage has dissolved, she has a drinking problem, often experiencing blackouts, and she has lost her job. To keep her roommate from learning this, Rachel continues to take the train daily, as if going to work. The train consistently stops at particular spots along the line; one of these happens to be a house near the one where Rachel lived when she was married. It is there that she sees a happily married couple who she names Jason and Jess, and she looks forward to seeing them on her way to and from the city each day.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rachel continues to contact her ex-husband, Tom, who has married Anna and now has a baby girl. Rachel’s contacts feel like harassment to Anna, but Tom continues to assure Anna that he is handling the situation.<br/><br/>One day, Rachel sees something that causes her to escalate her intrusion into the lives of her ex-husband and his wife, and also brings her into the lives of “Jason” and “Jess” when Jess disappears.<br/><br/>This was a gripping read, and I enjoyed the cat-and-mouse aspects of the story. I also learned that an alcoholic blackout is not a condition where the drinker forgets events. This type of blackout occurs because when highly intoxicated, the brain can’t create short-term memories and therefore, there is nothing to remember the next day.<br/><br/>Rachel’s behaviors may seem too crazy to be believed, but if she is an alcoholic and feels as if her life has spiraled out of control, her poor decisions seemed appropriate to me as a reader.
Rachel is soothed by the train jostling down the tracks. She is fighting off her latest hangover as she rides the train into town. The train is coming up on Rachel's favorite part of the trip. Rachel peers out the window hoping to get a glimpse of Jess and Jason, the couple who live in a house alongside the tracks. Rachel doesn't know the two, nor does she know their real names. To Rachel, Jess and Jason represent everything she lost in her own marriage, and she loves to see them together, that is until the day when Rachel sees Jess without Jason. What Rachel sees changes everything, and before long, Rachel is drawn into a police investigation. What did Rachel see?<br/>What I Liked:<br/>*This book is getting all kinds of buzz right now, and I am certainly glad that I took notice. The Girl on the Train is a riveting read that will keep you flipping pages until the shocking ending. If you love a good, strong psychological thriller, I highly recommend this one, it is the best thriller I have read since Gone Girl.<br/>*The story features three unreliable narrators. Rachel is an alcoholic, recently divorced, unemployed and prone to drunken blackouts. Megan or Jess, is a girl with a vicious past who seems to have the perfect marriage, but in reality, she is an adulteress driven by a troubling past. The cast is rounded out by Anna, a former mistress who is now married to Rachel's ex husband. Anna has a loving husband and a new baby, and she appears happy and content, but is she really? All three women are unlikable and even though you would think that a book with unreliable and unlikable characters would putt you off, it works. I found that I was invested in each woman, and that I wanted to know what drove them to behave the way did. I also hoped that each would find a way to redeem themselves, especially when it comes to Rachel the drunken train wreck. The characters were fantastically written, deeply flawed and messed up. Let's face it, who can resist reading about people whose lives are like a gossip column?<br/>*The plot is engaging and thrilling. Megan goes missing and Rachel feels compelled to help. The further Rachel digs, the more her mind niggles that she may know more than she remembers. There are many twists and turns, and lots of suspects that will keep you guessing up until the big reveal. I have to admit, I was surprised at the culprit, and I liked the way it all played out. Definitely worth the read.<br/>*The ending delivers with plenty of shock and drama. I liked that it ending satisfactorily without leaving the story open or with a head scratching finale that drives the reader crazy. I was satisfied with the conclusion.<br/>*The writing is excellent. Ms. Hawkins is indeed a fine story teller. There isn't much to the story; it is a book about secrets, deceiving outward appearances and the inability to truly know someone. Yet, her simple story telling is brilliant and thought provoking. This is Ms. Hawkins debut novel, and you can bet I will be reading her next book.<br/>And The Not So Much:<br/>*Even though I liked that all three women were unlikable, it was hard to spend so much time with Rachel. I kept hoping that she would do a turn around, and that I would connect with her, but she spirals further and further down. Rachel is a drunk who drinks to the point of blackout who engages in ridiculous behavior. She isn't an easy character to journey with, and I kept expecting her to get it together, but she never really does. Go into this one knowing that you aren't going to like anyone and it will go easier for you. I did at least feel sympathetic toward Rachel in the end.<br/>*The book moves back in forth in time. I had a bit of trouble keeping track of the shifts in time. Not a big issue, but I would suggest paying close attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter.<br/>*I was left with a few niggling questions. What was the purpose of the clothes beside the tracks? What really happened to Rachel during her marriage was she drunk and blacking out or was her ex husband manipulating her memories? *Was she physically abused? I wanted more insight into the marriage. How did Rachel manage to live so long without employment? Where was her money coming from? Who released the information about Megan's child to the press and why? What happened with Scott?<br/>*Even though the book reaches a firm conclusion, I still wanted more. I was hoping to see Rachel end up in a better place.<br/><br/>The Girl on the Train was a captivating and engaging thriller that kept me glued to the pages. I devoured this read, and I highly recommend it to those who are seeking a good psychological thriller with twists, turns and a solid mystery. This was a most impressive debut, and I for one, will be eager to see what Ms. Hawkins does next. If you need a page turner, grab this and set aside some time.<br/><br/>I borrowed a copy of this book from the library. All opinions are my own and I was not compensated for this review.<br/>Posted@Rainy Day Ramblings.
Those who would tout you onto "The Girl on the Train" by telling you it's another "Gone Girl" do a disservice. It's quite different in tone, and it makes no pretensions to be anything more than what it is--a clever thriller. There's little in the way of social satire that Gillian Flynn is so good at. Therefore to compare Paula Hawkins's effort to that earlier book is unfair both to her, and to prospective readers.<br/><br/>So let's talk about what "The Girl on the Train" is. It's first-person narrated by three different women, with the date and time of each chapter made quite clear. The girl on the train is actually a middle aged woman named Rachel. An alcoholic, she's lost her job, but so that her friend/landlady doesn't find out, she continues to ride the train into London (yes, London--Ms. Hawkins is English, and she brings a totally different sensibility to the thriller than Ms. Flynn). At one point, the train generally stops for a red signal to be reset, and Rachel makes up a fantasy about a couple she sees there. Rachel, with her alcoholism and obsessional self-pity, is cringeworthy. Maybe you'll start to groan in an "I can't believe she's . . . " sort of way.<br/><br/>The other two narrators are Anna and Megan, and it would be a spoiler to reveal their identities. You'll find out soon enough. It's sufficient to say that their contributions are reactions to the events Rachel has inadvertently set into motion, and they have their own secrets to reveal. Anna's narration, like Rachel's, is set in the book's present (2013), while Megan's tale picks up a year earlier.<br/><br/>The tricky plot works well, as the suspense builds; and Ms. Hawkins is a master of misdirection. It's a great read, but if you don't like books with unlikeable characters, this one isn't for you.
But I liked it, until the end. I hated Gone Girl, viscerally, but I could commiserate with Rachel,who quite obviously needs help with her drinking.<br/><br/>This book is eminently readable, especially if you know anything about alcoholism.It isn't really suspense, however, and not even mystery, really. As others have noted, the author uses semi-clever tricks to hide key information that is slowly revealed as the book moves along.  It's not predictable at all, which actually bothered me a little at the end, because I kept expecting the police to step in at some point and either arrest the heroine, Rachel, or clearly explain the dangers of meddling in what was most probably a domestic murder investigation.  But they don't.<br/><br/>And that's what bothers me at the end. I would have preferred that the villain be exposed for what he was to all the world.  But that doesn't happen, apparently because of British law, which seems to have a stricter requirement for self-defense that U.S. law enforcement. Thus, the ending is contorted and Rachel is locked in another lie at the end. Also, an entire trainful of people witness what happens at the end. What if the final line of the book had been "On the train, a girl shivered as she watched in horror."  Instead, Rachel lies to police and expects no one on the train to have anything to say about her lie. At the very least, I would have liked the police to learn the truth about who the murderer they've been seeking is.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem, which was evident now that I think about it throughout the book, is that the author is somewhat unfamiliar with police and police procedure.  It's difficult to write a book like this and get away with it, but again, like Gone Girl, the cleverness of the book tends to overwhelm.<br/><br/>I would recommend that Ms. Hawkins interview and get to know a few police officials before she writes her next book. It's not hard to do, and most homicide officials have a wealth of information to share. She has writing talent and the pace of the book is wonderful. Yes, it's full of dysfunctional characters, so don't be surprised by that. Be prepared instead, to be surprised, at the good and the bad.
I first read a sample of this book, and then I knew that I wanted ALL of Rachel's story. Some reviewers say it is Hitchockian - others say it is another Gone Girl ... I just say this is a TOP-DRAWER psychological thriller on its own merit. The Girl on the Train is based on an intriguing premise that kept me involved from the first page until the very end.<br/><br/>The book is structured with three separate first-person narratives, and usually, I don't care for this - the jumping back and forth between characters.  But in this book, it works VERY well and enhances the suspense.  All three "voices" kept me turning the pages, as I was interested in Rachel, but also in Anna (who is married to Rachel's former husband) and Megan (a woman that Rachel observes from the train).<br/><br/> Rachel is the title character, "the girl on the train" who travels daily to a non-existent job; she is a sad and lonely alcoholic who lost her job months ago, but doesn't want her roommate/landlord to know. As the reader learns Rachel's story, we see a depressed woman who cannot cope with her divorce, and thus she travels back and forth, creating fantasy-lives about the people she observes from her train window.<br/><br/>Other reviews tell you more about the plot of the story, so I won't go into those details.  I will say that Rachel's drinking causes black-outs, so she is the epitome of the "unreliable narrator" - and like Rachel herself, the Reader is never sure if her memories are true events or fantasy.  When a woman disappears, Rachel's involvement becomes a real mystery, even to herself. But there is evil stalking the pages, so we wonder who is at risk and can Rachel stop drinking (please!) long enough to protect herself.<br/><br/>This was a totally satisfying book, a true thriller/mystery that will keep you guessing and also thinking - about the nature of loneliness and the power of evil.
I received a copy of The Girl on the Train from the publisher in return for an honest review.<br/><br/>Rachel gets the same train everyday and everyday she travels the same route, she sees the same houses, with the same occupants and to pass the time she creates stories of what their lives must be like. Until one day something is different, something has changed and she's no longer just the girl on the train. Rachel gets caught up in the lives of these people she's created whole stories for in her head and the impact it has on her and the people she has just watched up until now, is drastic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed how the story was told from the three different perspectives of the female characters: Rachel, Meghan and Anna. The characters are not particularly likeable and I found myself at times feeling frustrated with how much they wallowed, complained and just generally felt sorry for themselves, but at the same time I just couldn't look away.<br/><br/>The mystery aspect of the plot is done very well and the suspicion moves around all the different characters. The suspense and character portrayal was executed well and it keeps you guessing and trying to work out and look for clues to what is going on underneath the surface. Although I did work out who was to blame before it was revealed, the twists and turns kept changing direction, so I could never really be sure just exactly where the plot was going to lead and at who's feet the blame would finally land until it was revealed.<br/><br/>The Girl on the Train is a dark tale that shows how deep an individuals personal struggles can go and what effect they have on their daily lives and those around them. While it's not a 5 star read for me, it really grabbed my attention and I flew through the pages and finished it in one night.
Tell me I'm not the only one who's played this game: you see a couple in a restaurant or bar and you make up your own version of their life or the conversation that they are having; you imagine what their life together must be like, good or bad, and wonder what goes on behind closed doors. The Girl on the Train begins in a similar way and, after you've read this one, I can guarantee that you'll never go through that "game" again without thinking of this story.<br/><br/>I requested a review copy of this novel before I'd read or heard anything about it; to tell you the truth, I was ready for a mystery and the cover looked interesting. I had no idea what I'd gotten myself into with this one. I've read some early reviews, now that I've finished the book; a couple of "notable" reviewers have referred to Ms. Hawkins as an author who is not quite as "razor sharp" as Gillian Flynn in Gone Girl, but I beg to differ.<br/><br/>There are certainly valid comparisons to be made, but I find Hawkins' characters to be somewhat grittier and riddled with lifelong problems, outside of the ones brought forth by the end of the novel; I couldn't help sympathizing with all of them. They are messy (alcoholism, divorce, infertility), they have secrets (lovers, dead children, unemployment) and they are all brought together by Rachel; she is the girl on the train, envisioning what must be the perfect lives of those individuals who inhabit the homes along her daily ride to work.<br/><br/>While there is not much I can tell you, plot-wise, for fear of spoiling a tale that has lots of twists and turns, I will say that I was completely drawn in by these characters; even though the chapters are alternatively narrated by the characters, I had no trouble following along and picking up small tidbits about each of them within every page. I was also fascinated with Hawkins' reflection on what it is that we, as human beings, are able to truly remember/recall based on what we've told ourselves about a particular event; memories are often manipulated by the human brain to protect us, without us knowing it, and getting the truth to the surface, as demonstrated in The Girl on the Train, can be a painful experience.
Rachel is a slightly overweight, divorced alcoholic and, as such, not the usual heroine for a novel.  Having been sacked from her job, but staying with a very long-suffering friend, Rachel leaves for ‘work’ every day and returns on her usual train, keeping up the pretence that she is employed and coping. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Obsessed, bitter and jealous, Rachel is forced to pass her old home every day, where ex-husband Tom now lives with new wife, Anna, and their little daughter.  A few doors down from her old home lives a ‘perfect’ couple, who Rachel imagines leaving the life she dreamt of having.  Of course, the reality is not quite like that…<br/><br/>Megan is not having the wonderful life Rachel imagines, from her glimpses through a train window. Having lost her art gallery, she struggles with her past and feels trapped by husband Scott’s suggestion they start a family.  The author manages to weave the strands of stories and characters well and the story is told from the point of view of Rachel, Megan and Anna. This is a tale of misconceptions, strong emotions, jealousy, desire and crime.  When Rachel sees something from her train window, she is suddenly confronted with a reason to stop drinking and try to help solve a mystery.<br/><br/>Now, to be honest, I spotted the twist in this story fairly early on.  Saying that, it did not spoil my enjoyment of this novel one bit.  This really is brilliantly written and I imagine that it will be a huge success – it certainly deserves to be.  Rachel is a very interesting character – one who could really be quite unsympathetic.  She drinks, makes endless harassing calls to her ex, embarrasses herself, blacks out, lies and is viewed with varying degrees of concern, suspicion and even distaste by other characters.  Yet, the author manages to make all three of the central characters sympathetic and I found it very difficult to put this book down.  At one point, ironically, I read it on the train into work and almost missed my stop!  It is that good – read it, it will be the thriller of 2015. Lastly, I received a copy of this book from the publishers, via NetGalley, for review.
Rachel is a sad shell of her former self.  She used to be married, with a bright future ahead of her, living in a cute house along the train tracks.  Then her husband left her and moved his new wife into their house.  This interloper has everything Rachel ever desired, including the child she was unable to conceive.<br/><br/>Rachel is an alcoholic, drinking every day as she rides the train to and from a job from which she has been fired.  She passes the house that used to be hers and tortures herself imagining her ex-husband and his new wife.<br/><br/>Several houses down, she passes another couple every morning and afternoon.  Rachel catches brief glimpses into their lives and their interactions, and based on these glimpses she concocts a robust backstory for this couple.  She gives them names, careers, and the sort of happiness that is so elusive in her own life.<br/><br/>When something unexpected happens with this couple, though, Rachel feels as though it is her duty and her place to come forward and tell what she has seen from the window of the train.<br/><br/>Things aren't always what they seem, and it is dangerous to involve yourself in the life of people you don't really know--or people you have convinced yourself you do know.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the mystery of this book, and the way things were slowly revealed as narration switched from character to character.  The book kept me guessing up until the end, and I was never sure whom to trust.<br/><br/>The characters, though, were absolutely despicable.  There wasn't a single one I wanted to see happy and successful; they were all a mess of problems and meanness.  I sometimes wished there was someone I felt was worth rooting for in this novel.

A good story, but too long and repetitive.
The Girl on the Train has been getting a lot of comparisons to Gone Girl, and it's not hard to see why. Both are books that derive much of their pleasure from unreliable narrators; both orbit around a disappearance and possible romantic intrigue/affairs; both begin with assumptions about characters that are gradually toyed with and then undermined. For all of that, The Girl on the Train doesn't feel like a Gone Girl clone, developing a voice all its own. Indeed, the book's primary narrator, a (barely) functioning alcoholic, is fundamentally a decent person driven to destructive behavior by her addiction, and Hawkins does a solid job making her understandable, not monstrous - a sharp contrast to the gleeful misanthropy on display in Gone Girl. And though the plots have some superficial similarities, Girl on the Train stands out by having the case narrated not by the key players, but by someone barely connected to it at all, making the case feel all the more voyeuristic than it already is. Hawkins does a great job of juggling her characters and her pacing, and as she jumps back and forth in the story and doles out he revelations, she makes sure to constantly surprise the reader when it's the perfect moment. And yet, there's the ending, which feels unworthy of the book before it; without giving too much away, it's an ending that ends up hinging on a lot of coincidences and making the book feel more constructed than organic, much to its detriment. That being said, it's no surprise that this one is such a hit so far; it's a ton of fun, and Hawkins delivers a gripping read anchored by some great narrative choices. Now if she can just get her plotting up to the same level, she's going to be a force to be reckoned with.
This is only one of two books that I have read that seemed to be perfect for me to read. Loved this and the author who wrote it. Great writing and character development was terrific.  I loved the suspense!
The Girl on the Train has taken the literary world by storm! Like a rushing train balling the jack this five star bestseller has enthralled readers who can t put the 323 page thriller down on the bedside table! First time novelist Paula Hawkins, a former London journalist, has done a great job in this Hitchcockian tale of wickedness and murder in a nice London neighborhood.<br/>  The Plot": Recently divorced Rachel is living in a flat supplied to her by her friend Cathy. Rachel travels to a nonexistent job each morning returning by the same mode of transportation each evening. She has been fired from her company for her alcohol problem. In Rear Window style she imagines the lives of the homes of those people she quickly passes each day on her rail travel. The book will reveal how different reality is from perceived images in the minds of the beholder. Meanwhile, Rachel s well to do husband Tom has married a fetching woman called Ann. The couple have a baby girl. Ann and Tom indulged in adultery while the latter was married to Rachel. The babysitter of Tom and Ann s baby is the beautiful Megan. Megan will later disappear inspiring a massive manhunt reminiscent of the Laci Peterson disappearance in the United States. Like Laci, Megan is with child at the time of her disappearance. Murder, deceit and a web of lies is the legacy of the complex lives led by all the three dimensional characters drawn by Hawkins.<br/>  The book is written as first person accounts by Rachel, Megan and Ann. Surprises and twists are there for the reader as he/.she wanders along the path through the plot. Whodunit? This book is an enjoyable read well worthy of the praise it has received from a wide readership.
A great psychological read and definitely a great debut by this author!<br/><br/>I was swept into the compelling storyline early on and never lost interest as conflict and tension builds into a crescendo of suspense. The author cleverly ties together the core of the storyline, and events come to life through three different character perspectives.<br/><br/>Rachel would rather be on the train than almost anywhere else, watching the houses and their occupants along the track. It has become an imaginary world for her. The couples living in these houses represent what she lost and what she was at one time. Rachel is depressed and has lost her marriage to Tom because of her alcohol abuse – her drinking is out of control. She blames herself for the broken marriage and no longer feels desirable to anyone.<br/><br/>Megan is an attractive and seemingly happy married woman, not wanting to look back and remember her past life. Megan is making a new life with Scott, who seems to adore her, and they’ve been married for three years. But Megan seems to have no direction in her life and becomes restless with her marriage.<br/><br/>Anna is portrayed as a rather cold and uncaring person. She is married to Tom, Rachel’s ex, and they appear to be blissfully happy with their baby girl. But Anna hates living in the same house that Tom and Rachel had once resided. She is tired of being constantly harassed by Rachel and feels threatened by her, worrying for the safety of her daughter.<br/><br/>And the story unfolds as Megan mysteriously disappears, and through numerous twists and turns the author brings the story to a stunning conclusion. My rating is 5 stars. Don’t miss this one – and excellent read!
This book kept you on the edge of your seat.  I started to figure out the truth towards the end of who was responsible.  How it happened and the mental torture they were capable of was a total surprise.

A very good read but a little depressing.
I thought the ending was too predictable.
Hauntingly amazing. Couldn't put it down.
This is a great read. Once you start, you won't be able to put it down. You need to know what happens next and who done it! Very well written. Can't believe it's the authors first novel. Kudos to her.
Never knew where this oddly lovable mess of a heroine was going to lead me ... I only wish I could have kept following her longer. A truly unique character whom I'd love to share a glass of wine with.
I can honestly say there are very few books where I can’t figure out what’s going to happen very early on.  I couldn’t put done the book because I had to know who killed Megan!  Literally I forgot I was cooking dinner and almost caught my kitchen on fire --- never has a book had me come close to that. Lol<br/><br/>Anyhow Rachel, The Girl on the Train, is a drunk.  We’re talking black out can’t remember anything total mess.  She watches this couple every day while she’s on the train (going to her “fake” job, a job she lost but is embarrassed to tell her flatmate).  She thinks this couple have the perfect marriage and she fantasies about it and how they must be like.  Wow, was she way off on that one!  One day she see another man kissing Megan and then one day Megan goes missing.  Now she knows she witnesses something that happened the day Megan went missing (of course she was drunk and trying to get to see her cheating ex-husband who just happens to live on Megan’s street); however, she can’t remember what happened. She afraid, bleeding, has a cut on her head and she can’t remember anything that happened.  She gets involved in the case and desperately wants to figure out what she can’t remember.<br/><br/>There’s murder, black outs, secrets, lies, infidelity, public drunkenness, you name it, it’s in here.<br/><br/>It’s a great book and like I said, I can usually figures things out very quickly but, this book was close to the end when you figure it out.  And remember, you can think other peoples lives are perfect and make up fantasies in your head and live them out in your mind but, it’s usually way off from what you believed.  Happy reading!
Of the hundred Kindle books I have purchased over the past 4 years, this one is truly paralyzingly boring!!! :O(  Like watching paint dry. I finally gave up after 50 pages and put it down FOR GOOD.
A compelling, gripping story.  I was unable to stop reading this book once I started, and read it in virtually one sitting.  The characters were so well defined that I felt I was living the story.
It takes a while for the reader to get passed the fact that none of the narrators in Paula Hawkins, "The Girl on the Train" are likeable reliable narrators.  All three of them have problems, their commonality a residential street of houses that backs the train going in and out of London each day.  As all three narrators get their turn to tell their story, the reader pieces together that they are connected in even more intricate ways.  Hawkins does a superb job of keeping the suspense up without revealing much of her hand until the very end of her tale.<br/><br/>A young wife goes missing; one of the first person narrators, Rachel, knows the missing girl--she's observed her in passing from the window of her commuter train.  She wants to help the police; she wants to help herself.  She needs a new starting point in life because her husband has left her for another woman . . . and now they have an infant daughter.<br/><br/>Hawkins writes of disturbed people whose faces are raw with shame and self-pity.  Her mystery revolves around need.  I listened to the unabridged audio presentation of this book; the performance gets high marks for theatricality and poignancy.  The narrators all have their flaws--there are no super human stereotypes here; together their voices pull together to find a light at the end of a dark tunnel at their own expense.<br/><br/>Bottom line?  Some might find the characters too disagreeable to give them time to work their simple magic.  Make the time; this thriller is quietly exciting and chilling in its every day reality. Recommended.<br/>Diana Faillace Von Behren<br/>"Buzzard's Eye View"

This book is everything you could possibly want in a book. It has suspense, love, heartbreak, heartache, a great back bone, and so many twists it's crazy. I LOVE this book, I highly recommend it.
Best book I have read in a long time. This book has been compared with Gone Girl, which I also read, but this one blew Gone Girl out of the water. I simply could not put it down. Brilliant story.
This books starts real slow ... But, DON'T give up on it!!! This book had me dreaming about the story line.. I really wanted to wake up and finish the book. I so enjoyed this thriller. Great read
Waste of valuable time.
Loved this book. The characters are flawed and imperfect which always makes for a good story. Great story idea. Something as simple as a glance from a train causes such havoc.  Highly recommend.
I am not through reading this novel, but I feel I must post a review at this point.  This book is a fast paced account of a woman who rides the train round trip daily despite losing her job. The main character, Rachel, is still mourning her husbands betrayal and divorce from her to marry a woman with whom he was having an affair. To keep the memories of her happy (as she recalls it) marriage alive in her head, she fixates on a couple who live in a house by the train tracks only a few doors down from the home she once occupied with her husband who still resides there with his new wife - the former mistress - and child they had together.  Rachel spirals down into the abyss of alcoholism to deal with the pain she is still reeling from.  Passing the home twice a day of the couple whom she has turned her focus onto, she becomes familiar with their daily routines for the time of day that the train is passing. Rachel envisions this couple as the happy couple she once was with her husband and relishes in their happiness.  When she realizes something is wrong, Rachel transfers her anger from her ex to the wife in the house whose name she does not know, but refers to in her head as "Jess."  Not wanting to reveal the plot thus far, we see Rachel descend into psychosis as she experiences blackouts due to her alcoholism and determined focus on her ex who she still calls daily and the couple in the house a few doors down.  This book is a thrill ride and one cannot help but get caught up in the wide range of emotions that Rachel is feeling.  I cannot wait to finish it and so far this book has hooked me in.
Better than Gone Girl. A lot better. You find yourself not liking any of the characters. They are are all miserable in some way, but this is what compels you in some weird way to keep reading.
This was one of the dumbest books ever!
Very engaging - I couldn't put it down!
Enjoyed but slow was glad to finish it.
