If "Go Set a Watchman" had been published before "To Kill a Mockingbird," it would have been meaningless. Tom Robinson's trial would be just a vague incident in the Jean Louise's memory instead of a culturally iconic scene. Atticus Finch would be his daughter's fallen hero, but not ours.  If "Watchman" had been first, we would only know Atticus as a segregationist and we wouldn't care: he wouldn't have been an ethical role model and a hero. There would be references to Atticus's past and why Jean Louise's world is shaken when she finds out he is a segregationist, but we would not share them. Now, though, Jean Louise's (who I keep referring to as "Scout" out of habit) feelings of betrayal are our own, as we can see by the collective Internet outrage.<br/><br/>That's why "Watchman" works; that's why I have to give it four stars. "Watchman" is about fallen idols and disillusionment. Jean Louise tries to reconcile how moral paragon Atticus Finch could be racist, and that's what the readers have been trying to reconcile, as well. The press release for "Watchman" said, "[Jean Louise Finch] is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood," which gave us a hint that the Atticus we knew--the infallible anti-racist crusader--would not be that way in "Watchman." The talk about "Watchman" tarnishing Lee's legacy contributed to that idea. Still, I dismissed this possibility until it was confirmed, and even then, I was in denial. When Scout finds out Atticus is attending segregationist citizens' council meetings, she thinks "[He was] pulling something, [he was] there merely to keep an eye on things," a thought that I hopefully and childishly had, as well.<br/><br/>But the most painful thing is that this Atticus is still recognizably, unquestionably Atticus Finch. Some speculated that this first draft Atticus would be different enough as a character (beyond the obvious) that we could easily dismiss him as Not Atticus and the book as Not Canon. He is still a loving father, a good neighbor, endlessly reasonable, thoughtful, articulate, patient, wry, giving. Still, his portrayal in "Watchman" makes me uneasy. JK Rowling could, conceivably, write a Harry Potter sequel set twenty, thirty years in the future, where Harry, an Auror, gleefully casts the Cruciatus Curse against suspected magical wrong-doers on a regular basis. Could she explain how he became this way as he grew older while making it consistent with his character from the first seven books? I think so, but I wouldn't want to read that.<br/><br/>On the bright side, Jean Louise Finch serves as a moral compass. Atticus taught her well. She challenges beliefs that she knows are wrong. Of course, by today's standards, some of the things she says are cringeworthy, but the point is, she is now the progressive heroine. She is not perfect, but she has potential to be better than her father and her hometown. We have hope that she will pick up where Atticus failed. She is also recognizably Scout Finch, the outspoken, precocious tomboy, but now she is twenty-six and still out of place in Maycomb. Jean Louise has been living in New York City, which contributes to the jarringness of her visit. She can't relate to the women of her town, their interests, or their views on race. And, of course, Aunt Alexandra is still on her case about her behavior and appearance.<br/><br/>Other familiar faces include Aunt Alexandra, Uncle Jack (who takes a much more prominent role), and Calpurnia. Scout mentions that she still keeps in touch with Dill, who is exploring Italy, last she checked. Next to Atticus, the most disappointing news is that Jem died before "Watchman" begins.<br/><br/>Henry Clinton is an important new character. He has been close to the Finches since, well, after the events of "Mockingbird." He became Atticus's protege after Jem died. Jean Louise has a serious relationship with him at the beginning of the novel, but, like Atticus, he attends those awful citizens' council meetings, and her view of him is shaken.<br/><br/>I wanted to hate this book, and I wanted to be angry at it. The controversy surrounding its release would be enough: the story behind its publication is shady, almost certainly achieved through underhanded means, and even buying the novel was a moral quandary. Unfortunately, the book is good, and its message--however painfully it hits--is important: heroes can fall and they should. Not only that, but it forces us to look at our own values and behaviors. Atticus Finch was a huge relief: a person, albeit fictional, that we could look up to. He embodied everything an ethical person should aspire to (at least, the memetic version of him did). Atticus became a literary saint.<br/><br/>However, even "Mockingbird" shows cracks in the statue we've erected of Atticus Finch. He has always taken a paternalist stance towards black people, but the focus of "Mockingbird" was his fight for justice. His moving courtroom scene, his progressive parenting, and his countless other noble deeds overshadow small things like making Calpurnia enter through the back door. But this indicates that his conception of justice and equality is limited--not as limited as the rest of Maycomb, of course, but still limited--and that becomes the focal point of "Watchman." The hardest truth of "Watchman" is not that Atticus changed. It is that he was always like this. The question that Jean Louise/Scout and the readers have to answer is, What are we going to do to be better?
I came in skeptical, but I loved this novel for exactly what it is: a brilliantly written, beautiful southern novel about a young woman who discovers her father is not a god. And I'm angry that some pompous, patriarchal publisher squashed it and convinced her to write a brilliantly written, beautiful southern novel about a young woman who discovers her father is a god. WATCHMAN is about growing up, "killing the Buddha" and laying claim to one's own world view.<br/><br/>I can certainly believe that this is Harper Lee's first novel. I totally understand why the editor buried it and encouraged her to bend her considerable talent to the concept of MOCKINGBIRD, latching onto a fairly insignificant anecdote and reframing it as the main plot thrust -- which also neatly swapped hero and heroine, making the star of the book a man instead of a young woman.<br/><br/>Setting aside the suspicious circumstances of the magical appearance of WATCHMAN (and the buckets of money involved for the publisher and agent), I also totally get why Harper Lee might want us to have this novel now, at this point in her life. She is now where old Atticus is in WATCHMAN: an elderly person who is sick and tired of carrying the burden of our hero worship. So there. Take that. Eat your disillusionment and throw up behind the ice cream parlor that was once your childhood home. It hurts, and it infuriates, and it strips away your security blanket. Get over it.<br/><br/>As an editor, I want to go back in time, embrace this young author, force her to firmly look in my eyes, and tell her: "This is a wonderful book. And you must write another one and another and another, and every one of them should say exactly what you want to say." Yes, I love MOCKINGBIRD as much as the next book nerd, but it breaks my heart that -- no matter what we know/don't know about the publishing process -- the publisher took hold of a young woman who had astonishing lyrical skills, massive raw talent, insight that transcended her years, and literary chops that set her on a trajectory to eclipse Faulkner, and they turned her into a one-hit wonder recluse who was unwilling or unable to ever publish another book.<br/><br/>I love both Harper Lee's beautiful novels. I'm mourning for the dozen or so she could have and should have written.
There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the publication of GO SET A WATCHMAN, which has been universally recognized as the first draft of what would eventually become Harper Lee's magnificent TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  WATCHMAN, written several years before MOCKINGBIRD, tells the story of 26-year-old Jean Louise Finch who returns to her childhood home of Maycomb, Alabama to visit her 72-year-old father, Atticus Finch.  At first, the visit is bathed in the patina of memories and nostalgia - Jean Louise remembers the smells, the sounds, and the people she grew up with, and she resents the changes that have taken place (Atticus has left the house where Jean Louise was born and built himself a new place that doesn't quite feel the same).  The first third of the novel is slow-paced and wistful, with Jean Louise flirting with childhood friend and maybe-fiancé, Hank Clinton, now her father's law partner.  She spars with her Aunt Alexandra (who berates her for wearing "slacks" in town) and her Uncle Jack (whose conversation is steeped in metaphor and allusion).  It isn't until she learns that Atticus and Hank are both part of the Maycomb County Citizen's Council, an organization bent on preventing racial integration, that the plot really begins.  The Atticus we see here - a man determined to preserve the identity of a South torn asunder, first by emancipation and then by Supreme Court decisions - is not the Atticus Jean Louise remembers from her childhood.  She thought of him as a God, and we who so loved both the book and movie versions of MOCKINGBIRD did, too.  But WATCHMAN has a message that's far more complex than its more famous counterpart.  Because Atticus is not a God.  He's also not evil, even in his need to protect his world from the kind of change that cannot come easily.  WATCHMAN isn't the uplifting, lovely novel that MOCKINGBIRD is.  But in many ways, by being Jean Louise's story more than Atticus's, it's bigger and more important.<br/><br/>From everything I've read, it's clear that Harper Lee never intended to publish WATCHMAN.  She submitted it to publishers who suggested she rework it focusing on Jean Louise's childhood, and the result was MOCKINGBIRD.  I can see why they gave Lee this advice - the childhood memories in WATCHMAN (and there are many) are among its most identifiable elements.  We get to see Jean Louise again when she was Scout, and we get to see Jem and Dill in all their glory.  There is a reference to the trial of Tom Robinson, which makes up the central conflict in MOCKINGBIRD.  In WATCHMAN, however, Robinson is not named, he seems much younger (a boy), and his "rape" of a 14-year-old white girl is proven to have been consensual (yes, Atticus gets him off).  Most of the rest of the stories and memories in WATCHMAN are new, covering Scout's school years (including high school, first dates, dances, and embarrassments).  I loved her and Jem and Dill and young Hank (a character who does not show up in MOCKINGBIRD), and I would have read this for those sections alone.<br/><br/>But this isn't a book about children.  Instead, it's a book about change, and how difficult it is to get people to let go of their identities and move forward into the future, even if that future is necessary and right.  The setting of WATCHMAN is the summer of 1954.  The Supreme Court has just ruled (in Brown vs. the Board of Education) that "separate but equal" cannot stand - no longer would states be able to avoid racial integration by setting up separate schools for Negroes.  Jean Louise believes in states' rights, so she isn't a fan of the Court's ruling (she believes it violates the 10th Amendment).  But she does believe in racial equality and in integration, and she considers herself "color blind," things she believes she learned from her father.  But when Atticus finally tells her what he believes - that neither Southern whites nor blacks are ready for forced integration, whether it be in the schools or the voting booth - it shakes her to her core.  And the conversations she has with both Atticus and her Uncle Jack reveal a lot about how enlightened Southern white men thought in the 1950's.  Parts of it are very hard to read, especially coming from the mouth of beloved Atticus Finch.  But it's also a very honest portrayal of issues that are still front-and-center in American life and politics today.<br/><br/>It's easy to say that the Atticus we meet in WATCHMAN isn't the same man as the kind, loving, God-like father in MOCKINGBIRD.  Since seeing the 1962 movie, I've always heard Gregory Peck's voice when I've read Atticus's words - and that's exactly what I heard when I read WATCHMAN.  This is Atticus, but a much older Atticus who is trying to protect the only world he's ever known.  He has no hate in his heart for black people, and he truly does believe in equality (this is a man who waits in line behind black people in the grocery store even though the white store owner would happily serve him first).  But he does call the Negro people "backward," and he compares them to children who are not ready to cast a vote or play a part in government.  Atticus says to Jean Louise, "Do you want your children going to a school that's been dragged down to accommodate Negro children?"  She is horrified, and she accuses him of denying that blacks are human.  He calmly tells her that change can't be forced upon people until they're ready.  It reminded me of a line from Lorraine Hansberry's 1959 play, "A Raisin in the Sun":  Mr. Lindner, a white man trying to prevent a black family from moving into his white neighborhood, says, "You just can't force people to change their hearts."  That's pretty much what Atticus is trying to tell Jean Louise.<br/><br/>At the same time, Atticus recognizes in his daughter the very spirit and commitment that will ultimately bring the kind of change he knows must happen.  She is a product of her upbringing - she was raised by a white man and a black woman (Calpurnia, who was Atticus's housekeeper since the death of his wife when Jean Louise was two).  She is Atticus's daughter, in her beliefs, her humanity, and yes, in her color-blindness.  And if she represents the changed world yet to come, Atticus represents a past which is so very hard to let go of.<br/><br/>I did enjoy reading GO SET A WATCHMAN, and I do think it makes a nice companion piece to MOCKINGBIRD.  The issues raised here are the kinds of things people should be thinking about and talking about.  I'm very glad this novel was published.  I highly recommend it to anyone willing to be challenged.
Many of the negative reviews of Go Set a Watchman have expressed the reader’s disillusionment with their beloved characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. My main disillusionment was with Harper Lee as I had long worshiped her as a literary genius and unfortunately, GSAW is just not a very good book.<br/><br/>This book can only be of interest to writers and literature scholars as it illustrates how a very poor first draft can be reworked to become a masterpiece. In this case, by taking the only really moving and well-written scenes – those where Jean Louise reflects back to her childhood – and refocusing the work around these, discarding everything else. It also gives an insight into Harper Lee’s inspiration for writing TKAM as it reflects her views and her conflicts with her father, closer to the time at which she wrote TKAM.<br/><br/>As a book in it’s own right, however, GSAW is disappointing and it is understandable why it was never originally published.<br/><br/>The characters are not well fleshed out and, without our prior familiarity with them through TKAM, do not inspire interest or affection. As much publicized, they are also very different from the characters in TKAM. Not only is Atticus racist – and it must be said despite Jean Louise’s rejection of her father’s racism, her own views are also racist for our times – but Jean Louise’s trademark wilfulness, while engaging and spirited in TKAM, is here portrayed as almost churlish and in some cases malicious. In short, although her views on race are comparatively enlightened, she just doesn’t come across as a very nice person or one I really wanted to spend an entire book with.<br/><br/>Uncle Jack, here given a bigger role than in TKAM, is characterised almost solely by his continuous and often obscure literary references. It said more about the writer at an immature and unpolished stage of her development, trying to show off her knowledge at the expense of believable and quality writing. The dialogue between Jack and Jean Louise was tedious and boring.<br/><br/>The plot and narrative also fail to meet the mark, with very little happening admidst a lot of description and not very relevant back story. The final part of the book is almost entirely political polemic, much of it offensive in our day. Leaving that aside and taking into consideration the time at which it was written, it is dull. It may have its place on a 1950s political pamphlet but it makes for poor fiction reading – pages and pages and pages of it. A lot of it also assumed prior knowledge of specific legislation and political events which escaped me. Perhaps they were clearer to US citizens of a certain age.<br/><br/>Events which could have become plot points – Zeebo’s son (and Calpurnia’s grandson) being charged with manslaughter of a white man, and Calpurnia’s estrangement from the family – were loose ends for me. Briefly mentioned but then never returned to or resolved. The pure focus on Jean Louise’s alienation and disillusionment denied attention to anything else in the novel, in a rather self-centred and frustrating sort of way as she just wasn’t interesting enough as a character in her own right.<br/><br/>GSAW being unedited since the publication of TKAM, discrepancies between places and events in the two works were disconcerting. The geography of the town changed, with Jean-Louise’s love interest now having lived opposite during the events of TKAM but not mentioned at all in that book. The trial of Tom Robinson was different – the age of the alleged victim, the circumstances of the alleged rape, the injury that Tom had (arm severed rather than loss of function), and of course, the verdict.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very sorry I read this book. Given such a lead up of anticipation, I was disappointed almost to the point of the tears. I had told myself it could not possibly be as good as TKAM but I had no idea it could possibly be this bad.<br/><br/>Publishing it was clearly an exercise in money making – the expectations and the hype guaranteeing the kind of colossal sales undeserved by the quality of the book.
The novel is quite an achievement and the adult Jean Louise dominates the pages with heroic stamina as she confronts the complexities of southern culture in the 1950's. I liked her. I liked the novel. I loved her stories of coming of age in a marvelous society of individuals and scholars and people of principle, including the woman of color who brought her up, Calpurnia. I myself think the Atticus of "Watchman" is a fine achievement. ----  And I heard nothing from his lips that he might not have said in "Mockingbird" had some one asked him. To assume that the hero of "Mockingbird" would have believed in de-segregation is a mighty stretch, indeed, and frankly I think a rather unnecessary one is make. ---  And the Atticus of "Watchman" does not go unchallenged by his courageous daughter when he voices his views on race and race conflict of the 1950's. ---- Of course we find those views distasteful and dangerous, and rightly so. But then so does Jean Louise and she is the heart of the novel. --- This isn't a sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird" and should not be read as if it were. It is a novel that died apparently so that "Mockingbird" could be born. And the literary mystery for me here is why a vital adult heroine like Jean Louise had to die in the process.. (Note: the character does not literally die in any narrative here. She is replaced by a small child Jean Louise in the novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird." ) We may never know the answer to the questions "Who killed the adult Jean Louise Finch, and why," but I'm glad that she has been exhumed --- because her story is very worth reading.  (I find it discouraging  that there is so much talk in the mainstream press about the character of Atticus --- is he a bigot or isn't he -----  and so little about the the powerful heroine of  "Watchman." )  ----- Thanks to the publishers of "Go Set a Watchman" for bringing this novel to us. And thank you, Ms. Lee, for writing it and for allowing its publication.
I received the Kindle edition, it downloaded automatically at midnight, so I’ve had time to read it while randomly checking for other people’s reviews….<br/><br/>I’m going to talk about it in the context of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and then as its own standalone.<br/><br/>In terms of comparison to Kill A Mockingbird…<br/><br/>Right away the first difference is the 3rd person omniscient narrator, but it still provides a high level of insight into the thoughts of the characters.  This is an important distinction, as it changes the feel of the story and sets apart an important consideration; “To Kill a Mockingbird” has a flawed narrator, one who is a child during the events, even if it is a flashback.  It is not that the 3rd person of “Go Set a Watchman” is cold, but it can account for the differences in perspective of how some of the major characters should be viewed.<br/><br/>There’s a pretty big surprise within the first 10 pages (I’m on a kindle), so you may want to brace yourself if you’re familiar with the primary characters from “To Kill a Mockingbird.”  Right away there is also a tone of the novel being set in a post-World War II era, one that borders on haunting memories, as well as the beginning of the sexual revolution and counter-culture.<br/><br/>There have been murmurs regarding this book and people not wanting to read it, mainly the portrayal of Atticus Finch, different from what people recall him in “To Kill a Mockingbird.”  A key aspect to know, and still makes the book a MUST read, is the portrayal of Atticus Finch that readers were left with in, “To Kill a Mockingbird” is still the image that Jean Louise has of her father; her reaction and reconciliation of this imagery is the crux of the story. In fact, Atticus’s paternalism towards African Americans is heightened and reflected in the ideas and comments of the town, so it is actually not much of a character deviation that people will argue that it is.<br/><br/>The ending may seem to be a let down, but I would argue quite the opposite.  Surprisingly, many of the issues addressed in the book; racism, states rights, and the law cumulate in reality, which is sometimes murky.<br/><br/>As its own book…<br/><br/>It’s an easy read, it’s not a short book, but one that is an easy pleasant read. Let me talk about the book in its own context, as almost a standalone.  This is an intelligent book, one that has a plethora of historical and literary allusions, so many so that I worry that some of these may go under appreciated.  These are especially applied in the context of the protagonist, her uncle, and her father; which is a nice, especially as the dialect is a wonderfully captured southern, which may convey ignorance to some. The writing is quite masterful in this regard. There are some fairly verbose sentences that could potentially benefit from editing, but nothing that is awkward.<br/><br/>Overall it’s a pretty good story and does a great job of blending the changing social and physical environment of a Post-World War II small southern town, especially as Jean Louise returns from her time spent in New York.  Surprisingly, almost none of the story focuses on her experiences in New York city and its influence.  Mostly there are reflections on the changes in the town of Maycomb itself, which is struggling with post World War II returnee’s and the growing independence of an African-American community.  These changes are couched in the interplay between family members and old family friends.<br/><br/>The dialogue and humor between family members is superb, there were actually a few times where I laughed out loud. Even as the novel broaches its main conflict, there are interjections of compassionate reflection coupled with the changing landscape, especially as it pertains to race relations and how someone who has a wider perspective from the city understands race relations versus those who feel threatened by the growing autonomy of the African-American community.  It’s actually quite timely and gives a pretty unique insight into one individual’s conflict with her family as it pertains to race.<br/><br/>*I edited my review to update for some grammar; sorry if there are still a few weird phrases.
First things first: 'Watchman' is NOT a sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird'; it is an early draft of the classic novel.  The events in 'Watchman' post-date those in 'Mockingbird' but, as stated, that was simply the period in Lee's original version.  It is important to understand that this newly-released book is a preliminary version of the classic, not a subsequent or totally different novel.<br/><br/>Okay, now that we understand each other, how is 'Watchman'?  It's...okay.  There are critical differences that I won't go into in order not to spoil the plot.  Here's what I can tell you (and I am assuming you are familiar with 'Mockingbird'):  The time period is mid-50's.  Scout is 26, lives in New York City, and returns to Maycomb for a two week visit.  The book is told in a series of anecdotes in the present day and in flashbacks to Scout's childhood.  Scout is called by her proper name, Jean Louise, for the majority of the book.  Dill is overseas and is only seen in a few flashbacks.  Jem is also not on the present scene, although he figures more significantly in flashbacks. Miss Maudie is mentioned but doesn't play a major role.  There is no mention whatsoever of any of the Radleys.  A principal "new" figure is Hank Clinton, an orphan of Jem's age that was taken under Atticus' wing, became a lawyer and Atticus' partner, and is determined to marry Jean Louise and have her return to Maycomb.<br/><br/>What's happening in Maycomb is that the NAACP is becoming prominent, and 'the Negroes' are demanding civil rights following the US Supreme Court's decision to integrate public schools.  Jean Louise is disgusted to learn of Maycomb's opposition to these developments and is horrified by a town council meeting attended by Hank and Atticus where blatant racism, intolerance, stereotypes and segregation are advanced.  She dismisses Hank as a would-be fiancé.  Her image of Atticus, the hero of 'Mockingbird' and a universal symbol of justice, tolerance and equality, is shattered.  Having based her own value system on Atticus, Jean Louise is infuriated and feels she is identity-less as a result of this surprising betrayal.<br/><br/>These developments would be startling and extremely disappointing if 'Watchman' was in fact a sequel to 'Mockingbird'.  Everyone can breathe a sigh of relief because Lee ultimately chose to portray Atticus in the manner that she did.  Reading the earlier version is interesting to see how she came around to the end result.  In this respect, 'Watchman' is important as a resource to show countervailing concerns at play when Lee was writing, and is good enough cause to read it.  (As a side note, there are striking comparisons to some of the more moderate Maycomb council theories and those of modern-day Confederate flag supporters.  Take note, English Lit teachers!)<br/><br/>Does the book stand on its own?  In a word, no.  It's boring.  'Mockingbird' is charming and funny, the characters are endearing, there's a fair amount of action, the dialogue is brilliant.  Not the case in the earlier draft.  There is relatively little action.  For the most part, the "action" takes place in the flashbacks, none of which are even close to the stories in the eventual classic.  The book is not funny.  Jean Louise is appealing but she's by no means the adorable, irreverent Scout.  Hank Clinton is a caricature that was wisely deleted.  Atticus is an old, decrepit shadow of himself whose opinions will upset most readers.  Dill is AWOL, the Radley angle is sorely missed.  Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack are overly present but are supremely tedious.  A major difference between this draft and the later one is that pages and pages are given over to speeches.  Practically all the dialogue is delivered from a pulpit or a soap box.  Lee had a lot to say, and eventually got it right, but in this version the overlong speeches get boring, quickly.  There is some great writing, and many passages from the draft made it into the final cut.  Lee obviously benefitted from some intelligent and caring editors as she finished the novel.<br/><br/>To Kill a Mockingbird is an all-time classic that everyone should read.  Go Set A Watchman is an interesting tool that helps show how Lee developed the characters, setting, storyline and message of the novel.  It is valuable in that respect, and is worth reading, but does not hold its own as an independent novel, because that's not what it is.
I read all of Go Set a Watchman today. As someone who has studied, taught and adored To Kill a Mockingbird, I was very worried that I would be extremely disappointed, especially after reading warnings about Atticus being a segregationist. Overall, I have mostly positive feelings toward this newly found work of Lee’s. As I discuss it here, I will try not to give too many specific plot details, since some of you may be planning on reading it, too.<br/><br/>First, I will address the title which piqued my curiosity when I first heard it many months ago. It’s from Isaiah 21:6 and just as God set Isaiah as a prophet and one to watch over Israel, this title speaks to the need for someone to serve as one who will truthfully declare what they see and serve as a sort of moral compass. Scout (Jean Louise) hears the preacher discuss this passage in church when she returns to visit Maycomb as an adult. Jean Louise later learns, with the help of her Uncle Jack, that she hadn’t fully developed her own conscience; instead, her own was indistinguishable from Atticus’s. This is what makes Atticus’s differing beliefs almost physically painful for her to handle. She has yet to learn that “[e]veryman’s watchman is his own conscience” (265). Just like in TKAM, the title is mentioned a few times and helps to reveal a change in understanding of the narrator.<br/><br/>Now on to Lee’s actually writing style. As a teacher, I found myself engrossed with noticing the similarities in style to her writing in TKAM and the obvious differences. Some phrases are direct echoes of lines that she obviously copies from Watchman to integrate into the new novel her publisher told her she should write about Scout’s childhood, To Kill a Mockingbird. There are some rich descriptions, but not as detailed or as lush as some of the descriptions in Mockingbird. Some might call the writing disappointing compared to the successful, beloved TKAM. Some of the prose does lack some sophistication in style, but I don’t feel disappointed by Lee. Instead, I see it for what it is: a first draft of a first novel that has been “lightly edited” according to the publisher’s accounts. I can imagine myself pulling a paragraph from Go Set a Watchman and one from To Kill a Mockingbird to have my students analyze for style. What a wonderful example to illustrate to them how they as writers can also grow and why feedback on writing and revising is so important. What Lee didn’t need to work on much in her earlier work is her humor. In one passage, the ever critical Aunt Alexandra is aghast that Jean Louise is rumored to have skinny dipped with her somewhat boyfriend, Hank (of course, that’s the Maycomb rumor mill-they were fully dressed). When Scout informs Atticus of the rumor, his first comment is simply that he “hope[s] [she] wasn’t doing the backstroke” (86), which instantly made me laugh and also sounds exactly like Mockingbird’s Atticus.<br/><br/>Speaking of Atticus, what about the characters of this “newly discovered” novel? Initially, Atticus does sound very much like the hero that so many readers have idolized for years. I’m glad that early reviews did warn me of his segregationist beliefs; however, I am not as shocked as other people. I don’t know if I can quite explain this correctly, but here it goes: To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in the 1930s when segregation was the norm. I think this makes it easier for Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man, unjustly accused of raping a white woman. First, Atticus always obeys his own conscience, and it is clear that Tom is innocent. However, it is one thing to defend a man in the courtroom and another to sit down and have dinner with him. I think some readers have forgotten that Scout mentions that Calpurnia sleeps on a cot in the kitchen whenever the Finches need her help overnight, implying the segregation that Atticus clearly obeyed in TKAM.  Go Set a Watchman takes place in the 50s right after the Brown vs the Board of Education decision. Now these characters have to actually search their consciences and think about co-existing with people who have up to this point been just seen as “the Other”, inferior, and always physically separated from them. Lee doesn’t present Atticus as some card carrying cross burner here, but a more practical man who knows his town isn’t perfect, and is trying to find a way to co-exist with others. The older Atticus has some concerns that are very realistic for a man living in a small Southern town in the 1950s. He feels that “a vast majority of [the black people] are unable to share fully in the responsibilities of citizenship”. In other words, because of the lack of education afforded to the black people in that time period, they would not be on an equal plain intellectually with the white people and should not immediately be elected into positions of power, etc. I could even almost imagine that the Mockingbird Atticus could turn into the Watchman one once his beliefs became challenged more on a practical, personal level. Aside from Atticus, I was concerned as to how I would feel towards Scout, whom I have also loved from the first time I read To Kill a Mockingbird. I like the adult Scout; she is the feminist I expected her to become. When Aunt Alexandra has a tea party in her honor reminiscent of the Maycomb Missionary tea party displayed in TKAM, the shallow conversation of the women makes Jean Louise remark that “it takes a lot of what I don’t have to be a member of this wedding” (173). She also realizes that she doesn’t have it in her to pretend to be the perfect wife for a man. As she tells Hank, “’I’ll have an affair with you, but I won’t marry you’” (14). I still like Scout, and more importantly, I understand her confusion, her anger, her grief.<br/><br/>I went into reading Go Set a Watchmen with what I consider the right attitude. I had reasonable expectations for a first novel that didn’t have the time or revisions put into it that Mockingbird had.<br/>I hoped to find enjoyable little nuggets reminiscent of TKAM, and to revel in my favorite author’s sense of humor, and Lee didn’t disappoint me.
Harper Lee had more than half a century to prepare this book for publication and yet chose not to do so. I think there is a very good reason for this. It simply isn't very good.<br/>It did something that To Kill a Mockingbird has never done for me once in more than forty years. It bored me. I found the characters flat and lifeless, and the whole thing seemed rather contrived. Any further debate about this manuscript's very doubtful provenance aside, the writing style just doesn't ring true. It seems like a second rate parody of the work of the author of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>I don't think I'm alone in this. One third of the reviews on Amazon are negative, and I just came from my local bookstore where, just days after its release, the book has already been marked down 40%. I didn't notice anyone standing in line to buy a copy either.The people who go on and on in these reviews about what a great book this is remind me of the visitors at a wake who comment on how lifelike the corpse looks.<br/>To Kill a Mockingbird is a luminous classic written for the ages. I doubt anyone will be reading this book a year from now..It is a very sad commentary that the author's wishes regarding it were not honored, and that it was published at a stage of her life when it seems highly unlikely that she could have actively participated in the process. She has been quoted as saying that writing anything else after To Kill a Mockingbird would have been pointless, on the grounds that her magnificent first novel could never be matched.. How right she was.
The short version of this review is: if nothing else, Go Set A Watchman, especially when compared to the brilliance of To Kill A Mockingbird, is a testament to the power of a good editor.<br/><br/>Watchman is told from the perspective of an adult Jean Louise (Scout) on her annual family visit to Maycomb from New York.  Some passages and characters are familiar: the questionable circumstances regarding the establishment of Maycomb; Aunty’s intimate knowledge of every family (and family foible) in the county; Dill, Jem, Calpurnia, and, of course, Atticus in the courtroom.  And there are flashes of Lee’s sly humor and ability to paint a vivid portrait of someone or something in one sentence: “He was a big, good man with a soft baritone, who ruled with easy tact a choir of repressed soloists, and who had an unerring memory for the favorite hymns of District Superintendents”.  Yet it is the unfamiliar behavior of these familiar characters that will be startling to most readers of Mockingbird: Jean Louise confronts a Maycomb seething with tension as the civil rights movement gains momentum and the people she loves most in the world seem to be standing on the wrong side of history.<br/><br/>The main problem with Watchman isn’t that it profanes the memory of beloved literary characters.  The bigger issue is that it is a sluggish read: the ‘contemporary’ passages in particular, are not that compelling. Scout’s childhood flashbacks and the sketches of small-town Southern life were often more interesting than the racial melodrama or adult-parent coming of age story central to the book, and much of the contemporary dialogue – particularly in the later chapters – was either clunky or overly complicated.  By the time the reader arrives at the climax, any interest in or feeling for these characters stems primarily from how we remember them in the past (via Mockingbird) rather than how we are introduced to them in Watchman.<br/><br/>Lest this sound too negative, perhaps the most interesting aspect of Watchman lies in seeing glimmers of how it evolved into Mockingbird.  Given that the highlights of Watchman were the flashback scenes and asides about small-town life, it is not surprising that this is the direction Harper Lee’s editor(s?) encouraged her to take in rewriting her manuscript.  Although there is nothing in Watchman that compares to, say, Scout’s brief theater career as a ham, I can also see how an editor would take great interest in this young author, but not necessarily be interested in this particular book.  That said, this is where the (still somewhat murky) way the book was published is a liability: often when the unpublished works of major authors are published (posthumously), they are also contextualized by scholars that unearth letters and interviews in order to piece together the editorial process.  Given that almost nobody will read this book without having read Mockingbird – indeed, I doubt this book would have been published at all if it was not tied to Lee’s earlier work – I think the publishers did readers an incredible disservice by not contextualizing the book more. Hopefully future editions will include an introduction that details the evolution of Watchman into Mockingbird, but the fact that it does not invites further questions about how and why Watchman was published at this point in time.<br/><br/>To conclude, Watchman is not a great book on its own.  It is a promising early work, which clearly benefited from an editorial process that managed not only to tighten the story while adding greater complexity, but also to preserve Harper Lee’s keen eye for detail and sharp sense of humor.  An account of Watchman’s transformation may make for a more interesting read than the actual manuscript itself.
The answers to your questions: it is not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. You don’t have to read it. That is not to say you shouldn’t, or you won’t enjoy it – I did – but you don’t HAVE to read it.<br/><br/>It is precisely what it is purported to be: the story of Scout Finch, all – or almost all – grown up. It is also a rough draft of sorts of Mockingbird; there are passages that were taken straight from this book and put into that one, some descriptions of Aunt Alexandra, the history of Maycomb’s founding, that sort of thing. It is not the same book, retold at a different time; it is also not the sequel, as there are several small details that do not mesh with Mockingbird — Cousin Francis is Alexandra’s son, not her grandson; the Radley family is missing entirely, but there is a reference to another boogeyman who sneaks out at night and eats cats.<br/><br/>For someone who has never read To Kill a Mockingbird, this would likely be a good, but probably not a great book. This is me theorizing, of course, because I’m a high school English teacher, and I’ve taught Harper Lee’s masterpiece (It gave me a laugh to look inside the front cover and see “Also by Harper Lee:”) and read it a dozen times. I think the reality, the tangible, concrete weight of the characters and their personalities was already in me from Mockingbird, and I’m not sure it would be present for someone who didn’t read that book. This book’s central conflict climaxes with more speechifying, as if Atticus’s closing argument were moved to the final chapters and combined with the conversations about Boo Radley and Jem: more slow buildup and a longer period of talking through it. But the writing is still Harper Lee, and it is still wonderful: there is the same elegant prose, the same remarkable ability to switch from formal to casual, the same ironic humor, the same incisive understanding of the people and history of the South, and it’s still a joy to read. So I would recommend it.<br/><br/>For those who, like me, have read Mockingbird and loved it, you should think carefully. This book is good, but it is not a masterpiece. The wonder of Mockingbird hinges on the choice to make Scout a child. That simplified the story, and enabled Lee to treat race and hate and human nature with innocence and simplicity – through a child’s eyes. The adult Scout – now Jean Louise, an emblematic change – doesn’t have it so easy. She is much more reflective, thinking about what people say and whether they actually meant it or not; trying to decide whether their words and their character are a match to what she remembers of them from the past; trying to decide for herself where she belongs, and what she loves and what she can’t stand. The characters that were simple are now not, particularly – and most tryingly – Atticus. In Mockingbird, Atticus is the perfect father-hero. But now, Scout is older, and in this book, she finishes growing up. And it hurts to see Atticus the way she is forced to see him. It made this book hard to read. And, to tell the truth, so did Lee’s erudite references to Victorian authors and 1950’s historical and cultural icons, several of which I did not understand.<br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend this book as an exercise in the writer’s craft to those who teach Mockingbird, and to those who write themselves and know Lee’s classic. It is fascinating to see the changes between this earlier book and the later one, to see the author’s choices that made that book great, and this one less so.<br/><br/>For those who love Mockingbird for its own sake? If you think you can handle it, I would highly recommend this book to you, too. Because just like Scout, I think we need to grow up, and see our heroes in a more human light. And even though this book is more complex, more troubling, it is the difference between idyllic, idealized childhood and murky, gray-shaded adulthood; and this is still Scout. It’s still Atticus. It’s still Maycomb. It’s still Harper Lee. It was wonderful to go back and see it all again.
If Harper Lee's intent in "Go Set a Watchman" is to have people see others as they really are, she has certainly done that--starting with herself as the book's author. As a former English teacher who has taught "Mockingbird" too many times to count, I had set Miss Lee on a literary pedestal so high she had become an immortal, of sorts, hovering over the rest of us, unattainable and powerful. "Watchman" has pulled back the curtain to reveal an ordinary writer with extraordinary talent, set on writing works that are meaningful, believable, and enjoyable. Nothing superhuman about that.<br/><br/>Some readers may be disillusioned with Lee and especially with the character Atticus Finch. But that disillusionment is at the heart of the book's theme. As we grow older, we see the world through different eyes. People and places larger than life back in the day, seem smaller and less significant viewed from the distance of time. Jean Louise knows this to be true, but can't accept this new reality. Like Jack Finch, Jean Louise views the world through her own half glasses, leaving her with a blind spot when it comes to the hearts and motives of those around her.<br/><br/>As the reader struggles to make peace with seeing the two stories and their author in a new light, he would do well to remember that the two books have different purposes. Without the naive narrative viewpoint of young Scout in "Mockingbird," there could be no evolution in the second story. As a novelist and commentator on life, Miss Lee shows people as they are, for better or for worse. Watching characters change, react, and adapt is what makes reading so seductive. If you just want a "Book 2" in the "Mockingbird Series" that picks up on Scout's newest misadventure and snarky wit, "Watchman" is not for you.<br/><br/>It seems apparent that this book was never revised or edited after the release of "Mockingbird." If Harper Lee had been able to weather the psychological storm that came along with the overwhelming attention and adulation she received from her first work, she likely would have made numerous revisions to "Watchman" so that it would flow more logically from the first story. She would have removed duplicated anecdotes, handled the fate of her benevolent Jem with greater depth, and added the same care, nuance, and sensitivity that made "Mockingbird" so powerful and palatable. Alas, Harper Lee mislaid her inner Jean Louise even before she did the same with this draft of "Watchman." Still, it is what it is.<br/><br/>Put in perspective, the themes are powerful and relevant. There are places where the story could have been tightened up, and the ending seems a little rushed. But for a story that in some ways is so unsettling, it has a fairly satisfying ending.<br/><br/>We, the readers, put "Mockingbird," the characters, and the author on that pedestal, just like Scout did with her father. "Watchman" is just as much a reality check for us as it is for our beloved Jean Louise. Miss Lee gave us a book that makes us think and debate and rethink. That is an enviable legacy.
Harper Lee submitted this novel in 1957.<br/><br/>It was rejected -- not because she was a poor writer, but because this was a flawed book.<br/><br/>First, the flaws:<br/><br/>1) The book is a series of short stories and speeches. It's not a parable (like To Kill a Mockingbird), but a sermon. As Robert McKee would say, it's "on the nose."<br/><br/>2) Both the adult Scout and Atticus AGREE on things that we would find abhorrent today -- that blacks are in their infancy, and that the Supreme Court decision was badly rendered.  Atticus leaves it at that, although Scout thinks it was wrongly done, but necessary anyway. The disturbing aspect of the book is that NEITHER side of the "conflict" has a different set of assumptions.<br/><br/>3) Nothing is properly dramatized; it's just argued.<br/><br/>4) The conclusion doesn't work -- but it contains a germ of an idea that became the triumph of Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Now the strengths:<br/><br/>1) The characters are real. They FEEL like real people, in all their ambiguities between goodness and bad. In this respect it is even better than Mockingbird, which has a too perfect Atticus.<br/><br/>2) The flashbacks are outstanding writing. If I were an editor rejecting this book I would ask for ANOTHER book which focused on the child Scout instead of the adult -- which is precisely what happened.<br/><br/>3) This book reflects the reality of Southern conflict in the 1950s. I've listed the shared assumptions of black inferiority as a weakness, but the truth is that this WAS indeed the mindset of that time.  The problem is that the writer couldn't properly transcend those assumptions (a weakness) even though she stated them more clearly than I've ever seen in print (a strength).<br/><br/>Is it canon?<br/><br/>No. I had to think long and hard about this, because the characters really are the same characters. But this book was written BEFORE Mockingbird and rejected. Atticus was based on Harper Lee's father in the early 1950s -- who WAS at that time a segregationist. That book took one year to write.<br/><br/>The multi-year REWRITE became Mockingbird -- not as a rewrite of that plot, but as a rewrite of those characters. In the interval between those two books, Harper Lee's father changed his mind about segregation. He began as the Atticus of Watchman and became the Atticus of Mockingbird.<br/><br/>In order to properly be "canon", the Atticus from Mockingbird to Watchman has to work as a single individual in that timeline.  Instead, his changed character reflected a real man (her actual father) in a timeline working in the opposite direction. The segregationist BECAME the Atticus we came to love. If read as canon, then the Atticus we came to love would have become the segregationist.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean it cannot be read as "canon." Certainly the cognitive dissonance Scout experiences in the Citizen's Council becomes our own in reading the book. It seems like canon in that respect, and can certainly be read that way if one desired (that is, Atticus would be for separate [Watchman] but equal [Mockingbird]).  But my take on canonicity is drawn from the fact that Atticus is a facsimile of Harper's own father, who grew between those novels -- from the father of Watchman into the father of Mockingbird.<br/><br/>This book is required reading if you want to learn how to write and to be encouraged to do so. Watchman is clunky, awkward, with flashes of raw brilliance. It is a book that CANNOT be fixed, yet with characters that can be recreated into something marvelous.<br/><br/>Harper Lee was rejected -- and overcame that rejection with a rewrite of those same characters in a different setting of a changed plot and a different presentation. From the sermon of Watchman came the parable of Mockingbird.<br/><br/>And in each Lee ended the novel with the same thematic trick: to show that Scout HERSELF (and therefore the reader) has been bigoted the whole time.<br/><br/>The entire point of bigotry is that we are unaware of it.  It is the logical or emotional conclusion of our assumptions -- and until those assumptions themselves are exposed, the bigotry remains invisible.  In the final pages of Watchman we realize that we are anti-Southern bigots.  In the final pages of Mockingbird we realize that we are anti-Boo Radley bigots.  Boo is no longer a stated value but a metaphor for ANYTHING or ANYONE we have wrongly feared.<br/><br/>Mockingbird IS the final version of Watchman -- and therefore Watchman is not canon in that respect.<br/><br/>But it IS essential reading for a writer who wants to rise from failure and rejection.<br/><br/>First, read Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Then, read Watchman.<br/><br/>Finally, read Mockingbird again as the resurrection of characters from a flawed plot.<br/><br/>If read in that way, this book could become infinitely meaningful -- not as a narrative of disillusion toward a character -- but rather as an example of resurrection as a writer.<br/><br/>I could write better than Watchman.<br/><br/>I will never write better than Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Harper Lee spanned both extremes -- giving hope for the rest of us who would love to write, and have lacked the guts to keep doing so.
This searingly insightful look into the minds of the people of Macomb in the 1950s is very timely.  It shows patterns of thought that persist to this day and exposes the roots of modern racial tension.  In To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus was shown as first and foremost a lawyer, dedicated to defending the justice system and the constitution every bit as much as his clients.  It's no surprise he's still the same way.  He was always a decent man according to his lights, leading to his actions in Mockingbird, and those lights have not changed, leading to his actions in Watchman.  In To Kill a Mockingbird, the author's acute observational lens was directed without pity onto the values and customs of Macomb in the 1930s.  People got on; assumptions were both racist and sexist, they weren't questioned much, and people mostly got on.  By the 1950s, people had begun questioning some of the assumptions pertaining to racism (sexism remains alive and well), and with those questions, people stopped getting on, and to this day, I'm afraid, neither side understands the other's position.  When Jean-Louise (very much a woman of her time, she spouts some rather racist and sexist positions herself) visits Calpurnia, this conflict bursts into light just as both women's hearts are torn.  I suspect Watchman was at least rewritten after Mockingbird was published, and then put aside because Mockingbird became such a juggernaut for change.  Only now can it really be understood as a portrait of a time, as merciless as an anthropological study, that can cast light on our world now.  There is a "canon" deviation: Tom was convicted in Mockingbird.  Parts of Watchman clearly want expansion.  No-one can seriously believe that anything Lee ever wrote won't be published after her death, so arguments against its current publication are specious.  Sure, the book needs editing and revision (hence 4 rather than 5 stars), but it is far from "first draft".  It's riviting.  It's shocking.  It's a gripping page-turner. Thought-provoking, certainly. It fully deserves publication, right this very minute, for the piercing insight Harper Lee brings to the world.  Read it.
I refuse to write spoilers. The book needs to unfold for you, the reader. Having said that, the book is amazing. Different from Mockingbird yet the same. I think the first paragraph in chapter three is identical to a paragraph in Mockingbird. Most of Mockingbird is encapsulated in a few sentences looking back by an adult Scout.<br/><br/>Atticus. He's a moral good one-dimensional man in Mockingbird. Scout was starting first grade. Atticus in Mockingbird was the Atticus of a six-year-old who adored her father. Atticus in Watchman is three-dimensional, flawed, and amazing still.<br/><br/>Watchman will rip out your insides. It's a damned uncomfortable read. The first half is funny as Hell. The second half makes you so uncomfortable that it's hard to breathe.<br/><br/>The honesty in the voices. The guileless comments. The hatred. The love. I don't think this book could be written now. It's not politically correct to even attempt to discuss this book. Many will say they hated the book simply because that will preclude having to talk about it.<br/><br/>It's uncomfortable. It's a shockingly honest peek into human bejngs and how flawed they are, especially when afraid. It's a peek into how heroic a human father can be, flawed though he is, in loving his daughter and wanting her to believe what is right for her.<br/><br/>It's an honest book. Every bit as good as Mockingbird. It's hard to read though. Be prepared to hold your mind open. There are many different sides in the book. Seeing all of them while not agreeing with them is hard. Which, I think, after all, is exactly the point Harper wanted to make.<br/><br/>We're all Childe Harold.
I'm sorry I read this book and wish it had not been published.  Clearly there was a reason why this version was not published and was not the pulitzer winning book that Harper Lee went on to write.  The characters are not well developed, the death of Jean Louise's beloved brother is glossed over, the fact that Dill is not even a character in this book, nor any of the neighbors, etc. shows the lack of proper development of the story in this book.  It is not a companion book since the facts in the two books don't match up (Atticus did not get a black man acquitted of rape, Francis is the grandson of Jean Louise's aunt, not the son, etc.), and the book contains portions of what did become part of To Kill a Mockingbird and used some of the same devices.  If you loved to Kill a Mockingbird, I would recommend not reading this book.
I so wish people would stop tarnishing Harper Lee's legacy by calling this book a sequel, as if she intended it to follow To Kill a Mockingbird -- as if she intended it to be published at all. Go Set a Watchman's theme and characters were only a starting point.<br/><br/>This was an initial draft, rejected by her publisher. With guidance from an editor, she reworked it and refined it into what ultimately became To Kill a Mockingbird. Thank heaven she did.<br/><br/>This book was deemed unpublishable when it was written. To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize. And rightfully so.<br/><br/>For people who enjoy studying a writer's process, reading Go Set a Watchman has value. You'll even recognize some longish passages which were used verbatim in To Kill a Mockingbird. That in itself should be a heads-up, though, about Harper Lee's intent regarding this early manuscript. This was raw material from which a later gem emerged.<br/><br/>I should make it clear that it was not the racist ideas we hear from Atticus in Watchman that made this first effort unpublishable.  Those are all intact in Mockingbird, but given far more subtle expression; Atticus in Mockingbird is just as staunch a guardian of Maycomb's social order, but Harper Lee found ways to show us rather than have him blurt his thoughts in a single scene.  It was the writing, the craft that fell short.<br/><br/>Watchman was a fledgling effort.  Relative to Mockingbird, its characters are two-dimensional.  Its setting lacks the rich and languid detail that makes Maycomb a character in itself in Mockingbird. Watchman's plot is pedestrian, its structure simplistic.  There's too much exposition.  Remember the edict "show, don't tell"?  Ms. Lee had yet to master it.<br/><br/>Appreciate this rare glimpse at an early draft of a classic.  Don't mistake it for a more highly evolved book than To Kill a Mockingbird, though, just because Go Set a Watchman takes place a couple of decades later and its protagonist is older. Mockingbird evolved *from* Watchman.  Harper Lee's growth as a writer during that process is breathtaking, and it's doing her a grave disservice to dismiss it, to laud her first attempt as superior to the masterpiece she gave us in the end.
First novels are tricky bags. First novels are as much about the learning experience of writing a novel as they are about the production of the manuscript. Let me explain: my favorite author is Cormac McCarthy. Reading Blood Meridian for the first time gave me epileptic fits when I tried to wrap my head around how a contemporary author could write such incandescent prose consistently across 300-odd pages. It wrecked me as a writer and as a reader. But when I read his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, I was distressed, to say the least. It's not that the novel was bad. It's a very good book, but it's nothing compared to what McCarthy would go on to write. Yet, after rereading it, I can see shades of the writer McCarthy later became. I can see precedent for almost every technique and thematic approach he would develop as he crafted his masterpieces. But first novels are about finding voice and figuring out technique. Who am I as a writer, and how do I write to share the story I'm telling with my audience? The answers take time to find.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is a first novel, and as a first novel, it's not bad, but it's also not very good.<br/><br/>For one thing, the narrative is told predominantly from a very traditional, past-tense third-person perspective. That's the way the overwhelming majority of novels are written, and in this case, it's sufficient to tell the story but not sufficient to draw the reader into Jean Louise's world. So, periodically, Harper Lee switches over into a present-tense, first-person perspective, to place the reader directly inside Jean Louise's head. The problem is, her head isn't terribly interesting. It's too juvenile to affect the reader in any substantive way. She sounds less like an independent 26-year-old woman and more like an 8-year-old brat who doesn't understand why she isn't getting her way. And then, as if those perspective switches weren't enough, we are given these long impressionistic collages in place of conversations and monologues that I'm assuming Harper Lee just couldn't be bothered to write out in full. And these passages should have been written out in full. I'm thinking in particular of what should have been an emotionally draining speech delivered by a hardcore Southern bigot, which currently reads as "racial slur dot dot dot racist comment dot dot dot racial slur dot dot dot racial slur dot dot dot racial superiority comment dot dot dot" and so on and so on. These collages are terribly ineffective in conveying what they need to, and there is no clear reason for the switch from a traditional third-person narrative to these collages.<br/><br/>As far as the writing itself, it's not bad. It's nothing special, certainly not very polished, but again, it is a first novel, and a first draft of a first novel. As I understand it, the manuscript was discovered and then the publisher immediately set about laying it out without doing any serious editorial work. I'm of two minds regarding this: on one hand, what we have is raw, it needs refinement, but on the other hand, editing a work 55 years after it was first written presents some significant challenges to the author in terms of maintaining a consistent voice while remaining true to the original manuscript.<br/><br/>And there are times when the writing is quite good. An early scene in which Jean Louise and Henry go on a date was one of the highlights of the novel for me. The dialogue is very natural, the narrative organic, and that section felt sweet and innocent without ever becoming sentimental. I really was hoping for more sections like that one. Also, there are several extended flashbacks to Jean Louise's childhood that I felt were well done. Again, sweet and innocent, not sentimental. Which is a difficult balance to achieve, so big ups, Miss Lee.<br/><br/>And really, if the only problems I had with the novel were the wonky narrative perspective and some clunky writing, the novel would be fine. Maybe not a classic, but certainly a worthwhile read.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my biggest issues with the novel are fairly serious.<br/><br/>Jean Louise Finch is supposed to be a 26-year-old woman. She is not. She is still Scout, by which I mean she is still a child. Now, I don't mean that she is struggling with growing up, that she is rejecting adulthood in favor of childhood. No, Scout's mindset is much more pathological, in that she is near despondent that the Maycomb of her childhood is not the Maycomb she has come home to, and she responds by essentially throwing temper tantrums the entire the novel. In fact, one of the most jarring reactions I had as I was reading was near the end of the novel when Scout's uncle tries to explain Southern racism in terms of Southern pride. It's not a terribly rational argument that he makes, and yet, I found it infinitely more rational than anything Scout said in response. Her responses were the responses of a petulant child who can't understand why an adult is not agreeing with her.<br/><br/>And the Uncle's argument is interesting in that it reminded me very much of Faulkner's argument in Absalom, Absalom and The Sound and the Fury: that notion of the Old South being forced into a modern era that it doesn't really want to get involved and is in no way prepared for. The difference between Lee's take and Faulkner's take is akin to the difference between Dan Brown and Umberto Eco's takes on the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  One is clearly more intellectual while the other is clearly meant for the common man and as a result is nowhere near as nuanced. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but Lee's novel is not terribly nuanced.<br/><br/>And this leads to the most damning criticism of the novel, one which, if you've heard anything at all about this novel, you've heard mentioned, and it's here that I must talk about Watchman alongside Mockingbird. Atticus Finch, the moral compass of Mockingbird, a bastion of decency and tolerance and acceptance, has been reduced to a raging bigot. This is simultaneously the most successful aspect of the novel and the least successful. I say that because, on it's own, we don't have enough setup for this revelation to affect us as readers. So Scout's dad isn't the idealized dude she claims early on, big deal. We feel bad that Scout is seeing an ugly side of her father, but we don't have enough invested in her childhood experiences to accept blindly what she says about him. We just assume she's being unreliable as a narrator. If, however, we look at Atticus in terms of Mockingbird, his turn as a racist breaks our hearts at least as much as it breaks Scout's heart. When Atticus argues that all men are created equal and that Tom Robinson is a good man and an innocent man, you believed what he was saying and what's more, you believed that he believed what he was saying. But then you see that he didn't, that he was just being a good lawyer and fighting for his client.<br/><br/>And that is this novel's greatest crime: we cannot read this novel in isolation. We cannot read it apart from Mockingbird. There is no way of separating the two. And when we read that Atticus Finch believes the black man is going to mongrelize the superior white race... it's too much.<br/><br/>He breaks our hearts.<br/><br/>He breaks our hearts. And that's that.<br/><br/>One last issue, and it's a relatively minor one, is the ending. I won't say much except that I feel the last two chapters were placeholders. They simply do not fit with what comes before them. And I think if anything needed a rewrite, it would be those two chapters.<br/><br/>Overall, I cannot recommend Go Set a Watchman, especially not if you are a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird. Don't do that to yourself. Go read Mockingbird again. Go watch the film. Don't read this. Don't do that to yourself.
This novel demonstrates everything that's wrong with traditional publishing today. When the unpublished novel by the Pulitzer prize-winning author of the literary classic To Kill a Mockingbird surfaced, publishing pounced on it, setting up a string of controversy that continues to surround this book. Harper Lee had not published another book since the famous Mockingbird, a tough act to follow. Watchman is rumored to have been the original Mockingbird manuscript, which some suspected had been heavily worked and edited by editor Tay Hohoff and eventually went on to superstardom.  Watchman was launched into the marketplace with great fanfare and expectation only to fall flat for a number of reasons, poor editing amongst them. This book appears to be the effort of a newbie writer, unclear, full of long-winded, unnecessary flashbacks, some concerning characters from Mockingbird who don't even appear in this story. If this were a newly written novel seeking publication or representation it wouldn't  make it past the front door. I found it difficult to understand, follow, or care about. I wonder if Harper Lee really stood behind the publication of this book, which tarnishes her legacy. Most likely there won't be another unless there's something tucked away in a closet somewhere to reach the light of day after she's no longer here to see it.<br/><br/>If the money and effort extended to publish and market this novel had been granted to some lesser-known authors, or a few trying to make their start, it may have offered more literary value. It's a shame when a Big 5 publisher banks on the reputation of a lone literary wonder to make its year, cheating both the readers and the writers of opportunities to discover new talent and books.
This is not a novel, it is only an early draft.  I can see why Harper Lee chose not publish it, and I question the motives of those who chose to publish this after Harper Lee entered a nursing home and both her attorney and her sister had died.  It is important to remember in this prototype, Lee addressed racism by reaching for our hearts.  In her first attempt (Go Set a Watchman), her prototype Atticus was a formerly good man who descended into bigotry, perhaps in response to both his crippling disease and the impact he perceived coming from the civil rights movement.  His fall hurts the reader.  But this was the first prototype of Atticus Finch.  Fortunately, she rescued the character from the man he was in Watchman and reworked him into the man who inspired a generation of young men and women to become lawyers.  Although in the chronolgy of the stories, Atticus goes from good to bad, in the chronology of the evolution of the story from Watchman to To Kill a Mockingbird, he goes from bad to good.  Watchman is not a novel.  It is a first, failed attempt.  It should never have been published as anything else.
A Review of Go Set a Watchman<br/><br/>First, let me say this is just my opinion and based on a three hour read through.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is approximately 275 pages of writing which was better left forgotten in the writer's trunk and relegated to the dusty forgetfulness of grocery store lists. The fact that you can see the passages Lee cannibalized to fill out the descriptive passages of To Kill a Mockingbird further leads me to believe this was a discarded work in favor or the more cohesive To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>So, with that out of the way, let me talk about what everyone is gasping and moaning and groaning about in the media...and that is Atticus' bigotry.<br/><br/>Scout comes home on her annual two week visit to find that her father has suddenly, in her eyes; become an old sickly man. We learn through the book the fates of other characters from Mockingbird and we hear some rather fractious gossip about the family and the neighbors. We also learn that Scout is being courted by her dad's junior partner.<br/><br/>Before you get to the meat of the story, and that is the fact her dad has some troubling thoughts about civil rights and the NAACP, we have to wade through some rather boring bits and stories and there is only one bare mention of the trial that was the central story of Mockingbird.<br/><br/>When we finally are confronted with the notion Atticus may well have been a bigot, we have waded through irrelevancy and are relieved to finally get to meat of the matter. Atticus excuses himself one night to attend a Citizen's Council meeting. This is Southern Parlayance for some sort of white men's meeting concerning black people in their town.<br/><br/>The speaker is one of those n*gger haters that a generation ago would have been wearing a white sheet. He does not make any bones about what he thinks of blacks and he is a caricature of the Southern Bigot. The fact that Scout's father sits placidly and listens to this man seems to be the thing that pisses Scout off the most.<br/><br/>After the meeting and some rather overdramatic behavior by Scout, she first talks to her Uncle; who lives in Maycomb now; and then she confronts Atticus. Let the reader observe that besides the ugly little man with the venomous hatred, Scout says the n-word more than any other character in the book, and Atticus never does. That is something to think about carefully. If you think about Mockingbird, Lee made it a point to show only ignorant ugly people used the word and Scout only used it in innocent ignorance and Atticus told her to never use that word.<br/><br/>The books has no real resolution and it ends awkwardly and leaves the reader with the feeling of something not finished. It will be up to you to decide whether you find Atticus' rather muddled explanation for his resistance to the Civil Rights Movement and the NAACP and the striking down of the 10th Amendment and why he sat placidly and listened to the hate being touted by the speaker who came to their meeting. You may come away disgusted by the actions of such a loved character, or you may be like me and say this material was not suitable for publishing as it was not very good or you may decide it is just as wonderful as Mockingbird and it's worthy successor.<br/><br/>But I urge you to read it for yourself and make up your own mind and try not to let the talking heads of the 24 hour news media and the prevailing racial climate in America color your opinion. It it either stands or fall on its own...
I first checked out TKAM from my local library before I read Go Set a Watchman, to become familiar with the characters I had read decades ago. From the reviews of Watchman, I was expecting the so-called racist issues to come up, but actually found those scenes to be melodramatic or even boring at times. The political dialogue made my eyes glaze over. I was waiting for more action to happen and it didn't. Disappointing to read whole pages of description or dialogue taken verbatim from TKAM! (and yes, I know, Watchman was actually a draft of TKAM, but still!) The thing that bothered me most was trying to figure out what Scout was DOING in New York. Was she working there? What was her profession? Not a clue in the book anywhere.<br/>All I can say is, poor Harper Lee. I am a 7-time author myself and am in the process of updating my will and advanced directive. Now I will add in explicit instructions for my estate to NOT publish any unfinished manuscripts they may find!!
Tiresome. I struggled through chapter by chapter waiting for the story to develop. Never happened. All of the characters seemed vague and one dimensional except for Jean Louise and she seemed to be kind of nutty. Can't recommend it.  Loved MOCKINGBIRD.
This was a waste of time.  There was no story and the moral if there is one is that it takes time for change to be effective. Would not recommend this book to any reader. It is simply a publishers money maker
Harper Lee was prescient when she wrote Go Set A Watchman, a book that is eerily timeless for it anticipates and underscores the continuing racial angst that has existed and is yet a part of this moment in America.  Harper Lee's voice is like setting down in a comfortable rocker and visiting an old and dear friend who returns us to both the good and the bad of our communal struggle, as well as the earnest desires for a better world for all in a distant and different time. The individual and personal nature of that struggle and those earnest desires for a better world remain a part of our character in every generation, resonating in these pages.<br/><br/>Scout/Jean Louise returns to Maycomb, Alabama after living in New York City.  In 1950s America, she has experienced an integrated America at a time when segregation was the rule in the South.  Her moral conscience, molded by Atticus more than her Church or school during her childhood, was realized in the culture of New York; the return to the culture of Maycomb in its racial and social division shocks, angers and devastates the adult Scout/Jean Louise. She is unengaged, bored and removed, as she has always been, from the foundations of the social world of Maycomb; its religion and moral imperatives along with the domestic urgencies of wives and mothers have been and continue to be alien to her.  She has come home to uncomfortable realities.<br/><br/>Growing  up in the postwar South meant that most of the community lived in what we would now identify as poverty, it was the state of most families, black and white, in rural America in the 1950s, as Lee recounts.  Atticus has been able to provide Scout with a college education, and forced her out of the nest and into the larger world of New York City.  As Jean Louise her return home is a story of losses: Atticus is aging and infirm, childhood playmates are gone, she reluctantly entertains her hometown suitor, Calpurnia, the black maid that raised Scout is aged and no longer works for the family.  Calpurnia has been more than a mother to her, but Scout is forced to awaken to the personal costs of racial, economic, social disparity of Calpurnia and Maycomb's black community within the poverty of Maycomb; the injustice, bitterness and hopelessness of being black in the 1950s South.  She is forced to recognize that her relationship with Calpurnia is one that is has had a veneer of intimacy because of these conditions. The historic Supreme Court decision ordering desegregation, and NAACP civil rights workers in Alabama challenging the historic racial cultural tension in the South, underscores the historic moment when the fabric of a racist culture begin to unravel, but so does Jean Louise's withering assessment of Atticus' racial and social conscience as he attempts to be the respected, skilled midwife bringing to life change in the racism in the microcosm of Maycomb in the 1950s.  The portrait of Atticus is one of a principled man walking a social tightrope, and a daughter who has lived outside of the social milieu of her hometown long enough to forget the reprecussions for whites who openly sympathized with injustice. Lee presents an America in which Americans struggling with radical social changes could and did respectfully listen to the repulsive opinions of the worst kind of religious and racial bigotry, reject it, and attempt to lead social change -- if you were a respected voice with deep roots in your community willing to take that risk, like Atticus and Jean Louise.  Uncle Jack reasons with Jean Louise, "You may not know it, but there's room for you down here."  "You mean Atticus needs me?"  "Not altogether.  I was thinking of Maycomb."  'That'd be great, with me on one side, and everybody else on the other."<br/><br/>Harper Lee, almost seventy years ago, recorded the moment when the consciousness of white America began to address the reasons for the disparity of outcomes for black America.  She is the Watchman that declares what she sees.  She exposes the personal nature of those messy individual moments of how people grow, learn, live and change that are often lost in the larger, historic, grander moments of protests, speeches and news stories.  Go Set a Watchman reminds us that the less spectacular personal challenges, earnest hopes and dreams, and individual actions of Americans who have and continue to work and sacrifice for safety and freedom, better education, and opportunities for black America are sometimes awkward, painful and difficult moments of change in our journey as a nation -- and are necessarily the righteous work of individuals in every generation.  Go Set a Watchman reminds us that our vigilance and effort as individuals may be unrecognized, but they are indispensable, necessary components of larger changes.  "That's the one thing about here, the South, that you've missed.  You'd be amazed if you knew how many people are on your side, if side's the right word.  You're no special case.  The woods are full of people like you, but we need some more of you."<br/><br/>Set A Watchman says more about racism and culture then and now than people realize.  Perhaps it will be unappreciated for the gem it is because so many people have a television news and/or movie perception of the violent, radical history of social change in America, and the subtleness of Harper Lee's observations are lost to present culture.  To anyone who lived in those times, in those places, what she declares from Atticus and Jean Louise's perspective does not go far enough.  Perhaps readers cannot let go of the exalted morality that has been taught to generations who've read To Kill A Mockingbird to embrace the genuineness of the ambiguity, finesse, personal relationships and, yes, individual risks that are necessary to social change.  Scout witnesses upheaval of bigotry; Jean Louise reminds us that personal relationships, being an example, and persuasion also are necessary to effect change.  Set A Watchman speaks to all of that. Bravo!
Totally disappointed in this book.  I can understand it not being published back before TKAM.  Being from the south, I am pretty sure had it been published back when it was written Harper Lee would not have ever published another book.  The ending is not even believable, to be that angry and nothing happen is a sell out, to say the least and it left me confused.  I feel there was no closure in this book, it just left you in a state of "you've got to kidding me"  and "huh, what"  There are conversations in this book, that could curl hair they are so blatantly racial, it just seems the publishers are taking advantage of current issues going on in this country and are trying to profit from them.  This book should have stayed unpublished.
Okay -- to address the "controversy."  Atticus Finch is indeed portrayed here as racist.  In other words, he is of his time and place, and an imperfect human being.  But it puzzles me that many people seem unable to remember the simple fact that Harper Lee wrote this book FIRST.  This was her original version of Atticus.  Mockingbird is written from the viewpoint of a child, and that makes all the difference.  To Scout, the world is full of magic, the dark is scarier, the daylight is brighter,  good and evil are clearly defined and separated, and her father is her idol and perfect.  But to the 26 yaer-old Jean Lousie (the same age as Harper Lee when she wrote it), the world is no longer that intense, magical place of childhood.  And there's no nostalgia here.  She dives right into the heart of racism, not to mention sexism -- in fact, these horrors are the subject of the book.  And yes it is shocking.  That's the point.  It was intended to be shocking; Lee wanted to rip the cover of convention off all forms of "everyday" prejudice, with which she was raised.  She highlights, with great precision and insight, the fact that anyone who was raised in the south (as well as the majority of people raised in the north) at any period, before or after the civil war,  racism is inescapable.  Think you are free of it?  So does Jean Louise, as portrayed here.  She says that she simply does not "see color."  By the end, we doubt her certainty about that.  She doesn't spare Atticus, and she doesn't spare herself -- because that is the accurate truth about the world that wants to recreate.  She loves these people, and fears some things that are in them, and in herself.  No one is exempt.  Every reader, I would hope, after reading this novel, will then have the courage to turn such an unflinching mirror on themselves -- to "go set a watchman" on their own souls.  That's how real change happens.  And the Civil War has not really ended yet.  So no, it's not as wonderful as Mockingbird.  But once we leave childhood, few things are.  (So: four stars only in comparison to Mockingbird, which is just about a perfect novel.  As Lee herself always knew, no book could ever succeed as that one did. But I was so glad to read it, and learned a great deal.  She is a one of a kind writer, and her language truly sings, in both books.)
To Kill a Mockingbird taught us one thing: even though hatred will follow us, everywhere, until the books of history run red—the tide can be turned back by simple goodness. Those are the two forces at work in the world.<br/><br/>But Go Set a Watchman teaches us there is still yet a third force, the immortal Mammon, still alive to devour our dollars. Perhaps that is not HarperCollins’ motivation; perhaps theirs is something altogether higher. But as a friend noted, there is a great deal of money to be made from this release.<br/><br/>Now before I go further, take note that this isn’t quite a review of Go Set a Watchman. This is a review of how misrepresented the novel is, and how marketing and/or the public deliberately seems to be playing up the controversial aspects—and the lie that this is a “sequel”—in the name of the buyer’s dollar. The novel is functional, but it’s also utterly pedestrian, and filled with unfocused or poor descriptions. The novel itself is the definition of one-star to two-stars. Were this marketed as what it is, the rejected first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, it would deserve more stars, as an artifact that was built into a great novel; but there are more forces at work, forces which misrepresent this novel.<br/><br/>Let this review be a flickering candle in the wilderness, telling you exactly what this book is.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is the first submitted draft of what would become, eventually, To Kill a Mockingbird. When the Lippincott editor Therese von Hohoff Torrey first saw Watchman, in far off 1957, she felt it was “more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” [1] It took a number of years—and a number of drafts—to rework the novel. As she wrote, “After a couple of false starts, the story-line, interplay of characters, and fall of emphasis grew clearer, and with each revision—there were many minor changes as the story grew in strength and in her own vision of it—the true stature of the novel became evident.” [1]<br/><br/>From these few lines, it is obvious that Go Set a Watchman is nothing more than an early draft of To Kill a Mockingbird. It may be the first submitted draft, or it may be one of the very early drafts which von Hohoff Torrey mentions. Should this be published? Certainly. It’s a rare opportunity to see behind the stage, and see the earliest form of one of the most famous, and one of the most beloved, novels of all time. Academia should be swooning; writers should be salivating, ready to learn the secrets of how to turn a “false start” into a novel famous across the world.<br/><br/>But a first draft—a lightly copyedited draft no less—would attract little attention. The two groups above are all that would buy it. The madwomen of the ivory tower, and the madmen of the written word. Regular people would have no use for it, and would keep exclusively to To Kill a Mockingbird. Which is a shame, a businessman would think, because the world would fight hand-over-fist to read a sequel to Mockingbird…<br/><br/>Let us turn to the back-of-the-book description. Does it clearly communicate that this is nothing more than a rejected draft? Does it over-step the bounds of truth, whispering the word “sequel”?<br/><br/>It does neither. It finds an uncomfortable middle-ground that alludes to both. It has a truthful start, affirming, “Originally written in the mid-1950s, Go Set a Watchman was the novel Harper Lee first submitted to her publishers before To Kill a Mockingbird. Assumed to have been lost, the manuscript was discovered in late 2014.” All of that is true, all of that is worth knowing, and yet, at the end. . .<br/><br/>“Exploring how the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird are adjusting to the turbulent events transforming mid-1950s America, Go Set a Watchman casts a fascinating new light. . .” It is not, strictly speaking, a lie. But what is the obvious reading? That this is a full-blooded sequel, and everything contained in it is canon. Never mind that this is a book of discarded, early characterizations; never mind that the backstory doesn’t at all match the events of To Kill a Mockingbird; never mind each and every difference that marks this off so thoroughly from Mockingbird’s world. They are not different characters sharing names, they are characters in “adjustment”; it is not a world which was developed differently, no, it is a world shown in “new light.” It’s a disgusting degree of dishonesty, even if it’s never quite a lie.<br/><br/>If one were to insist, “Oh, that’s well and clear, no-one is confused…” Well, I hate to break it to you, but a simple Google search of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “Sequel” returns more than 2,300,00 hits. People are seeing this as a sequel, and the one, true future of Mockingbird. Considering what Watchmen makes of Atticus, perhaps the early reviewers (the Wall Street Journal, for one) are right about this novel destroying the legacy of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Only time will tell.<br/><br/>RECAP:<br/>A) Go Set a Watchman is not a sequel. It is the rejected first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird<br/>B) Lee Harper’s editor, Therese von Hohoff Torrey, considered Watchman the inchoate “false start” from which the “true stature” of Mockingbird grew. She did not consider it a sequel; she did not even consider it a stand-alone novel. It’s only an abandoned draft in dire need of growth.<br/>C) Go Set a Watchman should have been published as such, and advertised honestly, much like early drafts of Jane Austen, Lewis Carroll, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.<br/>D) For unknown motives all their own, HarperCollins has chosen to publish Go Set a Watchman as a sequel, if only by association. Thanks to the controversy of a bigoted Atticus and a dead Jem—to say nothing of the simple draw of the word “sequel” that so many people brandy about—the novel is already breaking pre-order records.[2]<br/>E) Publishing an early draft in such a way the public thinks it’s a sequel is misleading to readers, and a business practice that I refuse to support. Worryingly, it may permanently damage the reputation of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: It's only worth reading if you're preparing a dissertation on To Kill a Mockingbird, or an author looking to learn the secrets of great writing. Collectors of literary curiosities might be interested in taking this from the library. No-one else should bother.<br/><br/>[1] Quoted in many places, but most readily available in “The Invisible Hand Behind Harper Lee’s ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’” (The New York Times).<br/>[2] “Harper Lee’s New Book Breaks HarperCollins’ Preorder Record” (Newsweek)
It is very, very obvious that GO SET A WATCHMAN is neither prequel nor sequel to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  It is clearly an earlier version of MOCKINGBIRD, a version of which Harper Lee, her advisers, and her publishers thought better and did not print.<br/><br/>Harper Lee (b. 1926) published TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in 1960.  The novel was an instant success and quickly regarded as a modern classic.  Lee, however, found that she greatly disliked the personal celebrity that went with the book’s success, and within a few years ended all contact with the press.  She occasionally told friends that she was working on another project, but she also told friends that she would never write another novel because, after the success of MOCKINGBIRD, she had “nowhere to go but down.”  As time passed she became increasing reclusive and eventually withdrew to her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, her interests protected by her attorney sister.  It was not until after her sister’s death, with Lee an octogenarian recovering from a stroke in a nursing home, that GO SET A WATCHMAN became available—pulled from Lee’s personal archives by new representatives more interested in making a buck than in protecting Lee’s literary reputation.<br/><br/>WATCHMAN is set in the 1950s.  Jean Louise “Scout” Finch is a young woman residing in New York who returns to her Alabama hometown once a year to visit her father Atticus, her aunt Alexandria, and her suitor Hank.  (Her brother Jem has died some years earlier.)  On this occasion, she is shocked to discover Atticus and Hank are involved in the segregationist movement—and in a legal case in which they plan to defend a drunk black man who accidentally ran over and killed an equally drunk white man, primarily in order to avoid the black man from being defended by the NAACP.  Jean Louise is horrified by their racism and their hypocrisy, which she also finds pervasive throughout the town.<br/><br/>Some of the novel is told in Harper Lee’s voice, but some of it seems alien, and I wouldn’t be surprised to learn that the book has been augmented by other hands.  It also possesses a preachy quality—characters often address each other as if they were lecturing—and overall it has an uneven, rough, and abrupt quality, filled with superfluous episodes that have nothing to do with the story or the nebulous point it is trying to make.  It possesses islands of greatness, but they are few and far between and in a very choppy sea.<br/><br/>Lee ripped characters and events and even descriptive passages from WATCHMAN (her descriptions of Aunt Alexandra and the Missionary Tea are the most obvious) to create MOCKINGBIRD, but there is no question as to which is the more memorable book.  Had WATCHMAN been published instead of MOCKINGBIRD, Harper Lee would be a forgotten footnote in American literature.  So, is WATCHMAN worth reading?  Yes, but only if you are interested in comparing it to MOCKINGBIRD.  It has passages that foreshadow the greatness of MOCKINGBIRD, but it is in and of itself embarrassingly trivial, and I find it hard to believe that Harper Lee knowingly and willingly allowed its publication.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer
Like a stab to the heart!  I was overwhelmed with a feeling of deep depression on finishing the book, which I had trouble doing.  I was tempted to just put it down and not finish it, but I kept giving it the benefit of the doubt, thinking that the author would redeem herself by the end of the book.<br/><br/>I could not believe this book when I finished it.  I was so stunned and upset that I could not speak.  I got the book a day earlier than expected and read it in one sitting; not because it was so good but because it was so bad.  Also, it is very short, published with lots of blank pages, large print and probably is not really more than 200 pages although the publishers have pushed it to 300.  I was tempted to stop reading it and just toss it, but I kept hoping that something would change.  The author would come to her senses...or somebody would.  I could not believe what I was reading, what the arguments were, who was agreeing with what.  The characters had absolutely nothing in common with the characters of 'mockingbird' --- who created this bunch?  the writing style ... I kept hoping that something would be redeemable.<br/><br/>Maybe even on the last page.  I don't want to include a lot of spoilers here, but the important thing I came away with is this:  I don't believe this book was written by the same person who wrote 'mockingbird.'  Not just for moral reasons (which there are plenty of) but because of the style.  The writing is hackneyed, amateurish, dull, flat, and droning.  It reads like a lecture from a southern racist who wants and needs to defend his/her way of thinking.  It's from the pulpit of a right-wing klan leader who needs to convince us that those people of color are less in all ways than those of 'white' people.  I cannot believe that this is what Lee meant us to take away from her writings.  It is my (what may be perceived to be paranoid) opinion that editors/agents etc., got hold of some remnants of what she wrote before 'mockingbird' and turned it into 'watchman.'  if there was ever anything that could undermine the beauty and sensitivity of 'mockingbird' it is accepting that this book precluded it and that 'mockingbird' came from it.  This is not the soul that 'mockingbird' came from.
I read several of these reviews before my copy arrived in the mail. Regarding some of the negative comments:  I don’t think some reviewers are aware of the background of this manuscript when commenting on the sentence style, difference from events in To Kill a Mockingbird, and lack of editing.  And as others have said this is not a sequel; it was a first draft that evolved into a beloved classic with much editorial assistance.  Thank God someone saw the possibilities in this manuscript and worked on its evolution.<br/><br/>Three previous reviews (“Power of a good editor,” “Unbearable disappointed,” and “Wish I hadn’t read it”) sum up most of what I would say so I won’t repeat. The Atticus portrayed in TKAM is very advanced in his thinking for the 1930s. I am sure much of him is based on Ms. Lee’s own father. Was he like the Atticus in this draft or TKAM?<br/><br/>I grew up in the Jim Crow South and lived through the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  I can see where those born without seeing the discrimination rampant then are upset with Atticus, but I knew many people (even educated ones) like him.  Keep in mind that this was written before the push for racial equality. Though there is mention of the 1954 school desegregation decision, this manuscript preceded the Montgomery bus boycott, marches for voting rights, Freedom Riders, and assassinations of Black activists.<br/><br/>I heartily agree that the writing is not first rate and not nearly up to TKAM.  I taught composition for over thirty years and know how a first draft can improve with each re-write. No editor worked to improve GSAW. The last section is very awkward and I rushed through it waiting for the point which never came.<br/><br/>I am reminded of another one-book author, Margaret Mitchell.  In the 1980s, the family commissioned a sequel to GONE WITH THE WIND.  The result, SCARLETT, was clumsy, unbelievable, and most disappointing; and no one remembers it today. That will be fate of GSAW also, but Harper Lee’s classic will endure.
If elderly abuse is found in publishing, 'Watchman' is the example that will set the mark. This is the raw first draft of a book that should never have seen the light of day.<br/>The Pulitzer should go to the editor who saw the potential in Harper Lee's writing (not an original observation) but what the readers will want to know is the economics: who profits from this tragic publication which destroys Harper Lee's reputation as will as the readers' love of 'Mockingbird', Scout and Atticus.<br/>I grew up in the South, in a town called McComb, Mississippi (very like Maycomb..). Long before my family took a stand in the Civil Rights movement  my father who had his own insurance business refused to join the Citizens Council. He called it 'the KuKlux Klan with cufflinks' and turned down the local lawyers and bankers  pressuring him to join. He refused and I suspect Mr Lee would have also. When my father tried to get our town's white clergymen to denounce the bombings of black churches and invited visiting clergymen from the 'North'  to our home for dinner, our days in the town were numbered.<br/> I know the world where 'Watchman' is set. It never comes alive in this book and despite many testimonials that she agreed to have it published, I don't believe it for a minute. If ever there was a case for a forensic investigation of who benefits financially from the publication, this is it. Knowing the answer won't undo the damage done to millions of readers and a writer who kept a dignified silence for fifty years.
This is clearly what all parties reported it to be, a first draft.  The writing is uneven.  At times, the tone was pitch perfect and at others, it was jarring.  It does not detract from To Kill a Mockingbird for me because it bears little resemblance to the prize-winning novel.  Jem is dead, Dill is gone.  the character of Atticus is vague and almost non-existant in his interactions with Scout.  My favorite character in Watchman is Uncle James who has a discussion with Scout that is eerily reminiscent of one heard in my political discussion group last week in reference to the Confederate flag.  I didn't find Atticus to be the bigot the news reported he would be.  He expressed racial views that were common to almost all white men of his age in the 1950's, but his behavior toward black people was non-discriminatory.  Just why Scout escaped all the prejudice of those around her was not explored.
Terrible book. I can see why it was rejected in the first place.
Though I didn’t think so when I started, I soon became convinced that Harper Lee would never have consciously sanctioned this publication to appear while she was still living. One of the things that convinced me were the sections, such as the one describing her aunt, that are direct repeats of portions of the author’s second book, To Kill a Mockingbird. Any good writer, or editor, would have made changes so such repeats would not have been apparent. This shows me that Watchman was a work in progress and was never meant for publication in its current state.<br/><br/>Harper Lee wrote Watchman as a diatribe against racism in the South. I believe that the publisher of the day, in the late 1950s, knew that the book was a too realistic, and rough, look at racism. Society, for good or bad reasons, would not be able to look in the mirror that Harper Lee was holding for them at that time. Whatever the publisher said to the author, she went and created Mockingbird, a gem of a book, which tells a story of racism but in a more palatable way. Yes, there is racism, but it is other people. And the white man saves the day, like any good hero in America. Mockingbird is as close to perfection as a writer could get. Why bother to write another?<br/><br/>Watchman should have been spared its present publication and only shown to people after Harper Lee’s death. Then it would have been available for literary scholars, allowing for many a doctoral dissertation on how a great author works, of how Harper Lee evolved Watchman, the tale of a woman realizing her own conscience, into Mockingbird, a child’s first hazy glimpse of the reality of life. Watchman should never have been presented as something the author agreed to produce since obviously it is a rough draft, put aside for good reasons. My apologies to Harper Lee for buying into the hype and purchasing a work that was not intended for publication.<br/><br/>Note: One bookstore had the right idea and will reimburse their customers who purchased Watchman and would like a refund.

I am not sure if I've been driving down a rough gravel road with giant potholes in a car with steel tires or ridden every carnival ride in the country that makes you dizzy beyond getting sick.  I had high hopes for this book, but am extremely disappointed.  Go Set a Watchman rambles not only uncomfortably but aimlessly from paragraph to paragraph.  The book reads as confusing as the ladies' conversation in chapter 13.<br/><br/>The book is a confusing read.  The narrative changes often and confusingly.  It is riddled with, often, pointless repetitive flashbacks.  Some were almost word for word excerpts from "To Kill a Mockingbird". I was often lulled to boredom waiting for the chapter to end.  Then, when it did end, you discover that some chapters are actual parts of the book.  Finishing a single chapter also finished a part of a book.  It made you think a chapter disappeared or vanished into thin air.  That only made you feel that the book was nothing but a collection of thoughts strewn together in some random order by a person suffering from vertigo.<br/><br/>It is difficult to read the book and see that the behavior and attitudes of the characters were not in congruous with “To Kill a Mockingbird”.  One can only assume that Harper Lee appears to attempt to describe the behavioral shift on race relations.  But, as a reader, it is a disappointment and mystery as to how this would occur.  Again, that could very well be the message being delivered with the book.<br/>Since the tone of the book is 180 degrees from "To Kill a Mockingbird", it makes the book even more difficult to read.  I don't fault the message being delivered.  However, I do fault the manner in which the book was written.  Had "To Kill a Mockingbird" not been published, I can't see how this book would survive publisher review on its own merit and ever be published on its own accord.  The book just wanders in and out of flashbacks, conversations, reflections with very little understandable forward direction that you just want to stop the ride and keep your head from spinning.<br/><br/>One theme of the book that is quite obvious is the juxtaposition of the awareness of your understanding of the world and how you perceive it as a child, then as an adult.  That juxtaposition is shoved in your face with an over-abundance of the use of offensive language and attitudes.  While I will not argue that they existed then, and still do now, I will argue that Lee over-used that convention in this book.  I do not think it was necessary to deliver that theme in this book, nor do I believe it does to illustrate any point.  As such, I do not think this is a book that would be acceptable reading material in public schools.<br/><br/>The other obvious theme of the book is the disgusting, disturbing, ugly, and unacceptable attitude of racism and mob mentality.  Lee goes deep into several bottomless caverns of this theme with the repeated use of offensive language and attitudes.  Again, while I will not argue of the existence of this in the past and currently, I don't think the manner in which it was written and presented bade well for the book.  I already have a vulgar taste and opinion for such behavior, I don't need to have that same disgust for a book that is already poorly written.  That just further fuels the disappointment with Harper Lee and the hopes of "Go Set a Watchman" as "To Kill a Mockingbird" is still one of my favorites.
Honestly, this book isn't very good.<br/><br/>As we all know, Harper Lee wrote this novel first, and she had no idea that Mockingbird was still to come.  I approached it with the same mindset.  I see it as an independent work, not as a sequel, not as revisiting old beloved characters.<br/><br/>Writers are always told, "Show, don't tell."  This, for me, was the biggest flaw of the book.  Too much exposition, not enough showing.<br/><br/>I felt like I didn't know anything about the characters and therefore could not sympathize with them.  The first part of the book, I kept thinking, "What does Jean Louise see in Henry?  What does he see in her?  Who are these people?"  He's described as her boyfriend, but we don't really see anything about who they are or what the attraction is, we're just told that this is their relationship.  Similarly, I had no feelings when Jean Louise makes her big discovery about her father and Henry.  If we had previously been shown how much Jean Louise had revered her father during her childhood, I might have shared some of her shock and disappointment, but it just felt like a stranger telling me about an unpleasant experience.<br/><br/>Some reviewers here have called the novel thought-provoking.  I respectfully disagree.  I will say that when this book was written, some of the themes were surely considered forward-thinking and daring, and I give Lee credit for that.  However, in today's climate, none of these ideas are new, we've heard them all before.  That's not to say that racism has been eradicated in our society and is now irrelevant, far from it.  But I am saying that I don't feel Lee has added anything new to the conversation, which is not surprising when you remember that this book was written over half a century ago.<br/><br/>To sum up, I found "Go Set a Watchman" dull as dishwater and had to force myself to finish it.  It was just going on and on about characters I didn't care about.  A tedious and uninspired coming of age story.  I can't believe all the 5 star reviews here.  I can only think that people were influenced by the Harper Lee name.  And I'm not bad mouthing Harper Lee.  I still love "To Kill a Mockingbird."  But Watchman was an early work and clearly not an example of the greatness she was capable of.
Do not buy this book. It was unpublished for a reason. Rough drafts should stay rough drafts. It looks to me like it was unedited and that there was no plot. The only good parts were the flashbacks, which is how I assume TKAMB came to be. This book seems like it was written by a racist child.
I find it difficult to believe that the same person wrote each of these books.  Watchman seems so contrived and poorly written.  It would be amazing that Harper Lee could become such an eloquent author with Mockingbird.  I am not even going to address the complete change in Atticus' personality.  Am sticking to the actual writing.  Watchmen is boring, poorly written, and I assume was "discovered" to fatten the picked of the publishers.  I almost quit reading after a ridiculous conversation between Scout and Uncle Jack.  Jean Louise has lost the charm that made her one of my favorite characters ever.  This novel is a complete waste of time and money.
Big disappointment and I think the publishers should be ashamed of their money grab.  Harper Lee obviously got it right the second time around in TKAM but this likely first attempt should have been left in the vault and not pushed as a 5 star book.  Scout's anger seems contrived, the Uncle's odd rantings obscure and difficult to interpret, Hank is just a cardboard cutout, and Atticus is barely a presence except as a foil for Jean Louise.  The issues are real and still relevant but this book falls far short as a meaningful interpretation. Very surprised at all the glowing reviews ... really?  Seems like a case of the Emperor's new clothes to me.  Still a big fan of TKAM but if this book had been written by anyone else I would have tossed it aside after the first few excruciating chapters.
Where do I begin? This is not an ordinary book. One of America's greatest novelists chose to only publish one book, "To Kill a Mockingbird." No one knew why and we all wanted more. Wasn't gonna happen. But it did. Here is that book we wanted. Or not.<br/><br/>Then there was the yet unsatisfying suspicion that the brilliant Harper Lee may not have approved publication of, "Go Set a Watchman." Or she approved it, but not fully aware. Legally, it has been cleared, and so whatever the motivations and manipulations existed or didn't exist, all of which is acceptible by law. Either way, the book is here.<br/><br/>I have one of the two million first copies. Many more will no doubt will be printed. After the initial buzz dies down, we will find out if this will be the classic "To Kill a Mockingbird" is.<br/><br/>Lee's writing is similarly toned as her other book. It has the same feel but misses the urgency. Occasionally, Lee draws us in casually, but poetically, as when describing Maycomb:<br/><br/>"New people rarely went there to live. The same families married the same families until relationships were hopeless entangled and the members of the community looked monotonously alike."<br/><br/>There's so much said in those few words. She describes then small-town Alabama in the 1950s, but it could be small-town Iowa or Massachusetts in the 2010s.<br/><br/>Other times, as during a major trial, a tighter edit would serve well.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" precedes "To Kill a Mockingbird" in its writing, but its plotline takes us years later. It has been 20 years, and Scout, now an adult, is off to visit Atticus, her dad. She discovers her dad isn't the hero she thought.<br/><br/>"To Kill a Mockingbird," as I've reviewed, is a love story between Scout and her father as she admired his heroics and love for all.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" is like that, but Atticus is more complex than the Atticus she, and we, thought we knew.<br/><br/>How so? Take a look at this from chapter 12:<br/><br/>  Atticus turned to her. "Scout, you probably don't know it, but the NAACP-paid lawyers are standing around like buzzards down here waiting for things like this to happen.----"<br/>  "You mean colored lawyers?"<br/>  Atticus nodded...<br/><br/>It goes on to examine the state of "Negroes" in the legal world.<br/><br/>Atticus tries to educate Scout who is less naive than he thinks. Mind you, he's no Archie Bunker. He's fairer-minded that that, but he's no Meathead either.<br/><br/>We also learn about Jem, Calpurnia, and others from "Mockingbird," but this is all about Scout and Atticus, who they were, who they thought each other was, and who they are discovering the other really is. It is extremely honest.<br/><br/>Like "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Go Set a Watchman" is forcing discussions of racial conflict, racism, and the context of real life "Go Set a Watchman." While "To Kill a Mockingbird" came out in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. In fact, it can be argued it was part of move forward.<br/><br/>This isn't "Mockingbird." Don't be fooled. Lee created a legendary book there. This is just very, very good. I give it five stars because of how it matters in continuing the national racial dialogue.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" was written then but remains relevant now. Racism is racism and people aren't simple good and bad cartoons. Not one of us is pure minded. Not Atticus, not Scout, not Harper Lee and not this reviewer.<br/><br/>I fully recommend "Go Set a Watchman" by Harper Lee. Once again, she has changed the landscape of modern American literature. May she change the hearts of we humans as well.<br/><br/>Anthony Trendl<br/>AmericanSpeechwriter.com
This doesn't belong on any true reader's bookshelf unless they bought this as a novelty item.  If Harper Lee had intended for this book to have been published then it would have years ago, decades ago.  Whoever found this manuscript wherever they found it needed to have left it there.  Instead seeing money in their eyes and a shot at fame some people have set in motion having this travesty released.<br/><br/>The same thing is happening now with Harper Lee that happened with Mark Felt when his family decided against his wishes to reveal him as Deep Throat right before his death.  Both of these people were in their very elder years, being exposed & trotted out one last time for the advantages of others that have never had fame or acclaim.  Again, had Mark Felt wanted to reveal himself as Deep Throat he would have done so far before the point he was pushed literally out the front door by his family when he was past the point of being able to say no to them.  Same thing here with Ms. Lee.<br/><br/>This manuscript she kept buried may have some semblance to the characters and town she wrote far more eloquently and gracefully later on in "To Kill A Mockingbird."  But the semblance is the same as the bunny that appears in Looney Toons before Bugs Bunny made his debut.  Just because there are similarities that is far more due to the author's evolving talents than due to any intent or significance.<br/><br/>People are throwing themselves into a fit that Gem has died and Atticus is now a racist.  Neither is true.  Don't try to reconcile any of it.  Don't try to offer up any fan fiction theories.  This is nothing more than a manuscript that Harper Lee herself fought against having released and then nefarious deeds were done for the book to be published.  Remember, this is only a money grab if people keep throwing money at it.  Do you truly love both literature & honoring the true intent of authors?  Then do what is right & honest, don't reward those that have been dishonest & wrong.
I just finished reading Go Set A Watchman…..and yes….I like it.  Do I like it as much as I love To Kill A Mockingbird? No.  Am I disappointed in the book?  No.  Do I think everyone will adore it - and lovingly set it beside their dog-eared copy of TKAMB? No.  Will some people hate it?  Probably.  Do I think you should read it? Yes…and I will tell you why.  Go Set A Watchman is narrated by a grown-up, slightly jaded Jean Louise Finch who still worships at the altar of her daddy.  She returns home, 20 years after the events depicted in TKAMB, and finds out things have changed.  The most striking thing she discovers is her father is not nearly as perfect as she believed.  She rebels - as so many of us do when we find out the people around us are not exactly the way we thought they were.  Not as pure, as honest, and more importantly, not even as bad as we imagine.  This revelation comes to many of us….but not until we are able to embrace the fact that we, individually, are not exactly what we present to the public either. Once this bit of truth is reconciled - we are able to move on, accept what we are able, and try to change what we can.<br/><br/>Atticus Finch will always be the father I wished I had.  I physically envied Scout because even though she lacked a mother - she had world’s best father on her side.  In GSAW - we see Atticus has some flaws that a six year old father worshipper would not have seen, nor understood.  After reading the new novel, do I still think Atticus was basically a good man?  Yes.  Will all of you agree? No.  In the current climate in the US - I have already seen him referred to a racist and a bigot.  According to critics, Atticus “supports” Jim Crow laws.  People fear that Harper Lee’s “legacy” will be destroyed by this novel.  What is my reaction to that?  Get a life!  Atticus Finch was, and always has been black ink on white paper.  He never breathed the air, or fathered a real child, or defended a young black father from despicable accusations of rape and assault on a young, white woman.  My suggestion to you, is if you will be offended by this book because Atticus - in the early 1950’s - was trying to process his thoughts about a Supreme Court decision that, in the character’s words, destroyed the 10th Amendment of the American Constitution, then don’t read the book.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you wish to read a book by a beloved, and very gifted author who has presented a time capsule of how the USA was beginning to evolve as it made infant steps toward granting rights and equality to blacks - read it.  I remember the early civil rights movement - the fire hoses, the police dogs, the marches, and the chaos that ensued….and so did Harper Lee.  It was a violent, ugly time in America.  One of the characters in the book likened the coming civil rights movement to giving birth; bloody, painful, and necessary if you wished to create new life and new standards in the nation. That is a metaphor that will stick with me.<br/><br/>As I read the book, I understood the controversy of whether Lee REALLY wanted this book released.  I actually saw “reviews” where the writers stated they would NOT be reading the book because they thought Lee had been coerced into publishing it by a greedy agent. I have no idea if that is true or not…and since it has been published and distributed - I believe this is a moot point anyway. I knew originally her editor and advisor read it, informed her the story presented from a six year old child’s perspective would be more engaging, more enduring, and more likely to attract readers.  Harper Lee went home and completely revised the book into the gem we know as To Kill A Mockingbird.  The new novel is still written by a writer who artfully creates a narrative that is beautiful and agonizing at the same time.<br/><br/>Go Set A Watchman is much darker in many ways.  It is NOT a child’s story, or a child’s perspective.  Jean Louise Finch - at age 26 - is taking the great leap that will allow her to be her own person - and not just a tiny voice waiting for her father’s direction, and fearing his disappointment.  Do I miss the fact that unlike the reviews I read, I did NOT find many of the old characters in the novel? Yes, of course.  I wanted to meet my old friends Jem, Dill, Boo, and the widow neighbor across the street from the Finch family. I wanted a “they all lived happily ever after” ending. I wanted a book that had as many subplots as I found in TKAMB.  Wanting this, but not finding these things does not deter me from liking the book.  It’s different than I imagined, but how can I not enjoy a tightly written, well-crafted story?<br/><br/>In the new novel, there is a lovely quote by Jean Louise Finch, where she speaks of Maycomb, and says, “If you did not want much, there was plenty.”  I love that line….it reminds me to be thoughtful about my expectations, to value what I have, and to avoid rushing too quickly through life….and thus miss out on the joy and beauty around me.  Read the book, and savor what you like, consider the lessons both Scout and the reader receive from many of the characters, including Atticus, and take away from it what you will.
I read Go Set a Watchman both despite and as a result of all of the controversy surrounding the release of the book. Because of that I'm not sorry I did. But, had I read it with baited breath expecting more of To Kill a Mockingbird, I’m certain I'd have been very heartbroken.<br/>I read To Kill a Mockingbird years ago and loved it. I didn't see it as a book only about racism but more as a book about justice. I thought the book was beautifully written and a thoughtfully arranged masterpiece. It was engaging as were all of the characters. Atticus Finch was portrayed as the best of men, the person we should all look for in ourselves. It's a story and it's a fine one.<br/>I didn't feel the same reading Go Set a Watchman. As a writer myself it happened that I'd heard many stories of what publishers knew of the history behind the writing of To Kill a Mockingbird. I'd heard about what Harper Lee’s contributions were to the book and the many others who built the beautiful novel that To Kill a Mockingbird came to be. Go Set a Watchman is, in my opinion, if indeed it is the original draft, what should have been put away and left that way.<br/>Yet somewhere along the line the decision was made to publish this work. A piece that I think was arranged and compiled and written by no one who was involved in the original novel. There have been over a million copies sold and I think that's a testament to how well-loved To Kill a Mockingbird really is. I'll always hold To Kill a Mockingbird in my heart as a work of art and this book as simply a way for someone to make a large amount of money on the legend of it and that's all. I bought it, as many people have and I'm not sorry. I learned from reading it and I like to think of having put my money down as paying homage to Atticus Finch and little Jean Louise, they earned it.
My 1st Edition arrived today with the pages all hacked up like they were cut with a dull blade. Uneven, and tattered, with a nice gash in the upper left hand corner of the book and cover. It is clearly a book hastily pumped out to create PROFIT with no respect for the book itself. I know now that deckle edge is printed to make new books look old. And who among us for a minute would think this is an old book? We all know it was printed this year. Bottom line, these jagged pages don't show dirt as easily and make re-selling returns easier for Amazon. We should have been at least given a choice. If you are looking for a first edition of a book that you intend to collect or keep in your personal library, do yourself a favor and purchase it from somewhere where you can inspect the quality of the print book before you purchase it. But then again, there may not be any straight-edge copies.  Not impressed here at all Amazon and Harper Collins for putting out sub-par merchandise in such a highly anticipated novel. Three stars for the actual physical book, not the story within which I have yet to read.
Spoiler Alert ----<br/>  As much as I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird", that is how much I hated "Go Set a Watchman".  Do we really need one more alibi, one more lie, one more voice, to explain why Southerners kept the Blacks down for years and years?  "They can't vote, they are just like children."  "They will all vote in a block."  (As if we whites didn't do that for years.)  "We have to take care of them because they aren't capable of it themselves."  I've heard all of those excuses and lies for over 60 years.  Separate but equal schools and opportunities was a lie.  So in "Go Set a Watchman" we have Harper Lee in the voice of Scout being the outraged Northerner (she now lives in New York - we don't get told why) and through the voices of Atticus and her boyfriend, Hank, we hear the Old Southern rhetoric trying to convincing her (and us) that they are not racists, they just know what is best for the Negroes.  Not racists even though they attend white-only "citizens committee" meetings to hear rabble rousing and discussions, in the most vile terms, about the Negros living in their community.  Stating the KKK is okay.  All they do is embarrass themselves by wearing bed sheets.  It  seems as though Hank just goes along to get along because even though he is a wonderful, hardworking person, the people in town think he is still trash because he didn't come from an established family of any "name".  ("Love whom you will, marry your own kind" Scout remembers hearing.)  When Jean Louise finally confronts her father his reply is meek and the excuse is, "Negroes down here are still in their childhood as a people" that's why they shouldn't vote.  He tells her (and us) that the South knows best how to deal with all its people, including the Negros.  (All evidence to the contrary!)  They don't need the Feds to interfere in their treatment of Negros with such things as the Constitution!  Her Uncle Jack only has to have a confrontation with her and give her whiskey and in 20 minutes she is convinced and accepts her father for who he is because he is only human.  All is forgiven.  What?<br/>  In my opinion, here we have an author and/or a publisher who want to make more money badly enough to put clay feet on a heroic icon of American Literature.  The whole idea that Atticus held these beliefs in "To Kill a Mockingbird" is extremely hard to believe and impossible to swallow.  It is a slap in the face to Atticus' character and a slap in the face to us, the readers.  I felt as though I were reading a story about different people who just happened to have the same names.  Why didn't Lee let Atticus be the beacon of what is right and fair and decent?  Why isn't Atticus leading the charge?  Why isn't he in league with Scout to fight to make a difference in their community?  Opportunity lost, Ms. Lee!  Do yourself a huge favor.  If you loved "To Kill a Mockingbird" don't spoil it by reading "Go Set a Watchman."  I'm sorry I did!  If you want to read a really great book, read or reread "To Kill a Mockingbird".  And if you must read "Watchman", don't buy a copy, go to your library and get it.  It is not a book you will want to read again.
I was concerned about the suspicion expressed by some commenters that Harper Lee did not write TKAMB because Go Set A Watchman is so poorly written and structured.  Perhaps some facts might clarify the situation.<br/><br/>Go Set was not a finished novel; it was a first draft that Harper Lee submitted to her esteemed editor, Tay Hohoff.  After reading the draft, he told Ms. Lee that the real story and novel lay in the flashbacks to Scout as a young girl. So Ms. Lee set her first draft aside and began to write TKAMB.  Over the next few years, she wrote the classic, guided by the steady and experienced hand of Mr. Hohoff.  In those days, editors, at least the best ones, significantly influenced the final product, and the write-editor relationship was much more collaborative and important, unlike publishing today where profits and speedy finished products reign.<br/><br/>If Ms. Lee had wanted to publish Go Set, she would have done so decades ago when she was younger and much more lucid.  Instead she vowed never to publish another novel.  Now she is in a nursing home, at 89 nearly blind, mostly deaf, and cognitively impaired. I’d wager that Go Set’s publication was a pure money grab by the publisher and members of Ms. Lee’s family.<br/><br/>I read a short excerpt and walked away from the book.  Its publication is a grave insult to Ms. Lee, to her talent, and to the immeasurable impact that TKAM has had on our children and ourselves.
This is NOT a sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird." This is a rough first draft of what would become "Mockingbird" many years later. This collection of character sketches was her first effort at a novel-length story. The potential of Lee to write something better was spotted in this draft by an editor with a good eye for talent. But "Go Set a Watchman" was rejected, as it was written, because of its lack of focus, structure, and narrative arc.<br/>  If you do read "Watchman," read it side-by-side with "To Kill a Mockingbird," as well as "Mockingbird" (by Charles J. Shields), the biography of Nelle Harper Lee and her famous book. Together, the three books become a writer's lesson in the value of perseverance, the revision process, and the importance of a great editor. But don't read "Watchman" as a completed novel or the sequel to anything, because it is not.<br/>  This book was published and marketed in a dishonest way, taking advantage of Lee's diminishing health and her misplaced trust in her attorney, who has complete control over her affairs. It would be a shame if it lived on in future generations as the next book Nelle Harper Lee wrote after the success of her Pulitzer Prize-winning masterpiece.
I won't attempt to sum up why this book is so dreadful as many reviewers have already done so quite eloquently.  I whole-heartedly agree with their assessments.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a favorite of mine, so I was extremely excited to read this.  It is awful.  Simply awful.  The characters are flat and unlikeable, particularly adult Scout, and the plot is boring and soap-boxy.  It's very clear as to why this was rejected until it was re-worked into TKAM.  I couldn't even finish it.  I found myself groaning and forcing myself to read, before deciding that life is too short for terrible books.  I wasn't going to punish myself simply because it was written by Harper Lee.  You won't be missing anything if you skip this book.  Very disappointing.
Remember when you saw the black and white still of Gone with the Wind, found Vivien Leigh dazzling in her monochrome, and then watched the remastered, coloured version and found Vivien still beautiful, but not as porcelain as the black and white? Well, that's what this book is. If Mockingbird is Atticus Finch in monochrome, this is on colour high-def. That means you're going to see his pores and realise that he's actually an organic being.<br/><br/>I've read through a few of the top reviews, and while I do agree with most of them, I feel that they've at times glossed over a few themes that I find are important. To begin with, I am a foreigner living in the US, and while I've had my share of The Amendments and Brown v Board of Education, I never really grew up with any "American" psyche that permeates the air every fourth of July. I am the proverbial "Englishman living in New York" so to speak.<br/><br/>I first read "To Kill a Mockingbird" when I was fifteen, smack in the middle of my high school debating career (which went pretty far). Yet a child, I was not exactly struck by it, and it passed by in a humdrum of other forms of media that I was exposed to. I wasn't exactly an avid Harry Potter reader but I was hooked on Graham Greene, so Mockingbird was about as stale as a day-old biscuit. I came back to it ten years later, now (relatively) more adult, and hopefully, more worldly. I was then struck by the profundity of its message, the bildungsroman of a six year old child, the eye-opener that the world wasn't all good and justice wasn't always served, that people were easily corruptible and it is extremely difficult - sometimes even close to impossible - to stand up for your beliefs. How many of us would cry out against class bullying? I have, and it's not a pleasant experience. What happened to Tom Robinson and his fate is a grander case of a class bullying in my opinion that starts from something that is so undeserving. But we all know the end.<br/><br/>Yet little Scout had not had the hard, cold truth yet; that there IS no justice in the world except what you yourself would give. Great men fall, heroes turn villains, and in the end, you are the only moral compass to guide yourself with, and at the end of the day, it is YOUR conscience that you must deal with, for whatever you have done; some find it easy to muffle the voice, some apparently do not hear it at all. Her world was still wrapped in a bubble, warm and fuzzy beneath a blanket called Atticus (and probably a bedsheet called Jem). Atticus is always right; he is always just; he is always good, and he is a moral compass that she can rely on. Even if the world seems hopelessly evil, there is always Atticus. And haven't we done the same? Haven't so many lawyers gone on their careers believing that there might be just ONE Atticus in court?<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is another bildungsroman for Scout, now called Jean Louise. She is grown-up now, about the same age as me, and perhaps, about as mature as me. She has gone through high school education in the US (as I have), had rebelled against social conformities (as I have, but don't all teenagers do that?). And after living in New York, she has preserved Maycomb in amber, along with Atticus, along with her beau, along with Ms Maudie (who never made an appearance... fancy that. She sort of served as a moral dictionary for little Scout back then). Maycomb still serves cold lemonade in her mind, has Miss Rachel calling after Dill, there is her father in her office giving her a nickel. In short, she hasn't quite grown up from the last we have seen her dressed as a ham.<br/><br/>But Harper Lee shoves a cold, hard truth in our faces that is not quite a slap, but a realisation and a nostalgic disappointment that we must all face as we grow up. Atticus, just as it was with our parents, is not infallible. He is prone to mistakes just like any other, although he tends to waver less than others, for his grasp on his beliefs are far more firm, erroneous or not, than other Maycomb residents. But that does not mean he does not err. That does not mean we should rely on him for our moral decisions. And neither should Jean Louise. It is at the end of this book that she finally separates from her father and forms her own moral identity and comes to terms with the realisation that she must make her own choices, and must accept the consequences of it. It is a difficult realisation. It is usually unpleasant. But it is necessary. It is very likely that had Jem been alive, she would have tried to attach herself to Jem, but alas, he is gone. She is on her own.<br/><br/>The disappointment that a reader might feel reading this novel is probably very similar to the disappointment a young teenager might feel on the day (s)he realises that the parents are not always right, they are not always infallible, and they are, in fact, human. Atticus, for fifty years, had been preserved in our memories as an epitome of moral perfection: standing up for what is right, believing in what one does, and always, always rational. (I might add that Gregory Peck does us no service by really entombing Atticus in amber and forever sealing it on screen. He even looks right.) It isn't some rage, nor is it grief, but it is a disappointment with a smile, a sadness that a hero has fallen from a pedestal.<br/><br/>What is heartbreaking, however, is not Scout's disappointment, nor Atticus, nor anyone else's action; rather, it is Calpurnia, the mother-figure in Scout's life. We discover that Calpurnia feels the racial segregation as sorely as Scout does (and consequently us), but because she had been so close to the Finches, she sees the current situation almost as a betrayal. And Scout realises that she quite is helpless to help her almost foster-mother, that she is alone in this battle, and that there is nothing she can do. She realises that Calpurnia was not her mother, was never her mother, and that her own identity and her own family's identity comes before the time spent with the Finches. That is natural, but as this is written with Scout as the central figure, we do see yet another figure crumble: that of the mother, beaten down to a stranger that once knew Jean Louise. And what is more sad than losing your own mother and father all at once?<br/><br/>There are continuation errors that are acceptable, considering that this is not quite a sequel. Tom Robinson has been miraculously acquitted, and Henry Clinton's sudden entrance had me trying to remember Dill's name for 1/3 of the book (seriously. Scout's old buddy? Check. Knew Jem? Check. Troubled childhood? From what I recall vaguely Dill might have had a troubled family, so check for me. Promised to marry Scout? Check.).<br/><br/>Before you read the review from the New York Times and peg Atticus as a fallen hero, please, do the book justice and read it. You hear voices from both sides, and while my mind is set on the belief that all men are created equal, Atticus does point out some good arguments (although his sweeping generalisation is up to some severe scrutiny), as does Uncle Jack, who serves as Ms Maudie in this novel. Henry Clinton and his humble upbringing that helps the readers realise just how privileged Jean Louise has been, both socially as well as morally, is also striking, and it makes us realise that a desperate man is a weak man but one does not deserve all the blame and judgement for being weak... or does he? Does the rules that govern the African Americans portrayed in this novel (and the sweeping statement Atticus makes) apply to Henry Clinton as well? Are racists just uninformed, or are they just skewed in their views, or are they some evil, disgusting people that deserves to be spit upon (to me, the modern portrayal of racists is the latter)? Do they deserve pity? Are they, like the case Atticus makes, just mentally unable to assimilate the differences (there's a study by Hodson and Busseri that correlates lower IQ during childhood to higher prevalence of racism in adulthood)?<br/><br/>In this day and age, where we know that racism is bad but still we see it when it is the least expected, this novel brings us back to the starting point of just what is nature and what is nurture, who deserves what and by what merit, and whether the government makes any sense governing such a large country as the US on a federal level. It is a novel with many themes, some moral, some social, and some political, that might have been written back in the 50s but is still relevant today.<br/><br/>If you want a lingering impression of a book in 2015, go read this book. It'll add for discussions, debates, and self-examinations. At least, it did for me.
I couldn't wait to get this book into my hands, and read it in one day. Not because I was so enthralled that I couldn't possibly put the book down; instead, I was waiting--and waiting--for the kind of depth and insight and singular voice that made "Mockingbird" so special.<br/><br/>I already knew from advance reviews that Atticus would be portrayed as a prejudiced and flawed man, and I was looking forward to Ms. Lee helping the reader get into his head and into the Southern mind-set of the times. But that turned out to be just a small--and predictable and trite--part of the novel. Plus, the characters we are introduced to in this sequel, including Aunty and Dr. Finch, were sideshows instead of integral to the story.<br/><br/>In my opinion, what should have been the meat of the book, Scout coming into her own as she embarks upon a new life in New York, and her subsequent difficulties in coming to terms with her flawed father, her flawed childhood, her "flawed" viewpoint, only crop up toward the end of the book. But we're not treated to an epiphany through Scout's eyes. The denouement is painfully trite. Scout's visit to Calpurnia is so glossed over and stripped of any real meaning that it might just as well have been edited out.<br/><br/>I suspect that if anyone other than Ms. Lee had written this book (which at times reads like a Tea Party children's primer), and if Scout and Atticus were new characters instead of beloved personalities from "Mockingbird," this novel might--or might not--have been quietly published, been ignored by reviewers and literature lovers, and would be languishing on the remainder shelves of bookstores and reduced to clearance status on Amazon in no time at all.<br/><br/>"Mockingbird" will live on and will be loved by generations to come, while "Watchman" will be but a sad footnote to that enduring story.
After reading all the published articles written in English about the release of this book, after viewing the PBS documentary on Harper Lee, after reading Amazon's "look inside" feature, and after reading many of the published reviews at Amazon, I have purchased the slip-bound version of To Kill a Mockingbird which I will read again and treasure.  As to Watchman, I concur with most of the other one-star reviews.  Go Set a Watchman, written before Mockingbird, is obviously a draft.  No one at the publisher Harper's has actually spoken to Miss Lee, instead communicating only with her lawyer.  It is my opinion that if what is being published as the "novel"  Go Set a Watchman had been sent to Harper's as a potential novel or as a sequel to Mockingbird without the Pulitzer Prize winning Miss Lee's name on it that it would have promptly been tossed in the proverbial circular file.  It is interesting that this material was published after the death of Miss Lee's sister Alice, a lawyer as well as her sister's best advocate.
I am on chapter 18 and still looking for a plot, a beginning, a middle and an end.  There aren’t any twists and turns or great revelations, oh, except that Atticus Finch and the rest of small, southern, towns in the 50s were bigoted. How enlightening!  It takes 12 chapters to get to the excuse, not the justification for bigotry in the South, and the conversation on that subject goes for one chapter and doesn’t pick up again till you wade through several more chapters of uneventful flashbacks of Scout’s boring little life as a child in Macomb County. So, she loses her falsies at a dance and doesn’t know what her period is. Really? Oops, I just told you the highlights of the book. What in the world makes anyone think this is a good, let alone a great literary achievement? It’s the longest, most boring treatise on irrelevant characters I’ve ever encountered. If I've spoiled it for you, I've done you a favor. You can save your time and money. Harper Collins should be ashamed for exploiting Harper Lee’s name for profit.
Yep. I fell for the "hype" and pre-ordered a copy anticipating something-anything like "Mockingbird." Boy, was I wrong. I found it difficult to follow with incredibly long and preachy banter between the characters. I found it tiring and really not worth the trouble. Miss Harper was right about not wanting to publish it years ago. I did finish the book despite the rambling rough draft tone throughout hoping that it would eventually come together-it never did.
SO disappointed .I hbought it because of the huge marketing push that promised a true sequel to "Mockingbird ". This book really should not have been published.<br/>While there was a minimal effort to raise the issue of change vs no change,it was so poorly written.<br/>I chose this book for my book club. No one liked it which was a first in the group.
I really wanted to like "Go Set a Watchman," but I didn't, and I can't imagine it would have been published if it wasn't by Harper Lee.  It wasn't published for over sixty years, and it could have gone unpublished for many more.<br/><br/>As another reviewer mentioned, it doesn't seem a finished work.  While there are a few "nice" scenes, there's little else.  It seemed I could have skipped the first hundred pages without having lost anything, and the "resolutions" in the last fifty pages seemed very contrived and unbelievable.<br/><br/>I've read "To Kill" many times, but I can't imagine picking up "Go Set" again.  It'll likely be left as a donation to the library in the morning.
Scout is now age 26, returning to her childhood home in the South to spend time with family.  Much of the novel is charming and pleasant reading, with many reminiscences about Scout’s younger days.  Tension comes when she is confronted with the truth of racial relations in her home town.  She is appalled to find her father Atticus and her beau Hank on the other side of the moral divide.  She rebuts her Uncle Jack’s polemic with a harsh diatribe against Atticus.  The book’s failing is that these chapters are not woven into the fabric of the book; they are unedited, overextended socio-political tracts.  Having been written in 1950, the book must be read in context, but even Scout’s moral positions bear scrutiny.
Fifty-five years ago Harper Lee stunned the literary world with a little gem of a first novel that was pure magic. In it, she introduced someone who would become the best-loved character in all of American fiction, a small-town Southern lawyer named Atticus Finch. Atticus was presented as a loving father, an able lawyer, and a figure of towering integrity, holding off a lynch mob to protect a young black man falsely accused of raping a white girl. After publication of To Kill a Mockingbird, Atticus Finch was all but sanctified as a paragon of virtue. So it came as an almighty shock when it turned out that the literary hero has feet of clay after all and that Atticus Finch, of all people, was a flat-out racist.<br/><br/>Well, given the time and the place, how could he not have been? Atticus, like everybody else, is a product of his environment, and Maycomb County, Alabama adhered strictly to the mores of the Deep South. Black people must be kept in their place. There were thousands of white people all across the South who, like Atticus, treated individual blacks with kindness and courtesy but who were appalled at the idea of black children going to school with their own.  Why sakes alive, they might end up marrying each other.  Yes, Atticus was committed to justice in the legal sense, but he was never interested in raising the condition of black people where he lived. He sent his children to all-white schools and his devoted housekeeper, Calpurnia, had to enter the house by the back door, and he had no problem with any of it. But his daughter Scout, who was presented as a delightfully devilish little tomboy in TKAM, has expanded her horizons since living in New York City, and on her annual visits back home she has come to realize that segregation was unfair, unjust, and just plain wrong. Scout is Jean Louise now, 20 years older than she was when we first met her, and she feels totally out of place in the world she was born into and raised. She sees Atticus at a meeting of the local White Citizens Council where they are handing out tracts spewing racist garbage and she is literally sick at her stomach. This is the father she has loved unquestioningly since the day she was born and now she has seen another side of him that is totally alien and antipathetic. The big question in "Go Set a Watchman" is if she can still love and accept her father now that she sees him warts and all.<br/><br/>Jean Louise's hometown is going through a crisis set off by Brown vs. the Board of Education in which the Supreme Court decided school segregation was illegal, and it's brought out the worst side of people she thought she knew all her life. The white population of Maycomb County sees the end of their world as they knew it. They look at the black people whom they had always seen as being safely subordinate with fear and suspicion. Jean Louise goes to visit Calpurnia, now old and retired, and it suddenly occurs to her to wonder if Calpurnia had hated the Finches all along for belonging to the race that has oppressed black people for two centuries. Nothing makes sense to her any more.<br/><br/>Harper Lee's laconic and often humorous writing style is still evident in GSAW and the book flows along effortlessly; it's a short, easy read. There are some flashbacks to the first book; my favorite is a description of Scout, Jem and Dill playing Missionary in the Finch's back yard and Dill swipes one of his Aunt Rachel's best sheets, cuts two holes in it for eyes, drapes it over his head and solemnly proclaims he's the Holy Ghost. But Dill and Jem are missing from the present day; Dill was last known to be traveling through Italy and Jem, having inherited their mother's cardiac condition, dropped dead of a heart attack before his thirtieth birthday. Aunt Alexandra is still around, though, as stubborn and stiff-necked as always, and so is Jean Louise's Uncle Jack Finch, who finally helps her to understand that her father is not the paragon she thought he was nor the demon he seems to her now, but is simply a good, decent and yet flawed human being.<br/><br/>Lee wrote "Go Set a Watchman" in the third person, and perhaps this is one reason why it lacks the sheer wonder and magic that ran all through "To Kill a Mockingbird". GSAW was the first draft of TKAM and it's hard to say if it's a prequel or a sequel; certainly it's the latter in view of the time setting. Jean Louise has grown up to be a strong, forceful young woman, and as her Uncle Jack Finch observes, she is one of the very few color-blind people he has ever met. Jean Louise sees people as people, whatever their color. We wonder where she got it from. Wherever it came from, she is very much her own person, still growing, developing and changing, just like the home she left and is gradually finding her way back to.<br/><br/>Judy Lind
Decent book. Several dead spots throughout the book and no where near as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. Still well worth the read though. Just don't set your expectations too high.
After waiting so long for this to be published I am so disappointed, not from the content/story line, which was disturbing,  but by the actual writing.  Ms. Lee improved greatly when she wrote To Kill a Mocking Bird, a true classic.  This is not on that level by any stretch.
I am an ADVID reader. I have NO idea what these people in the reviews are talking about!!  Mockingbird is a classic that was the best book I have ever read. Watchman is garbage...  Its so sad that this publisher only wanted to make a buck. After reading half the book, there was still no story, plot , or anything. I could hardly finish this book. It bearly held my attention. Maybe my expectations were too high with all the publisher hype. Obvisouly the publisher had to make this book look good, however the print is huge and it is double spaced. The book could have been half the size had it been publised like other novels. Save your money and keep a few hours of your life!!! Sadddddddd.
This book was incredibly boring.  I read To Kill a Mockingbird and this book back to back to get the full effect.  While I enjoyed Mockingbird, I was incredibly disappointed in this book.  The characters had 360 degree transformations between the first book and this book.  Main characters from the first book - Jem and Dill - were only mentioned briefly in this book.  While some of the childhood flashback stories were somewhat entertaining, they don't make up for the boring, dull majority of the book.  Read Mockingbird and stop there.  This book was terrible.
If I were able to give this poor excuse for a novel a minus-star rating, I would. Shame on Harper Collins for publishing and promoting this book. If it were written by a no-name writer, it would not have been considered. The publishers were right many years ago when this was first rejected. The burning question:  who REALLY wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. Not this writer, surely. I cringed reading much of the dialogue, obviously put in characters' mouths to present the writer's opinion. One good thing, I borrowed the book and did not spend money on it.
Well. Briefly - it's definitely written by Harper Lee. There are passages where her voice is clear.<br/><br/>It's also obviously an early effort. It's trying to get somewhere but the effort is not always cohesive, and is at times downright clunky.<br/><br/>I don't want to say anything too specific and spoil it for people who haven't read it yet.<br/><br/>I will say that it is no Mockingbird, not in immediacy or feel or lyricism. The only places where those things are present are in flashback scenes, where I did feel as if these are the same characters as in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Frankly, if it hadn't been by Harper Lee, if it was just a book I picked up in a store or a library and started to read to decide if I wanted it, I would have put it back.<br/><br/>As it is, just because it is by Harper Lee, I'm glad to have been able to read it.<br/><br/>I would say that this is not Scout, in this book, except in some flashback scenes. It's completely Nelle Harper Lee, translated to the page.<br/><br/>But after all that's what so many first novels are.<br/><br/>And given that, I'm glad for another reason to have been able to read it; because it's so clearly this person at this age and at that time. And given how little we've ever actually known of her, I have liked that.
I have always imagined myself to be one of Harper Lee's most devoted fans and I still believe this to be true.  The book, "To Kill A Mockingbird" is nearly divine.  From the first word until the very last, it is mesmerizing.  As a young woman, when I first read the book, my focus was on the innocence of childhood and the elusive Boo Radley.  Yes, I realized the trial of Tom Robinson was a crucial piece of the complete story but my heart was filled with Scout, Jem, Dill, Atticus, and Boo.  I did not overlook or take for granted the trial and the impact it had on Atticus, but I always felt the mysterious Boo and his love for the children was the true core of the story.  The book, "Go Set A Watchman" is an unfortunate disappointment and quite frankly, boring.  This compilation of Harper Lee should have never been taken out of the archives and hurried into print.  I find it to be confusing, disjointed, and stale.  It is difficult to believe that Harper Lee granted her permission to share this mediocre draft with her beloved fans, after paving her legacy with the literary masterpiece that is "To Kill A Mockingbird."  In my eyes, there is but one Atticus Finch and he is alive and well in "To Kill A Mockingbird."
I preface this by saying that I think TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is an American classic. Therefore, I had almost convinced myself not to read GO SET A WATHMAN.<br/><br/>This book is excellent. The pace, the wit, the content are as well done as MOCKINGBIRD.  There are some truly sad events that befall original MOCKINGBIRD characters- and Harper Lee does a nice job of weaving those events into the tale, not letting them drag down this story.<br/><br/>I bought the book and had trouble putting it down.  The pace is fast, the revelations are quick and the end is ...satisfying, yet leaves me wanting more.<br/><br/>Much was made in the media about on aspect- Atticus and his revelation as a bigot.  READ the story- he simply is revealed as the true character he was portrayed as in MOCKINGBIRD- he is steady, committed to his town and watchful of events.  Do I agree with some of his reasoning or some of the things he did? NO, but I live in 2015- and this story covers the cares, concerns and fears of the 1950's and an era of rapid growth and change in America.<br/><br/>I won't reveal the plot- but this is, perhaps, one of the best coming of age stories I have read.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the book.
There has been a lot of negativity about this book, and everyone is entitled to his/her own opinion. I read reviews others have written, but in the end the only person who censors what I read/watch/listen to, is me. I very much enjoyed this book. As always, use your brain and keep an open mind..........
Just received my book as promised. My question is why are the front of the pages of the book not smooth and unevenly cut? I am not satisfied with the product.
I'm sorry but I don't believe this book is a separate first book- written before To Kill a Mockingbird- it just doesn't fit.  Being a writer myself I think that this was part of a larger first book -To Kill a Mockingbird and the editors cut out this part- the later years of the main character and some other scenes which return in this book as recollections of her childhood.  As a separate first manuscript the references to what happens in To Kill a Mockingbird would have left readers of this book very confused as to why "Scout" had this firm image of her father's beliefs on race.  You really couldn't understand what had happened previously unless you had read TKMB- which if this was written before TKMB- doesn't make sense.  I think Lee's first book had a lot of editorial cuts and maybe some major revisions in style - and these cuts are what someone combined into a "prequel".<br/><br/>As a book in itself this Go Set a Watchman leaves a lot to be desired.  It's a lot of anguished thoughts on the main characters realization that her father doesn't think the way she does about race relations.  There's little action -mostly in childhood recollections.  And the line between what is being thought and spoken is often blurred.  I think Scouts reaction to the discovery that her father believes in segregation is overly dramatized, if you consider the era that the book was written in. And the ending just isn't realistic- one minute she is raging mad and leaving and the next she suddenly "sees the light" - and realizes her father is entitled to his own views.  I did find a few good quotes in the book- Prejudice and faith begin where reason ends- ( not exact quote) is my favorite.<br/><br/>Its a short easy read but not worth the price being charged.  I suggest waiting until the hype is over and the price goes down if you are curious.
Almost lived up to the anticipation, but not quite as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird."  I have read several reviews which panned the character of Atticus Finch in this novel, but I found it thought-provoking and an interesting read.
I really hope the money that the lawyers and promoters make on this travesty is worth besmirching the name of one of the last great living 20th century authors. This book is ... one of the worst books I've ever tried to read. I will read Twilight before I ever attempt to finish this book.<br/><br/>You can't help but compare it to To Kill a Mockingbird; Hell, it's why the promoters what you to buy the damn thing. But unlike that seminal work, this book is dreadfully dull - dull to the point of being offensive. I read through several chapters highlighting the minutiae of church services. Was that really necessary? Other than a swim-on-a-dare and getting locked in a train berth, there's not much going on of interest in this book.<br/><br/>Whether this is an actual sequel or a first draft of TKAM, the book could've used a good round of comprehensive editing to pull things together and make it a bit more interesting. I gave up around the 40% mark, when we get introduced to Atticus Finch, Klansman (they should've used that for the title, I think).  Sure, that goes on (and still goes on) down in the south, but after Finch's characterization in the original book (and, of course, the movie), this comes completely out of left field.<br/><br/>Really, the only good thing about this book is the cover, which is very reminiscent of the minimalist movement and many classic book covers from the mid-20th century. Please don't judge the book by that, because you'll be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>I doubt Harper Lee had much to do with this particular presentation, which is probably a very good thing. Remember her for To Kill a Mockingbird, and forget this abomination even exists.
Almost everyone knows how Go Set a Watchman got published -- Lee is now infirm and rumored to no longer be of sound mind. Her lawyer "discovered" this lost manuscript. In fact Watchman was a first draft of the novel that was sent to editor Tay Hohoff in 1957. Hohoff rejected the manuscript and suggested many changes and eventually all those changes and rewrites became To Kill a Mockingbird. Watchman is not a sequel to Mockingbird. It is not an alternate version. It's a first draft, and one can argue about the ethics about publishing it altogether -- would Beethoven have wanted his initial scribblings of his symphonies published and played by orchestras?<br/><br/>The revelation that Harper Lee's "long-lost" novel Go Set A Watchman gave the sainted Atticus Finch a "dark side" made the front pages of the New York Times for days and caused the predictable teeth-gnashing that one of the most beloved literary characters's reputation is somehow ... tarnished? Atticus in this book is not the same Atticus who defended an innocent black man and urged his children to be kind and unprejudiced. He's an infirm man who is vehemently against the NAACP and is outraged at the Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education. He's even joined the "Maycomb Citizens' Council," a club that's dedicated to preserving, well, the Southern way of life.<br/><br/>I sat and read Go Set a Watchman and if there's any literary character assassination, it's not really Atticus. Atticus in Watchman is so distantly drawn, so opaque of a figure, that one can easily just forget about him as soon as the book is over. The real disappointment, one that's harder to shake, is that the "Jean Louise Finch" of Watchman is NOTHING like "Scout Finch" of To Kill A Mockingbird. Mockingbird's Scout was a precocious, intelligent child. Watchman's Jean Louise Finch plays like a clichéd heroine from a young adult novel, and an annoying one at that.<br/><br/>When one reads Watchman the first thing that jumps out on the page is how thinly sketched every character is compared to the richly drawn Southern gothic counterparts in Mockingbird. "Jean Louise Finch" is a whiny, over-dramatic twenty-something year old and most of her storyline is dominated by a romance with Henry Clinton, a lawyer in Atticus's firm. She's 26, lives in New York, comes back home to Maycomb, Alabama, and discovers to her shock that Atticus is not perfect, Henry is prejudiced as well, Calpurnia no longer really recognizes her and Aunt Alexandra is still very, very annoying. The end. Oh, Jem is dead.<br/><br/>Remember how Scout was a tomboy, who was also really smart and capable? Well here's Jean-Louise: "Although she was a respectable driver, she hated to operate anything mechanical more complicated than a safety pin: folding lawn chairs were a source of profound irritation to her; she had never learned to ride a bicycle or use a typewriter; she fished with a pole."<br/><br/>To get a flavor of the of the love interest in this novel, here's an excruciating passage with Henry:<br/><br/>"I don't even love you like that anymore. I've hurt you but there it is." Yes, it was she talking, with her customary aplomb, breaking his heart in a drugstore. Well, he'd broken hers.<br/>Henry's face became blank, reddened, and its scar leaped into prominence. "Jean Louise, you can't mean what you're saying."<br/>"I mean every word of it."<br/>Hurts, doesn't it? You're damn right it hurts. You know how it feels, now.<br/><br/>Jean-Louise is outraged that her father and Henry have joined the Maycomb Citizens' Council but in the climax of the book she has an argument with Atticus which reveals that she's as bigoted as Atticus, if not worse. She also says that she was "furious" about the Brown vs. Board of Education decision because "they" were "tellin' us what to do again." She also agrees that the "Negro" population is "backward" and "unable to share the fully in the responsibilities of citizenship." In fact, her only defense of Brown is "Atticus, if you believe all that, then why don't you do right? I mean this, no matter how hateful the Court was, there had to be a beginning."<br/><br/>The protracted argument with Atticus stems not from any disagreement with Atticus over the basic philosophy behind segregation but from Jean-Louise's fury that Atticus had brought her up believing all the things about fairness and colorblindness and now he's backtracking. In other words, like many of the millenials of today who post 100 selfies a day with hasthags like #lookingood and #nomakeup, it's all about me. But let's examine some of Lee's "wonderful" prose here:<br/><br/>"Atticus, I'm throwing it at you and I'm gonna grind it in: you better go warn your younger friends that if they want to preserve Our Way of Life, it begins at home. It doesn't begin with the schools or the churches or anyplace at home. Tell 'em that, and use your blind, immoral, misguided, n___r-lovin' daughter as your example. Go in front of me with a bell and say, 'Unclean!' ... Point me out as your mistake. Point me out: Jean Louise Finch, who was exposed to all kinds of guff from the white trash she went to school with, but she might never have gone to school for all the influence it had on her. Everything that was Gospel to her she got at home from her father. You sowed the seeds in me, Atticus, and now it's coming home to you --"<br/><br/>This is awful writing. But it only gets worse: after the blow-up with Atticus Jean Louise talks to her uncle "Dr. Finch" who tells her: "You're color blind. You always have been, you always will be. The only differences you see are between one human and another are differences in looks and intelligence and character and the like. You've never been prodded to look at people as a race, and now that race is the burning issue of the day, you're still unable to think racially. You see only people." Jean-Louise's response to that might the one (unintentionally) hilarious moment in this novel: "But Uncle Jack, I don't especially want to run out and marry a Negro or something." If this is Lee's version of racial enlightenment ...<br/><br/>There's not a single character in Watchman that one wants to "follow" to the next page. Part of a writers' job is writing about characters that the reader cares about. Not good characters, not moral characters, not racially enlightened characters, but characters that attract interest and attention. Watchman is entirely devoid of any such characters, and thus any interest. You read it for the novelty factor and that's it.<br/><br/>There are a couple things in Watchman that remind me of Mockingbird, but unfortunately they don't speak very well of Lee as a writer. You remember how in Mockingbird Harper Lee had this habit of introducing every character with a long expository history, instead of simply letting the character come alive by himself on the page? That habit is here in Watchman, except there's no colorful lines to make those expository character introductions more interesting. You remember how sometimes huge confrontations in Mockingbird were tidied up with a neat homily, like "You never really understand a person until you see things from his point of view"? Well, you see traces of that in Watchman. But without confrontations that hold any meaning, those neat homilies become even more irritating.<br/><br/>It's interesting, then, to see that among all this trash, Hohoff rescued parts of Watchman that turned into Mockingbird. The "Tom Robinson" storyline in Mockingbird is drawn from a one paragraph description in Watchman about how Atticus once defended an unnamed black teen in a statutory rape case and won. In Watchman the story is told in such an impersonal, brief way that blink and you might miss it. The character of "Dill" is also taken from a brief passage about Scout's school days. "Aunt Alexandra" in Watchman is an insufferable and bigoted, but somehow Hohoff managed to make Lee rewrite her into a woman with a similar character, but enough pathos that she becomes a recognizable figure in the Southern gothic genre: the proud, lonely belle. Jean Louise's close relationship with Calpurnia as a child is also present in Watchman, except in a far more mundane storyline: Calpurnia talked Jean-Louise out of a phantom pregnancy scare.<br/><br/>Other things one just has to assume were created by the author mining her imagination. Who knows where the Boo Radley story came from? It's not anywhere in Watchman. It became the heart of Mockingbird. Why is the relationship between Jem and Jean-Louise remembered as so cold and distant in Watchman, when it was warm and close in Mockingbird? How about Tom and Mayella Ewell? Sheriff Tate? These richly drawn characters are again missing in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>I think most people who read To Kill a Mockingbird assumed that Scout was really Harper Lee, and Harper Lee was Scout. The novel is semi-autobiographical, and Lee worked many elements of her childhood and upbringing into the novel. Scout Finch's sharp observations, her love for her family and community, her integrity and moral compass -- I think most readers assumed that these were really the qualities of Harper Lee. The fact that Lee has led a reclusive life since the book's publication in 1960 has only added to the mystique. Harper Lee never crashed and burned the way her childhood friend Truman Capote (Dill in Mockingbird) did. It's like she wrote the book, and closed the curtain on her life permanently.<br/><br/>Watchman is so poorly written, so devoid of anything that might even suggest the embryonic stages of a literary classic, that I started to wonder if that old rumor that Truman Capote had a heavy invisible hand in the writing of Mockingbird was correct. What's more, it made me think, is this Jean-Louise" Finch really Harper Lee? If these were her first thoughts about herself, then either she didn't give herself enough credit or Lee later created a Scout Finch that was less true to life but more appealing to readers.<br/><br/>But all these debates about the ethics of publishing Watchman, who really were the invisible hands that shaped Mockingbird, how much of Harper Lee was put into both novels, is really a moot point at the end of the day. The fact is To Kill a Mockingbird is not a perfect book, but it's a book worth reading because it's well-written, interesting, and imaginative. In other words, a classic. Go Set a Watchman is none of those things.
This book was published out of greed. The publisher ignored the flaws and did not care that this story had lost its relevance since it was obviously written in the wake of Brown vs. The Board of Education.<br/>Sadly, the destruction of Atticus' character is complete. In "To Kill a Mockingbird", he has a mythical quality about him as displayed in the scenes with the rabid dog and the lynch mob. Here he is portrayed as the worst kind of racist, the "white man's burden" kind born from conceit. It actually retro-actively taints the original story.<br/>This adult coming of age story including the "you can never truly go back home" trope as well as "the realization that parents are flawed" trope are sophomoric. Some scenes are awkward and actually hard to follow.<br/>The only redeeming aspect of the book is for literature scholars because the seeds of "To Kill a Mockingbird" are evident with many flashbacks and asides but her writing style was poor at this time.
I read an article today that said "it would have been kinder" not to publish Go Set a Watchman. Balderdash!!!  This is NOT a sequel. This is not -- and not meant to even be a full fledge novel. It's a fascinating manuscript that revels the early steps of a great and important American novel. If you expect and want a Pulitzer Prize wining American masterpiece - don't bother. If you love To Kill A Mocking Bird - If you want a better understanding of the context/situation Harper Lee was wrestling with when she wrote Mocking Bird -- if you are interested in the writing process of her masterpiece (Mocking Bird) - then this book is for you.  It is exactly what Lee's representatives and the publisher said it was --- an earlier, first novel -- with the same family, in the same town, focused on the same subject matter --- but not as elegantly crafted. It is, as was advertised, unedited, in the raw, unpolished (because it was abandoned to make way for Mocking Bird).  But -- I loved it with all it's roughness -- for all the reasons I stated above. It pulls no punches in it's including of the ugly underbelly of racism -- total realism there. And like the material -- the young Jean Louise (Scott) is as biting and out of control at times as the community. No answers to it all in this book -- no resolution -- just the churning and fire of a youthful girl -- and young author -- confronting herself, her family, her community and her reading audience with all the honesty and grit she's got. And then -- after she finishes this first novel -- in the mid 1950s -- while Eisenhowser was still president -- before Rosa Parks refused to give her seat up -- before Martin Luther King Jr was ever heard of outside the local area -- she gets a few simple suggestions from her publisher. Among them are:  1) move the story back 20 years, 2) tell the story from the first person, and 3) use and expand some of Jean Louise's earlier memories. Out of that -- she tries again and manages to more powerfully get across the same message by telling the tale through the eyes of 6 year old child. Thank you Ms Harper! And I hope the rumors are true that you have more hidden in that vault of yours!
I like "Go Set a Watchman" more than I thought I would. Based on the previously released first chapter, I wasn't certain I could sufficiently engage with Harper Lee's newly released first novel.<br/><br/>It's difficult for "Mockingbird" devotees to set aside expectations that "Watchman" should live up to everything "Mockingbird" was and is.<br/><br/>It's also important to accept "Watchman" as a first novel -- and that Miss Lee's editor Tay Hohoff made an astute assessment. Miss Lee's writing gift is recognizable in "Watchman."  Hohoff's advice to Harper was to rewrite "Watchman" from Jean Louise's POV and to make it a coming of age novel.<br/><br/>"Watchman" is in third person. It seems Harper Lee was trying to figure out how to cast the stark bigotry of the 50s and how to stage Jean Louise's disgust with Southern hypocrisy. In this regard, "Watchman" is best interpreted as a trial run for "Mockingbird."<br/><br/>By the time Miss Lee had finished "Mockingbird," these portrayals were complete. With "Watchman," Lee set the stage, and with "Mockingbird," she dressed that stage for performance.<br/><br/>In "Watchman," the story isn't writ as grande as in "Mockingbird," but that doesn't make "Watchman" any less valuable.<br/><br/>Two thirds of the way through "Watchman," the message becomes clear.<br/><br/> In this excerpt from "Watchman," Jean Louise thinks to herself:<br/><br/>"Blind. That's what I am. I never thought to look into people's hearts, I only look in their faces. Stone blind...Stone. Mr. Stone set a watchman in church yesterday. He should have provided me with one. I need a watchman to lead me around and declare what he seeth every hour on the hour. I need a watchman to tell me this is what a man says he is but this is what he means, to draw a line down the middle and say here is this justice and there is that justice and make me understand the difference. I need a watchman to go forth and proclaim to them all that twenty-six years is too long to play a joke on anybody, no matter how funny it is."<br/><br/> "Watchman" is a voice trying out for the big stage. First you hear "Watchman's" strengths in sotto voce -- until the last 10 percent of the book. Then you hear "Watchman" in fortissimo. You hear its angry, harsh voice. And that voice tells the truth.<br/><br/>In "Mockingbird," Miss Lee paints a grander stage -- that of tragedy.<br/><br/>Two flaws do exist with "Watchman:"<br/><br/> One, it's episodic -- one thing happens, another thing happens, and then another and another.<br/><br/>Two, in some places, the characters exist primarily to showcase hypocrisy by shouting ideologies across the room.<br/><br/>A better way to portray hypocrisy is when problems sneak up from behind the characters and bite them in the rear. Both flaws are plotting issues Miss Lee fully resolved in the rewrite her Lippincott editor requested.<br/><br/>Edited to add: Miss Lee is delighted that "Watchman" has now been published, according to her attorney, Tonya Carter, who found "Watchman" in Miss Lee's safe-deposit box in February. Ms. Carter also apparently found what looks like an unpublished, incomplete manuscript in the safe-deposit box.  The Boston Globe had reported some years back that Miss Lee was working on a new novel, so perhaps the unfinished manuscript Ms. Carter found might be that "new novel."
If this book were written by Harper Lee, it must have been as a high school sophmore composition class project.  The writing is is so far from the quality of To Kill a Mockingbird, that I and my wife put it down forever after the ten pages. The adult protagonist's voice is that of someone in middle school; it is off-center. We donated the book to our library in the hope that it will serve as a guide for future writers on how not to write. We have convinced ourselves that the manuscript originated much earlier than her first book and did not have the benefit of an editor. This publication is a disservice to the author and most likely an attempt to make money on just her name and reputation.
I'm 81 years and still have my copy of TKAM.  It was my all time favorite, but after reading this my good feelings will always be tainted.  It was short, political, and unnecessary.  If by a miracle it becomes a movie, I won't be seeing it.  Instead of being left with a happy feeling, I'm depressed. I feel she has betrayed her legacy.
Either Scout is "misremembering" or Harper Lee has gone senile.  In Watchman Scout comments that Atticus succeeded in getting an acquittal for Tom Robinson --- too bad that in To Kill A Mockingbird Robinson is CONVICTED, sent to prison where he tries to escape, and is shot.  All in all, this novel is a sorry excuse for a companion work to the wonderfully written, wonderfully uplifting Mockingbird.  The writing seems to try to be 'contemporary styled' rather than TKM's classic style and the Scout character is a royal pain, full of herself and intolerant of others.  Don't you hate it when you thoroughly dislike the main character?
This is a a manuscript that should have remained just that.  There was a reason why it was returned to Ms Lee so that she could rework it.  Kudos to the person who gave her that advice because it turned a slow moving, uninspired manuscript into a Pulitzer prize winning novel.  To Kill a Mockingbird touched so many people on so many levels, it was a perfect novel, a story beautifully told and remembered by all who read it.  I wish Ms Lee had remained a one hit wonder because now there is an inferior version of the Finch Family out there that to me, sullies that memory.  It compares to drawing a mustache on The Mona Lisa.
What a harsh reality of life, to have your mentor taken away from you. I struggled to read the book and I don't know if I would have finished if it had been by any other author or any other characters but I had to know how it played out. I'm glad that I did even if it wasn't my favorite novel. "Melbourne said I’ll put it in my own words: the time your friends need you is when they’re wrong, Jean Louise . They don’t need you when they’re right—” I got the point of what Lee was trying to say. I'm just not sure using these characters to say it was the ending I wanted for them.
This is a poorly written book, there is no character development, the sentence structure is questionable, and the story is sometimes confusing. The punctuation is flawed. Maybe they should have kept the manuscript where they found it. Maybe Harper Lee did not want to publish this back then because she felt it was not ready. And it is not ready. And for all those who are giving this work a higher rating bless you. I just could not. This was all about making money by the publishers and others into exploiting the author and her fan base.<br/><br/>Author George Wilder Jr.<br/>Author and Popular Radio Host.
Terrible Writing. If it weren't for the Harper Lee name slapped on the front, it wouldn't have gained any traction. A crime has been committed by publishing this book. If it is of academic value, then release it as such, but to build anticipation and charge people is unacceptable. If it truly is a first draft of TKAM, then it should be marketed as such, and not as a sequel. Cheap ploy by the publishing house and whoever the decision makers were.<br/><br/>We should take heart the TKAM will last as a timeless classic, not to be eroded by this nonsense.
It drives me nuts when people read a story and say, “If only she’d written it differently I would have liked it…”  Well, then write your own damn story.  This is Harper Lee’s story, and I loved it.<br/>  In Go set a Watchman, I was transported to another time, another place; the south on the brink of desegregation and a young Jean Louise on the brink of adulthood.  I’m a sucker for the lingo of those earlier decades; it reminds me of Edna Ferber who could steer a big story right to the heart of the matter with bombastic dialogue and characters we loved and hated.  I liked being driven by Lee; I felt she knew the road.<br/>  A master of invoking memories, Lee juxtaposes her tale with flashbacks of Scout’s childhood.  I liked how some scenes were clear, and some were just bits; a sleeve and a hand in a game… who was that anyway?—how memories really are.  It put me right there.  I could feel the heat, the fun, the astonishment of being that kid.  Her father, Atticus, was her rock, Calpurnia, her comfort, and Jem, her playmate—until he turned teen and grew remote as teens do.  But even teenage Jem pledged to be there for her if trouble arose, until his death or maybe longer.  And old boyfriend, Henry, was always there, true blue and so familiar. Yes, hers was a childhood built of strong stuff.<br/>  But as her visit home proceeds, we learn that Jean Louise has become something different, a stranger to hometown Maycomb.  Her world-view is ready for change, and she sees plain and clear that the injustice and mean trickery of keeping the “negro” in his place has got to go.  It’s not fair, it’s not right, and it’s cruel to “deny them hope”.  Now Jean Louise is not a New Yorker, heaven forbid, but she’s not small-town-south anymore—and worse than that, she’s barely a Finch, because all she thought she knew about right and wrong, just tipped upside down when she witnesses Atticus attending a racist meeting.<br/>  How could Atticus be the man that raised her and be the man at the meeting?  How could neighbors be generous and kind, and still get behind the drivel and hatred the speaker espoused?  How could Calpurnia be the mother she never had, and now keep her at arm’s length like she was just "any white woman"?  And Henry was so like her, yet he was a coward, ready to go along to get along in his political career.  Atticus, and indeed all of Maycomb, to Scout’s huge disappointment are hopelessly flawed.<br/>  Jean Louise does battle with these conflicts, and when the dust settles, she figures out a way to be, because the child who understood about mockingbirds grew into the woman who understands about justice--in nations and in families.  She heeds the watchman of her conscience, and with courage and humor, she is forever our Scout.
This is the book Harper Lee originally wrote and was encouraged to follow Scout's childhood memories, which was a very minor part of this book. As a result of her editor's genius, we were gifted with To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee should have shared her Pulitzer with her editor, since the original is garbage. I couldn't wait to finish it just to be done with it.
In Go Set a Watchman, Harper Lee explores the racism embedded in Southern culture, and she is marvelously perceptive. Jean Louise is disgusted by the blatant racism expressed by her neighbors, but she is not surprised--she has encountered such attitudes her entire life. What does surprise her is discovering that her father is not the champion for racial equality she had believed him to be. Her world is shattered when she realizes that her father is racist.<br/><br/>It is in the character of Atticus that Lee demonstrates marvelous perception. Jean Louise believes at first that her father has turned racist, but she discovers that he has, in fact, always been racist. Atticus is not the kind of blatant racist who spews forth hate speech, but he is no less racist. He believes the black race to be inferior, and he believes in racial segregation. But he also has a rigid code of justice that requires him to protect the downtrodden, the way one would protect a child--or a mockingbird. Because desegregation threatened his orderly world, he chose to fight it. His support of segregation made Jean Louise see her father clearly for the first time.<br/><br/>Watchman unlocks Mockingbird, giving us a clearer understanding of Southern culture and the Civil Rights movement. As a stand alone book, Watchman would be difficult to appreciate. It is raw and cynical and sometimes vulgar. As an extension of Mockingbird, Watchman is fantastic.<br/><br/>I've read that Watchman was Lee's first attempt to publish a novel, but her editor sent her back to rewrite it and thus Mockingbird was born. If that is true, I believe Lee hoped to return to Watchman someday. It seems that Lee realized the world, like her editor, wasn't ready for Watchman. But she did not gut Watchman in order to create Mockingbird. They are two entirely different stories. In Mockingbird Lee tackled obvious racism, but in Watchman she went beyond the obvious to the heart of the issue--tolerance is not equality.<br/><br/>Mockingbird will forever be the favorite of many. On it's own merit, Watchman woukd likely never be the favorite of any. As an extension of Mockingbird, Watchman will be read and cherished, for it helps us to better understand our beloved.
I hated "To Kill a Mockingbird" as a freshman in high school. I just wasn't ready for it, I think, because when I went back and read it a few years ago I absolutely fell in love. I couldn't believe how well-written it was. So when I heard not too long after re-reading Mockingbird that there was going to be a new sequel published, I was pretty excited.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" did not live up to that excitement. It has almost none of the magic of Mockingbird, which often had me laughing out loud; Watchman barely elicited a few chuckles, and those only in the "flashback" moments where we see a little more of Scout's childhood.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong - I'm not necessarily criticizing Watchman because it didn't make me laugh. It's evident that it's meant to be a darker, more serious book, which makes sense given Scout's now-adult perspective. The problem is that every character felt almost completely caricatured. Whereas every single character in Mockingbird felt developed and important, down to the smallest side characters like Dolphus Raymond (who drank Coke from a paper bag pretending it was alcohol so people could feel better about his being in an interracial relationship), most characters in Watchman seem like talking heads. This is especially a tragedy when you consider that these flat characters were once so vibrantly interesting - Atticus and Scout are like the father/daughter icons of American literature, and here they feel like "characters" out of Plato (i.e., not so much characters as ideas given form).<br/><br/>Even worse, the ideas these characters are devoted to are obscure. I read somewhere that Harper Lee actually wrote this decades ago, shortly after Mockingbird, but that it just wasn't published until now. This explains but does not really excuse the fact that the issues are discussed obliquely, as if the author assumes the audience will know what she's talking about. But for those of us who didn't live through civil rights, that is not necessarily the case. As a literature and language major in college, I've studied my fair share of history, and especially American history, but I still often found myself confused as to what Scout or Atticus were actually so angry about.<br/><br/>Basically, I just often found myself thinking "I don't believe this character would say that or act that way" - a mental criticism I often have when reading and critiquing high school creative writing. Scout is pretty much yelling throughout the entire novel, completely unwilling to listen to anyone around her - we're meant to take her as a now-mature woman who has returned only briefly from the big city, but she comes off as petulant and annoying, in a way that we can't smile at as we may have in Mockingbird because she's no longer a pre-adolescent.<br/><br/>There are some high points. There are a few flashbacks interspersed into the text which give us a little more insight into Scout's life after the events of Mockingbird, but before she became an adult. These are generally as well-written as Mockingbird was - but, lacking any meaningful context into which to place them, they're easily forgettable. And I could even praise the general idea (***possible spoilers***) of the novel, which seems to be that even honorable men in the South, like Atticus, found themselves having to work with what we might consider the "bad/racist" groups that cropped up in reaction to civil rights. The idea that they were simply too small of a minority to achieve their goals without working to tame such groups from the inside is interesting - however, it's an idea that relies so much on "common knowledge" which may have been common in the 60s or 70s but is no longer in the collective unconscious, and that is hidden because we're stuck with Scout's perspective (i.e., raging incomprehension), that it can't save the novel.<br/><br/>I can't recommend the novel in good faith. I had trouble making myself finish reading it. You would be better off re-reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" and leaving your pleasant memories of the book and its author untarnished. Unless you are working on some sort of academic project regarding history or literature of civil rights, I can't see how this would be worth your time.
Thanks to the controversy surrounding the publication of "Go Set a Watchman," Harper Lee's first novel that languished unpublished for many years, the book has skyrocketed to the top of the bestseller lists. Does it deserve to be there? No, it does not, but it is an interesting and instructive work of fiction. Jean Louise Finch, now twenty-six, has traveled from New York to Maycomb to visit her family for "her fifth annual trip home." Atticus, her beloved father, has always been her moral compass. He is now seventy-two and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. His stuffy and moralizing sister, Alexandra, she of the "river-boat, boarding-school manners," lives with Atticus and keeps house now that Calpurnia has retired.<br/><br/>Lee's sense of humor is delightful; there are laugh-out-loud scenes and droll bits of dialogue that poke fun at the eccentric inhabitants of this Alabama town. In addition, Scout reminisces about her misadventures as a little girl and teenager. She thinks about Jem, her big brother who died too young. Most of all, she cherishes the solid upbringing she received from Atticus and Calpurnia, who always made her feel cherished and safe. Now, she is considering marriage to Henry (Hank) Clinton, a lawyer and Atticus's protégé.<br/><br/>Everything changes when Scout learn that her father (who once proclaimed "equal rights for all; special privileges for none") may be a bigot who believes that Southern blacks--with the help of the NAACP--are advocating for civil rights for which they are emotionally, educationally, and politically unprepared. Scout is crestfallen, for "the one human being she had ever fully and wholeheartedly trusted had failed her...." In a series of heated confrontations that Scout has with Atticus, her Uncle Jack, and Henry, Scout spews venom: "I cannot live with a hypocrite," she declares. For decades, she placed her father on a pedestal. Now her eyes have been opened to a new reality, one in which Atticus is a flawed and prejudiced individual whose opinions she finds repellant. Scout sadly realizes that she will never again be able to recapture the magic and innocence of her childhood<br/><br/>Ultimately, what works best in "Watchman" is not its message about racial equality, which is pounded home with the subtlety of a Mack truck, but its keen and critical portrait of everyday life in a place where everyone knows everyone else's business; people are polite to your face while they vilify you behind your back; change is glacially slow; and women's rights and racial equality are as yet unrealized dreams. On the other hand, there is warmth, camaraderie, and a feeling of fellowship in Maycomb that may be missing in most big cities. Like the elderly Atticus, "Go Set a Watchman" is imperfect. In spite of all the money "Watchman" is raking in, it is not likely to become a classic. This first effort is heavy-handed and unfocused, but still worth reading. We get the chance to observe how the characters and the author's perspective changed between "Watchman" and the completion of Harper Lee's masterpiece, "To Kill a Mockingbird."
4.5 stars!<br/><br/>Words to live by: "Every man's island, Jean Louise, every man's watchman, is his conscience."<br/><br/>Conspiracy theory much? Come on, people! Though it lacked the polished finish of an expert editor (reason for it not being 5 stars), Lee's writing is all over this book!<br/><br/>For me, GSAW was the perfect specimen of brilliant, masterful storytelling surrounding relevant subjects for both then and now. Though we were presented with a different version of Tom Robbins's trial, and our beloved Atticus has changed, I thought everything about this novel was very insightful as to the way the South thought back in the day, none of it deterring how I felt about any of these unforgettable, beloved characters.<br/><br/>GSAW is very much a product of the time it was written in (1950s/60s), but indeed not a product of the time in which it was published. To me, that shows leaps and bounds in our society. I see GSAW for what it appears to be: a first draft in which was eventually turned into a timeless classic, one I'm proud to say I enjoyed time and time again throughout my adulthood, following high school.<br/><br/>Is GSAW different from TKAMB? Yes, absolutely. But how couldn't it be? TKAMB was told through the pure, innocent, untouched eyes of Scout, GSAW explored from Jean Louise's much older, 26 year-old mind. If you go in knowing this, you won't be offended. Or shouldn't be, at least. And for those of you whom are, please explain why? I'm lost. Ms. Lee simply told the truth, the truth in which is still (sadly) sprinkled here and there throughout the world, let alone our country. Still, each and every day we make progress, so everyone just relax.<br/><br/>Either way, GSAW holds historical importance, and I'm happy to have read it, each turn of the page fulfilling everything my mind imagined it would be and then some.
Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee was not the sequel that I had wanted, but it wasn't the disgrace it was rumored to be either. Atticus Finch, one of my favorite literary characters of all time, was disappointedly revealed to be a racist. It turned To Kill a Mockingbird on its head and had this reader reconsidering all that I found so endearing and inspiring. Perhaps some would say that great literature will do that, cause you to rethink and reevaluate, especially your most valued and firmly held beliefs. I would have preferred to have preserved Atticus as he was portrayed in To Kill a Mockingbird. I understand that Mockingbird is told from the perspective of a child, a daughter who idolizes her father, but is it too much to ask that people of such fine character exist in both a child's viewpoint as well as from an adult perspective? There was something so special about Atticus Finch as he was portrayed in Mockingbird. He was the symbol of hope during a shameful period of history. I would like to believe that men like him exist.<br/><br/>Atticus Finch is a very complex character. In Watchman, the reader sees a flawed man. The forward thinker of Mockingbird is presented in Watchman as a man who shockingly believes in the separation of the races, and yet he values justice above all else.<br/><br/>I can see why Harper Lee's editor did not release this book first. Without Mockingbird, Watchman is little more than a rough draft. However, as Mockingbird's "sequel" it provides a great deal of insight into the true Atticus. He is neither all good nor all bad. Miraculously, Atticus remains a very likable character which is a real credit to the author. But, I also believe that this novel is much less about race, although certainly race plays an important role, than it is about child and parent. At some point a child matures and thinks for himself/herself, and may drastically differ with his/her parents' views. Watchman is saying that this okay; this is what we should want for our children. It doesn't need to divide us.<br/><br/>Watchman definitely required some editing. There were plot differences in the two stories that conflicted with one another. It was hard to follow the novel at points; the tenses changed and some of the dialogue was confusing. That being said, Watchman held my interest throughout and did a good job of keeping the characters authentic. On a side note, I would have liked to have found out whatever became of Miss Maudie. As a teen, I had always hoped that Atticus and Maudie would have married, but like Mockingbird that was just a young girl's dream. Many of the other Mockingbird characters are discussed though. Further, my children were as excited for the release of Watchman as I was; to have one book interest so many generations is simply a beautiful thing.
The outrage over this book is really amazing.  I knew going in that there was no way this could be anywhere near as good as To Kill a Mockingbird so I was not disappointed when it wasn't.  Mockingbird is one of my all-time favorites and apparently, this is the case with many others and you see that many are upset over the revelation of the true nature of Atticus Finch.  To me, though, this is fitting.  Atticus is a product of his time and place and this is shown clearly in Watchman.  Thinking back to Mockingbird, Atticus is a voice of reason and man of integrity.  Upon a closer look, however, he isn't really outspoken about his ideas of race.  He only defends Tom Robinson because the case was appointed to him and the man was clearly innocent.  In the eyes of Atticus, Tom didn't deserve an unfair trial simply for the color of his skin.  That doesn't mean Atticus believed in racial integration, though.  When Calpurnia sleeps over, she is on a cot in the kitchen.  These are only a few examples that I have found in Mockingbird that allude to, but don't hit you over the head with the fact that Atticus doesn't believe in integration of races.<br/>I also see Watchman as a perfect sequel to Mockingbird.  I'm SO glad Mockingbird was published first.  It draw a parallel with WIlliam Blake's Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience.  Mockingbird shows Scout as a very innocent young girl.  She learns some valuable life lessons in Mockingird and thus, loses some of that innocence but certainly not all of it.  In Watchman, her innocence is totally lost and by the end of the story she is a mature adult and has become her own person completely.  Atticus is no longer the infallible god that is seen through Scout's eyes in Mockingbird. He is a flawed human being.  In this way, Scout has now become the moral compass that Atticus was seen as in Mockingbird.  In fact, at the end of Watchman Atticus tells Scout how proud he is of her for standing up to him for what she believes.  She is the one that actually carries the traits that we all thought belonged to Atticus, and even then we see that Scout has some flaws herself (i.e. she wouldn't marry a "negro").  Clearly, this shows that to some degree Scout is also a product of her time and place.<br/>Those who are lambasting this book for its content, in my opinion, are not putting it into this type of context.  It is set during the time when desegregation was a hot-button topic much like same sex marriage is today.  It is set in the deep South where racial tensions were very high.  To me, the content and characterization is spot on.<br/>As for the literary views of it, it is definitely NOT the masterpiece Mockingbird is.  The ending feels a bit rushed, Uncle Jack's speeches are a bit drawn out, and the history of Maycomb County gets old very fast.  The childhood flashbacks are very interesting and fun to read.  It is clear to see why Harper Lee was advised to craft a story around those ideas.  With some proper revision and editing, I truly believe Watchman could have become a masterpiece, as well.  As it sits, though, it is still a great companion piece to Mockingbird.  I like how it made me think, how it made me feel uncomfortable, and how it made me miss the characters that I read about in Mockingbird.  This is, after all, exactly what Scout is thinking and feeling in Watchman and we are right there with her from the first page of Mockingbird to the last page of Watchman.
To Set A Watchman is both disappointing and disturbing. It is clearly a draft, not a final version, and should not have been published without a lot of additional work. The character development is fuzzy, the plot uneven, and the dialogue is hard to follow. It's also disturbing because it portrays one of the greatest characters in literature, Atticus Finch, as a racist who tries to rationalize his behavior. Jean Louise Finch, the adult Scout, appears to better, but her own racism is evident, too; it's merely a kinder, gentler racism.<br/><br/>This is not written well, and I find it difficult to believe that Harper Lee considered this to be a finished work. I believe that she discarded it when she took the characters and changed them and their story into one of the greatest, most inspiring and most moving novels of all time. To Kill A Mockingbird is without parallel in American literature. It taught many of us that even if we didn't recognize it, we had learned racism, even if it was thought to be benevolent. TO Kill A Mockingbird helped us learn that there is no such thing. As literature, it is one of the best written novels of all time, with a tight plot, brilliant dialogue, great character development, and beautiful, coherent narration. To Set A Watchman is none of those things. I wish it had been left on its shelf. Reading it damages my memory of two of my heroes, Atticus Finch and Harper Lee. Yes, I see the irony in that, as it is how Jean Louise is portrayed. I will go on believing that Harper Lee did not give fully competent consent to publish this book. I think people took advantage of her to make money off of a icon of literature.
I cut my teeth on mockingbird & I read it at least twice a year. When watchman was released I had decided not to read it since the reviews were so bad & the characters so different. I ran across it at the library & decided I'd give it a try. Bad move. First of all it took 100 pages to get the meat & potatoes of the novel. Once it finally got to the point, I wished it was over!! They gave 2 sentences in the whole book about Jem's death. Jem, the main characters only sibling & confidant. Then 2-4 sentences in the entire book about Dill, her childhood friend. But majority of the book focused around some kid named Henry, who was not in mockingbird at all, & could've been left out of watchman altogether. He was pointless. Cal, the woman who raised her, ran away after Jem's death & now doesn't know who Scout is....WHAT?!?! Aunt Alexandra is pretty true to form, but Atticus calling her Zandra?? Not once in mockingbird was that in there. The major change in Atticus didn't bother me as much as it did others, maybe because i read the reviews & I knew it was coming. And finally Miss Jean Louise Fitch. Wow. This beloved character is now a whiny, childish, silly young woman. She was more mature as the child we knew In mockingbird. Even the description of Maycomb was odd. Not nearly as fluid or beautiful as described in mockingbird. Bottom line: after reading this first draft I see why Mockingbird was written, how it became the classic piece of literature that it is & I thank God I read mockingbird first.<br/>PS: I quit Watchman with 6 pages to go. I just didn't care enough to see how it ended. I couldn't read one more word.
The music industry is replete with so called "one hit wonders" and the literary world is no stranger to this phenomenon either.  Although a great fan of Harper Lee's marvelous master work of American literature, "To Kill A Mockingbird" it pains me to say that similar accolades cannot be awarded for "Go Set A Watchman".  That there was quite a bit of controversy about this book's release so many decades after Lee's one and only novel and her staunch refusal to write/release anything else.  This book is packaged to look like TKAMB down to the cover art and font.  Really, about 4/5ths of this story works OK.  The reader is reacquainted with Jean Louise "Scout" Finch now a young twenty-something home to Maycomb, AL from her new life in NYC.  Lee (or her proxy) pleasantly bring us up to date with her revered father, Atticus and her other relatives and towns folk.  It's not particularly thrilling but the author has an engaging style and it's nice to reminisce with "Scout".  Then, as we reach the home stretch the book suddenly turns into a long, tiresome diatribe about the civil rights movement, NAACP, state's rights, voting rights, etc. as "Scout" excoriates her father after finding out he's maybe something of a racist.  The tone does not feel right and the book ends somewhat abruptly and unrealistically leaving a bad taste in your mouth.  Sadly it would seem the aging author may indeed have been taken advantage of by others in an effort to wring more money from an incomplete or unworthy manuscript as speculated by some. 2 1/2 stars at best.
I went back and read TKAM before reading this.  I wish I'd stopped at the end of "Mockingbird."  This new offering -- well, to be blunt, it just isn't that good of a read.  I could sympathize with Scout's (Jean Louise) conflicted feelings as she revisited her home, and discovered new sides to the people she loved.  These were the most interesting parts of the book.  But the conversations with Uncle Jack got really tedious -- if I met the man in person, he would be annoying at least, and might even seem to be mentally unhinged.  His endless literary and historical references added little to the story at hand.  Calpurnia?  We see her for about two pages -- disappointing.  And Atticus?  I just don't know how to feel about him -- and a better book would have more clearly explained his feelings and motivations.  I kept hoping this book would wrap things up nicely.  Not necessary redeem Atticus.  It wasn't mandatory to make him back into the hero we've all loved for fifty years.  But do "something" with him -- I was at least hoping to understand what made him "tick" by the end of this book.  He didn't have to turn out to be an angel, but it would have been nice to at least understand him, and to have his daughter understand him.  I didn't get that.  He seems to be a blank slate -- almost as annoying as Uncle Jack's endless ramblings.  If you're a "Mockingbird" fan, you might want to avoid this one.  I wish I had.
So disappointing, but really no surprise.  I only read it because my misguided book club chose it as a selection.  From the back story I've seen about how it came to be published I can only say how sorry I feel for poor Harper Lee, and her late sister.  It's so obvious why neither wanted it published and I have no doubt that Ms. Lee would have destroyed the manuscript if she found out the plans for it while still of sound mind.  It's a bad book, really more of a polemic than a novel.  The character of Atticus is a mere shell of what he was in Mockingbird, and he's not substantial enough to carry the enormous weight that the book attempts to place on him. I took the opportunity to re-read Mockingbird (for the first time in 45 years) and was so impressed with the language and the characters and the stories of a small Southern town.  It really struck me what a distinctive and Twain-ish voice Lee had in the book.  That language and voice are largely absent from Watchman, unfortunately.  Comparing the two books make me appreciate what a marvelous editor she must have had to go from Watchman to Mockingbird.  And the fact is that Mockingbird so skillfully makes the point that I think Watchman was aiming at (tho' not entirely sure of that) without slamming the reader over the head.  Bottom line, I wouldn't bother reading Watchman unless you want to compare to Mockingbird.  As a stand alone novel it is pretty horrible.
I was very disappointed in Lee Harper's new book.  It was poorly written and just an OK story.  To Kill a Mockingbird is an excellent book so I was expecting the same quality.  Did not happen.  It was chosen for our book club and most of us were disappointed.
It shouldn't be hard to reconcile the Atticus of Mockingbird to the Atticus in Watchman. He was born only twenty years after the end of the Civil War and raised in a strictly segregated society... so, anyone who would expect him to wholeheartedly embrace integration and full civil rights for blacks would want to read a fairy tale. In Watchman, Atticus reacts like we'd expect him to when outside forces threaten the social structures of his world. Having been born and raised in the South myself, I've known many people like Atticus: kind and fair to black people on an individual basis, but very uneasy when considering them on the whole. Atticus' noblesse oblige which we admired in Mockingbird should not be mistaken for a true belief in equality for all. Watchman is a fine book and I was able to read it without impacting the tenderness I've always felt towards Mockingbird.
Shame on Harper Lee's editor for first promoting this book as showing Atticus a racist and second for publishing it as a novel!  At best, it's a novella, and a better editor would have instead submitted it to a magazine as a short story.<br/><br/>One plods through a couple hundred pages waiting for the proverbial shoe to drop.  It's not until the last 40 or so pages that there is an explanation for what Jean Louise "thinks" is going on, and it is indeed fascinating and discussion worthy - - states' rights, post WWII social and economic changes, returning veterans of color, old vs. new social mores in the Deep South, forced integration, "outsider" meddling, etc.  Mind you, we find out that Jean Louise has gone off to Atlanta to college, and since graduation, has lived in New York City, with only vacation time spent back in her hometown.  She is so totally clueless, although she has been out in the "real world" of one of the world's largest, cosmopolitan and diverse cities, even in 1952, one has to wonder has she been living in a bubble?  I was so disappointed that the plucky and courageous Scout turned into a dim shadow of her former self, or at least came across as one.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed learning a bit more about the Finch family I wish that was woven into "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I was also sad to learn of Jem's death.
Reading it made it clear why it was not published when it was written.  It has value only to be able to compare it with "To Kill a Mockingbird" and, if not used in that way, perhaps should not have been published at all.
Awful plot.  Completely contradicts To Kill A Mockingbird. The part where Scout's uncle slapped her twice is silly, especially when she didn't retaliate.  Atticus's explanation for the Citizens Council is ridiculuous.
The original is my favorite book and this one was pretty terrible. All of the characters you love are not the same. I would have quit halfway through but I thought it would get better. Plot spoiler: It didn't.
I can see why the first editor sent it back for rewrite into "To Kill a Mockingbird". The conflict between the protagonist (Lee) and her father is overwrought and almost sophomoric.
This isn't an "easy" read.  It makes you think - especially think - when you don't really want to considering everyone has been beaten down by the topic of race.  Thinking deeply about that is not a bad thing, nor something to be feared as long as there is honesty.  But, in the end, this story was more about a young woman becoming an individual, adult woman.  Race issues was the vehicle that brought about Scout's breaking free from her chrysalis and in joining the human race during the time frame the book tells it's story.  I think a lot of people are going to have a lot of issues with this book for varied reasons - race equality -certainly, gender equality - yes, and even, though "it" being of a time when such things were more accepted, a man hitting a woman.  This whole book is written in a moment in time past and for a woman today a lot of it bristled me.  In the end, I liked how it made me think.  I liked how it made me examine it and how it applied to myself and my own Father.
This book has to be a fraud. It is possibly the worst book I have ever read. I re-read To Kill A Mockingbird before reading this new book. The writing style is not even close to Harper lee's style. Watchman is told in the 3rd person and Mockingbird is told in the first person from Scout's point of view. Why on earth would Scout not narrate the follow up story? Some descriptions of the characters and settings are lifted word for word from Mockingbird, and the multiple story lines of To Kill A Mockingbird are reduced to a single narrative of a south that yearns for the "good ole days" of inequality, or at best reduces African Americans to the mentality of reckless children.  This "new found novel" reads more like modern right wing rhetoric than anything Harper Lee would write in 1960.  For these reasons, I believe this book is a fraud put upon the public. It should be filed under G for garbage. Spend your hard earned cash on a more legitimate novel.
I'm glad I read "Go Set a Watchman", but I wish it had not been published. I hope Ms. Lee is being shielded from some of the harsher criticism of this early novel which is so clearly a first draft.<br/><br/>The story is likely a realistic portrait of small-town south in the 1950s grappling with the Supreme Court's handing down of Brown versus the Board of Education, Civil Rights workers, and the inception of the NAACP. Many southerners felt the federal government was over-reaching by pushing segregation on them, reasoning that the states would "get to it in good time". That's part of the story, the other part is a depiction of a young woman's realization that her father is not the paragon of virtue, truth, and honor that she believed him to be. It's a universal experience; the grief of discovering that your idols have feet  of clay.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" was what Harper Lee wrote before two and a half years of excellent writing and editing brought us "To Kill a Mockingbird". It's a testament to the value of a good editor (and yeah, maybe Truman Capote DID have a hand in it - who knows?) because "To Kill a Mockingbird" IS a True American Classic. It should not be compared to its original rough draft, and that is why I wish this draft had not been published. Sadly, I suspect greed was the catalyst.
What a disappointment.  First the narrator, Scout, it completely insufferable in this book.  But the worst part of this book is how Atticus Finch is totally destroyed! I loved the character of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird.  He is an American icon.  To have him shattered in this book was truly devastating.  I know some of you out there may say it makes him more real because it exposes his flaws.  But what is wrong with having someone like Atticus to look up to and to aspire to.  It gives you hope of utopian idea of justice for all.  I wish I had never read this book.  Now I can't ever think of Atticus Finch without thinking of how in this book he has been completely undermined and all the good he did in To Kill a Mockingbird, has been undone with this careless stroke of the pen.  What a shame!  If you love To Kill a Mockingbird and revere Atticus Finch, do not spoil things by reading this book!
I am glad I read the book, should make for a good BookClub discussion,  but it was disappointing. I found it very disjointed. Too many story lines that never came together and the characters were not particularly likable especially Jean Louise (scout). To Kill a Mockingbird was much better written both in the story it told and stylistically. I struggled with detecting any kind of plot except that apparently all Southerns are racist bigots except for Scout. The ending was abrupt and rudderless. Did she move home, did she forgive her father and Hank?  The character was so self centered I guess this should not have come as a surprise.<br/><br/>Born in the mid fifties in Alabama I am a southern through and through. My ancestors have lived in South since before the Civil War. Although many of her depictions of the south in the 50s were accurate many were over stated and globalized. Like every woman is a boring housewife that spouts off their husbands beliefs, although "coffees" were a staple. And the prolific use of the N word.  In polite educated society in the south the N word was never used or permitted. I know it was not permitted in our home.<br/><br/>Evidently no one but Scout was open minded and understood the necessity of desegregation. This certainly was not true. Many people in the south, white and black, struggled with desegregation. But many realized the need for a better system, something more fair....even if some of the tactics were disagreed upon. Although awful things have happened in the south, even in that period of our history not everyone looked down or thought poorly of people who were a different color.<br/><br/>In my opinion she wrote this book to prove to her NY literary society cronies that yes just as they suspected everyone in the south is a racist bigot except for Scout AKA Harper Lee.  At some point I think she rethought this book and the harshness of its depiction of Southerns and decided to write something that showed yes Southerns do have a sense of justice. And yes there are heroes and giants as well as scumbags and bigots, just like there are everywhere.<br/><br/>I also thought the scene where her Uncle slapped her not once but twice and hard enough to injure her weird and unrealistic. Slapping women was not acceptable practice. I found it odd that Scout had no problem with this, being the supposed enlightened modern woman she thought herself to be.<br/><br/>I thank God this was never published in the fifties. One I don't think it would have been a success for Harper Lee so she may never have written TKAM and two it would have only reinforced negative, over dramatized, not universally, true southern stereotypes at a volatile time.
This is book that will be read out of curiousity but quickly forgotten. After reading it (in a matter of three days) it is pretty superficial given the subject matter that it's attempting to tackle and just has no great insight to offer. This is obviously a book that was never meant to be published and had the author had her way would have either blocked its publication or perhaps totally rewritten it. The core idea of a young woman educated beyond the bubble of her hometown and returning to see things in a different perspective is an interesting one, but not when it employs such iconic characters as Scout and Attiucus Finch. I am not aware of the history of To Kill a Mockingbird only that (as read on Wikipedia) that the publisher suggested that Harper Lee should write a book focusing on Scout as a young girl. The characters seemed to have had a deep root in Lee's mind to go on and create the American classic we all know and will be reread for generations to come. This will not be the fate for Go Set A Watchman. Apart from a few interesting passages but the pacing is hopelessly sluggish and gets confusing when it suddenly slips into long flashbacks that tend to go nowhere before we are unceremoniously thrown back into the present narrative, sustaining a serious case of literary whiplash. Had this been about an entirely different set of characters it might have been a slightly less unpleasent reading experience. Atticus Finch is among the great literary characters (as well as great fictional fathers) and see him portrayed in this book was very depressing. I just dismiss this as a shameless cash grab for one and all who were active in publishing a book author had forgotten. The nefarious circumstances behind it's publishing seem not to be all that improbable after reading the finished work.
Comments and discussions are flying around everywhere regarding the release of Harper Lee's long lost manuscript. One of America's most cherished literary characters, Atticus Finch is now seen in a different light. The image so indelibly imprinted in our minds is the elegant and thoughtful Gregory Peck, sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, portraying the southern gentleman as a kind and intelligent father. In Go Set a Watchman, we may begin reading with that image in mind, but it fades within the first few pages. Another man begins to emerge: thoughtful, yes, judicious, yes, elegant- maybe not so much. What we do see is a very real portrait of a man seen not through the eyes of a young girl, but as a fully fleshed human being, caught up in the changing times. It is surprising to see him clinging to old ways of thinking, and it is slightly horrifying to our modern sensibility. Advance copies given to members of the press yielded the news that our beloved Atticus Finch was a racist.<br/><br/> Having traveled in Jim Crow's south in my youth, I have a picture of what life looked like back then. We took frequent train trips from Toronto down to Florida. You had the white south and the “colored” south, clearly divided.  It was as if each place had two different cultures, living side by side, but with one having the best of everything and the other, out on the fringes. You would see blacks lining up for the bus in maids uniforms, or in overalls with mechanics rags in the back pocket, but rarely in any other roles.  One clearly served the other, and for the most part relationships seemed to be jovial. The courtesy delivered on both sides of the great divide was clearly evident to me. Somehow I got the idea, probably from my grandmother, and mother and father that the whole subject was off limits and in polite society, the great divide was not discussed. Efforts should be made to be extra courteous at all times, given the difficulties of the whole history and structure. That is the very crux of the matter that Scout attacks in Go Set a Watchman. Having lived in New York and returning to her hometown, she is no longer willing to hush up.<br/><br/>Going back to what I learned from my parents was more in keeping with the Finch household that Scout thought was the one in which she lived.  Every chance should be given to helping people improve their lives. I was never given the impression that intelligence, or certainly athletic ability was any way inferior. It was more that time and circumstance had created this unfortunate situation, and that change was inevitable. So reading Go Set a Watchman had me pulling for the grown- up Scout to whom I felt so endeared.  Harper Lee has an astonishing voice.  Not publishing this novel had nothing to do with Lee's talent as a writer; it had everything to do with its content. What I came away with is an understanding of the craft of writing a novel. Any writer has freely flowing ideas, and things he or she wants to say. Issues, statements, and a desire to create change can keep many a person typing away late into the night. She found the characters, she found her voice, she ripped the scab off polite society in the south and exposed a great deal of fear and ignorance. The story that became To Kill a Mockingbird is embedded here.  You see that she did get to have her say, but in a totally different way. I found I was in awe of her editor. Why she did not continue writing more books is a mystery. How she had the courage to begin again after hearing she need to go back to the drawing board is a great testament to her character. Any writer who reads this may well fish out those buried manuscripts and look at them in a new light. Is there one aspect that can be salvaged? What drew me to the character in the first place, and how do I focus on that more fully? Go Set a Watchman may detail a very universal experience in the lives of young women. There is the father you saw at nine, the man with the answers, the work ethic, the discipline and the good judgment versus the flawed human being you confronted later in life. The girls who went from climbing trees and playing with the neighborhood boys to the teen who was criticized every single day in order to make a lady of her often do have something to say. I loved Lee's brashness, her intelligent voice, her saucy wit and her guts to challenge the archaic social mores.<br/>With events in Charleston unfolding as they have in the last while, perhaps this long- buried story has emerged at just the right time.
Go Set A Watchman starts with Jean Louise Finch or Scout returning to Maycomb, Alabama from New York City, where she has been living to visit her father Atticus who is in his 70’s and is suffering with rheumatoid arthritis.  Atticus’ sister Alexandra is staying with him to help him out. We also are reintroduced to Atticus’ brother Dr. Finch who has an imperative role in this book.<br/><br/>We learn that Scout has a man she likes named Henry Clinton that lives in Maycomb and that is a lawyer and thinks highly of Atticus, but that he is from a red necked white trash family, but has made good for himself becoming a lawyer.  Even though Henry has made good for himself becoming a lawyer, he is still thought by many in the community as white trash because of his kinfolk.  Apparently in the south once you are white trash, you will always be thought of this way, in the same sense once you are thought of as the “Negro” maid or help you can never be thought of differently in the south.  Aunt Alexandra tells Scout, “I would like to remind you of a few facts of life… I’m quite sure you know those facts already, but there a few things you in your wisecracking way don’t know, and bless goodness I’m going to tell you.  You are as innocent as a new-laid egg for all your city living.  Henry is not and never will be suitable for you. We Finches do not marry children of red necked white trash, which is exactly what Henry’s parent were when they were born and were all their lives. You can’t call them anything better. The only reason Henry’s like he is now is because of your father took him in hand when he was a boy, and because the war came along and paid for his education. Fine a boy as he is, the trash won’t wash out of him….”  Aunt Alexandra tells Scout this in the beginning of Part I to show us foreboding of what is going to happen later in the story. She tries to explain about the view in her hometown and its people.<br/><br/>Scout reminisces about growing up in Maycomb that are amusing. She tells an amusing story about getting her first menstruation and thinking she was dying. Her father raised her after her mother died, and never explained about the changes that would happen to a girl. The Negro house maid Calpurnia ends up explaining it to her after it happens, but never told her about the birds and the bees. Turns out later the girls in school scare Scout thinking that she can become pregnant from kissing a boy, and for 9 months after kissing a boy she thinks she is pregnant and surprisingly doesn’t tell anyone her fearful thoughts until she almost kills herself.  Scout tells of other amusing stories that happened to her going to a dance with Henry. We learn that Scout is intelligent, but may not have much common sense. We also learn that Atticus as good a father he is, he may be flawed in not teaching his daughter the facts of life and about the changes her body will take.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the part when Scout goes to a ladies luncheon that her aunt organizes and she speaks to the different ladies in the community some young, and some old and she realizes she has many different views about things. One lady hears that Scout lives in New York City and mentions that she visited NYC last spring. Scout asks her if she liked NYC, the lady says she had a marvelous time, but wouldn’t dream of living there. She then goes on to say “Well, I wouldn’t want to get mixed up with all those Italians and Puerto Ricans. In a drugstore one day I looked around and there was a Negro woman eating her dinner right next to me, right next to me. Of course I knew she could, but it did give me a shock.” Scout asks, “Did she hurt you in anyway?” The lady replies, “Reckon she didn’t. I got up real quick and left. I don’t see how you live up there with them.”  Scout then says, “You aren’t aware of them. You work with them, eat by and with them, ride the buses with them, and you aren’t aware of them unless you want to be… The lady says I certainly noticed them and asks Scout, You must be blind or something.  Scout says, “Blind, that’s what I am. I never opened my eyes. I never thought to look into people’s hearts, I looked only in their faces. Stoned blind… Mr. Stone. Mr. Stone set a watchman in church yesterday.”<br/><br/>This refers to Isaiah Chapter 21, verse 6 which was mentioned in the Sunday sermon that Scout went to the other day at church with her family.  “For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:”<br/><br/>“He should have provided me with one. I need a watchman to lead me around and declare what he seeth every hour on the hour. I need a watchman to tell me this is what a man says but this is what he means, to draw line down the middle and say here is this justice and this is that justice and make me understand the difference.”  As the book progresses, you realize Scout does need a watchman to explain what she is seeing and hearing in her old town.<br/><br/>This discussion Scout has with this lady, seems to have a profound impact on her about her small town. She also witnesses her father leading a KKK meeting which shocks her and us all the reader. We are Scout, feeling that Atticus is this flawless man, but in reality no man is flawless and that is really the crux of this book. I think by this being the 2nd book that Harper Lee has published the impact of Atticus being this amazing man, but in reality a man with flaws comes through and never would have come through if this book was published first.<br/><br/>I did enjoy how Harper Lee wrote, and found the book a fast read and I highly recommend this book, but I feel that you should watch the movie or read To Kill a Mockingbird before reading this book, to get its true impact. I also did have an issue with calling Scout, Jean Louise, instead of Scout even in my review, so please excuse me for that. I feel there has not been much said about Scout's uncle, Dr. Finch for hitting Scout, which just seemed like abuse and totally wrong for a man to hit a woman and there should be something said about this violence in the book.
Poorly written - reads like a novel for junior high students. No story. Contrived scenes to use as a springboard for dialogue.  Undeveloped characters and storylines.  Yawn - wasn't expecting a masterpiece but, sorry to say, this shouldn't have ever been published. Money grab. Nothing more.
If Harper Lee had published this one first, she'd never have been famous. This reads like a whining retrospective condemnation of one's small Southern town roots, and the character of Scout aka Jean Louise comes off as a spoiled brat. Following her thorough the return to Smallville is not pleasant, and slogging through the book was not an easy read. I had to make myself keep picking it up, just because I had paid for it, and because I was supposed to like Harper Lee. Afterall, To Kill a Mockingbird was such a slam-dunk, taught in schools across America for years, praised for its respect for the minority characters of Jim and Boo, and offering a heart-warming view of a little girl's perspective on grown up issues. This book, GSAW is not that book.
While I much prefer "Mockingbird" to "Watchman", this is also a coming-of-age book - for Jean Louise as an adult.  I would have liked to see Jem and Calpurnia's characters and thoughts on the situation included also.  More of Atticus and the townspeople too.<br/>It is a definite read for everyone though, and provides a different outlook on the racial situations than "Mockingbird" did.<br/>I wonder why Ms. Lee, in writing this novel first, put such a different spin on Atticus in "Mockingbird".  It must have been difficult to view him in a completely different way in "Mockingbird" -- a child's view of her hero vs. an adult's view of a man.<br/>I will read it again, and again.
Wow, people gave this 5 stars??? No friggin way this is 5 stars. I read To kill a mockingbird probably 2 dozen times in my life. Reading it always transported me to the depression Era south. Even reading it as an adult. I don't believe these two books were written at the same time by the same author. Go set a watchman is absolutely flat. The storyline is totally one dimensional. Of ALL the characters in TKAM you got to know in this book there's only two return for this story. Book was very easy to close and shut the light off to go to sleep. This was one of those books when you read the last word and turn the page expecting another chapter you're like waitaminute?!?! That's it?!?!?! Blah, very disappointed.
I derive no pleasure from writing this review. TKAM is one of my favorite books of all time, so this is particularly difficult to do.<br/>This book should never have been published. It is the first draft of an aspiring writer, albeit articulate and certainly talented as seen in her later novel, and lacks so many of the attributes a good novel should have. There is little to no plot. I suppose someone could argue that Scout's awakening, her character arc, could act partially as plot, but that would be weak. There are certainly plot threads, but those were never followed through--Zeebo's vehicular manslaughter, for one. There's a reason the author was told to go back and try again, to capitalize on what she does best, which is to tell the story of Scout and her childhood and how it shaped her and the world around her during a racially charged era. And Lee did it and did it well. This novel should have been kept in a box as a learning tool--like many authors' first novels--and never seen the light of day. I did enjoy some scenes, moments, lines, but they were caught up in a whirlwind of confusing prose and chaotic dialogue. So sad. In any case, it is not my habit to write bad reviews unless I feel I have been duped. And I feel I have, but not by the author. Those who brought this novel into light should be ashamed of themselves.
In retrospect, it seems fitting that we all knew and came to love Scout as her young self before we had her almost-grown-up self to get to know and come to terms with. Harper Lee's two masterpieces, it turns out, were published in the right order. And, honestly, I'm not sure we were ready for this second installment until now. This riveting story speaks directly to the world we live in today, grapples with the sociopolitical issues we are struggling with in 2015, and admits there are no easy answers nor simple solutions to the problems that divide people. Nonetheless, as it was with Ms. Lee's first installment, we still have Jean Louise's tenaciously hopeful belief that what's right and good and true will ultimately win out over what's wrong in the world, and we're still hoping with and rooting for Scout as we have been since she first arrived on the scene 55 years ago.
This could have been an interesting book about a young woman returning home to the South in the late 50s. I was more than willing to read it on its own merits without comparing it to TKAM or obsessing over the "revelations" about Atticus being a racist and not a hero. But this book was very disappointing, both in terms of plot and writing. (Spoiler alert) Hard to tell how heavily it was edited to anticipate the fallout over Atticus, because there was an awful lot of overly neat wrapping up at the end where Jean Louise was made to understand that in order to become an adult, she had to separate from and stop worshipping her flawed father. And by made to understand I mean the scene where her uncle hits her so hard he apparently knocks some sense and acceptance into her. Really? Being hit hard enough to require medical attention (from the very person who hit her) is the big awakening in this novel? I found that disturbing. As for the writing, there are a few nice turns of phrase and some descriptions of childhood memories that are vivid and engaging. But the present day writing sections seem forced and stilted. Lots of Monologues With Important Points rather than natural dialogue or narrative. As an artifact, an okay read, but certainly not an important or well written work.
Characters not convincing or memorable, writing not the caliber of first novel, publisher exploiting the public.
Grade: D<br/><br/>I've read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, one of my all-time favorite books more times that I can count on one hand. Atticus Finch was the father I wished I had, resting comfortably and firmly atop a high pedestal. Scout Finch accompanied Jo March were childhood my literary heroines.<br/><br/>When I heard Atticus became a racist in GO SET A WATCHMAN, my initial thought was to cancel my kindle preorder. Then, upon reflecting (and seeing that the price had risen $4) that children see their heroes as perfect, adults see their flaws and admire them anyway, I decided to give the novel a try.  I gave myself permission to stop reading, skip to the end, or disregard the entire book as something Harper Lee may never have wanted published. She certainly didn't want WATCHMAN published in the over 50 years before her sister died. Did she decide to publish in her final years, reportedly deaf and blind? Was she pressured? Did she have the cognitive faculties to make the decision? Did she even know?<br/><br/>WATCHMAN was written before TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, so calling it a sequel or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD 2 isn't exactly accurate, especially since Lee never published the book after MOCKINGBIRD'S success.<br/><br/>WATCHMAN lacked the voice and charm of MOCKINGBIRD. WATCHMAN'S plot basically boiled down to a young woman realizes the father she adores holds racist views and isn't the paragon of virtue she believes.<br/><br/>If WATCHMAN had been a character study of Jean Louise's (Scout) reconciliation of the father she worshipped as a girl and the man he is twenty years later, I might have been more engaged.  I preferred MOCKINGBIRD's first person narration from Scout to the WATCHMAN'S third person. MOCKINGBIRD'S writing was far superior, not surprising for a second novel.<br/><br/>Is WATCHMAN a victim of the brilliance of MOCKINGBIRD? Probably, but that doesn't mean if not for MOCKINGBIRD, WATCHMAN would be a decent book. I certainly would have never read it otherwise.<br/><br/>I think each reader needs to go into WATCHMAN with an open mind, and decide whether or not to read the novel based on what you want to get from it.<br/>Curiosity? Read<br/>Great literature? Not in my estimation<br/>Plot? Lower your expectations<br/>Multidimensional characters? Yes, but not fleshed out
I am very disappointed with the hype around this so-called "second novel". I'm on Chapter 8 and having to push my way through it, only to find the "second novel" is a very rough draft of "To Kill A Mockingbird". I believe this novel was published and hyped for greed. What other reason would could there be? I returned it for a refund. From one chapter to the next, it was destroying the vision Harper Lee so beautifully crafted in her masterpiece, "To Kill A Mockingbird". I didn't want to believe this book was published against her wishes, but after reading just the first eight chapters, I have changed my mind. Please don't waste your money. If you need to check it out for yourself, then visit the library.
I was skeptical about this book as I know that Harper Lee publicly stated she would never publish again. I didn't want to make the people who are exploiting her any richer so I borrowed this book from our local library.<br/><br/>I finished it last night. This book wasn't very interesting at all. The plot was slow and plodding. I had trouble finishing it. I'm so glad I didn't spend money on it.<br/><br/>I feel very sad that Lee's literary career will end with this book.<br/><br/>For others who are interested in Lee, I highly recommend the biography "Mockingbird" by Charles Shields.
The one thing I kept reminding myself while reading this book is that it is unedited and that Harper Lee never wanted it published.  While it was not a bad novel, it was in serious need of editing.  She would get lost in descriptions, then gloss over things that were more important.  I enjoyed seeing the woman Scout had become, but would have preferred a more interesting plot line.  The struggle is internal, and she missed the opportunity to mirror that struggle externally.  It  is a good book if you are looking  for nostalgia.  I just kept hoping for a little more.
It's clear why Harper Lee was asked to shelve this effort and try again. It just isn't very good or interesting. It falls far short of the scope and moral power that's Mockingbird. It is interesting to see what happens to the characters, and it poses some interesting ethical questions about having to sacrifice some of our morals in an attempt to fit in. But in the end I'm just not sure what this is, other than a curiosity. It reads like an alternate reality TKM, or maybe fan fiction. I recommend it only because people will be talking about it and it's always nice to have something to say. But understand this isn't really a sequel; it's a failed first attempt that led to something much better.
To my mind, this was neither a prequel nor a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird. If we had not had the context of TKAM this would have been an eminently forgettable coming-of-age story of a young woman I did not find particularly likeable interrupted by obscure literary references from her supposedly erudite uncle and peppered with the internal (and external) monologues typical of children on the verge of adulthood who KNOW what's right. The one saving grace of having this book published was that I re-read TKAM.
I was very disappointed in this new book of Harper Lee's. I fully expected to enjoy it as I had her previous book, To Kill A Mocking Bird. But it did not have anywhere near the substance of the other book. Which I was hoping it would as it is a continuation of the lives of the persons in the first book. I would not consider this book a "novel" as it focused on just one brief moment of their lives, with seemingly no conclusions of any kind. Sad to be so disappointed in a book I was so anxious to read.
Interesting look at a classic  in the making. Watchman isn't a true sequel to Mockingbird but it is well worth reading. The bare bones of the rape trial are mentioned but with enough differences that is not the same case. Much is made of Atticus's raceism  but if this was a true seqeal  would Miss Lee had put it in. Atticus evolved into a finer man in Mockingbird than the Atticus of Watchman. Read Watchman as a good first novel of a promicing writer. I am just sorry that Harper Lee didn't write more novels
When I heard about Harper Lee's lost manuscript, I wasn't sure what to expect.<br/><br/>According to the publisher, this novel was written before To Kill a Mockingbird, and the story takes place 20 years after the original.  Although it takes place 20 years later, it has flashbacks to the main character Jean Louise Finch's childhood.<br/><br/>Apparently, the publishers loved the flashbacks so much, they suggested she focus on that.  Rather than doing a simple edit, she started from scratch, with a younger Jean Louise Finch as the central narrator.  The result was the Pulitzer Prize winning classic To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Based on that, I expected the flashbacks to essentially overlap the original novel, but that wasn't the case.  Although the flashbacks didn't necessarily echo the originals, they essentially rhymed with it, so to speak.  The essence and spirit were the same, but the details were entirely fresh... and often very surprising.<br/><br/>I'm not of fan of giving away major plot elements, especially since this novel was only released this week, but I will say that you will see an even greater level of depth in these beloved characters because you will experience them at two entirely different stages in their lives.  I felt genuine sadness to read how time took it's toll on some of them, perhaps more than usual because I already have the images of them in my mind when they were younger and healthier.<br/><br/>Just like the original, this novel deals with some of the issues of racial inequality and injustice in the US as a whole, and in the south in particular.  It doesn't pull any punches.  There are some intensely emotional moments, and it reveals a side of our nation that are difficult for some people to admit still exist.<br/><br/>It's not surprising that the publisher may have felt that some of these issues were too complex and polarizing for that generation of readers, so their suggestion to focus on Jean Louise's childhood may have been their way of making it less controversial.  While To Kill a Mockingbird still contained plenty of this material, it wasn't as intense or as richly presented as it is here.<br/><br/>What Harper Lee has done in Go Set a Watchman is paint a rich and vivid picture of these issues, without passing judgement on any one particular group or their position and rhetoric, and that's why it's so magical.  She makes us think about these issues with an open mind, by showing us how these beloved characters face them.<br/><br/>The flashback moments give the characters depth, while also allowing us to laugh and think about our own childhood days.  They remind me of the playful moments in Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer.<br/><br/>As I write this in July of 2015, the thing that amazes me is that many of these issues are just as controversial today as when this was written.  In fact, many of them have just returned to the surface in light of the debate over the use of the Confederate Flag as a symbol of southern unity.<br/><br/>I purchased the Audible Audiobook version, so I would also like to mention that Reese Withersppon has done a fantastic job of the narration.  Her narration is perfect for this novel.  The funny thing is some of the storyline mirrors that of one of her films, Sweet Home Alabama, which is also about a girl from New York City who returns to her small town roots, where she's given the opportunity to reconnect with her childhood boyfriend.  I'm not sure if the publishers chose her because of it, but there is some similarity.<br/><br/>My final thought is that I am so happy that I listened to it.  I was sad to see some of the events unfold, but they gave me an even greater sense of the characters, and the issues.<br/><br/>I hope you found this review helpful.  Questions and comments are welcome.
**Spoiler Alert** some of the things I mention might be considered spoilers.<br/>This book is the Godfather III of literature, on it's own it might be OK, but in comparison it doesn't stand up so well.<br/>Scout who know goes by Jean Louise is now in her mid-twenties and is returning home to her hometown of Maycomb from New York. She's greeted at the train station by a new character, Henry Clinton the best friend of the now dead Jem and potential suitor for Jean Louise.<br/>Jean Louise uncomfortable makes her way among Maycomb visiting family and acquaintances. She become deeply upset and disillusioned when she witnesses Atticus and Henry attending a Citizen's Council meeting (more respectable version of the Klan assembled to resist integration). Jean Louise then gets in separate arguments with all her family members and Herny. The final and most acrimonious argument is between her and her father, a man to she had previously considered the embodiment of moral rectitude.<br/>Before the conflict over integration, the first 100 pages of this 270 page novel drag. The Book perks up occasionally for the flashback scenes of Scout as a child and adolescent. We get to see Scout as a tomboy is middle and high school, which I think will be the highlight for most fans of the Mockingbird. We see Scout attend prom and witness her fretting over whether she got pregnant from kissing a boy.<br/>Like a typical science fiction story the conflict is rapped up too neatly and quickly in the last few pages. There is a reason why Harper Lee took two years to rework this story. The characters, particularly Scout, had potential but most everything else needed to be reworked. This early draft should have remained unpublished. I think the best one say about this book is what Lee's editor initially thought, it's a first draft with potential.<br/>Commentary unrelated to the plot:<br/>I feel this manuscript should have remained unpublished. Or if published done so after Lee's death as an academic book about the editorial process and early development of a modern classic. I think the evidence strongly suggests that the book was published for the wrong reasons. Harper Lee had five decades to publish this early version and only "decides" to when she's in a nursing home and after her trusted sister/lawyer Alice is dead. This is a manuscript that Lee somehow forgot she still had and it was "found" by her new lawyer among some papers. A manuscript that was already rediscovered and examined when it was removed from a safety deposit box to be examined by a book appraiser and a literary agent. Lee's new lawyer, Tanja Carter, forgot to mention that she'd already been made aware of the book when it is was viewed at the bank with the safety deposit box.<br/>Lee's enormous success from Mockingbird and her frugal life style have no doubt left Lee quite wealthy. A frugal lifestyle which is illustrated in the boring, but no doubt truthful Mockingbird Next Door. The author got to know Harper and Alice Lee over several years and seems to have become quite close with the two. The author moved next door to the two, with their permission, and made known her intention to write a book on Harper Lee. It was only right before publication and again after Alice's death that Harper Lee "decided" to revoke approval for the book. Harper Lee also filed suit against the her hometown of Monroeville over the yearly stage production of To Kill a Mockingbird. The suit was settled out of court. Again this occurred after Alice died and Tanja Carter took over.<br/>What did Harper Lee stand to gain from publishing a first draft of her book that tarnishes the image of one of the most beloved characters in American literature?
I'm naturally skeptical of reviewers both professional and otherwise.  I just can't help wondering at the motives behind reviews be they monetary or just wanting attention.  That being said I felt that I had to throw my opinion out there after hearing more than one mainstream media review of Watchman.  Take it for what it is worth.<br/><br/>First of all I have been a fan of Mockingbird since I was first introduced to it in the eighth grade.  In preparation of reading Watchman, I reread Mockingbird and finished it literally two hours before beginning the "new" novel.  For all of the reviewers that claim Watchman is "so dark", I have to wonder when they have last read Mockingbird.  That novel is far from unicorns and rainbows.  It is pure Southern Gothic and is fairly dark in its own right.  In Watchman, as far as the character of Atticus being a "big, bad racist", I'm not reading it that way.  Yes he is opinionated and cantankerous but he is also twenty years older and in chronic pain.  Perhaps it is my background in geriatrics and working with seniors, but I don't find this change all that hard to believe.  Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, he wasn't Mr. Liberal in Mockingbird.  He believed strongly in the defense of Tom Robinson, but he also had some conservative beliefs as well.  Does this make him bad?  Not at all.  I think it speaks to Ms. Lee's writing abilities to create a character so multi-faceted.  As far as Jean Louise, I find her character to be exactly what I would have expected Scout to become.  I appreciate her humor and her observations of her family and hometown.  I have found myself to be confronted with the same troubles reconciling my personal beliefs with those expressed by my loved ones.  Her bittersweet responses to the changes in her hometown also resonate with my own experiences in watching my beloved childhood haunts shift with time.  Watchman is not set up with a standard plot per say and I look at it as more of a character study of the Finch family and the town of Maycomb itself.  There are plenty of books out there with this format so I'm not sure why so many people are "OHMYGOD" so upset about that.  Plenty of characters make a reappearance and it is not always a happy one however that is life.  Watchman is set 20 years in the future.  To have all of the characters living happily ever after would have been disingenuous.<br/><br/>So in closing am I glad that I purchased Watchman? Yes.  Will I reread it? Absolutely.  Do I feel Harper Lee has manipulated me out of my money? No.  Do I think her publishers and lawyers have committed a conspiracy against her?  I sincerely hope not.  Do I still love Atticus, Scout, and the Finch family?  Yes I do.  Do I recommend Watchman?  I do if you are curious as to Ms. Lee's version of the Finch's future.  If you prefer your own ending to their story than pass it up.
This is a remarkable story about a daughter and father we've learned to love. Jean Louise Finch has enshrined Atticus on a high pedestal, and in this book she discovers his humanity - evidenced in his illness and frailty as well as in his involvement in the resistance to court ordered integration. I identified totally with her shared in her shock and heartbreak as she learns disturbing things about her father.<br/>This book could not have been released at a better time. Our nation is presently embroiled in conflict over intrusive government and the right of a state to determine how things will be done within its borders. The story is like a wormhole between America in the Civil Rights Era and America now. People are haggling over the very same issues. Jean Louise' s Uncle Jack says it's like going through a second Reconstruction; I don't think it would be an exaggeration to view present events as a third.<br/>I hope readers remember that this was written almost six decades ago. Our modern sensibilities make it difficult to read, over and over, references to "wooly hair," "Negroes," and the n-word I can't bring myself to type. In the course of Jean Louise' s conversations with her Uncle Jack and with Atticus, we discover that even the most enlightened people at the time viewed African-Americans as not yet ready for full integration with white society. It's a distressing matter, and I am haunted by the possibility that this view still motivates some today. It's like an insidious form of racial exceptionalism.<br/>There is a lot more to this book, though, than the struggle of th a main character to understand and deal with the family and friends she thought she knew so well. We also get a fascinating picture of a young Southern woman who does not fit the pattern, who rebels against the petty social constraints of a small Alabama town. I particularly enjoyed her interactions with and thoughts about her Aunt Alexandra.<br/>Nothing in this book changes one jot or tittle of the glory of To Kill a Mockingbird.  When put together, the two works reveal a small world bound together by a social contract under attack. In both works, the danger is not from the Klan or the NAACP or the Supreme Court......the real danger is from the dark places in the human heart.
This will never be a classic. I didn't enjoy Scout's foul mood that permeates the novel.
I think I was expecting something on par with Mockingbird. Atticus had been such a hero of mine it was hard to read this version of him. It was also difficult to read all the racist rhetoric although I know it is probably much more representative of a small southern town in the day.<br/>I also wished that more information was given about what Scout was doing in NY; what her life was like in the North compared to the South.<br/>This might teach me to pre order a hardback in the future.
As had been marketed this book was actually a first draft of what later became a rewrite and renamed To Kill A Mockingbird.  It has also been reported that Harper said that she would not write another book.  In my opinion this book should have been left unpublished. If one had not read TKAM they would not understand the differences in the two books.  I was hoping it was going to be a sequel equal to TKAM.  I understand why the publisher rejected this manuscript when it was submitted.
Have to be honest and admit that I have not finished the novel. Started it with great eagerness after having taught "To Kill a Mockingbird" for 25 years and falling in love with every character and event in it. Not so for this one...slow, dull, dreary and lacking anything to motivate me to continue reading. Have read 3 other books since starting "Go Set a Watchman" and expect I will not finish it. Should have listened to the reviews. A great disappointment for me.
I read the book with no expectations.  I was disappointed in the poor plot line, in Scout's weak character, and in the ending, which settles nothing.
This novel needs to be treated as a novel separate from the classic To Kill A Mockingbird.  Although some of the characters share space in both novels, the characters are portrayed as almost separate people.  The most enjoyable portions of this novel are the reflective pieces, which speaks to the creation of TKAM as a novel that succeeds entirely in reflective narration.  As it stands individually, this would not have been published on its own merits.
What a disappointment. Her other book, "To Kill a Mockingbird" is my all time favorite book and this was a difficult book for me to read, I now understand why the publisher originally asked her to re-write this version. The style is so different, which is okay, but, its not the 'easy, gentle, read her first book was. I feel the change in the characters.....well they are just wrong. I'm disappointed, I wish I hadn;t read this version.
So sorry, but this was a real bomb compared to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  I was skeptical about what the naysayers had to say when it first was released, but I highly agree that I don't even rhink Harper Lee wrote it.  There may have been a rough outline put together by her, but it was a pitiful attempt to write s sequel.  It wasn't even a prequel.  Disjointed, out of character, choppy and contrived.  Ugh...sorry I wasted my time and money.
This story was a disappointment to me... I was reading and kept waiting for something to happen... yes, there were the bones of important  issues certainly, but I felt  that it didn't have enough of a story.  To Kill a Mockingbird is in a totally different elevated category of excellence.  I bought this because I was curious what Harper Lee's first thoughts were.  I can't imagine the leap she made from this manuscript to Mockingbird.
Go Set A Watchman is a novel that should have remained hidden away in the writer's past. Standing alone, it's an uninspiring tale of coming to terms with a great disappointment. Our fathers are seldom the superheroes we make them out to be.<br/><br/>Paired with To Kill A Mockingbird, this work is a good example of the need for and blessing of rewrites. Atticus Finch did not change into a bigot; the story was re-imagined.
I am still too...emotional to write a fully developed review and given what I've read of the reviews so far, there isn't much more to say.  This book was, most assuredly, NOT "To Kill a Mockingbird", but it is astounding in it's own right.  I agree with another reader who said that "To Kill a Mockingbird" would not have been the glorious, beloved novel that it is if this book had been published first; nor, would this book have packed the same punch.  I empathize so strongly with Scout in this book, more-so than I did with her in "To Kill a Mockingbird".  "Go Set a Watchman" allows the reader to witness the crumbling of a pedastal underneath one of the most beloved characters (and father) in all of literature and, eventually, his being unceremoniously knocked off of it by the person who idolized him the most.  It's a brilliantly written story and I can't recommend it enough.  In my view, Atticus Finch was not unrecognizable in this story.  He was merely revealed.  Anyone who has read "To Kill a Mockingbird" and was left with the same questions I have been all these years won't be entirely surprised.  What will shock you, especially in today's world, is the absolution he receives.<br/>On a different note, Scout really hasn't changed a bit.  She still makes me laugh.  But my heart broke right along with hers and I cried when she did.  Please give this book a chance.
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite novels.  It was with great anticipation that I awaited the release of this book.<br/><br/>I agree completely with another review that the writing style does not appear to be the same as TKAM.  I was also bored throughout many points in the book and found the character of Scout to be annoying.  When I got to the last page and saw "Prologue" I was amazed.  Where was the story?  Where was the plot?  Is the book over after a lot of flowery speeches and no action?<br/><br/>While I think that the author does a good job of explaining racism from multiple perspectives, there was no real story.  For example, one character is mentioned to gotten somebody pregnant, however the author never comes back to that point and so you're not sure how it fits into the entire picture.  There were many instances of this in the book...what appeared to be foreshadowing that actually didn't go anywhere.<br/><br/>I didn't find any of the characters to be likeable perhaps because we were given data about them without the background story.<br/><br/>I suppose that the merits of publishing this book could be to encourage beginning writers to keep trying.  If this was truly Harper Lee's publication, and TKAM followed this...then there's hope for anyone.
There were parts of the book that I found amusing.  I always enjoy novels written with a southern backdrop.  I thought the ending was very disappointing.  So much time and energy spent to reveal that the child eventually becomes self actualized and separates from their parent and develops their own value system.  Overall, the book held my interest to the end, but the ending was disappointing.
Harper Lee put this manuscript under lock and key because she knew it was a young writer's first attempt.  She never wanted it published because she died without publishing it.  This is a blatant money grab by whoever has the copyright.  It is a disservice to an American classic, "To Kill a Mockingbird, and an American institution, Harper Lee.  The publishers should be ashamed.
It is mind boggling to me to know that the author wrote this story before "To Kill a Mockingbird."  That book, published in the 1960s, was just the message we needed for the time.  This book, though delayed in publishing, is the same.  Had it been printed before, I don't think we would have been ready for it.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" moves in the same slow, syrup as "Mockingbird."  It contains the same anecdotal style: a series of stories, flashbacks, and poignant pieces of exposition that culminate in an unexpected conclusion.  Things are not always as they seem and sometimes even the people who know everything have something to learn.
God bless the talented editor who pulled To Kill A Mockingbird out of Harper Lee. I still love it, and see glimmers of it here, but this is uneven. I think it's crying out for an edit, and it's too bad Lee couldn't make that process happen now. I'm glad I read this, and there are some lovely moments that make me very happy. The opening as she travels home is full of wonderful details and evocative imagery. I especially love her memories of her early childhood, with Jem and Dill and Calpurnia. I loved the way she showed little bits of life in Maycomb--the conversations in the Coffee were stellar--and realized how she didn't quite fit in there.  Her quotations of poetry or cultural allusions dropped here and there largely lose me. There are soliloquies and pages of arguments that I wanted to cut way down with a colored pencil. Hank didn't have enough life for me to even get worked up over. For me, Atticus of TKAM  is not tainted. But he is human and he does live in this society in 1950s Alabama, and he has flaws. I thoroughly understand Jean Louise's disappointment and disillusionment and there is a part where it is well-put. But give me Scout over Jean Louise anyday.
At first I was skeptical. I had no desire to lose my love for the characters in To Kill A Mockingbird and my fear of being disappointed by Harper Lee's book delayed my indulgence. However, Harper Lee was not a one-hit wonder! I thoroughly enjoyed the new characters. My vision, perception, and love for Aticus was not diluted. Scout is still a character to be enjoyed.
Disappointing. How sad that this clunky and poorly structured novel becomes part of Harper Lee's legacy. I think that in the light of HL's poor health and her sister's death this appears to be a successful attempt for someone to profit from Harper Lee's stellar reputation by publishing what should have remained in manuscript hidden in a bottom drawer.
"Every man's island, Jean Louise, every man's watchman, is his conscience. There is no such thing as a collective conscience."<br/><br/>These words, spoken by Dr Jack Finch, brother to Atticus Finch and uncle to Jean Louise Finch, point to a central theme in Harper Lee's "Go Set a Watchman". To say the words are pivotal in the climax of the novel may be too trite as they form part of a larger exposition from Uncle Jack tying together many of the book's themes, including individuality, societal cohesion, early civil rights activism and making decisions that, despite their apparent horror and hypocrisy, may, if the gamble pays off, establish longer term benefits.<br/><br/>Anyone who has read (or viewed) "The Help" by Kathryn Stockett, could be forgiven for assuming it was based on "Go Set a Watchman": Southern woman in her mid-twenties returns from New York where she has been experiencing northern ways. She tries to integrate herself into her old society, one in which she never felt wholly comfortable in the first place, but still had good standing as a member of her family. She ends up confronting a significant parent about racist attitudes.<br/><br/>And this is the big story for fans of Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird". The headlines say Atticus is revealed as racist. There is room for this interpretation, though I think it is erroneous. Instead, "Watchman" is more about exploring the methods employed in working for the ideals espoused by Atticus in "Mockingbird" and idealised by both the child Scout and the adult Jean Louise Finch: not judging a person until you've walked in their shoes, equality and justice regardless of skin colour or creed.<br/><br/>However, the tension in "Watchman" is created by more complex issues than in "Mockingbird", despite the less complex plot. (There is no Boo Radley sub-plot here, although her romantic relationship with Henry Clinton serves to expand on the themes of identity and integration while also linking to delightful and skilfully woven vignettes from Jean Louise's childhood and teenage years). There are more specific allusions to historical incidents - Montgomery, a particular Supreme Court decision, the activities of the NAACP and the development of citizens' councils - many of which will escape most readers without study outside the text. The overall threat in the novel, as seen by Atticus and others, is the legislative intrusion by the north into the south, potentially bringing progress at a rate his community cannot handle.<br/><br/>These complex issues of the 1950s need more complex solutions than in "Mockingbird", just as Jean Louise's issues are more complex. Atticus can't fight a court case or shoot a rabid dog to fix things here. He also can no longer send Scout to bed with a story and a tidy maxim. Whereas Atticus wrapped up the lessons for Scout at the end of "Mockingbird", it is Jack who explains what the brothers have been hoping for and even planning for Scouts' next stage of development. Some may find this condescending to read about two men still instructing a 26 year old woman in such a conspiratorial manner.<br/><br/>In short, Jean Louise learns that sometimes you need to work within the system alongside horrid people against a common enemy in order to achieve more stable transitions to equality. There is a lot for Scout and us to rail against here and a debate worth having - more debate than Mockingbird provokes, which I say is a good thing. Personally for Jean Louise, she must learn that her father is not perfect. It is a fitting lesson as, with the release of "Watchman", Atticus Finch, this epitome of reliable, wise, settling fatherhood will come under a great deal of scrutiny by us all over the next few months and years. Lee writes a wonderful passage which could be seen as prophetic, as if she knew we would also need these words to articulate the moment. Again, Uncle Jack is her mouthpiece:<br/><br/>"You confused your father with God. You never saw him as a man with a man's heart, and a man's failings - I'll grant you it may have been hard to see, he makes so few mistakes, but he makes 'em like all of us. You were an emotional cripple, leaning on him, getting answers from him, assuming that your answers would always be his answers."<br/><br/>Jack and Atticus see her confrontation with her father as the final step in becoming a fully grown woman. Like a character in a Bruce Springsteen song, Jean Louise had been running from the people of Maycomb, rather than accepting them and working with them to improve their community.<br/><br/>"Instead of getting on your charger and blindly striking it down, you turned and ran. You said, in effect, 'I don't like the way these people do, so I have no time for them.' You'd better take time for 'em, honey, otherwise you'll never grow."<br/><br/>It's not all so serious. There are plenty of humourous moments, especially in the childhood vignettes which prompted Lee's original publishers to request she expand into the novel which would become "To Kill a Mockingbird". Fans of "Mockingbird" (and I count myself one, having deemed it to be a "perfect" novel) will feel instantly at home, not only with the setting of Maycomb twenty years later but with Lee's writing style. Jean Louise acts consistently with her 6-year old self, reacting emotionally before investigating further, often internalising fears before she fully understands them, eliciting both empathy and a smile from readers. We learn of the fates of Jem and Dill and we reunite with Aunt Alexandra who is a force and constant presence as an aide to the aging and ailing Atticus. Calpurnia has moved on, but makes an appearance in one of the more heart-wrenching scenes in the books. Mr Cunningham returns, selling ice-cream out of the old Finch house.<br/><br/>Many will wonder how this book would have been received had it been released prior to or even immediately after "Mockingbird". Is it a novel for our time? Perhaps, with modern news about police and race relations in America and disputes over Confederate flags, HarperCollins has an argument that "Watchman" and the complex issues it presents, along with Atticus' message about murky solutions to these, may be well-timed indeed.<br/><br/>As a long-time fan and teacher of Harper Lee, I highly recommend "Go Set a Watchman". It is not a perfect book, but it is an exceptional piece of work in its own right and it does nothing to take away from the perfection of "To Kill a Mockingbird". But, for those who are not sure, I'll echo Atticus' loving (and new) words to Jean Louise: "As you please."
It appears that maybe Harper Lee's lawyers were more interested in profits than integrity. Harper Lee wrote this befor. TKAM, and never wanted it published. Not worth the reading.
Very disappointing. Little substance, poor character development. First half of the book was downright monotonous, meandering with little to hold the reader's interest. The content amounted to little more than a short story, stretched out into a very mediocre novella. Hard to believe the same author penned a classic like Mockingbird.
A barrage of wild, out-of-context reviews (?) on this book led me to believe it would be something much different. I wasn't going into this though seeing as how it measured up to Mockingbird or how it worked as a draft for that story. I wasn't that invested in literary nerdiness. I read this as a 30-something adult having read Mockingbird 20 or more years ago. It's that simple really.<br/><br/>Harper Lee's narrative struck a chord in me. I'm not sure younger readers will appreciate what is going on here, but having to face the decay of your home, those you love and those you respect is an integral and challenging part of growing up. It is no doubt magnified when the venom of white supremacy is still a viable force.<br/><br/>Anyone who has lived through the last eight years or so of a new racial strife in this country will be shocked at how similar the 1950s justifications for white supremacy are. I am sure a lot of us have been in Jean-Louise's shoes trying to desperately make sense of it all and even questioning our own place in the machine that allows these poison ideas to still flourish. Lee was very much in the moment when she wrote this and you can tell that raw passion was not held back by anyone.<br/><br/>I think that's something to be appreciated, especially when dealing with something as divisive as white supremacy. We just don't get to see behind the curtain of someone's true emotions too often. The people that allowed this to be released should be commended as well. It is a proper American literary classic and no one should feel any bit of concern for Lee. She did an outstanding job and all of this need to be said. Especially now.
I was disappointed with this book.  I had hoped it would have been as enjoyable as "To kill a Mockingbird" to go back and visit with old friends. Unfortunately for me it did not live up to expectations. The good thing was I went back to Mockingbird to see if I remembered that correctly and enjoyed it all over again
After years of waiting for more from Harper Lee, Go Set a watchman misses the mark.  There were some interesting ideas regarding the civil rights movement, but I don't think that the conclusions reached were accurate.  I have lived during those times and can't honestly draw the same conclusions brought forth in the novel.
The book itself is ok. The product was terrible with the pages roughly hacked off. Twice I ordered the book and twice I ended up with a poor product, even after assurance from the helpchat staff who were probably just doing their job. I ordered from another site with a different publisher and it was totally ok.
I can't believe Harper Lee wrote this -- it reads like a book by committee. The back story is tedious and dense, and the new Scout, Jean Louise, is insufferable. The media account of Atticus as a racist is way overrated. I'm glad I read it, but it does not compare to "To Kill A Mockingbird."
I am a huge fan of To Kill a Mockingbird (both the novel and the motion picture) since being introduced to it all the way back in grade school.  I was fascinated to see these characters again in Harper Lee's purported first attempt at a novel.  Having read it, fans of TKAM are cautioned to avoid it.  Although the book seems like a sequel, one must remember this was a first attempt that was rejected by the publishers, who advised Lee that she had some promise but needed to return to the storyboard from scratch and develop her strengths.  That was undoubtedly a grand idea, because Go Set a Watchman is often pointless, cliched and unpleasant to read, and had this been Lee's first published novel it would have had no where near the impact of To Kill a Mockingbird.  Ms. Lee had a very astute editor/publisher.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman picks up with Scout, now living in New York City working an unidentified job, returning to Maycomb for a visit ostensibly 20 years after the events in TKAM.  We dawdle through half the book as Scout is re-introduced to various characters, most of which we are unfamiliar with, and tries to find her bearings in the old Southern town of her youth.  Many of the characters from TKAM are missing, given short shrift or re-imagined in such a way as to defy belief.  Few of the events from TKAM are referenced and when they are, their outcomes are different from the original novel.  Other than building atmosphere for an eternity, nothing much happens until nearly the midway point when Scout aimlessly crashes a meeting at the courthouse where dad Atticus, suitor Hank, and various unsavory types are busy hatching plots to maintain segregation and foil any attempts of blacks to achieve equality.  The remainder of the book consists of Scout reeling from this revelation with lots of hand-wringing, vomiting and assorted histrionics, building to several anti-climactic verbal confrontations, which manage to seem alternately dated, creepy and depressing.<br/><br/>Lee's writing is OK here, sometimes quite good (especially when depicting a morning coffee Scout's busybody aunt hosts with Scout tuning in and out of the vacuous conversations held by the female elite of the town). The problem is that there is not much story here other than a general overview of entrenched Southern bigotry and racism from the casual to the more insidious.  TOKM featured strongly delineated characters (such as Atticus, Scout, Jem, Dill, Calpurnia), even down to some minor players (Mrs. Lafayette Dubose, Boo Radley), who stayed with you long after the book was done.  Go Set a Watchman has nothing like that.  Scout is really the only fully realized character, and that is often because we have insight into her thoughts as the narrator.  Jem and Dill have been unceremoniously written out of this novel (making only rare appearances in too brief flashbacks).  Calpurnia, the black family housekeeper and mother figure, has been relegated to a dismal cameo where she demonstrates a fear of Scout and her family.  The Radleys are not mentioned at all.  New characters range from inconsequential (Scout's suitor Hank) to irritating (Scout's prissy bossy aunt and an obnoxious uncle, whose quoting of literary figures is apparently supposed to convince us of an intelligence he fails to exhibit).  The most radical change is in the character of Atticus Finch who, in TKAM and as indelibly interpreted onscreen by Gregory Peck, was a weary paragon of virtue fighting for justice for the underdog and serving as inspiration to his children.  Here Atticus has been reduced to little more than a sly, genteel bigot, who takes on cases for the black community so he can ostensibly lose them and keep out the Feds and NAACP.  This is not the Atticus Finch of TKAM or any credible rendition of him, this is Atticus Finch as filtered through a Tea Party lens spouting babble that would make Ted Cruz proud - a condescending noxious hypocrite undermining equality while pretending to help and using outdated, easily debunked nonsense about the inferiority of the black race to justify his actions.  This Atticus is an anti-government, states righter who reads propaganda likening black people to the plague, and thinks these views are OK because he himself is not physically lynching anyone...just propping up the more volatile bigots and letting them get their hands dirty.  Pretty much all of the characters we meet in Maycomb turn out to be like Atticus (from the outwardly polite inwardly nasty Southern gals at the coffee to the fussy aunt with her antiquated views on white trash and negroes to the braggart uncle using laughable defenses for his casual racism) and the unrelenting weight of it becomes depressing.  One gets tired of these "nice" genteel ninnies answering Scout's pleas with "Think, Girl..." followed by a terrible meandering defense of racism.  Atticus and Hank lecture Scout that sometimes one needs to go along, to get along (a far cry from the inspirational Atticus in TKAM).  Even worse, Atticus gets a calm, lengthy diatribe that still emerges as shrill where he demands "do you want them sitting next to you, in your schools, in your theaters"!<br/><br/>The ambiguous ending is a bit disconcerting and unsatisfying in that it solves nothing, there is too much left unexplored/unsaid and a revelation about Scout's uncle and her deceased mother comes out of nowhere and seems ultimately pointless.  Perhaps this novel would make a bigger impact if so many other novels had not tread the same ground better.  Unfortunately, this "discovery" fails to come anywhere near TKAM and manages to disturbingly tarnish the image of Atticus Finch to such an extent that it may hinder enjoyment of the earlier book.  Truthfully, Scout may decide to stick around in Maycomb, but she and the reader would be much better served by getting on the next train out of town and never looking back.
There are three ways to look at this novel: a dependent sequel to Mockingbird; a stand-alone novel, more or less divorced from Mockingbird; or as an interesting example of the writing and editing process. By dependent sequel I mean a book that lacks merit except as an extension of its predecessor. Alas, Watchman fails as such a sequel because critical facts from the newer book contradict Mockingbird. A minimal amount of competent editing would at least make the two books consistent, unless we are to believe as readers that we face an unreliable narrator, in one if not both books.  In fact, I suppose one could see Watchman as the revelation that certain key facts and the canonization of Atticus in Mockingbird were simply the day-dreams of a troubled young girl. I doubt that is what Harper Lee had in mind.<br/><br/>Yet, Watchman also fails as a stand-alone novel. Divorced from Mockingbird this book simply lacks impact. Take Atticus Finch. The central controversy surrounding the book’s content is the unveiling of Mockingbird’s saint-like Finch as an aging racist. This is controversial only for readers versed in Mockingbird. Separate from Mockingbird the revelation about Atticus cannot affect the reader because his character is so superficially developed in Watchman.<br/><br/>Watchman does succeed as a companion piece to Mockingbird.  It is rather interesting to see the dreck that ultimately spawned a great novel (and to appreciate the quality advice Harper Lee received so long ago).  But, let’s face it, literary forensics holds interest for few outside college literature departments.<br/><br/>Regardless of how you look at it, Watchman is a weak book. It has few nice scenes, virtually all involving Scout and company’s childhood hijinks.  (I can only think these were cut from Mockingbird to save length.) Otherwise, the characters are thinly drawn and the book action mainly consists of a parade of poorly written and motivated conversations.  Worst of all is the climatic argument between the grown Scout (Jean) and Atticus.  It’s a hackneyed jumble of stilted half-baked dialogue regarding Brown v. Board, integration, and paternalistic racism.
I have been a jag lately of being disappointed by books written by women. I know there are smart, capable women who are imaginative, creative and glorious out there- but apparently I am not finding their books. I was really looking forward to this book, since Harper Lee has only written 2 books, and the first one, "To Kill A Mockingbird" is on many top ten read lists, and has won many awards. I also know that she was friends with Truman Capote, and I love his books.<br/><br/>The book felt really dated, and then kept reminding me that it was written about the south, and about people in the south that had certain beliefs that were basically ingrained. Like we inherit eye color or skin color, we are supposed to believe that these people had no power to make their own decisions and inherit racism. That may be true to a certain degree, but I can't see EVERYONE in the whole town being that way and Scout being the only one who "sees the light".<br/><br/>I kept waiting for the book to get better, to be something more than I would be assigned to read in 8th grade literature, but it never happened. In fact, when Scout compares Atticus to HITLER for his beliefs about blacks, it gets taken off the 8th grade reading list. If I wanted to hear someone compared to HITLER I would be watching Fox News or listening to a Republican debate. I expected something much better out of Ms. Lee, for the winner of the Pulitzer Prize to come up with something more profound.<br/><br/>The book jacket promised a "profoundly affected work of art that is wonderfully evocative of another era". What resonates with me from the book is that Atticus had bad arthritis, people didn't want Scout to "marry beneath her" and even though Henry has been loyal to her for years she decides to throw him over. Why would she not have done that in the last decade without leading him on is beyond me. Scout also has this melt-down where she screams at everyone.  Her dad & her uncle respond "we knew this would happen someday." in a very condescending way. I would like to think living a New York would have given Jean Louise some better communication skills and more insight into how to create progress in her hometown.<br/><br/>On a side note, I have recently watched a biography on Thurgood Marshall and this book made me appreciate what he went thru working for NAACP. He travelled tirelessly to get good legal representation for blacks. If the reality is anywhere near what Harper Lee portrayed, that was more than necessary.
Clearly the clunky draft of what Harper Lee submitted to her adept editor Tay Hohoff. Hohoff wisely chose to pull one of the backstories (the trial of a black man represented by Atticus) and have Lee work on that to co-create the masterpiece that is To Kill a Mockingbird. Editors these days are marketers and rarely have the skills and devotion (or the support of the publishers they work for, esp. if it's Murdoch) to nurse a book as Hohoff did. This new editor/marketer pulled out the main reference to that backstory but left other non-sequitur references and all the first-draft awkwardness: tedious, unreal speechifying that passes for dialogue, lack of cohesion or clarity in several story segments, an off-kilter narrative arc, and typos. This was all about Rupert Murdoch's Harper Collins imprint making big, big bucks (in cahoots with its cross-promotion by his very own Wall Street Journal). Besides the rough draft of this novel-to-be, besides the too-coincidental "discovery" of this manuscript just after her lawyer and sister Alice died in 2014, besides the fact witnesses attest to sitting in on a meeting between the new lawyer as early as 2011 - three years earlier - in which this "original draft" of the book was presented (which said new lawyer claims only to have -- oh my, oh my -- discovered just after Alice died), besides the fact that To Kill a Mockingbird made Lee a rich woman who doesn't need money and has no direct heirs, besides all that, Harper Lee said throughout her life she wasn't interested in writing or publishing anything else. A post-stroke elderly woman was taken advantage of for that crassest of motives: greed. This book never should have seen print. I am grateful that what became To Kill a Mockingbird,, i.e., this original submission, was so skillfully and respectfully handled and molded into a treasure.
The premise of the publication of this book is that it is the original book written by Lee and rejected by the publishers. She then went away and in a very short amount of time returned with To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>I didn't believe that story when it came to light and after reading this book I am positive that the story is a vast untruth.<br/>This book is clearly not written by Harper Lee, or if it is, is not written in the sequence that it is purported to be. It was not written first. It is not developed, and while it has similarities to her literary style, it is not in the same style.<br/>It does have passages take seem to have been taken from To Kill a Mockingbird, and some inspired by it. It seems to be cobbled together with phrases that seem written by Harper Lee, and then the surrounds written by someone-else using her style.<br/>There is no way that an author would go from this frankly undeveloped and unappealing story to the charm and warmth of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>Atticus could not be a liberal in one book and a nazi in another.<br/><br/>In real life Harper Lee is unable to write and is reportedly unable to communicate. Apparently this has been true for many years. She always said she would never publish anything again.<br/><br/>It leaves me to wonder why so many well known book reviewers have been gushing over this manuscript. It has no redeeming literary qualities. It is relatively distasteful story-wise, it is vastly disappointing and it carries with it no conclusion or resolution.<br/>If this book was indeed first then Jem, Scout, Atticus, Arthur, the many missing characters in this book would never have appeared in To Kill A Mockingbird as they did. There are other things to consider as well. Lee clearly loved the characters of Scout and Jem Finch. However a discussion in this train of thought might ruin the story for someone who has not yet read this book.<br/><br/>So my belief is that Go Set a Watchman is an effort to cash in on the fame of To Kill a Mockingbird, and is a money making enterprise by someone in an influential position & in control of Harper Lee's estate. This belief of mine is underscored by the fact that the day after I finished it there was a report that the lawyer had "found another manuscript" and it would be prepared for publication soon - Oh, Please, I am just not that gullible.
Is that she is just as racist as the "fallen" Atticus in this book.  For all the press that this book got regarding Atticus' fall from grace (which ironically is kind of the whole point of Watchman), I am shocked that there was little mention regarding the racism of the one character who is supposed to be the "progressive hero."<br/><br/>Potential spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>Watchman's core message is Jean Louise realizing the fallibility of her idol and letting her own conscience guide her as opposed to her perception of her father.  For as much angst and pain Jean Louise goes through in accepting Atticus' fallibility, her ideas about race are not really that different from Atticus' views, with the exception of segregation.  I realize that when this book was written, some of her ideas may have been extremely progressive for a white Southern woman.  But in 2015, her views are just as offensive as those she is railing against in the book.<br/><br/>Some of the most offensive examples:<br/><br/>*She uses the N-word more than any other main character in the book. With the exception of the white supremacist's speech at the citizen's council meeting, no other character uses the word as much as she does.  I don't believe Atticus utters it in the book.<br/><br/>*She describes black people as "dirty and diseased" and when she is arguing with Atticus about his views she agrees with him that they are a "backward" people.  She doesn't even really challenge his notion that black people are too "infantile" to govern themselves and that's why the status quo (segregation, no voting rights) should be upheld.  Her position really comes down to her believing that if white people had been nice enough to black people, they would not have resorted to asserting their civil rights.  I think she called it "Love a N***** Week."<br/><br/>*When she agrees with her Uncle Jack to accept Atticus as he is and to agree to disagree on the race thing, she assures her Uncle that she is not going to run out "and marry a Negro."  Then they have a talk about how silly it is for the Klan to be worried about interracial marriage, because white people will continue to marry their own regardless of the laws.<br/><br/>Ugh.  There is more, but that is just a flavor of the "moral voice" in Watchman.<br/><br/>I did give the book 2-stars because the flashbacks to Scout's childhood were truly enjoyable and good reading.  One can tell the original editors thought so too and had Lee re-work the book to focus more on those pieces which eventually evolved into Mockingbird.
It has been so long since I read To Kill A Mockingbird that I honestly remember little about Harper Lee's writing style in that novel.  To be fair, I did watch the movie version on Netflix after finishing Watchman just to re-affirm my earlier assessment of Atticus Finch as a rational and fair minded lawyer.  The first seven chapters of Watchman were a struggle to complete and made me wonder whether there was the glimmer of a plot in sight.  These seven chapters consist mainly of the recollections of Jean Louise Finch ("Scout") concerning her childhood in Maycomb County.  Scout is now a twenty-sixish journalist living in New York, home on a visit to Maycomb.  Scout's recollections are interspersed with her ruminations on whether she should give in and marry Hank Clinton, her childhood and would-be suitor, who is from the other side of the tracks.  Finally, in chapter 8 (100 pages into the book), something happens.  Jean Louise follows Atticus and Hank to a meeting of the Maycomb County Citizens Council and discovers that they are involved in the Council, an activist group that deplores the U.S. Supreme Court's school desegretation decision in Brown v. Board of Education.  The Council also is devoted to thwarting the NAACP's burgeoning efforts to ensure equal treatment of blacks.  Atticus justifies his participation in the Council by claiming that the judiciary has overstepped its bounds and that "Negroes" in 1950's America do not deserve to be treated equally as they are "still in their childhood as people."  I'm not buying this version of Atticus, who in Mockingbird argued the unfairness of believing a white man's version of facts concerning an alleged rape of a white woman over the black defendant's account based solely on race.  Jean Louise is sickened to learn of Atticus' bigotry and rightfully so because it is radically out of character with her and the reader's fundamental understanding of Atticus.  Lee has Scout's Uncle Jack Finch resolve the conflict that is the apparent reason for the book in a plot twist that defies any logic honed by the reality of experience.  Don't read this book unless you enjoy amateurish efforts driven by greed.
One can hear the narrator from To Kill a Mockingbird in Go Set A Watchman. Atticus Finch is much the same man in both books; perhaps, his character flaws were in To Kill a Mockingbird and too many of failed to see them. Lee provides a fuller backstory for each character in Go Set a Watchman. Whether the voice is Scout, Jean Louise, Atticus, Calpurnia, or Uncle Jack, the moral compass of one's conscience is the true north of both novels. I was neither disappointed in Atticus nor Jean Louise. Uncle Jack perhaps sounds a bit too Freudian when explaining the relationships between fathers and daughters. Atticus is not 21st century American hero, nonetheless, he is as much as 21st century American as he is a 20th century man -- caught between a deep regard for the local and individual and the larger, national good. When I listen to the accounts of Atticus' social politics in Watchman, I hear so much of the letter and spirit of 21st century conservatives, though not the strident kind. Why does the novel speak to us in 2015? Look to our criminal justice system, or our structurally segregated communities (we insist divides exist because of economic class not race, yet how so  much do race and poverty converge as they do in Lee's novels). No the novel does not disappoint, nor do I grieve the loss or fall of Atticus Finch. There are times when children remember the same story differently, during ages unlike one another. In Mockingbird,  Lee recalls Atticus, and in Watchman, Lee the young woman meets Atticus. The stories are about White people of privilege and their consciences. The consciences of White folk will not become the watchmen or women that they are to be until the story becomes about Tom Robinson, Calpurnia, and Frank rather than Atticus.
I finished Harper Lee's "Go set a Watchman" last night and it will be a while before I fully digest the experience.  I think is is possible that I have bit off more than I can chew in reviewing this book. There are so many angles to see this "new" book from.  I can only tell you my fresh impressions, and invite you to jump into the pool of confusion, with a lot of brilliant literature scattered about.  I signed up with Kindle to have it sent to me as soon as it was ready for publication.... already a little absurd for a manuscript that was suddenly "discovered" but written over 50 years ago. I tried to just close my ears and wait but of course that was impossible.  I did wait to read the New Yorker's article by Adam Gopnik until after I had read the book.  A good idea, if for no other reason than there are numerous "spoiler alerts" in the article.  And while I did agree with a good portion of his analysis it was good to come to my own conclusions.<br/><br/>I have got to say that something does just not add up with this release.  I just can't believe that no one in the publishing world would have known about it all these years. And clearly the reader is expected to have known many things that had happened earlier, which was in a novel written later.  Something doesn't add up, but it isn't my job to figure it out, and frankly I don't care.  The fact is, I did read "To Kill a Mockingbird and characters live in my brain, both from the book and the movie.<br/><br/>The book centers around Jean Louise's (Scout) return from New York where she was employed in some job (never described)  Her return and her flashbacks of childhood are worth the price of admission. Here is the opening:<br/><br/>"Since Atlanta, she had looked out the dining-car window with a delight almost physical. Over her breakfast coffee, she watched the last of Georgia’s hills recede and the red earth appear, and with it tin-roofed houses set in the middle of swept yards, and in the yards the inevitable verbena grew, surrounded by whitewashed tires. She grinned when she saw her first TV antenna atop an unpainted Negro house; as they multiplied, her joy rose"<br/><br/>I don't know if I can identify exactly why, but that is as powerful as any first paragraph ever.  Oh yeah IMHO.  Not one unnecessary word.  And that is the thing I came away with from reading this book... it was uneven for sure and tedious at times and some of the arguments about race are so......dated (duh!) but when you have a painter of words like this, does it matter what the setting? It reminds me of Van Gogh's paintings - do you like the chair in his room  or the flowers in the vase or the peasants pputting in the harvest.... well so I have too choose?  The master is behind the canvas.  Or in this case the typewriter.<br/><br/>Here's another sample.....<br/><br/> "Autumn comes late in Alabama. On Halloween, even, one may hide porch chairs unencumbered by one’s heavy coat. Twilights are long, but darkness comes suddenly; the sky turns from dull orange to blue-black before one can take five steps, and with the light goes the last ray of the day’s heat, leaving livingroom weather. Autumn was her happiest season. There was an expectancy about its sounds and shapes: the distant thunk pomp of leather and young bodies on the practice field near her house made her think of bands and cold Coca-Colas, parched peanuts and the sight of people’s breath in the air. There was even something to look forward to when school started—­renewals of old feuds and friendships, weeks of learning again what one half forgot in the long summer. Fall was hot-supper time with everything to eat one missed in the morning when too sleepy to enjoy it. Her world was at its best when her time came to leave it."<br/><br/>As the last line indicates, this is part of a traumatic memory of Jean Louise's but you really don't need to know exactly what to appreciate the brilliant prose which could only be written by an observant and masterful writer from the American South.<br/><br/>The one thing everyone has heard about the book is that Gregory Peck... ooops I mean Atticus has somehow become a racist.  In a nutshell, that is a simplistic spin. I don't know if I can adequately parse it out so let's start with what Adam Gopnik says on this subject.....<br/><br/>"So the idea that Atticus, in this book, “becomes” the bigot he was not in “Mockingbird” entirely misses Harper Lee’s point—that this is exactly the kind of bigot that Atticus has been all along. The particular kind of racial rhetoric that Atticus embraces (and that he and Jean Louise are careful to distinguish from low-rent, white-trash bigotry) is a complex and, in its own estimation, “liberal” ideology: there is no contradiction between Atticus defending an innocent black man accused of rape in “Mockingbird” and Atticus mistrusting civil rights twenty years later. Both are part of a paternal effort to help a minority that, in this view, cannot yet entirely help itself.......<br/><br/>Atticus’s attitude seems entirely authentic, his heroism and his prejudices, as so often with actual human beings, part of the same package. Credibility is the ethic of fiction, and he is a credible character."<br/><br/>The other thing I would say is that if Atticus had been without those seemingly prejudiced views, Jean Louise would not have a target for her righteous indignation and present her an opportunity to vocalize those views.  Of course reading those arguments in a post-Ferguson world makes them seem pretty silly, but I think most readers are smart enough to figure that out.<br/><br/>The thing that haunts me is...... if this were a "blind" reading like we used to do tastings in our wine group... in other words if I had never read "To Kill a Mockingbird" would I have gotten the joy of the prose out of it?  If we are to believe the story of how this manuscript was rejected before Mockingbird came out then of course it is the lesser of the books.  I for one got enough pleasure of of the parts, if not the whole to recommend it,
I gave this novel five stars, because it deserves it. It is written brilliantly. To Kill a Mockingbird is to me, as to so many others, one of the best novels ever written by any author. However, readers must forget about it, or at least, assign it to a different part of their brains, when reading Go Set A Watchman. If they are constantly comparing the two novels, they are going to miss the point of this one. I read it with an open mind and I enjoyed it with immense pleasure.. Yes, Scout, who now lives in New York City, learns on her vacation back in Maycomb Junction that her father, Atticus Finch, is not God, the person she revered and looked up to as all-knowing, the world's perfect man. Yet, the way Lee brings it all together with the spirited conversation with her Uncle Jack, Dr. John Finch, toward the end is beautiful and brilliant. For Scout to find that spirit of forgiveness (for what she perceives as her father's deception and hypocrisy), and to be able to ask his forgiveness, only to be told she owes him no apology because he is proud of her for standing up to him for what she believes, and in that split second, know that her home is still in Maycomb and with him, Hank, Uncle Jack and Aunt Alexandra, was so authentic. What she struggled with and what the rest of them struggled with is not so different from what still is going on in the world to this day. There are still people who are segregationists in their hearts and how they live, even as they deny it and say they are not prejudiced, just as there are still the Jean Louise Finches  who are their polar opposites, even in the same families. Yet, Harper Lee is saying, just as Rodney King said, Can't we all just get along? Isn't there room in this town, this world, for all of us? We can't all, and we never will, ever believe the same thing or act the same way, so the only solution, regardless of how we perceive the race issue, is to try to rise above it and respect one another to the best of our ability. Great novel and I highly recommend it.
I was profoundly moved by "To Kill a Mockingbird". It was one the high school mandatory reads that sneaks up on you and fundamentally changes how you think. It resonated with me in a way I am not sure I truly understood at the age of 15. It remains today one of my all time favorites and Atticus one of my heroes.<br/><br/>When I heard that Atticus Finch was a racist in "Go Set Set a Watchman" I was reluctant to read it. I did not want one of my heros knocked off of his pedestal. Little did I know that is exactly what this book is about.<br/><br/>I found "Go Set a Watchman" not be be about racism, but rather about the relationship between a father and a daughter. It is about the time in a daughters life when she must deal with the reality that is her father. He is not the all knowing, man she believed him to be in her youth. He is a man of the south, trying to adjust to a changing  and complex world in 1954.  Because he is her Atticus, she expects him to adjust easily and respond to the world as she does. After all, he taught her the difference between right and wrong. The shocking reality that her moral compass is not pointing in the same direction as his, is deviating to Scout. Rage bubbles up in her in a way that she cannot control.<br/><br/>This is a story about the coming of age; that point in life where, as young adults, we must reconcile the difference between who we thought our parents were as we saw them from a child's eyes and who they are when viewed through an adult lens. Do we embrace them and love then for who they are, or do we turn away and cut them from our lives?<br/><br/>Harper Lee did not disappoint. She spins another engaging southern tale. Out of this tale of the south comes universal lessons for us to ponder.
Don’t read reviews. We are just ignorant clowns with high opinions of ourselves. But, if you are indecisive and have already heard conflicting reviews, then by all means, enter the fray and read on.<br/><br/>Buy it and read it (!!!),especially, if you are between the ages of 22 and 30 (and yes, it is worthwhile for ALL ages) Go Set a Watchman may not be what you expect, but it is Harper Lee, and she has a way with words. You will be sure to enjoy the new characters, in particular Dr. John Hale Finch.<br/><br/>*Spoiler alert*<br/>Go Set a Watchman is is a very different book than To Kill a Mockingbird. It could be re-titled, Go Scout, and find Your Conscience. The book has a more grown-up feel. The narration is still from Scout, but instead of the innocent perspective of a child, she is twenty-six years old and has all of the idealism, dreams, immaturity, and drama one would expect from a young adult (hence its relevance to tweenagers).<br/><br/>I know little of Harper Lee, but the book appears to be a description of her worldview with a myriad of conflicting themes (beyond just racism). Scout is struggling to makes sense of her world after finding that Atticus is not her moral anchor.  She draws from Aunt Alexandra, Dr. Finch, Church, and her childhood to find a moral compass that can explain what she sees in Maycomb. Written in the 1950’s, it is almost prophetic that Harper Lee could describe the search for justice and truth at the time that many absolutes were being discarded.<br/><br/>Jean Louise narrates the story and much of it centers on her struggle to understand Atticus. She is not the naïve child she once was. She is a New York wise twenty six year old who discovers that Atticus may not have been the same shining white knight she assumed him to be. Atticus is not immune to the cultural reconstruction and changes of his time. Jem has died, but he is not forgotten. Although his heart failed, he lives on in the hearts Maycomb and in the Jean Louise’s recollections.<br/><br/> If you are 25, like myself, you will appreciate the coming of age struggles (not the teenage nonsense called “finding oneself”). Jean Louise is pressed to find a spouse and to return to the small town of her youth.  While home offers familiarity there is no anonymity to be found (note: The Coffee scene in particular). Small towns embody both what we love and hate. A fitting description of Got Set a Watchman.
I really enjoyed Go Set a Watchman.  While it is not "To Kill a Mockingbird" I think it is a great book on in it's own merit.  I don't think it is as well written as Mockingbird, but it is Ms. Lee's first novel.  My opinion really differs from the NPR reports, etc.  Many people are upset and saying Atticus is racist.  I never got that feeling.  We have to remember that this novel takes place in a very small southern town.  The town is not even near any big towns.  The people are all interbred and lived in this town all of their lives.  Also, Atticus is a product of this town and is 72 years old.  Throughout the book Atticus is still Atticus to me, the one from Mockingbird.  As we learn, he joined the KKK 40 years prior to this book because he figured that by joining it would be the best way to keep tabs on what they were up to and understand their motives.  I really never felt he was racist, he still would defend all people, he still treated all people the same way.  He does go on to say that the NAACP was wrong in how they were trying to push the African Americans into positions that they were not ready for, not educated for, and not able to adjust to.  And if you take that into the context of living in such a small town where they were kept from education and treated as lower class citizens for all of their lives, that is probably true.<br/>I think the conflict within Jean Louis is one many young women go through sometime in their life....their hero dad is human.  In the end the way that Atticus and Jean Louis and her Uncle work it all out is enlightening for all of them and for us.  The book is historically a good book.  The reader has to think about the era and circumstances of living in a very small southern town.
Go Set a Watchman, likely the most read book of this year, carries some of the charm of Harper Lee’s style but it is easy to see why her initial editor suggested she rewrite with the young Finch’s as the motive force for much of the original novel carries  Jean Louise’s flash backs of youth as decisive forces. She is twenty-six living in New York City and returning ‘Home’ as she feels it to visit her aging father Atticus Finch. The controversy the book has raised is what happened to Atticus at 73? But its converse is correct, Watchman predating Mockingbird, the Atticus we know and love is the same person but not before but after. The interesting question is why does Harper Lee treat him as very much color blind as it seems in Mockingbird when as she saw the elder Atticus as carrying the attitudes of the good old boys of Maycomb Alabama in Watchman and one answer would be the very different times the two works were created.<br/><br/>Her first Atticus is living in the bending time in the South following the Warren Court’s unanimous decision in Brown v Board of Education of Topeka that Separate is not Equal; segregation must go. The battle lines were being drawn.<br/><br/>“What turned ordinary men into screaming dirt at the top of their voices, what made her kind of people harden and say “n****r” when the word had never crossed their lips before?”<br/>Would the Atticus Finch we know in Mockingbird use such language? A careful look at that character does not neatly answer that question for he is living in a very different time when the existing system of social relations was very well established and certainly not under attack. Atticus fought the good fight for Justice there but lost, for he could not bring his white jury to see beyond race. Interesting the Atticus of Watchman won acquittal in a like contest as Lee wrote.<br/>As Harper Lee settled to rework the story the South was slowly adjusting to a time when the battle line could not hold and people were moving to a new reality, her Atticus – where ever he originated – now lived in a earlier and different time, the coming rupture had not occurred.<br/>Both works contain Harper Lee’s masterful character development, in Watchman a page and a half gives you an Alexandra you will not forget, but Kill a Mockingbird is perhaps more gracefully polished. Watchman makes the riff of the 1950’s tug at the heart just as well.
This book just made me sad, because it’s terrible and never should have been published. It’s really not Lee’s fault this book is a mess. There’s a reason it sat in storage for more than 50 years. Watchman is essentially the first version of Mockingbird. Lee’s editor, Tay Hohoff, reportedly called the manuscript "more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.” Hohoff suggested she rewrite the story focusing on Scout’s childhood, and the result was the version of Mockingbird we all know now.<br/><br/>Watchman finds an adult Jean Louise (Scout) coming back to Maycomb, Alabama, to find race relations in her hometown much changed. I spent the first half of the book wondering if I was missing something, because not a whole lot happens. The plot can be summed up as, Jean Louise comes home, sees her father (the esteemed attorney Atticus Finch) do something that changes her opinion of him, stews over that for a while, eventually argues with him, and then realizes that her father is not, in fact, a god. The book ambles along in an unfocused way without any real dramatic tension. A few plot points are introduced without ever really going anywhere. The passages focusing on Scout’s childhood are the most interesting and entertaining, so I see why Hohoff encouraged her to rewrite the story with the focus on the younger Scout.<br/><br/>Read it if you must as a companion to To Kill a Mockingbird or as an example of how to turn a flawed book into an excellent one, but don’t buy into the hype that it’s on par with Mockingbird or even that it’s a sequel to Lee’s previously published book, as advertised.
Really disappointed in this book. Of course, I wanted to love it as much as Mockingbird; not even close. I didn't like the ending at all (won't spoil it here), very convoluted and I ended feeling like I was sorry I took the time to read it. Definitely would not recommend.
I was never one of those conspiracy theorists who believed that Truman Capote was the actual author of To Kill a Mockingbird, my absolute favorite book of all time.  I always took the viewpoint that if Harper Lee was just a "one hit wonder" what a hit it was!  Now having read Go Set a Watchman which Miss Lee supposedly wrote prior to Mockingbird, I can only say someone -- if not Mr. Capote -- must have been the true author of that wonderful book.  There is no way Miss Lee could have improved to the caliber of the writing of Mockingbird based on this book.  The only parts of the book that are enjoyable are those which include the flashbacks to Scout's youth.  Otherwise, the character development is poor, and the story line in this book is lacking.  I have friends who refused to read Watchman based on reviews that say Atticus is revealed to be a racist, and they did not want their memories of Mockingbird to be tarnished.  If this book had been published first, I would never have read Mockingbird.  So I am truly grateful that the publisher suggested Miss Lee rework her original effort.  He should have told her to destroy this book so it never saw the light of day.  I don't know what the motivation was for Miss Lee to allow this travesty to be published other than financial gain.  It certainly will not advance her reputation as a great author.  No, Watchman didn't tarnish my memories of Atticus so much as it forever tarnished my admiration for a beloved author.  Whoever advised Miss Lee to release this book did her and those who love Mockingbird a huge disservice.
I really really wanted to love this. I re-read TKAM every summer, and I have always warmly embraced its characters. I came to Go Set a Watchman expecting to read a book that stood alone in its own right and that added depth to what we already know of the characters, the town, and the narratives of justice that we found in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>It just wasn't there. Perhaps not so much with a bang, but with a whimper - it just really reads like a first draft. It doesn't stand on its own feet. Whether you're taken with the motifs of disillusionment, feminism, coming of age, or racism in the south is irrelevant. There wasn't much substance. I read the 278 pages today in little time. There wasn't much to chew on or much reason to pause and reflect. Mostly, there were too many details about the intricacies of southern life (but not enough to build on what we got in Mockingbird) and a reiteration of how Jean Louise feels lost in her 20s, as so many of us have. Perhaps I'll read it again, but unless the next few days change my mind, it's not on the annual re-read list with its predecessor.
I enjoyed this book very much. It portrayed the lives and beliefs of people in that era in regard to segregation and the journey to integration. I found it very realistic and able to allow both sides of the coin to be felt without having to spend it at all.
I loved the grown-up scout (Jean Louise) .  Not at all comparable to "To Kill a Mocking Bird" but it was nevertheless a good read for me.  I did first reread "To Kill a Mockingbird" and it was everything I remembered it to be---wonderful!
Such a  disappointment. I have to agree with one critic who said that if one takes Lee's two books as being two totally different books simply sharing characters with the same name one might find this novel acceptable. I have taught "To Kill a Mockingbird" for 20 years and found the books so immensely well written and that is what mad eit so very easy to teach and to love. the plot structure is flawless; the characterization most concrete and often built by making use of two antithetical types for e.g. a poor child with a deep sense of humanity and pride vs a poor child with absolutely no concept of acceptable, humane behavior; the writing is subtle and also deeply touching even while perhaps leading one to condemn the character; the atmosphere is consistently real and authentic. So much is said by most concrete and implicit examples. Whereas this novel uses language less concrete and vocabulary less consistent with the age of narrator. The narrator is also most unlikeable because she is so self-righteous and judgmentally narrow in spite of wanting to portray herself as less racist and therefore better than her family. I find it difficult to believe that both novels were written by the same hand and especially the same mind. I was very disappointed and this did, to some extent ,diminish the original novel but I shall purge this weak novel from memory as soon as possible and continue to revere "To kill a Mockingbird" for its artistry, style and theme.
Perhaps this is the book America needs to read now -- just as Mockingbird was the book to be read in the 1960s. Mockingbird was a story striving for a fairer world. Watchman is a reminder just how short society has fallen. Race relations are strained and very little has changed since Mockingbird's wake up call. America needs to set itself a new watchman.<br/>I refuse to read all the hoo-ha surrounding this publication. I have my suspicions about the timing of this release, but I have enjoyed following up on each and every intertexual reference. It's a mine of political and cultural history. Do yourself a favor and read the book before reading the reviews and being influenced. Try to be neutral, if you can.
I loved this book!  It was a very quick read. The childhood flashbacks were great. Jean Louise remained the Scout we all loved.  The conversation with her Uncle in the last half of the book was a little long. But I guess necessary to
This book won't be as loved as To Kill a Mockingbird, but it's a perfect sequel to it. Jean Louise grows up and discovers the people in her life aren't as perfect as she thought. Atticus is prejudiced, after all. What's great about this book is we see how a variety of white people thought about race in the South in the 1950's and that there are many different shades of racism, some more malignant than others. Even Jean Louise, who defends the rights of black people, says things that are definitely not PC. These complex characters remind us that people can be great in some situations and small-minded in others. That's how real human beings are.
Despite the barrage of prepublication articles, I approached this book with optimism, and I loved it. Yes, there are some rough transitions, but the characters shine through, and they have depth. GSAW is so much more than a first draft of TKAM; it is a companion novel that fleshes out Scout's childhood and gives her a true father, a complex man whose love for her never wavers.
"Go Set a Watchman," in my opinion, is just as much a masterpiece as was "To Kill a Mockingbird." I was so looking forward to reading it (which I did in one day, yesterday, as soon as it was released), that I preordered it for my kindle many months ago, as soon as I learned of its existance and imminent release.  To prepare myself, I read "The Mockingbird Next Door: Life with Harper Lee" by Marja Mills, the story of Nelle Harper Lee's life that she herself approved. I highly recommend Mills' book to anyone who truly wants to know and understand Lee, both as a person and as a writer.<br/><br/>It might help anyone reading my review to know that I taught "To Kill a Mockingbird" for many years as an English teacher, and that I am an author myself.  I identify closely with Lee because I share her choice of privacy and am also uncomfortable with the spotlight and attention that fame can bring. I want my books to be received well, yet cringe at the thought of too much attention, so I truly feel for Nelle.<br/><br/>All that said, I am shocked by the negative, critical reviews I have read so far by so-called "literary experts" who make assumptions about the book that I don't see.  For example, the assumption that Atticus is a "segregationist" and a "bigot."  I strongly disagree.  I think that those who call him that have spent too much time trying to be politically correct.  Atticus is not at all either of these, but a man of integrity trying to understand the culture around him, with the intelligence to know that in some ways, society was trying to move too fast.  The changes were happening, but much strife could have been avoided if changes were introduced more gradually, as he advocated. He wasn't being "paternallistic," but realistic.<br/><br/>And those that stated that Jean Louise totally lost faith in her father Atticus, whom she regarded as "a god," I disagree.  She misunderstood his position and was disillusioned and angry with him, but later, with the help of her uncle, was able to see that he wasn't perfect, but still worthy of her respect.  And she was able to break away from her childlike perception of her father, and become her own person.<br/><br/>I had wondered where Lee got the title, and understood her message when I learned that it came from the Book of Isaiah, 21, verse six, "For thus the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth." And by the end of the book, I learned that each of us has a watchman, and that is our own conscience.  Thank you, Nelle Harper Lee, for that lesson.  There is so much more in this book than any critic can take apart.
I think, like Scout, we have all had Atticus on a pedestal these many years. This book gives him depth. Makes him real, and causes us to reflect on the humanity of our idols. I'm perplexed, but also provoked to think of the ideal I have carried. It is good to examine our own bigotry through the eyes of a character. Any book that makes one think is a good book.
Although it's been awhile since I read "To Kill a Mockingbird," I deliberately did not re-read it in order to give this book a chance.  I had heard rumors of dissatisfaction and dismay with Atticus.  I understand those.  But I still love the book and know I will read it again (and probably again).  Jean Louise has grown up.  She's still feisty and outspoken, but is different than I would have imagined her.  That's okay.  Atticus is different, too, but, again, that's okay.  I believe his character is consistent between the books.  I believe he faithfully represents many community leaders of the time who found themselves hurtled into a situation for which they were unprepared.  He was more a champion of justice than a champion of Civil Rights in "Mockingbird."  Perhaps we cheered because his actions mirrored our beliefs and we saw what we wanted to see.  Scout's feelings of betrayal are understandable.  As a child of the deep South during integration, I can relate to a lot of the confusion of rapidly changing times and seemingly hypocritical adult actions.  Some have said Harper Lee was coerced into releasing this novel. Perhaps she just felt it was finally time for us to revisit those feelings of fear and have a real conversation about race and bigotry.
Here's the full review... Harper Lee's is a voice that echoes across time; the book is eerily timely and profoundly current. "I did not want my world disturbed..." frames the struggle against the context we have embraced and adored. And just like for Scout, our idols are discovered to have feet of clay, our world to be less than we hoped it was, ourselves frail and blindly floundering in our own failure. It is brilliant, convicting, passionate, hilarious, heart-wrenching and a timeless classic...born today. Get. It. Read. It. Enter the struggle! What a treasure!!
Extremely slow and boring book.  One of the least captivating I've ever read.  Stopped after a third of the way through because it was so painful.  Don't believe the hype about this book.  Don't waste your time.
Along with so many others, TKAM is one of my all-time favorite books and I too eagerly awaited GSAW. Sadly, I am having to make myself finish it. I read one review that said that if Harper Lee would have wanted it published when it was written, then it would have been at that time. I agree with that reviewer, completely. There is some beautiful use of language and some memorable or humorous lines, but overall I am disappointed. For all die-hard fans of Scout the sage advice "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here. If it ain't TKAM, then don't read it.
The story line was slow as Southern molasses---until the very last part of the book, when Jean Louise gets into the Big Debate with her dad. It seemed that they weren't real people but actors reciting their lines, as if the book were written as a forum for illustrating two different points of view of that era.<br/><br/>Jean Louise's conversation with Uncle Jack was garbled and incoherent, unless the reader happens to be familiar with the many obscure references to this and that literary source. It seemed that the author was showing off a bit at the expense of clarity. I got the feeling that Uncle Jack had some pearl of wisdom he meant to impart to Jean Louise, but she didn't get it and, unfortunately, neither does the reader.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that nothing more was said about Calpurnia! Especially since Jean Louise was surely in a position to do something more for her.  Calpurnia had spent many years acting as a surrogate mother to Jean Louise, only to be forgotten in the end. Maybe that, too, is typical of the era; blacks had their 'place' in the white world and could even be loved by them, but their lives and concerns were quickly forgotten when the self-absorbed whites' attention was drawn elsewhere.
After having read early reviews by people who did not like this book and that I was not even sure if they had really read the book, since it had only just been released on the day of their reviews, I was glad that the book was not a disappointment and seemed to be a good second book of TKAM which I loved. I thought that Watchman told the story of what Atticus was thinking in how on earth the changes that were made by the laws of integration and being enforced by the NAACP, could possibly be carried so quickly without preparation. This book told the other side of the story from the older generation who lived in the town. It did not appear to be a mean spirited attempt from Atticus, but rather his feelings about how it could possibly work immediately. It also made Scout the hero until the ending when it was shown that she, in this case, was the bigot because she had her mind made up about how the changes could take place. The title of the book was a very interesting thing in itself. I had wondered where it came from and thought that the answer was good. I think that it was just great that Harper Lee has  allowed this book to be published.  She seems a remarkable woman who lead a life that mirrored her stories.
Just finished reading. The book was way too "talky" for me, and it was easy to see why the editors told Harper Lee to write another book based on her childhood memories she wrote about in "Watchman." This book really reads like a sequel to "Mockingbird," but without any real character development. If you didn't know Atticus from "Mockingbird," you wouldn't understand his character at all. Same with Scout, whose character is particularly unlikeable and judgemental.Content-wise, "Watchman" never really addresses the subject that it is about: the federal desegregation of the south. It is touched upon but not fully explained or developed. We read about states' rights and federal imposition, but the complex viewpoint of the colorblind southerner is not really developed. I doubt this subject will be fully understood or appreciated by anyone who hasn't lived in the modern South. Uncle Jack tells Scout that people like her are needed in the South, but he doesn't really explain why, at least in any clear, understandable way. Lee's dialogue in the book seems amateurish, compared to "Mockingbird." Overall, this is a book that I wish I hadn't read.
I hated this book. One of my all-time favorite books is To Kill a Mockingbird. I can't believe that Harper Lee wrote this sequel. There is no way that the honorable Atticus Finch would become a racist.
It is a good read, and I enjoyed it.  Didn't like where it ended.  I can understand why it went unpublished for a long time.  I don't think it would have been well received at the time it was written.
I reread To Kill a Mockingbird about once a year, and I absolutely love the book. Every time I read it I find something new I didn't remember reading before. I know I am not the only person who loves the book or who looked forward with excitement to the release date of Go Set a Watchman. I was relieved to recognize Lee's writing style from the very beginning, which I enjoy very much. I viewed this book not as a separate novel but as a first version of what later became To Kill a Mockingbird.  The book illustrates the importance of revision and the guidance of a good editor to recognize that first person point of view  of Scout as a child  made all the difference in telling this story. If  I were teaching Mockingbird to high school students, I would use passages of Watchman for comparison to help students understand the impact of point of view on a story. Watchman does not have the engaging plot that Mockingbird does, and it tends to "preach" its message about racism rather than revealing events that cause the reader to draw conclusions on his or her own. For these reasons, I gave the book 3 stars.
I enjoyed this story more than I expected to.  It certainly made sense for Mockingbird to be the first one published by Lee. I wish she did not wait so long to have Watchman published.
I'll keep this short and sweet.....wish I hadn't read it.<br/><br/>I've loved To Kill A Mockingbird since Jr. High, and have read it at least 20 times in the ensuing 30-odd years.  Always my favorite book to pick up while grabbing a sandwich, waiting for the repairman at home, or sitting in bed with the flu.  Now I don't know if I'll be able to ever read it again.  The added depths of Atticus Finch were very shocking to this reader, and my literary (character) hero of so long is not only off his pedestal, he's become a man I wouldn't want to know.  His reasonings and justifications in the last chapters of the book to Jean Louise rang hollow and reflected his own deep-rooted racism.  It did little to assuage the huge sense of disappointment I felt with the character.<br/><br/>Despite Ms. Lee's statements that the book is not a sequel, it is hard not to view it as such.  I agreed with Jean Louise's rage and sense of betrayal...and hope I can someday go back to the Atticus I loved in all those readings.<br/><br/>I really wish I hadn't read it.....damn, damn and double-damn....
Harper Lee was a fine writer and her talent shines in some parts of this draft, especially the parts set in the past. The first half of the book was reasonably engaging, but when the racial theme is introduced it goes rapidly downhill. Many of the themes of "Mockingbird" (class, race, love of family, not fitting into the feminine mold) are still there, but they are explored through argument and the characters talking each other to death. The second half is, in a word, incoherent. And the end is almost breathtakingly weird. It's as if Lee knew she absolutely wanted to go to a certain Point A (reconciliation and increased understanding between Scout and family), but had absolutely no idea how to get there.<br/><br/>Having written and re-written my own fiction in the past, I find it interesting to see how this "hot mess" of a draft was eventually transformed into a significant work of art. "Mockingbird" ends up where Lee seems to have wanted to go, but the path taken in that novel is beautifully landscaped and smoothly paved, whereas the path in this draft is a rutted and muddy mess that ends up meandering off a cliff.<br/><br/>I cannot imagine any writer in her right mind wanting to put a draft like this out into the world after having finally (and successfully) written the book she wanted to write. This is a writer struggling with her material; one can see the talent and potential, but the struggle is ugly. I'm not sorry I read this, but I am sorry "Go Set a Watchman" was published with the hoopla and attention it received.<br/><br/>Reviews and articles on this book have made much of the revelation that Atticus is a racist. I do not perceive the Atticus in this draft as being the Atticus of "To Kill A Mockingbird." In "Watchman" Harper Lee is exploring a possible formulation of her story -- the wrong one, as it turns out. Whatever assistance or guidance Lee received from her editors or other early readers, she was well served by them. But in the end, she still had to write the novel. She went with her strengths, and the end result was a truly great novel that is warm and funny, sad and wise. The reinvention of Atticus and the invention of Boo Radley (who appears not at all in "Watchman") made all the difference between what would have been an awkward and forgettable work of fiction, and one that, after more than fifty years of social change, remains a touchstone of American literature. Rather than read "Go Set a Watchman," I would strongly recommend re-reading "To Kill A Mockingbird." I re-read it myself a couple of months ago, and am very glad that I did before slogging through this.
There is little doubt that everyone who loved "To Kill A Mockingbird" was as anxious as I was (perhaps even a bit scared?) when it was discovered that Harper Lee had a second book that would be on the shelves and that book would have Scout (Jean Louise) returning to Maycomb to visit her old home town after she has been living in New York City.<br/><br/>I just finished the book and I can say that I loved the book. No, it is not Scout anymore. She has grown up. She has seen a bigger world and returning to Maycomb creates a cognitive dissonance in her that she cannot resolve. I was reminded of the Thomas Wolfe novel, "You Can't Go Home Again" as it fits quite well for this beautiful book. Jean Louise realizes early that the little girl who grew up with Jem and Dill is now a woman caught (trapped?) in time in a town that is set in its ways and fighting hard to deal with a changing nation and laws that have shaken their smal town culture to the bone.<br/><br/>The book has some brilliant passages and dialogue including a conversation between Jean Louise and Dr. Finch (her uncle) as he tries to explain why the south and its culture is set in its ways. There is another moment when she confronts her father and realizes that the man she thought she knew growing up in Maycomb is, in reality, a man she never truly understood.<br/><br/>Is the book as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird?" No. I am not sure anything Harper Lee would or will ever write can be that good, but this is a good read. It is a heartbreaking read in many ways as Jean Louise learns that the innocent world she believed she had as a child has been challenged as an adult and the people of Maycomb have a culture that she no longer understands and thus maybe she truly cannot come home again.<br/><br/>Thank you, Harper Lee.
Go Set a Watchman has at least two fairly serious stylistic defects that identify it as a first novel, but artistically it fully retains all the seriousness and integrity that marked its successor in time.<br/>The first defect is simply that, written in the mid-1950, it shows it: the conversations are stilted, dated, and so too, for the most part, the scenes of social interaction.  This might perhaps be considered inevitable, but then consider the timelessness of, say, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novels and short stories, or John O’Hara’s, or even To Kill a Mockingbird itself:  in these writings, the sheer pace and beauty of the stories told work to overcome the time when they were written.<br/>With Watchman, try as one almost certainly does, this is not so.  Adding to this, then first-time author Harper Lee twice slips into the seductive error of supposing that the sweet pathos of her own childhood memories can be made equally moving to others, simply by recalling them, first with Jem, Dill and Scout’s lengthy play re-enacting a revival, and later in the awkward re-telling of Scout’s passage into sexual maturity. Instead, the first is simply boring, while the second brings little to the reader that cannot easily be found elsewhere, and probably ultimately best in personal memories of one’s own.<br/>In addition, there is a ringingly wrong scene, towards the story’s end, that has Jean Louise’s beloved Uncle Jack haul off and smack her face, twice, hard enough to knock her down and draw blood. Yet for reasons we have no way of understanding, neither from what we know of her spunky, self-reliant New York character nor from her relationship with that uncle, this brutal treatment is entirely forgiven by the young woman.  Worse yet, it serves to ‘bring her to her senses’ as if she were some sort of hysterical Victorian maiden, a progression (for that’s how it’s styled) that is as unconvincing as it is clumsy.<br/>With regard to the story’s over-all integrity and importance of message, however, the broad publicity already brought to the supposed destruction of the principal character, Atticus’s, noble character, seems to me ill-founded. Once one overcomes the confusion of dealing with a character who has fully matured (although he must have been around 55 in Mockingbird, to be 72 when Scout is 26—hardly wet behind the ears) in a book written a fair number of years earlier; one focuses inevitably on Harper Lee herself to follow the reasoning behind Atticus’s development.<br/>This is so because, obviously and inevitably, neither Atticus nor Jean Louise, or Scout, actually ever existed, but their creator Harper Lee did and does. Thus, at the time her first book was written, it’s clear in its own references to the famous trial in which Atticus performed so courageously, that she already “knew” what kind of man Atticus had been in earlier years, at least to her, and her task now was to try to show how he had developed, or at least changed, over the 17 or so years thereafter. Later, for her, she was simply filling in the pieces, if far more compellingly and artfully, in characters she already understood so well.<br/>In the critiques to date, much is made of Atticus’s courageous defense in the famous rape trial, but there’s not equal attention given to the fact that his defense was built around an ingrained respect for the doctrine of fair treatment under the law, rather than that his client was black (or a Negro, in that time) and so inherently the subject of discrimination and other unfairness. The centrality of that conviction, in Mockingbird, led just about everyone to ignore Atticus’s general standing in the community as one of its central social pillars, but that standing is essential to understanding what he seems to have become some seventeen years later.<br/>And what is that?  At first, and actually before I even read the book (possibly like many others), I thought Atticus had simply evolved, the way so many liberals seem to, with age, into a more conservative, even intolerant, old person.  I had seen this happen to my own parents, FDR Democrats their whole lives, except towards the end, and to others, and while it’s sad to see, perhaps, it’s not so hard to understand.  Sweepingly liberal ideas become as much a noisy bore and annoyance to the old as the company of the young:  it is more restful to be surrounded by the people and customs of one’s earlier age.<br/>So I first thought that Harper Lee was simply precociously aware of this demographic inevitability when she wrote her first novel at a relatively young age herself.  But now I realize that she was even wiser than that: while it must have been incredibly tempting, when she wrote Mockingbird after many more years of experience living with the social and attitudinal changes after Brown vs. Board, to portray Atticus as an unbiased and courageous champion of racial equality in a sea of malicious and vindictive prejudice—the Deep South that truly was, at the time—she chose another route.  Atticus was, and remains, two main things:  an unmovable champion of equal treatment before the law and a deeply-imbedded, firmly convictioned, member of his own southern community.<br/>And it is in the latter role that he joins the Maycomb council, which Jean Louise observes so ironically from the same perch where she watched Atticus submit his heroic defense of the accused black rapist years before.  As Uncle Jack tries to explain, somewhat elliptically, and Atticus himself states pretty clearly, he’s just as offended as she is by racial invective and true “trash” talk and action of all kinds, but not so offended that he will not seize the unsavory tactical advantage of joining them, however uneasily, in an effort to make sure that changes he agrees must come, come to southern communities like his at a proper pace.  And this pace is far slower than that advocated by the NAACP or, for that matter, most liberal thinkers of our own time.<br/>Jean Louise’s conversion to this viewpoint—“I did not want my world disturbed, but I wanted to crush the man who’s trying to preserve it for me”—is not persuasive, because Lee lacked the artistry at the time to work that through correctly for us.  And she certainly developed that artistry to full flower when she filled in the spaces of these characters in her later work! Regardless, Atticus Finch is the same man in both tales, and consistently so.  We may not like the emphasis placed on his role as preserver of a Southern Way of Life, because we know only too well how that preservation often worked out, and what barbarism it could conceal. But it’s a role that can, if with difficulty, be seen consistent with a respect for due process—of a kind—and that’s what Atticus is all about.  He’s just as respectable in Watchman as in Mockingbird, just more fully developed, with all his flaws and tatters on open display.
I have just finished "Go Set A Watchman" by Harper Lee. For years I have been praying that there would be more from a favorite author, and I was ecstatic when I heard the news that something further was coming out. With dread I read the stories of her being taken advantage of by unscrupulous agents acting on her behalf after the death of her sister who had protected her legacy for decades. For good or ill, it is out there, and I knew I would buy it and read it no matter what. I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird" that much. For the last 4 years I have taught the book to African-American 8th graders, and the conversations that ensued on race and power in America were some of the highlights of my teaching career. So what of "Go Set A Watchman"?<br/><br/>"Go Set A Watchman" is a novel unto itself. It can and should be judged on its own merits, though it uses beloved icons of American literature and the awkward and nostalgia-inducing Maycomb County, Alabama. Do we trust anyone, even Harper Lee, with furthering our mental images? Some will say no. I, for one, found Harper Lee's "Go Set A Watchman" an admirable continuation of a beloved novel. It could very well have been titled Scout Finch Comes of Age. It follows only four days of a return visit home by the 26 year old Jean Louise, and during that time she becomes her own person. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those for whom the first novel was a touchstone.<br/><br/>What I find most remarkable about the book is that it is still poignant and applicable today, even though it was supposedly written decades ago. We are still fighting the same battles, and we are still waging the same wars. Outcomes may be different, but the atrocities of Charleston a month ago and the ensuing conversations/arguments over the Confederate Battle Flag fit hand in glove with the premise and passion of this book. What does it mean to be Southern and white now? What does it mean to care about so many things one can hold dear but not embrace the totality of the Southern legacy? There are not easy answers and this is not an easy book. Do not hear me saying that it is. I read To Kill A Mockingbird with children. I would want to read this with them 8 years later, when the adolescent black and white perspective can be let go and we can go on to ask ourselves, how do we live in the gray? Read it. Decide where you stand. Wherever you land, may we come together and talk it through.
With the exception of J.D. Salinger, there is perhaps no figure in American letters who so prominently withdrew from the public eye at the height of their literary fame as Harper Lee. Her entire literary reputation rested on a single work, To Kill a Mockingbird, but now that novel has a companion piece: Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>This book has been wrapped in controversy long before it ever went to the printers. Harper Lee had made known that she intended to never again publish during her lifetime, and while rumors abounded that there were dusty manuscripts tucked away in her desk drawers, the humble reader was forced to accept they would remain private for a while longer. In her eighty-ninth year, however, in poor health and allegedly beginning to suffer from mental decline, she apparently had a sudden change of heart and decided to publish the first draft of her masterpiece. If this is a decision made of her own volition, I welcome this work’s publication, but I remain skeptical. While I find it forgivable for publishers to give readers a wink and a nudge with a posthumous book the author regarded as imperfect, an author’s wishes legally and ethically need to be respected while still alive. If Harper Lee is being taken advantage of (and her publishers should certainly know), then they need to be condemned. However, such facts take a long time to become apparent.<br/><br/>To be clear, Go Set a Watchman is an inferior work when compared with To Kill a Mockingbird. It is an impossible feat for any experienced reader not to compare the two. New characters are introduced, such as Scout’s eccentric Uncle Jack and her potential fiancé Hank. Gone are Boo Radley and his trinkets in the tree, gone is the tone of enlightened innocence from Scout’s first-person narration, and gone is the central plot of Tom Robinson’s trial during the Great Depression for rape, here relegated to a one page mention in which he is acquitted. The most painful absence, however, is the saintliness of Atticus Finch. In Go Set a Watchman, Scout Finch makes her annual trip from New York to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama at the beginning of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement and is aghast to discover that her father is heading a local organization determined to resist desegregation. As an attorney, I think I can say confidently that Atticus (and his depiction on-screen by Gregory Peck) is the most enduring depiction of my profession, and it will be painful to many of my peers to encounter this new figure. To members of the bar, he was a symbol that one could act within the letter of law when posed with moral questions and still remain an honest man. He carried in To Kill a Mockingbird an unwavering patience with his children and a finely tuned sense of justice, despite the pressure of his community to let Tom Robinson be lynched either in court or from a tree. Much of his charm and humility is still present in this new work, but he is also representative of a generation determined to resist change we now view as inevitable.<br/><br/>In some ways, however, I think these flaws are an improvement on Atticus Finch’s character; they make him human. His prior depiction was of a man so perfect that he could not exist in reality. In the best of worlds, children grow up to recognize the flaws of their parents, but continue to approach them with love in a relationship close to that of equals. The primary challenge for Scout throughout this work is to accept her father may hold views which she regards as odious, but that this does not mean he must be rejected. For those we truly love, we accept their faults, not because we approve of them, but because we believe they are worth the effort of trying to make them better. By the end of the book, Scout has begun to move in that direction.<br/><br/>While the dust jacket bills this as a sequel, I view these books as inhabiting separate realities, each representative of how people of identical backgrounds can react to events in different ways. It is much trimmer than To Kill a Mockingbird and can be read in one sitting. The narration of Go Set a Watchman is often flat, the dialogue unrealistic, the author implicitly endorses some views of Southern history I do not agree with, and at times bludgeons the reader with obvious metaphors. Despite its many weaknesses as a work, it is ultimately successful as moral fiction because it reminds each of us that we act on imperfect knowledge in an imperfect world.
Scout better known as Jean Louise Finch has returned home to Maycomb, Alabama as an adult on her annual two week journey. The author, Harper Lee, wrote this book before writing about "To Kill a Mockingbird" which lifted the author of literary stardom and success beyond imaginable. This book should be read not as a sequel to her first book but rather read it on it's own merit.<br/><br/>Harper Lee wrote this book before she wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird." What's fascinating is what Harper Lee was capable of at the time. For a new writer, this book is an extraordinary detailed observation of life in rural Alabama before the Civil Rights movement. The book features the major characters like Scout and her father, Atticus Finch. Her father is now 72 years old while Scout is only 26 and called Jean Louise. Her return home on annual trip is brought to deal with the reality of life in the South after the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the verge of the Civil Rights Movement.<br/><br/>Now literary scholars will be thrilled to see Lee's potential at storytelling. For the last fifty plus years, Harper Lee's only novel "To Kill A Mockingbird," has been received to be the best American novel and taught in schools all over the world. It would be hard for any writer especially Nelle Harper Lee to top her first novel. This book was a manuscript locked away in safety deposit box somewhere. When it was discovered last year, Harper Lee finally published her long awaited sequel.<br/><br/>Now if the naysayers are disappointed, they shouldn't be. This novel was constructed with thought, conscience, and intelligently done in the 1950s before the Civil Rights Movement. Despite some minor flaws, this book is a literary masterpiece on its own merit. Harper Lee has written two unforgettable books. I just wished there are more of Harper Lee's manuscripts tucked away and rediscovered now.<br/><br/>The relationship between father and adult daughter are revisited again in this journey. Jean Louise comes home to the Deep South harboring the reality of racism in everyday life. She is a white girl from a privileged respectable family. She has lived in New York City far away from the South. The author herself would split her time between New York City and her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. When you read this book, you get the feeling that it's about the author herself.
I scanned the headlines. Read only a scant amount of reviews. Learned Atticus had morphed into a racist and decided to stop before I embarked on my one-night stand — oh, hell, we went at it all day — with Harper Lee’s sequel/prequel of To Kill A Mockingbird. I call it such because of my enamor with the original, written before, yet set after: This novel, which I have been lusting after for many months, would be my July 14 wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am. Nothing else would garner my attention. Nothing else would elicit such ecstasy. It would cause strife between my mother and me as she, like Lee’s Aunty Alexandra, viciously scolded me for neglecting my duties; it bred angst with my husband, despite his usual and Asquinthian ways, and disillusionment from my children, who could not fathom why/how I had the audacity to ever put something else before their adolescent desires.<br/>From the beginning, any seasoned reader can discern that this is Lee’s first approach to a novel, or that it is definitively among her earliest works, which original publishers shunned and requested a rewrite focusing on Scout’s backstory, ultimately spawning pure literary (albeit, heavily and meticulously edited) perfection in To Kill A Mockingbird. The point of view shifts in GSAW are vile — to the degree of disorganization. But, by the novel’s end, this meandering road, full of rich and learned allusions and punchy euphemisms, masterfully twists, weaves and finally arrives at TKAM’s brilliant and enduring message: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” Only now, Scout must apply this to her god-like father.<br/><br/>Jean Louise, after earning her bachelor’s degree, is sent out into the world where, Atticus encourages, she needs to make it on her own. We reacquaint ourselves with 26-year-old Scout as she travels to Maycomb for her annual visit. There, she’s met by childhood friend, Hank, who has loved her as long as he can remember. She balks at marriage and teases that she’ll never consent to the confines of the sacrament. She reveals,  “. . .every woman born in this world wants a strong man who knows her like a book, who’s not only her lover but he who keepeth Israel. Strange, isn’t it?” Hank answers, “She wants a father instead of a husband.” Henceforth, the greatest of all dilemmas emerges. Atticus, the pillar of integrity, courage, and truth, the father we all craved, is not the man we thought.<br/><br/>Critics have made much out of Atticus becoming a racist. What seems unfathomable and irreconcilable is that he always was a racist. TKAM, we must remember, was told from Scout’s point of view, and little girls, as we all know, worship their daddies. Uncle Jack reminds Scout that Atticus was just a man: “. . .you confused your father with God. You never saw him as a man with a man’s heart, and a man’s failings.” Later Jack adds, “Our gods are remote from us, Jean Louise. They must never descend to human level.” The discovery of Atticus’ descent sent my mood spiraling — much like a two-year having a tantrum. I wanted to scream, curse, throw the book, and even stop reading this blasphemous tale. I didn't simply because, as learned in TKAM, real courage is “. . .when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what.”<br/><br/>Thankfully, I kept at it, though it killed my mood and I reported to my family I hated GSAW. By the book’s end, the message was clear. Atticus had not changed. He was who he always was, and that was the man who, in spite of his own beliefs, modeled integrity, courage and truth for his children because he wanted more for them. He was 72, a product of his environment, though not opposed to change, he explained. He wanted better for Scout and Jem, so he did what he thought best to provide it. He wanted their experiences — not his — to reflect their consciences. Atticus tells her, “Well, I certainly hoped a daughter of mine’d hold her ground for what she thinks is right — stand up to me first of all.” And with that, order is restored in my world.<br/><br/>Initially, I was put off by inconsistencies between the two books, the biggest being GSAW’s very brief recollection of the Tom Robinson storyline. I won’t reveal the details, but it’s totally different. A couple of characters change and some material is recycled, but I blame that on the publisher; I learned Lee requested that this text not be edited. No writer is above reproach and even the iconic Harper Lee needs someone to red ink her grammar, which, with the dismissal of colloquialism, is atrocious at times. But coming back to earth, we must remember that the reclusive, publicity-shy author did not intend to publish this current novel.<br/><br/>As I read my last word, with tears streaming down my face, it all came together. It made perfect sense and easily joins the ranks of its sister novel as a classic. The themes resonate on so many levels and like those in TKAM, are sure to stand the test of time. To fall in love with GSAW, we must heed the advice Uncle Jack gives Scout: “. . .it’s always easy to look back and see what we were, yesterday, ten years ago. It’s hard to see where we are. If you master that trick, you’ll get along.” Such is the case of finding harmony in Lee’s two universally different prickly protests on race, gender and class issues.
I think this is a brilliant novel. It's not perfect, and I don't entirely agree with its message, but part of the point is that you don't have to be perfectly on the same page with someone in order to listen to and value their perspective.<br/><br/>In fact, I'm inclined to say that this is a better book than TKAM. Sure, the prose is a bit rough and awkward in the first couple of chapters, whereas TKAM is polished through and through. But it's also her first novel, so that's to be expected. By a third of the way through, the rhythm of the prose had smoothed out, and as I read on I found that it achieved several moments of aching beauty. Chapters 8, 13, 16, and 18 were absolutely pitch-perfect in terms of writing as well as storytelling. The technique of using snippets of conversations was used really effectively in several of these chapters, and I haven't seen it done in quite that way before. So there is some formal innovation in this book that there wasn't in TKAM.<br/><br/>This story is also a much more daring one with more interesting politics than TKAM. I wonder if the reason it wasn't published earlier was that its portrayal of the South was too painfully real. It is a powerful illumination of a certain time and place and the people who lived in it. The characters live, breathe, and sometimes say things that are outright horrifying.<br/><br/>This book says a few things that are hard to say in today's historical moment. The idea that the civil rights movement inflamed tensions between blacks and whites is difficult to acknowledge for many people, especially if they've gotten a whitewashed history of this time period in school. I think many people struggle to see how something that ultimately immense good could have any negative side-effects, even in the short term. For those of us who want to change society for the better, it's important to remember that even highly successful movements to bring about a better world necessarily involve some elements of destructiveness. In this case, the communal bonds of trust, which were rooted in entrenched oppression, broke down when the civil rights movement occurred - but that was a prerequisite to rebuilding those ties on a more equal basis. When all social relationships are descended from the social relationships instantiated during slavery, you can't make progress without destroying some of the foundations of those relationships. That hurts, and it creates backlash. Even formerly good people can get swept up in it and change for the worst. It's still worth it.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think the Atticus of GSAW is as different from the Atticus of TKAM as people want to believe. In both novels, he is fundamentally a legalist. That's why he defends a black man accused of rape in TKAM and it's *also* why he is able to make himself sound reasonable and logical when defending his white supremacist views in this book. This is in fact what many white supremacists are like: perfect gentlemen on the surface, until you really pay attention to what they're saying and the implications of it. And even in TKAM, he wasn't such a progressive; a large part of his defense rested on the fact that the Ewells couldn't be trusted because they were white trash, Mayella was a lying whore, her father committed incest, etc. If you combine the rosy-eyed view of childhood* with the changes wrought by the heightened social tensions of the civil rights upheaval, it's perfectly believable to me that the Atticus of TKAM became the Atticus of GSAW. (*Yes, I am aware that TKAM is narrated by adult Scout. But given that she still presents her father as a hero in TKAM, it seems like that narration must have taken place sometime between when she reached adulthood and when she has her realization in GSAW. So she is an adult in terms of age, but she still sees her childhood through the eyes of her childhood self. She hasn't yet "killed" her childhood self who worships her father as a God and reached full adult independence.)<br/><br/>The portrayal of gender in this novel is also unusual and complex. Jean Louise feels emotionally disconnected from femininity, but rather than declaring herself genderqueer or something she strikes an uneasy balance between trying to live as she's expected to and trying to be the person she really is. This alienated version of womanhood is disappearing now, as feminism continues to succeed in broadening the scope of what it means to be a woman and giving people other options than living confined in an uncomfortable binary role. And that's great. But it's also important not to forget what it was like back then, and how gender was seen differently. Jean Louise's lack of appropriate femininity was seen as a personal eccentricity. She didn't have consciousness-raising groups where she could find out that there were others like her - indeed, many more like her. Even tough, independent Jean Louise could get slapped, hard, by her uncle and not see anything all that crazy and offensive about it. That was what the world was like. The only other book I've read that captures the paradoxical position of gender-noncompliant women in the old South with this kind of nuance is Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle-Stop Cafe. (Yes, the early paragraph about her incompetence with machines was weird and probably should have been edited out.)<br/><br/>By the end, I was in tears and felt the way I do when I've had a fight with *my* family over what I think is right. I felt like I *was* Scout. Usually, I'm not very interested in "coming of age" tales, but I think that's because I hadn't yet read any that spoke to my experience; this one did, even though Harper Lee and I are separated by 64 years. What an evocative portrayal of what it was like to be an unconventional young woman caught between her hometown and the big city, between the stickiness of a past that is never quite gone and the uncertainty of a future that is always just shy of being realized.
Despite all of the s***ty reviews that I had read before picking up the much anticipated second novel by Harper Lee, I was excited! Upon seeing and reading less than encouraging comments on Facebook about, Go Set A Watchman, I became very hesitant, questioning if I even wanted to run out and purchase my copy, if I even wanted to read it. I admit it. I was a coward.<br/><br/>But in fact, reading those reviews helped me read this book with little to know preconceived ideas if you can believe it or not. My beloved Harper Lee was being attacked by NPR bloggers and the like, and that, I could not stand. I decided to read this book with an open mind, I did my best never to assume what the book SHOULD be about, but to let her novel tell a story, which it most certainly did.<br/><br/>Jean Louise is 26, a great age for self discovery and self-doubt, the early twenties being some of the hardest years of any persons life. As readers we see the result of her upbringing, a square peg in a round hole if you will. I felt that the 'grown-up' Jean Louise was exactly as she should be, strong but also confused and self-effacing. Many reviewers where upset about the fact that Jem and Dill were not active characters, well why should they be? It's a different book! It's many years later! Harper Lee didn't write a book to satisfy our needs, but to tell the story, her story. But don't fear, Jem and Dill are still a part of her, still a part of the story so don't get into a tizzy.<br/><br/>Atticus is 72, the same quiet and whitty man that we all first fell in love with. But, this time around, we see more to him, we see the South in him. Now, I'm not Southerner and I won't try to act like I am or that I even understand them, many liberals will have a hard time seeing Atticus as the same courageous, honest, and demagogue of a man that they knew in To Kill A Mockingbird. Keep reading though, despite our differing views with Atticus, despite the hurt and rage that rip through Jean Louise, we still learn a lesson, we still love Atticus and we come to love Scout even more.<br/>I won't get into the racism that I know that everyone is shouting over, because if you are more anguished about that, then you didn't really get the point of the book, did you? Also, I'm not going to talk about the possible murky details behind Harper Lee suddenly deciding to have her book published. It's here and that's all I know for now.<br/><br/>Don't let the reviews discourage you, have your own thoughts and feelings. Read this book with an open mind, approach it like you would a stranger, give it time. If you don't understand a reference, look it up, that's what Google and smart phones are for. Push yourself a little. I cried many times, I identified with Scout and my heart broke with hers, Harper Lee did it again.
This is not the Harper Lee from ''Mockingbird" so be warned. The characters are not recognizable either. Seems to be written by someone else entirely! This is a very minor effort!
What a disappointment this book was.  It should not have been published.  "To Kill a Mocking Bird" seems to have been written by an entirely different, excellent author.
When Harper Lee first submitted “Go Set a Watchman,” the publisher advised her to go back and rewrite the book. She did and the result was “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Unfortunately, someone located the original manuscript and published it to take advantage of the status “To Kill a Mockingbird” has in American literature. The book is prone to long-winded dialogue, especially at the end, and sections written with Jean Louise, AKA Scout, bouncing between real-time and her thoughts. There are long flashbacks that seemed to me to serve little purpose. The story is sometimes confusing, boring, and eventually, I found it irritating. In addition, I was unable to ever develop interest in or respect for any of the characters. Returning home, after having lived in New York, Scout considers disowning her family, friends, and neighbors—both black and white—because she does not accept their lives or beliefs. I found that to be a rather arrogant and self-centered point of view. She seems to miss the point: intolerance is intolerance, no matter who expresses it.
I was not very impressed with the book. Atticus should have had a bigger part so we could understand his views. He was still standing up to help the black person. Scout was so dependent on her Father! She couldn't view him as a separate entity from her. What happened to Jem?
I have read some reviews of this book that were written by people who have obviously not read it. I think this is a great book. It may not become a great classic, but it is more than a good read. I will not go into the issues of Atticus being a bigot that is the big new. I will just say-read it for yourself.<br/><br/>There are several reasons why this book was not published in the 1950's. I think the main one was that it was pretty strong in its writing. But another key reason is that it read like an ideal sequel to a book that had not yet been written. They told her to go and write that book, which she did-and "To Kill a Mockingbird" was produced. This book comes some years after the events of that book. It takes place shortly after the Supreme Court issued "Brown v. The Board of Education". It describes Jean Louise's (Scouts) journey from  being a child to becoming an adult. But, it is done with passion and humor. There are flashbacks to the old days. There are moments of anger and violence. But the characters remain true and there is great depth in the trip Jean Louise take when she visits her old home town.<br/><br/>I like her use of broken dialog at parties. She is a master of wit. She is also a master of drama. She takes us on one hell of a trip through the climax of the book.<br/><br/>This is one powerful book and it is not something that should be scanned or read while watching TV. You need to let it fill you .<br/><br/>I will also say the timing of this book could not be better-with the Supreme Court issuing the decision on gay marriage and all the angst it has produced.
This much anticipated "sequel" to Go Kill a Mockingbird was actually written by Harper Lee as her first attempt at getting published. It was written BEFORE the great classic that we all know and love and it was rejected by publishers and not published until July 2015. I just finished listening to the audio version and I can tell you that the publishers that rejected this book knew exactly what they were doing. It is terrible. It is dry, boring, and slow. I'm actually not even sure it ever even had a point. If Harper Lee actually wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, her writing style must have drastically improved before she wrote it because this book is dry, slow, and tiresome to read.
I was a little worried about reading this with all the controversy surrounding it's publication, so I began by re-reading her To Kill A  Mockingbird, which I probably had not read since my school days.  It was a more enjoyable read now I'm pretty sure, as these would have been quite heavy issues for a 8th or 9th grader.... but the movie had already been made & shown. I probably saw it before I read it.<br/>OK - so now her earlier manuscript, as it was originally, is now authorized for publication - I'm glad it was. It is well written,  in the same kind of voice as TKAM; personal, rich in then-current sentiment & thinking, and provokes us again to face our own beliefs about people and races and humanity at large - AND it adds another dimension most of us had to deal with as kids.  For those of us who had put a parent or a parent-figure<br/>on any kind of pedestal, and many of us did, we had to deal with growing up and removing that pedestal - to see the humanity in that parent and build a new, more mature relationship.<br/>Some have drawn conclusions in this book that I did not see as they did, and I do not fear for Atticus fans to read this one.  I think he is shown well and admirably in both.<br/>It was a joy to read Ms Lee's writing style, as it's not often seen these days. I enjoy & admire many current authors, but I also really admire and enjoy her style, vocabulary and the voice of Scout at many ages.<br/>I do think the advice given to her,  to write what became TKAM first,  was very wise and worked out well for us readers, but am so glad this one finally got published for us as well!
Jean Louise proclaims herself to be colorblind, and might to some extent actually be, but only with people, and only with those people who are black.  She sees issues only in two shades; the darkest of blacks and the starkest of whites, with no grey.  She allows no room for any graduation, in any sense.  And in this, she's the same character she was in TKAM.  There she was a child, in watchman, she's supposed to be an adult, but she clings to a child's eye view- of people, of issues, of events.  For her, everything is either entirely good, or irredeemably bad, with no middle ground.  She's still a child, but to be fair, she's a young adult, who had been somewhat sheltered, and gently reared, so perhaps one can hope that her character could have, would have matured and grown up.<br/><br/>Putting her character aside, it would seem, to me, that while TKAM was written as a memory of things past, watchman was written to be contemporaneous.... which could explain why the characters of Atticus and Calpurnia scan so differently from one book to the next.  Neither person, neither character is wholly good or bad, but both disappoint both Jean Louise and many of the readers who've commented - people who are reading a story of early-to-mid 20th century sensibilities with 21st century eyes and trying to insert their own imperatives, moral and otherwise, and bemoaning that they don't fit.  The book was written in the 1950's, it was set in the 1950's, I'd hazard that had it been published then, there wouldn't be the sort of confusion<br/><br/> that seems to follow it now. Both Atticus and Calpurnia are more developed, 3 dimensional characters, as opposed to Jean Louise, who runs from one hyssy fit to the next, with scarcely time to draw breath between.<br/><br/>Personally, I wish that that long ago editor had requested more development of the plot in watchman.  I wish I knew what happened to Calpurnia's grandson, how his trial went.  I wish there had been more discussion on Atticus' membership in the town council.  And, yes, I wish that Harper Lee had allowed Jean Louise to try to begin to acknowledge, if not actually see, some shades of grey.
At first I was not impressed. I thought it was boring and the writing unclear, at times. I also was unable to avoid the spoiler alerts on the news and I was upset to hear that Atticus was a racist. However, mid-way through the book I was hooked. I think it is a very insightful, nuanced book about families, small towns, class differences, and, of course, race relations in the 1950s. It was interesting to learn about the white southern reaction to Brown vs. The Board of Education in the 1950s. The character development was excellent. It is one of those books, like Mockingbird, that keeps you thinking about it after you are finished. It is not  as well written as Mockingbird (it should had been edited) and it is certainly not as inspiring, but it is a good book with flawed characters. Perhaps it is more true to life - people are often a product of their times and go along with "group think". Atticus is no longer an icon, a hero; he is a flawed human being.
A lot has been said about Atticus the racist, but I found Uncle Jack and his treatment of Scout (and everyone's acceptance of his behavior) troubling as well.
certainly not up to the high standard of To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee certainly caught the confused thinking found in the southern USA to this very day.
Disappointed.  Reads like a high school lit assignment.<br/>Of course, nothing could compare with TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  I was expecting too much, I guess.
I'm of the belief that this book should never have been published and made available for purchase given that it's basically a draft of a great book that was published. I went against my better judgement and purchased it just so I could participate in any potential conversations which might arise around me about the book. About a third of the way through the book, I decided that my reason for reading the book (see previous sentence) didn't warrant me reading a "bad" book, or more aptly an early draft of a great book. My personal opinion is that this book was a money grab by all those who profited from the book by trading on the author's good name garnered from "To Kill A Mockingbird."<br/><br/>I would only recommend purchasing this book if you just want to add it to your collection. My copy will be donated to the local library to be sold for a dollar or two to benefit the library.<br/><br/>Caveat emptor.
Just finished Go Set A Watchman. I am exhausted and wrung out and so pleased at the same time. I got to feel Scout's anguish when she realizes her father is not perfect. Yet, he is perfect in that he makes her finally have her own opinions separate from his. This book needed to come after To Kill A Mockingbird or you wouldn't love the characters and let them play out to the conclusion.
This isn't To Kill a Mockingbird. In fact, this isn't much of a book, but I hae nobody but myself for getting hooked on the promotion,<br/><br/>The first part is ( not even very convincingly ) pure fluff as Scout considers marrying her boyfriend from Maycomb.  The middle is some sort of a discussion of the South's civil right problems.  Though the author, who I strongly suspect just isn't  Harper Lee, gets a White Citizens' Council meeting down pat. I'm a southerner and grew up hearing all of those justifications for segregation.  No danger of my revealing the ending because I cannot figure out what it was. Did she stay ?  did she leave ?  Can't tell.  All of the discussions between Jean Louise and her elders read more like lawyer briefs than what people would typically really say.  I think it is so sad that this mediocre book at best was published.  I know, it was for the money. but Ms. Lee's legacy will pay a price.
Do not buy this book. I love books, but this book I hated! I literally had to force myself to finish it - it is boring and has no substance. It totally destroys her characters from what was my favorite all-time read. Scout turns out to be a very shallow person changing her convictions against prejudice to OH WELL, what can I do, it's just always been that way. Shallow, poorly written.She decides to just accept it. I am not a young person, I lived through the years of integration and went to the High School that was first integrated. It was UGLY. I was raised Southern and taught prejudice, but God opened my heart, mind, and soul to see that it was wrong on every level. I now see why Harper Lee was a one- book wonder!!  Harper Lee, in allowing this writing atrocity to be published, killed the Mockingbird and sullied the characters of her former work. Don't waste your time and don't waste your money on this one!
I read through this book twice. The first time I stopped on the page with Scout going to the meeting. Shocked by the situation, I closed the book, too scared to continue. Not Atticus! Anyone but him. I then read the book again starting from the beginning. I realized this story was about Scout really growing up, and was comforted by the end. I guess we all have to grow up sometime.
I don't want to give any spoilers, but I definitely was dissapointed in what I found out about Atticus Finch's character in this the sequal.  I named my son Atticus!! I can honestly say it did not change my love for Atticus Finch, but it made him seem a little more human. No one person can ecompass all 100% good traits. Atticus Finch is the man to idolize in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Go Set a Watchman brings him down to earth in a huge way. The book to me is really more about that point in your adultholld where you realize your idols/parents are not super human or godlike.  We are all incredibly complex people with often very conflicting morals and ethics. No person is all good or all bad. I think that is the point of the book. Is it disheartening that someone so good can be a part of something so awful? Yes, of course, but it doesn't change the good that person has done, does or is capable of doing.
I find it ridiculous that so many people are simply outright refusing to read this book. It is fantastic in it's own right. Never when I read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' did I picture Atticus as someone who couldn't possibly be racist. I spent many summers in the deep south, I can tell you from experience that people will defend someone being treated poorly even if they themselves don't like said person. It's simply because it's the right thing to do. Not to mention the fact that I have known racists who have made exceptions to the rule for people they've become friends with. Now, yes, people are going to be upset because Atticus is now human, he is not the saint you're grammar school teacher pounded into your head and your B+ book report claimed. That doesn't make him a bad person, that doesn't mean you have to change your child's name. No where in the course of this book did I see anything but Atticus clinging to a life that he understood, in old age one tends to do that. People of today are so quick to judge, to quick to think and far to fast acting to really see the world for how it is. Imperfect. You cant change the way the world was, no matter how much you try to ban it. People will always be offended by something, it's not the rest of our job to care why. I personally loved this book. It might not be the fairy tale ending you wanted it to be, but that's life. No fantasies. Read the book, then formulate an opinion.
Not worth the read. More like a first draft of a novel.  An obvious publisher's ploy to make money.  Cannot Compare to "To Kill A Mockingbird"
This book is trash. I have a hard time believing that Harper Lee actually wrote it.  Since it's difficult to find a thesis at all, it's also difficult to construct a motive for fraud beyond cashing in on a beloved author at the  expense of her legacy and  at the end of her life when she can't do anything about it.<br/> The long meandering dialogs are excruciating.  The characters are inconsistent with in themselves within this book. They are unrecognizable from what they were in "to kill Mockingbird" If one found value in introducing 'flawed character traits' and 'humanity' to a character like Atticus,  there is an obligation to at least do that well. To do it believably. To go to a little bother. The impact that "To kill Mockingbird" has had on the literary world deserves that much. The Scout that we know from "to kill a Mockingbird" had the room to be herself when she was six, seven, and eight years old. She had time and room to develop her own sense of self and her own moral barometer.  This is not a foundation  from which a,  whiny, smoking, baffled 26-year-old  that has a lot to prove is formed.<br/> Audible generously gave me my money back.<br/> I find all of the positive reviews for this book suspect. I can only conclude that the reviewers either didn't read the book or they were paid off.<br/> I am not allowed to give this zero stars if I were, I would.<br/> Run, don't walk.
This is considered he first draft to Mockingbird and it definitely comes off that way.  However, there are a few thought-provoking areas that definitely resonate in the current tense climate of modern politics.<br/><br/>Mockingbird is, and will always be, the most incredible and perfectly written book I've ever come across.  There was never any need to Harper Lee to write a 2nd book.  There was just no topping Mockingbird.<br/><br/>It's my opinion Harper Lee was taken completely advantage of by her manager and estate by publishing this.  I highly doubt she had any real input in what was happening and I find it all of it despicable.<br/><br/>It's worth a read for comparison's sake between a 1st draft and the final product of Mockingbird.  For noting the many changes which were made.<br/><br/>But there were still a few gems to be found, even in this fairly badly written novel.
Poorly written. Did not sustain my interests. Characters not interestingly developed and bear little resemblance to those in To Kill a Mockingbird.
Those who have boycotted this book have made a grave mistake, in my opinion. I can only say that I enjoyed it cover to cover, on so many levels, as a reader, as a writer and as a teacher. Despite the controversy surrounding the so-called nefarious side of its publication and the accusation of bigotry and racism (not at all how I read the nuances of the character in question, mind) I'm so glad it was made available to the public. Anyone who loved To Kill a Mockingbird would do himself well to ignore the negative hype and read this book. It is thought-provoking, brilliantly written, and brings back some of our most beloved characters in literature, giving them an additional depth that is comparable to what we discover about people as we get to know them in real life. Many blessings to Harper Lee for inspiring me all over again to be the best writer I can be.
What I’ve enjoyed most about Lee’s second published novel is the good solid prose that has taken me to a time and place I would not otherwise have experienced. Yes, some of it is ugly—Scout is grown, no longer seeing the world through the eyes of a child, race relations in the South and everywhere had changed in subtle and not-so-subtle ways—but Harper Lee called it as she saw it, I believe.<br/>The first time around, she gave us a happy ending. The second book takes away that happy ending, or at least diminishes it. And in that respect, Lee's second novel may be more honest.<br/>I’ve just finished the book, and I have savored it.<br/>There may not be too many more writers who aren’t in a hurry to cash in. Or too many more lost manuscripts found in attics. We need not feel guilty about reading them.<br/>However, we should not be so quick to judge them.
Very amateurish quality to writing and very boring story. Makes me wonder if this is really the same author who wrote To Kill A Mockingbird????
This book is the worst piece of crap I have ever read (or at least tried to read). Unfortunately it is too late to return it. What a rip off.
This won't win the Pulitzer Prize. It's not as good as I had hoped, nor as bad as I had feared. The racial issues that drive the story are less evolved than in Mockingbird. And, I dearly missed Dill, Jem, and Boo Radley.
I enjoyed reading this book although it was not as polished as it could have been.  The characters were authentic and the events in the book were believable.  Having been a child in the 60s, I remember the turmoil of integrating schools.  I'm sure that men like Atticus struggled with their ethics and their consciences.  It was a difficult time in our history.  This book gives us insight into those times and shows how decent Southern people coped with the issue of integration.  I remember those discussions among my parents' contemporaries--some favoring immediate integration and some favoring a gradual introduction of segregation believing that younger children were more open to accepting each other.  Of course, some were opposed to it altogether.  This is Scout's coming of age, accepting and loving her father as a mere human.
This is an unfinished work which sat in a safety deposit box for decades without editing or rewriting by the author.  And, that is obvious from reading it.<br/>Watchman was written before To Kill a Mockingbird.  Its characters were imported into Mockingbird as the basis of that classic novel.  Watchman is interesting to me for two reasons.  First, while Atticus Finch has been called a racist in Watchman, when read in context, he appears to have been a moderating influence on the most racist of his neighbors during the early days of the civil rights movement.  Second, even if he was a racist, in his defense of Tom Robinson in Mockingbird, Finch shows the best tradition of his profession as a defense lawyer:  he did everything he could to get an acquittal for an innocent man charged and convicted based solely on racism.
This is a wonderful book, Scout grew up to be exactly who I thought she would be. I really enjoyed this different glimpse into her life.
I have read To Kill A Mockingbird many, many times and hand out copies to anyone who hasn't yet done so.  I had heard all of the concerns about how Atticus is portrayed in Watchman and it's true that he is shown in another light here.  That is not what bothered me about this 'book', however.  This truly reads like an early manuscript, unedited except for spelling and grammar.  If given the time and the motivation, I am confident that Ms. Lee would have delivered another masterpiece but this is not one.  I found it very superficial.  I would have liked to see the characters more 'fleshed out' and substantive.  It didn't bother me at all that Atticus had another side to him; it was a different time and none of us is one dimensional.  What did bother me is the sense that this was published for the money.
Imagine for a minute that you are an author. You write manuscript and end up making some really significant revisions that end up begin published as an award-winning book. Now you have the opportunity to publish that earlier draft as an entirely new book. What would you do? While each of us will have our own answer, I think that if the book were to be published as a "sequel" I'd at least want to make revisions to bring it in line with the published work. Consider, Tolkien who creates a new version of the Hobbit to fit with the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Whoever it was who gave Lee the advise to rework the novel really knew what they were talking about. The best parts are the flashbacks to her childhood. The worst are the pages and pages of preaching and a poorly executed climax/resolution.
Judged by its own merits, "Go Set a Watchman" is a fascinating and prescient look at race, gender, class and identity. It is a coming of age novel (that quite frankly reads like a Judy Blume novel sometimes) that anyone can relate to as it asks the question, what do we do when the people we idolized as children turn out to be all too human. It is a flawed book, but in a meta way, it is a flawed book about accepting flawed people and loving them anyway. And I loved this book.
I wish I hadn't spent the money on this novel.  It's basically about a strong-willed child coming of age in the South, and her learning to accept people as they are.  Basically, it's about any child growing up and learning her parents are fallible or may have other unrevealed motives for their behavior.  We all learn these lessons eventually, and reading a book about same doesn't qualify as entertainment to me.  In fact, I found this story quite tedious and the only reason I finished reading it was that I was hoping for an earth-shattering revelation of some sort.  I was quite disappointed with this novel, as "To Kill a Mockingbird" was my favorite novel.  Basically, someone was looking to make a lot of money by trading on the reputation of Harper Lee and her other novel.
This "book" should have been a free download for Harper Lee fans who were interested in it. I blame the publishers for advertising it as they did. It is in no way, shape, or form a sequel.
I was lucky to get this quick from the library because I've been on the pre-release waiting list and had a low number.<br/>The book reads like someone cut up a Harper Lee novel and replaced large sections with their own bad fan fiction. Very uneven.<br/>The voice in the flashbacks is so different from adult Jean Louise, which is pretty genius, but makes me wonder if it was the same writer. The editor was smart to suggest Lee go back and develop that younger voice and setting because that is where the story is. Not all the flashbacks work well, but when Scout is Scout, they do and not just because our memory of Scout, but because Lee's talent really shines through there.<br/>Some of the colloquialisms are charming, some should have been cut because they pulled me right out trying to figure out what she was talking about. Context did not help. ("As long as an elephant" referring to time, not measurement?)<br/>It's also dated, which is to be expected, but painfully so.<br/>Mainly it's just overwritten and underwritten, sometimes in the same paragraph, redundant and I keep expecting Jean Louise to say, verbatim, "I'm not a racist, I have black friends!".
This poorly written plot alternates, moving from the past to the present, throughout the entire story. Disillusioned by her moral upbringing, Jean Louise is seen as the voice of reason in her hometown as she reminds Atticus that his current perception of Negroes is not what he taught her when she was a child. This book is not written in the same vein as TKAM and will never receive the acclaim of TKAM. I dare not recommend it. It is a big disappointment!
Harper Lee's masterpiece was given to me by my wife. It is her favorite book of all time. It struck me almost as much. I per-ordered the book when I heard of its publishing. This whole enterprise is a money grab by the publisher- a real travesty.  The book is a rough draft of the original with many flaws, and indeed is divergent from the final draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird" that you could consider it a separate story, but the book should only be considered by literary scholars with an interest in Harper Lee. It makes a good coaster otherwise. Read or listen to Maureen Corrigan's review of it on NPR [http://www.npr.org/2015/07/13/422545987/harper-lees-watchman-is-a-mess-that-makes-us-reconsider-a-masterpiece] and believe it. She's spot on.
It was a bit difficult to follow along, what with her constant thinkings back to the past.  It brought in Hank, who was not in the original book, and discarded other characters who were.  The book did not hold my interest as To Kill A Mockingbird did, but it did give the reasoning behind the thoughts and feelings of those in the south during this period of time.  I had a difficult time pinning down the exact year when this took place and only got it when I googled To Kill A Mockingbird and found out when the original story occurred.  The ending and the philosophy of her uncle probably told the entire story.  I was not happy with this book and still question if Harper Lee actually wrote it or merely had notes scribbled and someone else penned it.
I nearly stopped reading this book after the first two chapters.  The characters were dense and boring.  Just couldn't get into it.  I talked myself into reading it after hearing about the racism angle because I wanted to see how that played out.  That was the only thing that kept me reading.  Actually I found it to be a boring and verbose book with either unlikable characters or under developed characters.  I am an avid reader and maybe I am just used to a more modern style of writing or maybe the main character, the daughter, was self absorbed, rude, inconsiderate, dense and spoiled.  I won't read the book that came in between this one and To Kill a Mockingbird.  I read TKAM a long time ago and I don't remember how I felt about the style.
I can only echo the other 1 Star comments. I am an avid reader and have read few, if any, more disappointing books. I found maybe 20 pages of interesting, engaging story. Otherwise, I found the writing flat, the characters unrealistic, the story pretty boring. And I found the repeated use of "Scout's" name (Jean Louise) distracting. I believe had this book been published when it was written we would never have heard of Harper Lee again.
Watchman gives a lot to think  about-its not a book to finish and put away--the afterthoughts will keep coming and coming!
I am glad I purchased it.  I wasn't sure I would because of all the hype about it being done without permission; or confused permission.  For those who expect a book like "Mockingbird", it isn't.  But what it did show me was how beautifully written "Mockingbird" was.  It was written thru the eyes of a child.  I fell in love with the Scout's vision of the world.  "Watchman" is told thru the eyes of an adult.  An adult who has to deal with her idealistic memories.  It reminds me that we all, at some time, have to do the same.  We have to accept that our "Idols" were flawed.<br/><br/>Harper Lee's writing is beautiful.  And once I dealt with my ideal vision of Scout's tale, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
I really didn't think there was much of a story here.  When my kindle showed that I was more than half way through the book I wondered if there would be a plot at all.  I think Watchman tells us more about the author than perhaps she desired.  It may explain why Ms. Lee never wrote another book for publication.  This is pure speculation, but is it possible that she realized without her remarkable editor, she on her own couldn't produce a solid piece of work?  Evidently it took two years for author and editor to finish Mockingbird.  If this editor wasn't available after such a close working relationship, perhaps Ms. Lee didn't feel up to the task of creating a book equal to, much less surpassing, Mockingbird.<br/><br/>As regards the book, the main character wasn't a sympathetic person at all.  Supposedly she went to New York and grew up, far "above her raising".  Actually, she comes across are totally self-absorbed and constantly concerned only with how things affect her.  She is a poor listener who isn't interested in what anyone else says or thinks.  How does she expect to affect change if all she does is yell and shame others and then retreat?  The ending was TOTALLY implausible.  The twist that her uncle always loved her mother and that  Atticus knew it, was bogus.  The idea that Atticus and the Uncle were pleased with her whiny, bratty behavior because she stood up for something was so out of character for the characters and would never happen in real life.  It was laughable.<br/><br/>So, I'm glad I only put it on Kindle and didn't purchase a hard copy.  I don't think is was much of a read and probably should not have been published since there was no editing at all.  It's a pity.  Did I mention that it was boring, too?.....and that was from the very beginning.  Sad.
There has been a lot of drama and speculation around the release of Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman.  It began with concerns around whether Harper Lee was taken advantage of; did she even want to release this book?  And then, once the book came out, it erupted into consternation that Atticus Finch was not the beloved hero we all know and love and name our kids/dogs/cats after, but was actually... well, kind of racist.<br/><br/>Luckily for readers, Atticus' daughter Scout is also appalled at learning that her dad's a racist.  Misery loves company!<br/><br/>It took a lot of effort for me to crack open the cover of Go Set a Watchman.  I really wasn't sure I wanted to read it.  I'm glad, now that I'm done, that I did read it, but I don't think I want to read it ever again.  I wouldn't say it is a very tightly-written novel.  The lack of editing is pretty obvious; a lot of conversations seem to swirl around without getting anywhere, and there is a very frustrating lack of resolution at the end of the book.<br/><br/>I want to believe that Harper Lee had some agency in the book's publication.  That she is aware of what's happening in the United States and thought, "Now's the time!" and thus published this book.  I want to believe that To Kill a Mockingbird was the book we all needed in the 1960s, with the white male hero swooping in with a grand (failing) effort to save the day.  And now, what we need is Go Set a Watchman, a way for us to see that ideals need to be cared for and tested for them to last long-term, and to show us just how hypocritical and ridiculous some of our arguments are.<br/><br/>But even if I do believe that Lee had agency in this whole situation, I just don't think she was very successful in her attempt.  There are a lot of important points made in this story, but hardly any deep discussion or introspection.  And everyone in the book is so unaware of their own privilege, it is almost laughable.<br/><br/>And that's what ultimately frustrated me so much about this book.  It just doesn't challenge the status quo enough.  And maybe in that way, it's very much a product of the time it was written (in the 1950s and 1960s), and not a product of the time it was published.<br/><br/>I knew I was going to have trouble with this book as soon as I read the following:<br/>"Had she insight, could she have pierced the barriers of her highly selective, insular world, [Scout] may have discovered that all her life she had been with a visual defect which had gone unnoticed and neglected by herself and by those closest to her:  she was born color blind."<br/><br/>Seriously?!  The only people who ever say (and believe) they are color blind are white people, but Lee never once questioned Scout's flawed logic here.  Even later, when Scout's semi-boyfriend Hank (whom she now distrusts because he's racist) tries gently to point out her own privilege as a member of an old, wealthy and respected family in Maycomb, she is completely unwilling to accept it.<br/>"Hank.  That is untrue and you know it.  It's unfair and it's ungenerous, but more than anything in this world it's just not true... you've got some kind of complex."<br/><br/>This story could have been so much stronger if later, Scout considered her own biases.  For example, after taking her high moral ground as "color blind," she goes to visit her nanny, Calpurnia, whose grandson is going to jail for manslaughter (great timing, Scout).  While there, she never once considers the fact that maybe she is not quite as color blind as she thinks she is, or that maybe it's easy to be blind to color when you are in a place of privilege.  Similarly, she never thinks about privilege as someone from a very wealthy Maycomb family.  She just assumes that everyone else is wrong and assumes that her kicking and screaming is evidence of her being a better person than they are.<br/><br/>Most people focus on Atticus' fall from grace in this book, and he does say some vile, miserable things that were very hard to stomach.  But Scout was a moral compass and strong character in To Kill a Mockingbird, too, and one that was far more approachable and real than Atticus probably was.  And so her fall from grace was even harder for me.  She says she's color blind but she uses the same ridiculous story about the federal government encroaching on "states' rights" that people have been using from the days of slavery to the days of civil rights to today.  And goes on to say, "Well, it seemed to me that to meet the real needs of a small portion of the population, the Court set up something horrible that could - that could affect the vast majority of folks.  Adversely, that is."<br/><br/>But she's not racist.  She didn't care that it was black people who were the small portion of the population the Court "set up something horrible" for.  She would have felt the same way no matter which tiny population came barging into the schools, adversely affecting the lives of everyone else already there.<br/><br/>Can you see why I was so frustrated?<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman felt very much like a long-winded internal monologue without any resolution.  All that happened was that Scout realized her dad wasn't perfect (and yet had no such similar epiphany about herself), but that she loved him, anyway, for teaching her how to make up her own mind.  And that was that.<br/><br/>And it was just not even close to enough.
I'll get right to it:<br/><br/>1. It’s not really a sequel.  First, several descriptive passages are repeated verbatim from "TKAM."  Therefore, a previous reading of the events in TKAM is not presumed.  Among these passages are anecdotes about Alexandra’s corset, the Cunningham/Coningham civil battle, and the history of Maycomb County.  (Glad I re-read TKAM before taking on Watchman.)  Perhaps more importantly, the Tom Robinson trial is re/unwritten.  A rape trial with a maimed black defendant and white victim is recounted, but not only are the names Robinson and Ewell omitted, Atticus won the case!  Any uncomfortable aftermath from trial by the white (trash) community is also unreferenced.  The Radleys, and the enchanting subplot of the children’s fascination with Boo, are nowhere to be found in these pages.<br/><br/>2. It’s not quite the undoing of Atticus Finch.  Although the book is disappointing, it is not the complete dismantling of Atticus Finch that friends and I feared.  Atticus does not use racial slurs (though Alexandra does, once).  He does not evidence any blatant ill will towards or dislike of black people.  What he does is “allow” a segregationist to speak at a citizen’s council meeting.  Eventually, it is revealed, he is against NAACP and Supreme Court efforts to “rush” blacks into…equality? Prominence?...for which he feels “they” are not ready.  I don’t get the feel of white supremacy or malice from the character.  But the idea that he would impose his own timetable on “progress”, and his apparent self-satisfiaction with slowing that progress, is not “our” Atticus.<br/><br/>The now-adult Scout/Jean Louise (Atticus is seventy-two in this book) lambastes Atticus for this view.  In an unsatisfying resolution, Atticus and Uncle Jack alternately patronize and admire her for doing so.  It is implied that Atticus does not approve of the segregationist’s opinions.  That he did not do all humanly possible from stopping the presentation, and that he does not fully avail himself of a full explanation from his actions and views, shows that Scout, not Atticus, is the hero of this novel.<br/><br/>3. As in “TKAM”, no black character gets to express a clear point of view in this book.  “TKAM” gets away with this (note:  not a universal opinion) based on “storytelling magic” and/or the narration of events from a child's perspective.  “Watchman” does not enjoy, and to some views cannot hide behind, that storytelling convention.  The closest “Watchman” comes to this issue is Scout’s visit to Calpurnia.  Calpurnia, through her grammar and demeanor, treats Scout as a guest rather than family, and implies that Atticus is not (or is no longer) a hero to Maycomb’s black community.  Scout’s earnest pleas to Calpurnia fail to break down this wall.  A sad scene, and a heartbreaking contrast to Reverend Sykes’ courtroom instruction for Scout to stand when Atticus passed by after the trial.<br/><br/>Also missing by omission or other devices are Miss Maudie, Jem, Dill, and most of the neighbors we knew; the Finches moved at some point and oddly, an ice-cream parlor replaced the family home.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Watchman tries to tackle the same ground as “To Kill a Mockingbird”, with our hero this time being the New York-exposed, twentysomething Scout rather than her father.  In the process, the magic of our beloved classic is missing along with Atticus' heroism and the charm of the children Jem and Scout.  There are still generous helpings of Lee’s sardonic descriptive gifts, as in the dreaded “coffee” reunion Alexandra arranges.  We also get a previously-untold story from the childhood adventures of Jem, Scout and Dill. Those are among the few pleasures in Go Set a Watchman.  One supsects there are reasons this book was not released in all this time.  I hope I have fairly described most of them.  I join in the skepticism of the motives behind its release.  But it is not (quite) the disaster I’d been warned about via rumor, the Internet (is that different from “rumor”?), and radio.<br/><br/>Caveat Emptor.
Yes, like most of the readers, I have loved, indeed cherished To Kill A Mockingbird. I read it as a youngster, in a different country and had no idea one day I would read more about Scout, Jean Louise, sitting in an armchair looking out on a two acre lawn, with the summer rain beating down and say, 'Thank you, Harper Lee.'<br/>I have thanked her all my life, for Mockingbird, which remains to this day, an American Classic, and at times transcends into an universal classic. The distinction is difficult to explain to American readers. Kipling, Galsworthy, though truly British, Tolstoy, truly Russian, stretched a canvas beyond their culture, language and region. American South, for those who have never experienced it is a different kettle of fish. So when I was young and had no first hand knowledge of Americana, I loved Mockingbird but perhaps never really understood it, till after many a re-readings. A classic transcends generations, by definition. Mockingbird would survive for our grandchildren, will Go Set A Watchman?<br/>We are all-myself not excluded-approach this novel as an extension, prequel or post script of Mockingbird. Is that a correct attitude? Of course, not. No it is a totally independent book: written in 1958, two years before Mockingbird. At the editor's suggestion, Ms. Lee crafted a different novel: and perhaps consciously created an Atticus Finch different from the one in Watchman. But a man very much a White man of the South in the middle 50s. She was dealing in reality. Mockingbird would have been a fairy tale but it touched everyone's heart and became what it is now.<br/>(One can here pay tribute to the astute editor of Harper Row in the 50s who told Harper Lee to go and rewrite Watchman set 20 years back and focus on the characters and the state of South, then. That is what good, no great editors are for. Enhance the writer's vision. Harper Lee did that and in two years of writing and rewriting produced the masterpiece which we revere now. If only we had the earlier drafts of Mockingbird would we know the miraculous hand of the editor no one remembers now.)<br/>Jean Louise is back in Maycomb, Alabama and visiting Atticus, the beloved hero of millions of readers. How she travels in the train and meets the completely new character Henry Clinton, called 'trash' by Aunt Alexandra. In fact, her definition of trash is worth reading and is funny.  But Atticus is the father of yore, and how in her memory he deals with Reverend Moorehead's insensitivity and Scout's consternation about her appearing without clothes, is what Atticus is all about. And when Alexandra rushes into her bedroom and accuses her of swimming with Henry Clinton, naked, Atticus quite without turning a hair says, 'I hope you weren't doing the backstroke!' is again vintage liberalism.<br/>So what happens in the fateful courthouse meeting where Jean Louise sees the hateful Mr. O'Hanlon spewing racial slurs and flanked by Atticus and Henry? That is Jean Louise's death of the mockingbird! She wakes up to what these White people in the South are about.<br/>Just imagine, that the editor at that time, 1958 or so, (it was published n 1960), telling Harper Lee, how much better it would be to make Atticus Finch a real champion or racial equality instead of a bigot? Great, but does that detract from a great character, no matter how different our conception of him?<br/>I think we should be reading Watchman as distinct from Mockingbird. It is by any standards a great piece of writing. It has quaint Southern dialect:'<br/>how many of you have heard of 'set up' in a bar? Or the expression 'woolgathering' ? The writing is authentic of the period and the current editors are wise to let the manuscript alone.<br/>For me, Watchman is a complex novel, short, sure, but padding as it is routinely done now, does but gild the lily. Lord of the Flies, Conrad's classic novellas, Tortilla Flat do not suffer from overwriting, nor does Watchman.<br/>I can keep on writing more, but why? You should be spending the time to read something unique, without comparing with another.<br/>I am actually adding to my review for after I finished reading the book I just did not forget about it. It kind of haunted me. I pondered over it and came to an astonishing conclusion that intentionally or not, the last chapters are a daughter's disillusion with the memory of a beloved father. It is Shakespearean in its anguish-Lear being rejected by her daughters; 'so he kills me and gives me a twist . . how can he taunt me so?' And then her uncle explains to Jean Louise, 'Our gods are remote from us, They must not descend to human level.' I don't think Old Will could have put it any better.
It's difficult to consider this novel relative to its predecessor given the reputation and history that To Kill A Mockingbird has accumulated in the 55 years since it was published. If you approach this novel expecting "To Kill a Mockingbird...A Few Years Later," you're going to come away sorely disappointed, and whining about what a disgrace this book and Harper Lee are to American Literature, which will only mean you've cheated yourself out of what could be a great experience.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel like this book soars over the heads of all the people claiming this book is "terrible" and has "ruined" To Kill a Mockingbird, which is why they're complaining. They don't get it.<br/><br/>This novel announces itself immediately through its POV; it says "thing grow and change and are different." To Kill a Mockingbird's narration is a first person memory of Scout's childhood. We experience some very serious stuff through the innocent eyes of a child. This novel is third person omniscient, which is admittedly, bracing at first, but of course it has to be third person omniscient. With this book, we join Scout in the painful, aching disillusionment that accompanies adulthood. We are confronted with ugly truths and realizations, and we look back on the events from To Kill a Mockingbird in a new, different light. I came away from this novel feeling as if I had both lost and gained something - just another of adulthood's grim, incongruent experiences.<br/><br/>I would have liked more of a glimpse into Scout's life in New York. I can't say with any type of certainty what Scout grew up to do for a career or what she studied in college except for typical liberal arts courses; I felt like that limited me in my understanding and knowing adult Scout.<br/><br/>Harper Lee has a wonderful voice; the way she uses the English language is beautiful to me. I wish I could read something new from her every day because I'm certain it would make me much more eloquent.<br/><br/>Take this book for what it is, and you'll be altered, which is a good thing.
“Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends.” This is only one of the truths spoken by Harper Lee in her sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. Yes, I said sequel. And I’m well aware that Lee’s Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill a Mockingbird, but it functions as a fitting sequel to that timeless, honored tale. In Watchman, twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise—Scout—returns to her hometown to find it and its people changed and to find her aging father changed, as well. Jean Louise must navigate the waters of change, weigh these waves against her own deeply held personal beliefs, and figure out who she truly is. This is the premise, and Lee’s masterful writing propels us to a most satisfying and instructive conclusion. Whether Go Tell a Watchman matches the greatness of To Kill a Mockingbird is for other teachers, other critics, other readers to decide. I refuse to venture into that territory, but I will say that Watchman taught me much while entertaining me, as well. And that’s what great literature is supposed to do. Besides its message, I marveled at the fact that we are reading two books here: one a sequel, one a prequel. As a sequel, Go Tell a Watchman is a beautiful companion to To Kill a Mockingbird, filling us in on everyone’s lives since the first novel ended and fleshing out characters who are now almost twenty years older, for the book is set in the mid-1950s. It is most satisfying to see the strong, independent, feminist young woman Scout has become. And, amid all the publicity about Atticus being a racist in Watchman, I saw him more as an evolved man, part of him wanting his world to remain unchanged and part of him expressing ideas to simply provoke his daughter into growing up into the independent woman she was destined to be. As a prequel, the book is a wonder. Lee had written this fully realized, beautiful book, and then—according to press releases—her editor told her to write a new novel, focusing on Jean Louise at a much younger age. Harper Lee uses her skill as a great writer to take these adult characters, spin them back into a different era, and, for To Kill a Mockingbird, create the youths they once were. I, as a writer myself, am in awe that she knew her characters so well. Having recently re-read Mockingbird, I could clearly see the young Scout in the older Jean Louise of Watchman. And finally, it is prescient that this novel came to light and was released when it was. Lee’s message applies directly to the recent Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, and readers of Go Set a Watchman can apply Jean Louise’s revelations to their acceptance and understanding of the recent ruling. We have heard so much from those who compare the plight of today’s GLBTQ community to the plight of the black community of sixty years ago. Go Set a Watchman pointedly—without Lee realizing it so long ago when she wrote the novel—makes that comparison if we will only see it. And I refer you to my opening line, that quote from Go Set a Watchman. Be it relations involving race, gender, religion, or sexual identity, there is a fine balance between prejudice and faith. That is the lesson we all need, and that is the lesson Harper Lee teaches in Go Set a Watchman.
I just have to say, I am quite weary of reading negative reviews of Go Set a Watchman written by . . . who?  Written by book reviewers who are more concerned about letting us know how brilliant they are in penning their assessment of the story rather than analyzing what the story is really saying.<br/><br/>The first clue that you are reading a review written by a self-important reviewer is how soon they refer to Atticus as being racist.  I would, and will, argue that Atticus was not a racist.  These reviews are infinitely frustrating because people will read these criticisms and they will decide they don’t want to read Go Set a Watchman because they don’t want to read about Atticus being racist.<br/><br/>Let’s look at Atticus shall we?  It was WE, along with Jean-Louise Finch, who placed Atticus on a pedestal as a figurehead for justice in the long-standing battle for basic human rights for Negroes in the south in the 1930’s.  If Atticus were a racist, he would not have had such respect for his house keeper Calpurnia.  He would not have entrusted Calpurnia to provide for and care for his children.  Indeed, in one passage in To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout even refers to Atticus as always taking Calpurnia’s side against her.  Atticus was not a racist, he did not harbor contempt for the Negroes, but he was a self-admitted separatist.  His separatist views were common for the time and were based upon the economic and social mindset of the day.<br/><br/>With nearly as much skill and passion as he argued for the innocence of Tom Robinson, he presents his argument to Jean-Louise as to why he feels it would be detrimental to integrate Whites and Negroes as well as why he feels that, even in counties where the majority of the population was Negro, they were not ready to govern themselves.  In his description, we see that even with his separatist views, in his heart he still wants what is best.  He feels that the Negro’s were not ready to vote and were not ready to govern themselves because they were not educated enough to do so.  In this small snapshot of time and place, we see that he represents a White population who believes they need to be the caretakers of the Negroes.  Not because he bears any hatred towards the Negroes, but because he feels they have been placed in a position (through no fault of their own) in which they cannot care for themselves.<br/><br/>Just as To Kill a Mockingbird was an accurate snapshot of time and place in the 1930’s, so is Go Set a Watchman an accurate portrayal of life in the south in the 1950’s, just prior to the days of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the growing Civil Rights movement.  I believe that if we were able to see Atticus and Jean-Louise in the 1970’s, we would see Atticus believing in the promise that integration, education, and equal rights for the Negro’s would indeed create a better society for everyone.  Atticus was a realist, his views were not entirely inflexible, and he was not racist.<br/><br/>Just as To Kill a Mockingbird was historically accurate for the 1930’s, Go Set a Watchman is historically accurate for the 1950’s.  It may not be a pretty history for our country and for the south in particular, but we can learn from our history in its original context.  We cannot take Atticus Finch out of 1950 Alabama and drop him into 2015 and expect him to be the same person.  Atticus represents the White south of the 1950’s, whether we want to accept that truth or not.
Considering when this was written, the story was somewhat bold for its time.  However, the character of Scout seems so immature and over-reactive compared to her character in "Mockingbird".  I wanted to know more about everyone - background, experiences, etc.  The story left me wanting more and it seemed to me to be incomplete which it probably was.  I think the original editor was so wise to have Harper Lee rewrite this book from Scout's childhood perspective.  I would guess that the same editor would have insisted on more development for this story before being published.  It was an interesting and fast read.  I would still recommend reading this book just to see how she imagined the adult Scout and her family.
I knew of Mocking Bird because of its long-term adoption by many school and university courses, and consequent iconic status - which had always biased me against the book.  But I read Mocking Bird recently, for the first time, and enjoyed it immensely.  As a result I read on Wiki the back-history of Mocking Bird and its author, and the emergence of Watchman - which I promptly pre-ordered for my Kindle.  But Watchman only shows occasional flashes of the good things about Mocking Bird, and the various chapters seem haphazard and unconnected, lacking the care and conciseness of Mocking Bird.  Disappointing - Watchman suffers form its back-story, and from the charm and interestof its brilliantly successful predecessor.
Harper Lee was a much better writer when she wrote To Kill A Mockingbird.  In Go Set ......, her writing is immature, and somewhat erratic.  Scout is more mature at 7 than at 27.  And The character of Jim is a missing element.  Scout needs him drawn clearly, if only in her mind in Go Set....  Also, all the hype about how we would not see Atticus as a hero in Go Set.  That is ridiculous.  Atticus is very quiet at the town meeting towards the end.  It is Scout who reacts to something literally non-existent.  By the time she wrote To Kill......  She knew how she felt about her characters and drew them carefully so that the reader is clear about who they are.  Atticus remains my hero to this day.
This a first draft that should not have been published. Harper Lee knew that, and that is why she refused to edit and release it. I don't know why she didn't want to write or publish another book, (Sophomore stress? Totally understandable.) but she didn't. There is no way that someone can read this book and not feel an impact on how they see "To Kill A Mockingbird." Once you have read GSAW you can not un-read it and you can not stop the influence it has on the characters of TKAM. It changes everything.<br/><br/>I am sad for Nelle Lee. I am sad for what this does to her legacy. However, I do believe that TKAM will continue to be a classic, vital piece of literature.
Apologist for racism.  Recognizing racism without acting to correct it does not compensate for the damage done.
I enjoyed following the premise of the book; the institutional racism of the south in the 1950s, and the legacy of white hierarchy,but the writing was only mediocre, and the plot devices too contrived. Too many lengthy flashbacks, too many caricatures and too few characters. Righteous indignation too easily set aside, and not least the silly stereotyping of strong southern women who only require a good rap in the mouth by a male relative to get them back into line. I reread Mockingbird immediately before reading Watchman. Perhaps the timing was too close. It did reveal an occasional glimpse of what could have been from a literary perspective, but too often fell short.
There is simply no plot to this book. It is utterly boring and I'm so disappointed!!<br/>I can't even finish.
Reading this book, even though I knew from early reviews and newspaper articles that Atticus would be revealed as a hateful racist, was one of the all time worst decisions I have ever made!  And the disappointment that such a great character from TKAMB was now forever tainted is only compounded by the fact that that Go Set A Watchman is boring, disjointed and not even very readable.  It's inconceivable to me that I ruined my love of TKAMB for this waste of time.  It should have remained unpublished.  There are so few things these days that we can actually look up to and revere - such a tragedy to lose one of the great ones.  I wish I had an undo button in my brain.
I was fearful of losing my love for Mockingbird by reading Watchman. Once I decided to approach it as a first draft (which it really was), I could embrace Watchman. Lee's easygoing, storytelling style supports the story very well. However, the story itself is too blunt and becomes rushed toward the closing in its mission to cover certain key points about civil rights in America. If Mockingbird is genius, then Watchman is pedantic. Between the two of them, Lee's attempt to explain the South, its culture and customs is far more subtle, refined and engaging in Mockingbird. Nonetheless, Watchman is well worth reading  to experience real life in the South of the1950s.
What a disappointment - this first book by Harper Lee.  I wish that it had not been published.  I respected Miss Lee for writing To Kill A Mockingbird because she told us something of the best of human kind - showed a person who, at great social risk to himself - stood up for right at a time when he was very much in the minority.  This new book shows one how petty, mean-spirited, and closed minded people can be.  The speaker lets us see her in an unfavorable light and, though, she at the last shows us that there is some slight change in her attitude: she preaches - pouts - leaves us with little admiration for the characters in the book.  I'm sorry that I read it.
People who were upset to find that Atticus Finch was a racist in this story obviously did not finish the book! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" as a teenager who read cereal boxes and roadside signs because I loved to read everything; my husband read it as an adult, at my suggestion, on his Kindle and also liked it a lot; he had never seen the movie either. He was born in Illinois, I, in the state of Mississippi in 1949 and we both really liked "Go Set a Watchman." It is a shame that Harper Lee did not publish more books; she had a way of bringing words to life.....I would absolutely recommend this book!
This did no justice to Harper Lee and the classic To Kill a Mockingbird.  I am sorry that it was published.
Like many others, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this “new” novel by Harper Lee. It could not have been printed first. It’s time is now. Had it been, I doubt that Miss Lee would have had the fortitude to proceed with the publication of TKAM, and the world would never have known that wonderful gift. The story of GSAW tends to meander from Jean Louise’s present day to her reminiscences of her childhood. There are moments that will make you laugh out loud (i.e. Dill and the Holy Ghost), and others that will make you cringe. Is the noble Atticus Finch truly a racist? The short answer: yes. He is far from evil personified, but is not the gallant southern lawyer we all came to know and love in TKAM. He is a product of his age (72 yrs.), time and place. His thoughts are glaringly, awfully, ignorant, yet he is earnest in his beliefs.<br/>In short, just as its predecessor was, this is a coming of age tale. The adult child learns to accept her father for who and what he is, with a genuine, painful wrenching of heart and soul. It is a short book, under 200 pages. But don’t let that lull you into thinking it is not an important story. Read it slowly and carefully. I re-read several passages until I could absorb all the nuances of what the author was trying to tell me. Keep in mind the setting – Alabama in the 1950’s. Be prepared to think and ponder over what you are reading. It is not going to win the Pulitzer, but it will make for lively debates and opinions. What more can you ask?
When I finished this book I found myself thinking that it read like a first novel, which I understand it was even though the events in the story occur some years after those in "To Kill a Mockingbird."  My guess is that if Harper Lee had written only this one book, we would never have heard of her.  It was mildly interesting to look in on the characters years after our first introduction to them, but that wasn't enough to carry the day for me.  I also felt cheated by the absence of Jem and Dill.  I felt that conversations that were probably meant to help us to know each character and move the plot along were often hard to follow.  It was like Lee was writing in family shorthand, and I wasn't a member of the family.
I honestly don't know what to make of this book. It is NOTHING like To Kill a Mockingbird.  I hate to buy into conspiracy theories but I read on Huffington Post that people suspect Lee didn't write this. I can understand why people would think that.  There are some truly bizarre chapters in this book that honestly have nothing to do with the plot.  The ending is even more bizarre.<br/>The racial slurs in this book made me cringe.  I understand it was the vernacular of that time but it feels like Lee is doing it for shock value.  She has even made Atticus a racist although to hear him tell it in the book he is simply defending State's Rights.
This novel is not ready to be published. This is a very rough draft of a novice writer, which is why the publisher told her to go back and write a new one. It shines when she is writing about Scout as a child. Which is how Mockingbbird was born. It feels like it is Miss Harper's personal therapy to resolve her conflicting feelings regarding growing up in the racist South and then moving to NYc. This is her lecture to her home town folk.<br/>Our book club had more discussions about the scandal of publishing this book, than the actual book.<br/>It would be useful for freshman writers... to see how a novel is born and shaped.
The book was very choppy and did not flow well.  The "story" is random and rambling at best.
When Harper Lee submitted Go Set A Watchman she was encouraged to go back and write about Scout's character as a child instead. Thank God. We never would have had To Kill A Mockingbird and it was so much better than this novel. The character development is no where near as robust –if I hadn't read TKAM, I wouldn't have cared about any of them. Plus, the story line was pretty uneventful. Part of the criteria I use to judge a book is by how often I put it down. I put this one down a lot. I'm guessing it would've never been published had Harper Lee's name not been attached to it. I kind of wish it wasn't.
This book was a major disappointment. I was expecting a read the caliber of "Mockingbird".
Go set a watchman is written with flawless skill. Jean Louise Finch, Scout to an earlier generation, is the protagonist/narrator. She is fully developed as a character, as are the secondary characters. The sense of time and place are captured perfectly. The plot moves well and presents the protagonist and the reader with a paradigm of huge dimensions. It was a pure pleasure to read such perfect prose.<br/>It is unavoidable to compare it to it predecessor. To Kill a Mockingbird is classic American literature that would be difficult to recreate. Watchman comes close. I highly recommend this book.
I was so disappointed in this book.  First, I found it difficult to follow, I think because the writing bounced between first, second and third person without warning, and without the writer explaining who was thinking or making a statement.  Second, I couldn't get a good feel for the characters.  After reading TKMB, which flowed beautifully, and provided insight into the characters, I wondered if it was HEAVILY edited, because GSW had an entirely different style of writing, yet both were by the same author.  I wish I had just checked GSW out from the library instead of paying for it.
Harper Lee nails the way things were not only in the South, but often in the North as well after the Civil Rights Act was signed by Pres. Johnson.  She does something else... she is the first person I've read who helped me understand with some empathy the thinking behind the horrible discrimination that black Americans faced.  The complex feelings as the South mourns their culture is mixed in with a fear of the unknown.  Of course, that this discrimination continues today cannot be explained away with that reason or excuse.  And Scout's catapult into adulthood is so well done.
Not very interesting!  Rather boring story of grown -up daughter vs. father, who never appears, but is only talked about.<br/><br/>Other people/family members present his viewpoint, and there is no confrontation between of these two key parties who disagree.<br/><br/>Publisher is selling an exploitation of previous novel "to Kill a Mocking BIrd." and it hardly measures up.<br/><br/>No wonder it took so long to get it to market!<br/><br/>It is obvious that previous and cooler heads at the publisher did not want any part of selling this very uninteresting book.
Awful.  Should never have been released.  This is a first draft at best.  I'm sorry I read it.
Enjoyed it very much. I seemed to see it all in my mind. I couldn't put it down. A great read.
Please don't buy this book, I think it's a con. I so regret buying it but I  read lots of reviews and thought I would try it, out of curiosity, but also because many reviews said it was very good - it certainly is not good in any way at all. There is also nothing at all in the writing that would lead you to believe that the author was Harper Lee - nothing at all - the vocabulary, the scene setting, the cadences of the writing, nothing is Harper Lee. I am amazed that it is marketed as being written by her, I simply don't believe it. Oh yes, it's extremely boring as well.
Excellent read!
I, for one, enjoyed the book.  I know there have been many opinions pro and con out there, but her story is told as things were in that era in the south.  The situation she finds as an adult person really stuns her - especially the position her father has taken on race relations, but she later comes to understand why.  Her childhood memories are so different from what she is experiencing in the present day.  The hard realities are setting in, and it is hard for her to accept.  A great analysis of the individuals and characters that make up Monroeville and surrounds.
So sad that greed motivated publishing this book and tarnishing the name and talent of Harper Lee.  The only interesting thing about this book is to understand the power of a great editor.  This book was turned down for publishing and Harper Lee took from this hot mess and created the amazing To Kill A Mockingbird.  Go Set a Watchman should have never been published.  The characters are poorly developed, the book wanders around the story line is not effective.  Sad, sad, sad.  Don't waste your time or money and don't reward the greed that got this published.
It's clear from reading this book that Harper Lee didn't write To Kill a Mockingbird. Truman Capote did. Shame on Ms. Lee's guardians for deciding to make a fortune by exploiting her and arranging for this book to be published. It's clear why she never did publish it while she was in control of her affairs--it's a third-rate novel which is clearly not the level of Mockingbird. Don't bother buying it unless you're just curious. Better yet, if that's the case, check it out of the library and save yourself some money. Second rate Chick Lit and nothing more.
this was not what I expected and that is what made this book so powerful and awesome. Don't read people's reviews. Just read the book.
Sincerely phony apologist bulls***.  Disappointing and sad. We should have left her alone.
So distressing-- I was horrified to read this underdeveloped, poorly edited travesty.  Any media recognition of the novel is due purely to its connection to the beloved classic that precedes it.  In the heated discussion between Scout and her father, it reads as though someone tinkered with the text to bring in highly politicized views.  Scout loses her strength as a female - sprinkling her argument with statements such as "..I don't know anything about it," (the constitution/ the Supreme Court).."and I don't want to know much.."
This weekend I read Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee (who also wrote To Kill A Mockingbird if there's anyone on earth who doesn't know that, lol)<br/>There's something you should be aware of before you read this book - in case you haven't already read it<br/><br/>Go Set A Watchmen was written FIRST, it was just never published. So things that happen that don't seem relatable to To Kill A Mockingbird (both stories are about the same family - just set 20 years apart) - keep in mind she really didn't "know" some of these characters yet.  Even though things happening to them in this "second" book (which was written first.... is later in their lives, lol) I have a feeling that this was her first draft and eventually changed and became TKAM.<br/><br/>Ok - EVERYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT IS A SPOILER.<br/>SPOILER ALERT!!<br/>SPOILER ALERT!!<br/>DON'T READ IF  you haven't already read GSAW and YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW!!!<br/><br/>Ok, I was disapppointed in the book. It becomes very obvious very quickly that this book was pretty much unedited, that it was written as her first book and that she was still learning the art and science of writing.<br/><br/>She has many long long run on sentences and many "unsentences" (sentences that seem to go nowhere).<br/>Check out Part III Chapter 10 - the next to last paragraph. One sentence makes up the entire paragraph, it is 81 words long!!!!! and it pretty much makes little sense. This is the worst example, but there's many more throughout the book.<br/><br/>This book is basically a rhetorical Political musing on the author's part.<br/><br/>Scout (Jean Louse Finch) comes home to visit. She lives in New York now. And she discovers her father and "fiance" (you'll see why I have that word in quotes) are not, politically or morally, the men she thought them to be, and it almost destroys her.<br/><br/>She goes to her favorite uncle to discuss it with him and he goes through a huge long-winded discussion about the South and why it is what it is, none of which answers her question.<br/><br/>She's told when she reaches the point where she simply cannot stand it anymore, she is to return to him.<br/>Ok, skip to where she simply cannot stand it anymore - he punches her in the mouth!!!! and this abuse clears her mind and makes her "see" just how foolish she's been. HUH??<br/><br/>Bottom line, the Finch family is a huge dysfunctional family, where everyone despises all the other members but pretends to like them (and tolerates them best as they can) (NOT what I got from To Kill a Mockingbird!)<br/><br/>Add to this a big party her Aunt throws for her where all the dull women citizens of Maycomb come and drool their political idiocy in a long long chapter of non-sentences. Each sentence is simply phrases from each woman strung together by a series of ellilpses. (which I soon began to scan and skip).<br/>To sum it up, I can only say that I'm very very very very happy to have read To Kill a Mockingbird FIRST or I would have missed one of my best-loved stories.<br/><br/>If you've read, what did YOU think?
I'd like to keep this brief since if I were to go on about all the reasons this book is deeply personal to me, the daughter of a Kentucky minister now living in a global metropolis, I would most likely loose the point of why I think this is a book that is extremely important for all young Americans of my generation at this specific time in history.<br/><br/>For those of us who grew up in the 90s reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" this book is an experience of disillusionment and cognitive dissonances mirroring Jean-Louise's own journey in the book.  Everything we believed about this world seems turned on its head and all our idols have been broken.<br/><br/>But I disagree with the reviews that say this is not a coming of age novel on the level of Harper Lee's first best seller.  If anything this book is nothing but one giant growing pain that a reader like me must experience in the act of reading.<br/><br/>At this time of extreme civil rights and political unrest, not unlike the time in which this book was set and written, a new social civil war is breaking out dividing family's and friendships along lines of ideals.  What do we do with the fallen idol?  What do we do with the person whom we love, but who's views we find absolutely repulsive and unconscionable?<br/><br/>This book does not provide all the answers we're asking about the civil rights struggle today, but it is my belief that it does provide a picture of what love looks like in the midst of a revolution.<br/><br/>Scout is now Jean-Louise and she is as imperfect, straight forward, quick to speak and quick to fight as ever as a 26 year old woman, struggling to reconcile her idyllic memory of her childhood home with the seat of racial hatred it seems to have become.<br/><br/>Atticus is still Atticus, no matter what your Twitter feed may have led you to believe.  But the reader would do well to take note that this is our first opportunity to meat him on his own terms and not through the lens of Scout's nostalgic first person narration.  He is an arthritic 72 year old Southern gentleman.  A man of principals and convictions, and very full of love.  A flawed man and not above mistakes.<br/><br/>As for Uncle Jack, who returns in a big way in this novel...all I can feel towards him is gratitude for being there during this particularly difficult growing pain.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect book, with pacing issues and in need of editing, but it's a TRUE book and a deeply personal one for our country.  If we are willing to set aside our bigoted attitudes (look up the actual definition of "Bigot" in a dictionary, as Jean-Louise does) and listen with mercy and love to all the voices in this volume, I feel that our country can glean some wisdom about how to love each other right now, even if we don't and cannot agree.<br/><br/>Harper Lee, whether you wanted this out there or not, I give you my gratitude for ever writing it.
The timing of this book's publication couldn't be more relevant. The issue of a Supreme Court ruling overturning states' rights comes off of 2015 headlines. The issue is different, but at the same time the same. Even the recent confederate battle flag controversy relates to the mindset of southerners a hundred years after the Civil War.<br/><br/>Lee's writing is, in my opinion, equal in skill with To Kill A Mockingbird. There are enough flashbacks to her childhood to please nostalgists, and the reader can imagine Gregory Peck saying all of Atticus Finch's lines without a hitch.<br/><br/>In Watchman, we see an Atticus Finch that Scout sees as racist, but he sees himself as more of a helicopter parent to a race of people. He doesn't admit to racism, but he does admit to snobbery. The black people of mid-century Alabama are children who need a careful guiding hand in order to be slowly and gently lead into responsibility and civilized behavior.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the book is going to cause controversy, but what I hope it will also do is what it could never have done had it been published any earlier: Make us understand that truly good people can have truly messed up ideas. Having a wrong idea does not make someone a bad person. Atticus is not a bad person. He has not changed, he has always been this way. He has never hated black people, he has always respected them as people, just not as mature equals. I see the same attitude reflected in how he raised his own children: He raised them as equals who were entitled to use his name when they addressed him and were given an unprecedented (for the day) level of autonomy. He did not, however, let them do anything they wanted to do, he let them be only as long as they acted appropriately, in his opinion. He understood that they needed guidance until they matured enough to be on their own. He believes that this should be done for blacks in the same way; gradually in order to protect them from themselves.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that black people needed guidance before they could mature enough to become equal citizens. I'm only explaining how I see Atticus's mindset.<br/><br/>With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that the Supreme Court decision (Brown vs. the Board of Education?) was necessary, because regardless of the willingness that Atticus and people like him believed themselves to hold, the willingness to allow blacks to be equals, they were not doing enough. I believe if Atticus and state's rights had had their leisure to work things out at their own pace, we'd still have legal segregation in at least some parts of the south.<br/><br/>What Atticus and people like him are really protecting, is not the blacks, but the whites. The conditions were such that no matter how sudden and shocking the transition, anything was an improvement for the blacks, it was only a burden for the whites who were forced to make accommodations quicker than they were prepared.<br/><br/>In the same way, the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling is forcing heterosexuals to accommodate homosexuals at a more advanced pace than would have been possible if left up to the individual state legislatures. I believe that, just as with the civil rights rulings of the 50s and 60s, the country will not collapse, the Chicken-Little predictions will not come to pass, and everyone will learn to deal with it.
I found the book slow for the first 25 to 30 pages. Then catching as Harper delved once again into her past, which I believe is her forte. Most of it reads well from there, with strong reflection on the upheaval of the south in the 60s and rights for Negroes. But there were typos which detracted/distracted from the reading. Not many, but some. With dialogue at first that was stilted. The most blatant finding, though, was an inconsistency in "Scout" remembering how Atticus, representing the young Negro man in the rape case, had actually acquitted him, which was not so in To Kill a Mockingbird. Despite a plethora of evidence of his innocence, he was found guilty. Then he ran and was shot. Killed. Big mistake. Big disappointment. So sad that the story was not proofed before publication.
Amazon wants us to select "Predictable", "Some twists", or "Full of surprises" to describe the plot of the book. They need another box titled "None of the above". There was no plot, but a lot of plodding dialog that went nowhere. Jean Louise was angry from the very first and remained angry until the very last. There is very little character development, so without knowing them from TKAM, I would have been scratching my head trying to remember, "who are these people ?" Jean Louise graduated from college and was living in New York. Doing what? She was home for two weeks to visit the family. After two days she was ready to leave. Then it just ended with no resolution to the conflict. Meh. The whole thing was simply tedious. And I so wanted to love it.
Not what I expected. Disappointed with the writing and poor quality if the books theme.
Like a few other reviewers here, I'm thinking there was a good reason Harper Lee never had this one published.  To me it read like a "young adult" novel. Plot was practically non existent, characters were wooden and Atticus himself was almost invisible in the book. We are in chapter 12 before we get the explanation of his racism. FAR too much focus on Scout as a young girl. How many pages can one devote to going to the Senior Prom? Too many in my opinion. As one reviewer asked, "are we sure Lee actually wrote this"?
When I started this book, I made a point to blank the other from my mind.  It is. Not fair to look at it with what amounts to the prequel In view.<br/>The writing is a bit looser, more dreamy.  For me, that makes the pain Scout feels much more visible.  In fact, the entire book is basically (to me) a bit more of her growing up.  A painful bit that, had she been raised differently, allowed to become just another wife in the town she grew up in, would not have been necessary.<br/>A lot has been made of how Atticus Is portrayed in this book.  I read the same book, I think, and came to the conclusion that he was watching to make sure justice was still done.  Ultimately, the book I read was about a woman trying to finish growing up, and learning her parent was human after all.
This was just OK. Definitely not To Kill A Mockingbird. I tried to keep this in mind the entire way, but I just got bored. The only thing new here is that it was Harper Lee's first novel. Knowing now what we do about Scout, Atticus, et all, it's hard to read this as a stand alone novel. The genre of southern bigotry and ignorance has been DONE over and over in literature so I didn't feel like I was reading anything new. Granted that was not the goal from me from the outset. This book should not have been published now.
Terrible... Just awful... one of the worst things I have ever read - especially since it was written by the author of a semi-classic -- what a miserable swan song (and completely out of tune!) ... as if Harper Lee watched "Birth of a Nation" 100 times, and then read a really bad Classics Illustrated version of "Intruder in the Dust" -- completely misunderstanding Faulkner's point... what a terrible waste of time and paper...it almost serves to subtract "To Kill a Mockingbird" from existence...
I was very disappointed in this book. There were a few patches that were interesting and amusing, but overall large slabs of conversation, events that were poorly organised, unintelligible emotions, not too mention fairly brutal treatment of Scout by her uncle. Scout, too, came over as annoying and immature. If you loved  To Kill a Mockingbird don't read this book. The warmth and humour and moral integrity that make Mockingbird such a loved and enriching book are not present in this raw and poorly edited book.
I thought it was amateurish and terrible.  Too much hype for not much of anything.
Harper Lee has written another masterpiece here.  Despite the plot's being twenty years after T=o Kill am Mockingbird, Jean Louise is still confused and concerned about the political thought of her home town, Maycomb County.  Even though she is no longer an  innocent child, she stiill seeks the truth about human nature.  Lee's use of the characters of Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack reinforce the differing thoughts of the time within Jean Louise's family, thus expertly illuminating Jean Louise's upbringing in the South.  The humor, the pathos, and the horror of Southern thought are brought to the forefront again in Lee's work.  Miss Lee, I thank you for this novel.  My life is now complete with its appearance in my life.  God bless you.
What the Heck was that.  Was so excited to sit down and read Go Set a Watchman.  Quickly re read To Kill a Mockingbird and loved that book all over again.  Then got a brick to the face.  About 20 pages into GSAW was ready to stop.  No I must keep going.  So sorry I wasted my money and time.  It was rejected by the publishing houses for a reason, and I am glad it was b/c without we wouldn't have to Kill a Mockingbird.  But save your money and buy something else.  This is not the book you are looking for.
I love Harper Lee's writing style. When she is telling stories from Scout's past, it is wonderful. But I fail to see why she had to re-write the very message of To Kill a Mockingbird. Watchman turned out to be one giant, rambling apology for bigotry. That is not what Mockingbird was all about at all. So disappointed. If you loved the original book, do NOT read this one. I want to wash it out of my head. I want to be able to un-read it and go back to the book that inspired me to be a lawyer for the ACLU.
There is a reason that this book was never published. I have mixed feelings about both the content and the writing. I grew up with people who espoused all the views in the book, so it's not the portrayal of the characters that bothers me most. I just feel that the book doesn't tell a good story - what was the point? Is it just "Scout grows up"? Is it about racism? The writing is uneven and occasionally seems preachy. (I hate preachy.) I never understood the motivation for most of the characters and their actions, other than as caricatures.<br/><br/>Some people will dislike this book because it takes a quite different moral perspective than To Kill A Mockingbird. Some people will find it politically incorrect. Some people will be disappointed in Harper Lee personally. I think the book will continue to cause controversy, as it has since its publication was first announced.<br/><br/>I wish Harper Lee well, and hope that the hype/controversy around the book will make her some money. I hope this was not just manipulation of a old woman by others.
I really wanted to give this book a chance, but it failed in every aspect. I was even willing to let Lee destroy the character of the beloved Atticus Finch as long as it was necessary thematically, if she would have let Scout come out heroically, but no, she destroyed them both, and thematically, it is a black hole of tepid platitudes. Additionally, it was poorly written, full of cliches and shifting from third person to first person perspective in the middle of sentences. DON'T read this book!
This is NOT a series!  GSAW is a first draft that resulted, after some hard work, in To Kill a Mockingbird.  When Harper Lee declined to publish GSAW  she was right to do so.  As an illustration of fine editorial work, it is of interest.But, if you, as I, loved To Kill a Mockingbird,.don't reward the publisher by buying GSAW, get it from. your local library.<br/><br/>Then, remember Harper Lee as the author of one Tdamned fine book and be grateful to her editor who recognized it's potential
Didn't read it because it is the draft written by H. Lee BEFORE TKAM according to most established critics.  Her editor recommended changes in the whole story line of this draft and she delivered a great novel.  Most authors love their work, first draft or just notes, and she didn't destroy the draft.  To say it is a "new" novel or sequel, or whatever, is nonsense as the characters and plot are wholly different and not in the same story line as the final novel that was published.
Very disappointing.  The characters are poorly drawn with a rambling narrative.
Okay, first of all, when your other book is among the most beloved of all time, nothing else you do will measure up, that is certainly true here.  Secondly, everyone is up in arms about the portrayal of Atticus Finch in this book, but i find that to be inconsequential, the book is not about him, the book is about Scout.<br/><br/>This book is very good, definitely worth a read for many reasons.  It is an interesting look at the process of growing up and claiming your own place in the world as well as trying to escape the shadow of an enormous family legacy.  Second, i found the setting, at the intersection between the Old South and New South, the Pre and Post Civil Rights movement to be fascinating as an exploration of small town life in the South during this defining period of the last 100 years.<br/><br/>Certainly worth a read, if the reader is willing to shed their own preconceptions and prejudices based on past novels and film portrayals and take this story for what it is, its an excellent exploration of place, family and independance
Not anywhere near the quality of to Kill a Mockingbird,  I stopped reading it.
I will never believe this novel was written in the 1950s.  Ever.  I am sure it was written very recently,  and not by Harper Lee if in fact she actually wrote  To Kill a Mockingbird  ( one of my favorite books of all time.)  Perhaps Truman Capote collaborated on  TKAM  or this novel was a rough outline and has been ghost written and filled out in order to make a million bucks on Harper Lee's name.<br/>  None of the settings, descriptions or plot advancement rings true to the  1950s or 1960s at all.  I lived those years, and people did not speak and act like the puppets in this book.  Anachronisms galore.  I think the whole novel has been misrepresented and nothing will convince me otherwise.
After hearing the criticism of this book before it arrived, I was hesitant to read it, but I'm really glad I did. I was afraid Atticus was going to be a reprobate, but fortunately he wasn't. Having come to learning-to-think-for-myself-independently-of-family-friend-church-later than most, I SO understand Jean Louise's anxiety and shaken world. I feel like the Atticus of GSAW was realistic of a 72 year old Southerner in the beginning days of the civil rights movement. I don't think the essence of who Atticus was in TKAM changed in the new book. The goodness of Atticus lives on, just in a more human and relatable way. And finally, I'm taken with how applicable this story is to our world today.
Because I absolutely adore Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, I slogged through Go Set a Watchman, hoping to find a bit of Scout and her gang and some bang-up storytelling. But I was very much disappointed. There are a few noteworthy scenes (which I why I am going as high as two stars), but the novel as a whole fell flat. Go Set a Watchman would be meaningless without To Kill a Mockingbird. It doesn't stand alone as a novel. Guess the publishing house made some big bucks.
I was disappointed in this prequel to To Kill a Mockingbird.  I actually found it downright boring until the last quarter of it when it finally got to the point.  I judge a book In large part by how reluctant I am to put it down and how anxious I am to pick it up again.  This took me weeks to read just because there was nothing there to keep me coming back.  Maybe that's not the best criteria for rating a novel but if a book doesn't hold your interest how good can it be?
I read MOCKINGBIRD in high school and didn't appreciate completely Harper Lee's literary talent. Seven pages into WATCHMAN I was completely blown away by her lyrical composition. I was not disappointed as the next 270 pages matched the first seven. I have purchased MOCKINGBIRD and will undoubtedly re-read WATCHMAN to catch any nuances I missed once I have familiarized myself again with Maycomb of Scout's youth.<br/><br/>With that said, I have been disappointed by two things related to the great controversy surrounding the "discovery" and publication of WATCHMAN. First, there was a great deal of speculation about the quality of WATCHMAN to the point of almost gleeful anticipation of Harper Lee's fall as a literary giant of the 20th century. Remember it wasn't so long ago that some speculated she didn't write MOCKINGBIRD. Those voices were so wrong and it is so sad that some may not read WATCHMAN; it is their loss because the book is as relevant today as it was when it was written. Actually, it might be more relevant today as we are ready to hear the message. Second, how sad that we will only ever have these two books from Harper Lee. How disappointing that something, maybe the editorial process, stopped her from writing and fulfilling her promise. I wish she had continued writing, but I am happy to have these two books at least. These disappointments aside, I say ignore the naysayers and read WATCHMAN!
Pointless novel with no plot, one-dimensional characters and a very unlikeable narrator. Not worthy to be associated with its predecessor. Definite money grab.
Do NOT waste your money on this drivel - Harper Lee spends all of a couple of pages describing what made Scout's opinion change - all because she attended a meeting that was somewhat racist.  No wonder the publisher initially turned the script down. The author does do a very good job with the visual images conjured up in other parts of the book. But this is boring, boring.  If I had my do overs, I would not have wasted my money purchasing it.  And what a dumb title.
I didn't expect much and was not disappointed. I can see where a great editor would say, "Here's your brilliance––focus here and forget your proselytizing. As a writer, I sympathize with her first effort. We all want to come home again, but most of the world does not want to go with us. Nonetheless, I am glad to have read it and really glad to get it over with. And it does illustrate how rewrite after agonizing rewrite can produce an unforgettable work of art.
I ordered the book reluctantly after reading all of the reviews from the various media outlets as well as Amazon readers.  I must say that the criticism is valid. It wasn't a very long book but it took me a great deal of time to get through it.  I could only read about an hour at a time.  I guess knowing that it was a possible first draft that was put aside so she could write the classic TKAMB, made me take it all in with a grain of salt.  There really wasn't a plot.  I am an avid reader of southern literature from both the white as well as the black perspective. Fiction and nonfiction. This was just a dumb book.  The one thing I can say is that the narrative regarding the Supreme Court was prescient for 2015.  The same rhetoric used by Atticus is currently being used by today's politicians.  Sadly, not much seems to have changed.  It was very disturbing to me as an African American woman born in '63.  I know both books are fiction, but sadly rings too true.
I wasn't going to read this, but then I changed my mind. I'm so glad I did; for anyone who lived through a certain period in the south this is a must read.
This is so poorly edited and it saddens me that they published it. The plot development is slow and disjointed, the dialogue often rambling, the message of the story is unclear. I can't imagine what it would be like to read this without having first read To Kill a Mockingbird - I think I would've been completely confused! Also there's an entire chapter that is almost identical in both books. I cannot imagine that Harper Lee intended for this to be published.
Rough draft in my opinion at best.  After reading, I understand fully why her editor rejected it and told her to try again.  "Scout" grew up to be a pretty unkind person in my view.  This to me tarnished one of the greatest books ever written and destroyed the mystique of the 'one hit' author.  This should have stayed in her safe deposit box as again I think the author and Mockingbird are now tarnished somewhat.  I wish I had never read it.
Much of what Lee writes about in this book just seems stale.  The dialogue is not inspiring.  But far more important than that<br/>is the focus of the hatred of the uneducated blacks which Lee refers to with the "N" word, far too often.  This book should have been left where it was found after  these many years and never been published.  I don't think it adds any literary gifts to us at all.<br/>  It is not another To Kill a Mockingbird.
I enjoyed this book. It was nice to find out what happened to the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird and to learn a bit more about Scout's mother, Uncle Jack and even Atticus. I would say that this book evokes much of the turbulence of the time it is based in. A complicated time and a time of change. The characters we all came to love are affected by these changes and challenges to the way things have always been. It's definitely worth reading.
Most boring book I ever tried to read could not get past the 3rd chapter
This book should never have been released. I doubt if Harper Lee would have released this book without someone else's influence.It was hard for me to finish the book. It put Atticus Finch in a bad light and he was a everyone's hero in In to Kill a Mockingbird. I hope it will not change the public's  feeling about one of my favorite Gregory Peck movies, and taint the character of Atticus Finch. I do not object to the writing only the content.
This previously unpublished novel by Harper Lee reveals to reader the source of the themes and ideas and characters presented in her first published book, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Like Scout, LEE came into her own and certainly changed the thinking of millions with her brilliant reworking of these ideas in. until now, her only published work. While nothing can be better or even as good as MOCKINGBIRD, one should not be read without the other.
This book was supposed to be written before "to Kill a Mockingbird".  I believe it.  I think it was written when Harper Lee was about 13. Every cliched generalization imaginable is in this book.  I am now rereading To Kill a Mockingbird.  Absolutely beautifully written.  The descriptions fly off the page.  Whoever convinced Harper Lee to publish this, must have been motivated by sheer greed and should be ashamed of herself/himself.
Some people have already pointed this out, but the fact is very little actually happens in this book. It moves at an absolutely glacial pace and we don't get to the primary conflict until fairly near the end of the book. The central conflict is uncompelling (mostly the main character's horror at finding out that her father was a racist) and Atticus's motivations are never convincingly explained. In a word, this book is thoroughly boring.
Surprisingly, thought this book very boring because To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books. Probably a reason Harper Lee never had it published.  Why would you change beloved characters character without giving an explanation.  I suppose uncle Finch gave her one but I hated the fact that he hit her to get her to listen to his reasoning. I think it all had to do with the time period but for me had no real storyline.
Though the language is not as eloquent as  To Kill a Mockingbird, its content strikes deep. I would see it less as a critique of Atticus, who is whom he always was as a father, but an honest look at what happens to our heroes as we grow up and look at them with the eyes of an adult. Jean Louise comes into her own, she makes a stand in the only way our Scout of old could do and it is a heart-wrenchingly necessary and beautiful thing. In the end, though not as polished, for obvious reasons, it has its own eloquence and its own place as an enduring work.
This book has to be on anyone's short list for most disappointing book.  The book is written beautifully and as much as I disliked it, I finished the book.  The one major thing missing is PLOT.  99.9% of the books volume did not address any plot and the 0.5% that did almost seemed like Lee put it in the book because her editors told her there must be "some" plot.  Very disappointing.
Obviously a first effort.  However the attitude of white "moderate" leaders in the small town South of the 1950's, such as Atticus and Dr. Finch, are extremely accurate.  I grew up in that atmosphere.  Jean Louise is a way 'over the top" in her reactions to them in the light of her own prejudices.  The childhood memories are a foretaste of the genius of "Mockingbird".
A MUST read!  Thank you Harper Lee for publishing your sequel!
What a wonderful novel. I'm so glad that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was published first because this book would have not been understood as well if it would have been published before. Even with all the controversy over this book I absolutely loved it. I'm sure that many people are not going to agree with me but this is a beautifully written novel that should have been published years ago.
Well worth if for no other reason than to learn more about the writer's craft.  It's clearly a first-draft which is immensely encouraging when we consider the final version, __To Kill a Mockingbird__.  Reading it while I'm rewriting and struggling with point of view helped me remember as a wise editor once wrote on a manuscript:  "there is no good writing, only good rewriting."
Despite all the advance negative press, I was impressed by the writing and 'proud' of Scout (so obviously the author!) Yes, it would have been confusing or even irrelevant without "Mockingbird" but even Atticus, as racist as he was (or became), seemed to be impressed by Jean Louis' defiant anti-racism by the end. Became a real page-turner too, to find out how aspects resolved.
This is a different story than To Kill a Mockingbird. Instead of Atticus teaching Scout a lesson, Scout learns a much more nuanced lesson from everyone in Maycomb.  I loved this story as much as I loved Mockingbird, and if it had gotten the editing that Mockingbird did, I am sure it would have been as acclaimed as Mockingbird.  I am disappointed that people don't like the story because they feel it insults Mockingbird--it is the first story Harper Lee wrote, and she wrote a DIFFERENT STORY when her editor suggested she tell a story from Scout's childhood viewpoint.This story is set about 20 years after Mockingbird, and instead of seeing Atticus as a child, Scout has her own attitude concerning racial issues, feminism and her father.  I loved this book.
I read this novel shortly after seeing "To kill a mockingbird" again.<br/>The comparison is inevitable! This novel would not be comprehensible without the other. We need the background of Jean Louise's growing up with her brother alive and her father young and vibrant first. This book doesn't work by flashbacks alone; it's more a treatise on the '50's south than an intact novel.
To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book so I was pretty excited to read Go Set a Watchman. I found that the only parts I really enjoyed were when Scout was remembering an incident from her childhood. The rest is like listening to lectures on politics and race. Really boring. I can see why the publisher suggested that the author write a book about the kids when they were kids.
This must be on the best seller list because of the author and all she stands for having written possibly one of the most important works of our lifetime.  I could not believe how boring and unimportant it could be.  I made myself read it because of Harper Lee.<br/>Would not recommend it myself, but I know book clubs all over the world are considering this book, mine included.
Wonderful book by Harper Lee describing life in the Deep South after the SCOTUS decision in Brown v Board of Education in 1954. It brought feelings to the fore which had to on the minds of people all across the South in the mid to late 1950s. It's a timeless story in that some of those issues are still around today. I loved it. Only wish it had the editing that Mockingbird had.
Because of all the controversy,I held my opinion until I had read the book. I 'm glad I did. Yes the book does show a different side of Atticus Finch, but it does correctly show the struggle the people of 1950's south had with the Civil Rights movement. It is  shown through the conflict between  Atticus, the generation trying to fight change and keep the status quo and Jean Louise who sees people, not race. A very good sequel, though written first, to To  Kill a Mocking Bird. I recommend you read it and form your on opinion.
This book must be read on its own terms. The reader must approach this book as if Mockingbird did not exist.<br/>It makes an interesting read with many episodes that make entertaining reading. Plot structure is loose and many characters are not well fleshed out. Lee's editor was right to have her revise this book to ultimately become Mockingbird. It is good to have both !
Only the second book I've ever pre-ordered for my kindle I gobbled it up over two days as soon as it arrived. Nothing could have been "as good" as To Kill a Mockingbird but her voice is there and her sharp insights into race, gender, drinking and the slow evolution of culture and "civilization" as we know it ring true. Better an uncomfortable truth than a comfortable lie. I think this "new" characterization of Atticus is more human and reveals the racist, classist, sexist and ageist tendencies that we are all prone to.
Understanding that this really is a first draft of what would eventually become one of the best books ever, To Kill a Mockingbird, the book is rather jaded, with a few glimpses into the brilliance that would be TKAM.  What is interesting is to see the divergence between the two books and how a really dark book eventually became something so different and a complete joy.
This book should never have been published without Harper Lee's approval.  It destroys her magnificent classic, "To Kill a Mockingbird."<br/>The book is poorly written, probably because it was a rough draft that was never meant to be published in this unfinished, unedited state.<br/>Even though many book clubs are reading it, I would not recommend this book.
Ok, I finished it. I really adored it. Yes, it's no Mockingbird and it was difficult to think Atticus was racist BUT I do believe Harper Lee wrote what things were like in the South then, even for honorable men. I cried with Scout. It's worth a read,everyone. It will make you think, which is what good books are suppose to do.<br/>“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.”<br/>' Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird
I got this book knowing that it wouldn't be the great novel that To Kill a Mockingbird was but this one actually made me mad.  With everything that is said these days being scrutinized to see if it can be called racist, here is a book that falls right into the trap that all white people are bad, even old Aticus Finch.  So sorry that I even bothered with this one.
It's rare I cry from a book - can't remember the last time I did - but this book and the truths in it brought me to tears more than once.  What an honest testament to the South, our way of life, and the separations between one generation and the next.  The airplane metaphor was stupendous.  This book is not about racism - it's about humanity and truth.
I was disappointed. The quality of the book did not deserve the hype it was given prior to its release.  Simply put, Lee Harper's second book, the masterpiece, "To Kill A Mockingbird" was derived from the not-as-well-written, "Go Set A Watchman." I can understand why Watchman was never published originally. It should have remained so.
I loved the book. It would have drove me nuts not to read it before everyone in the world ripped into it. I do caution that you may be offended in some of the chapters. You have to concider the time period. Overall a good read. But I have to admit, I will have to read it again. It's tough at times to figure out,.jumps around a bit. Overall READ it!
Still reading it.....1/2 through.  I do believe it was a sequel to to Kill a Mockingbird.  Don't thing anyone would "get it" if they didn't know the story behind Atticus, Scout and the "town".  Harper Lee's writing in Mockingbird far superior to this,  I do not believe it was a finished product,  Think she was still working on it.
I wanted to love it. I wanted it to be that epic story that to kill a mockingbird was. It wasn't. Honestly there was about 50 pages where I could see Harper Lee polished to kill a mockingbird style the rest was just meh unfinished  unpolished story line. Pretty sad. But thankfully I can go reread to kill a mockingbird and make everything better!
This is a story about a young woman who idolizes her father and discovers that he is not perfect. That he holds different ideas from hers. It tells of her painful reaction to this discovery and how she deals with it. I found it painful to read. There was very little else going on in the book to make it interesting. I wish that I had not read it.
This book is so far inferior to To Kill A Mockingbird that it is easy to believe those who have written that it was not authored by Harper Lee, it was a poor first draft of TKAM that was subsequently edited and re-edited to make it infinitely better, etc.  I do not think it is worth the read, unless to be more informed about the ongoing debate.
This book whenever written has found its tme.  As the Confederate flag comes down in South Carolina, the nature of racism and bigotry get caught up in what it means to be a born and bred Southerner.  The identity of individuality and states rights are embodied in a grown up Scout.  Atticus is a realist, while Scout is an idealist.  As Dr. Finch shows her, both are needed in the world.  As a retired English teacher I see great value in this as a companion to its predecessor.
For anybody who grew up adoring to kill a Mockingbird this is terrible. I had to stop reading it because I had a kiss is portrayed as intolerant, kelp hernia is drawn as a woman who did not love scout with all her heart. It shouldn't have been written and doesn't even deserve a quarter of a star. Harper Lee did not mean for this to happen.
...as I found it "true" to the time period. Guess no one wanted to see Atticus dethroned, but I found the ending to be - if not totally redeeming, at least understandable and somewhat encouraging. Not the masterpiece that TKAM is, but a worthwhile addition to helping frame the discussion of a difficult time, and relevant to today as well.
I am a huge fan of "To Kill a Mockingbird " and I was expecting the same level of intrigue and twist in this book. Instead, I found myself bored and forcing the reading. The story lacks any true events or reasons to truly pull you in ..and anticipate the next page.  Although well written, this just was not a favorite book for me.
I haven't finished the book, but am half-way through.  I'm finding it boring, and if it doesn't soon get better, I may not finish it at all.  If this had been written by an unknown author, I would have ditched it long ago.  But because it is Harper Lee of TKAM, I am trying to like it.  At least I'm enjoying the Southern small town humor.
I wanted to love this, as I do TKAM, but after several attempts, I could not get into the story.  I found the dialogue slow and incredibly uninteresting.  I tried to gut it out, but just couldn't.  Miss Lee is and has been a beloved author of mine, but I cannot love this book just because she wrote it.  I know I'm in the minority...
Although I wasn't blown away by Harper Lee's Pulitzer-Prize winning "To Kill a Mockingbird", I wanted to give "Go Set a Watchman" a fair shot but sadly I wasted my time. This book reminded me of the deleted scenes of a movie that come as extras on the DVD, you may be excited to see them but after you do you realize why they were cut in the first place. After reading this book it is clear to me why it wasn't published fifty years ago.
There is a reason Harper Lee didn't want this novel released.  I didn't have any problem with Atticus losing his "hero" status.  I just didn't think the novel was particularly interesting or had anything new to offer.  Had it not been written by Harper Lee, this wouldn't be a novel I would have read based on its merit.
Passionate fans of Mockingbird may be angry, but I find this a fascinating light on where the story began and where it went.  We get to see Atticus through an adult daughter's eyes as well as a child's, and the "liberal" Southerner's reaction to Brown v. Board of Education.<br/>What a tragedy that Lee wrote no more!
I really enjoyed this novel.  It will never live up TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD but I love Harper Lee's writing style and ability to weave a story.  It's apparent that the novels were written at the same time and this remained unfinished but it was enjoyable all the same.<br/><br/>As for the criticism of Atticus READ THE NOVEL
An "OK" read, at best. Especially when compared to its prequel. The book has no real story or focal event, and the finish is just "muddled". It might be thought of as a book that explains the thought process of "ordinary people" during those times well, but it pales in comparison to Mockingbird.
Watchman is obviously a money grab on the part of those who control Harper Lee's assets.  The book proceeds at a snail's pace, and is peopled with characters that are only occasionally interesting.  This supposedly was the first draft of what became To Kill a Mockingbird, and it shows.  Despite some beautiful passages, this is the over-hyped novel of the year.  Please read (or reread) Mockingbird and forget about this painful offering.
Though fairly well written, this novel should have never been released. It completely undermines To Kill A Mockingbird with negative re-characterizations of beloved characters, the introduction of new characters that could not have existed in Mockingbird's world, and a barrage of factual inconsistencies with Mockingbird.  It's as if this book exists in an alternate Mockingbird universe where none of the facts or rules of the original novel apply.  While I understand that this novel was written prior to Mockingbird, it is presented as a sequel to Mockingbird.  There is no excuse for releasing a sequel that does not factually work as a sequel to the prior novel. This was clearly a cash grab by the publisher and what smells like someone taking advantage of an old woman (Harper Lee) who no longer knows any better.
Well, It was very different than the mood and development of "Mockingbird", but we knew it would be.  The complexity of the times, and the thought process is brought out by different "voices" Ms. Lee gives to each character, a little predictable in some minor way, but enlightening and worth the read.
The promotion of this book was one of the biggest literary scams ever.  It was terribly boring, but I continued to read, thinking it would get better.  I loved "To Kill a Mocking Bird".  This book does not even come close.  It is hard to believe they were written by the same author.  Don't waste your money.
My husband and I both read this excellent novel in just two days; we found it impossible to put down! The very different depiction of Atticus Finch was indeed a shock, but we both found this book's presentation of era-specific racism to be appropriately honest and bold. Is it To Kill a Mockingbird? Of course not, but it deserves to be enjoyed and respected on its own terms and for its own unique merits. It was worth the wait!
If I could give it 1/2 a star I would. This book is one of the worst I've read in years.  I can typically finish a book like this in a few days. 6 weeks later I am still reading it a page or 2 at a time.  To kill a mockingbird was one of my all time favorite books. This book has left me incredibly disappointed.
I could not wait for this book to download and as soon as it did this morning I started to read.  I could not put the book down.  It held my attention from the very first page to the last.  It took me to the time and it was like living it with Scout and seeing everything through her eyes. She makes everything clear and shows how it was in the south at a very disturbing time in our history and the way the people of the south dealt with all the things going on at the time.  I learned a lot of history from this novel and would recommend this book to everyone who loves to read.
First hundred pages are hard, then it's downhill from there, according to another reader in my family. I could only get to page 59, then I gave up. This one should never have been published. It's OK if read as a first draft of "To Kill A Mockingbird," which would make it of interest only to academics.
As a lover of To Kill a Mockingbird, I was surprised how the revelation regarding Atticus.  I understand his reasoning, even though I am not sure I agree with it.  Interesting reading, but to be honest, if I wish I hadn't read it.  It did change the person I believed Atticus Finch to be.  You can't unread it.
This book was a tremendous disappointment. It did not have the character or content of Harper Lee's first novel "To Kill a Mockingbird". With all the hype I expected a good read, I did not find it in this book. This is a "don't bother" book that had more press pre-publication than content.
This book needs to see an editor. I'm afraid someone took advantage of an ailing older person. she should have had mor imput into its development and it should not have been released in the form it was in. Not up to her usual standards, but, To Kill a Mockingbird would be a hard act to follow for anyone.
A major disappointment from the first novel.  Not so much in the character of Atticus Finch but more in the general way the story was told.  In the first book you cared about the characters.  In this book there was too much detachment.  They should have started off with JEM's funeral and went from there.
Same Harper Lee of Mockingbird, delightful descriptions and characters, and the same charming Scout.  The setting is civil rights fight in the South, specifically centered on Scout's heroes, her father and the man she was to marry.  The novel becomes very preachy, which was annoying and disappointing.
I think Harper's agent had it right in 1957 when he said, "Watchman is more of a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel. Write me the story of Scout's childhood instead. Tell me how she became this woman." Very poor character development. Choppy. It's simply not a well written story.
Tedious. If this were written by any other author I would have quit 50 pages in. While I do not share the common complaint about the portrayal of Atticus as racist and while I found the depiction of small town Alabama at the start of the Civil Rights movement to be spot on, I think there are far better period pieces out there--books with plots and characters that develop through the book and who drive the plot. The Help comes to mind immediately. In any event, there's none of that in this book. Scout comes across as a cardboard Northern liberal acting as a foil for the cardboard Southern racists, Atticus among them. On top of that there IS no plot for either character to drive. Boring and, in the end, not particularly enlightening, much less enjoyable.
A wonderful book. Full of politics, idealism, and social issues that are still with us today. Given the issues that we have just witnessed with Marriage Equality, States Rights, the Confederate flag and #blacklivesmatter, " Go Set A Watchman" could have been written just last week.  It makes you realize that nothing has really changed since Harper Lee wrote this wonderful book- and that is rather sad indeed.
I struggled with it and just stopped reading it
Nowhere near Mockingbird. cannot be compared...
Disappointing follow up to Mocking Bird. Relationship issues were not explored in depth. The relationship with Calpurnia was explored and closed in a few paragraphs? Scout came across as an angry young woman who does not take time to consider the views of others. She is not believable. The book feels like a skeletal frame that needed to be filled in. Watchman does not come close to what Mocking Bird is.
Was really looking forward to this book.  LOVED "To Kill a Mockingbird", but this falls short.  It is obvious that the book really didn't get idited and the author did not get to re-write. I can understand why the original publisher asked her to go back and write a book about the children.
I liked learning more about Scout and her future. The return to her hometown demonstrated that nothing ever stays the same and leaves one pondering if all change and/or progress is good. At first I did not feel connected to the characters, but soon warmed up to Scout's big heart and caring nature.
I had some concerns about reading the book because I had heard the leaks about Atticus being racist and didn't want to risk having to learn that a character I had long admired had feet of clay.  What a relief I had after reading the entire book and not just a snippet.  Those were stressful times.
This book was terrible, especially in light of the author's previous wonderful work.  It was badly written and the characters were not well developed.  Scout turned out to be an obnoxious, self-centered adult.  The basic premise was good and the book had potential but where were the editors?
This book does not measure up to the writing of "to kill a Mockingbird". There is a reason that this book was never published until Harper Lee was in a nursing home and her sister/protector was dead. This book was not meant to be published or it would have been published long ago.
I was so disappointed ! I was looking forward to reading this book because To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my very favorite books. I even reread it again before I started Watchman. It just didn't grab me. I didn't find the characters at all interesting or likable. Sorry I wasted my money.
I did not enjoy this book. It was very disappointing after reading To Kill A Mockingbird. I felt it was a waste of my money and the time spent reading it. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I was determined to finish it, but it took a long time because it could not hold my interest.
It was just preachy and not very realalistic
It was a disappointment after the other book
I only read this book because of the publicity of the book being found only recently.  Could understand why the manuscript was rejected:  characters were shallow compared to the later book, To Kill a Mockingbird.  Harper Lee developed better writing skills with time and practice.
I stopped reading it 30 pages in, because 2 o the pages were the same as To Kill a Mockingbird. The other pages just weren't good enough to hold my attention nor did they hold a candle to To Kill a Mockingbird.  As for me To Kill a Mockingbird is the only book Harper Lee wrote.
I got 30% through and said "Enough." I hadn't yet gotten to the part about Atticus' bigotry. But the story was not worth reading. I don't believe that this was a draft for TKAM. From the level of writing in GSAW and TKAM, I doubt that the same person wrote both. If she did, then her skills improved greatly in TKAM. I find that level of improvement highly unlikely.
I suppose that  novel about disillusionment must necessarily shatter the illusions of the reader. That Scout Finch, now grown up and going by Jean Louise, learns that her idol has a clay feet is not a surprise.  By now most readers of To Kill a Mockingbird have discovered that Atticus Finch, the one time embodiment of integrity, honesty, and empathy, has grown up to be racist, anti-Government crackpot.<br/><br/>Jean Louise, perhaps voicing what many feel about this revelation, says, “I believed in you. I looked up to you, Atticus, like I never looked up to anybody in my life and never will again. If you had only given me some hint, if you had only broken your word with me a couple of times, if you had been bad-tempered or impatient ...if you had been a lesser man, maybe I could have taken [it].”<br/><br/>Losing an inspirational hero, fictional though he may be, is one thing, but the novel as a whole is an artistic failure.  The novel doesn’t work on its own; you need to have read TKAMB and have seen Atticus as a hero to understand his role here.  The characters become speechmakers, ranting about the tenth amendment and state’s rights.  The novel uses Atticus’s transformation as the central conflict with Scout, but it never really resolves it. Sure, the book says, Atticus attended Klan meetings, but you know, it was just to see what was going on.  Even as we reject Atticus’s views, the novel argues that Atticus isn’t wrong. Consider this conversation:<br/><br/>“Let’s look at it this way,” said her father. “You realize that our Negro population is backward, don’t you? You will concede that? You realize the full implications of the word ‘backward,’ don’t you?”<br/> “Yes sir.” “<br/>You realize that the vast majority of them here in the South are unable to share fully in the responsibilities of citizenship, and why?”<br/>“Yes sir.”<br/><br/>And it gets worse.<br/><br/>Plus, there’s no Boo Radley.
The novel Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee is the sequel (although it was written first) of To Kill a Mockingbird. I read this book because I truly enjoyed all of the minor details seen in To Kill a Mockingbird, and I thought that even if it was half as intriguing, Go Set a Watchman would be worth the read. This book is set in third person omniscient unlike its predecessor, which was in Scout’s point of view. Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird has grown up in Go Set a Watchman and lives in New York City. But do not fear; Scout visits her home in Maycomb along with some familiar faces. She has also outgrown her nickname and now prefers Jean Louise. The novel is filled with changes like these, and some of them, the reader will not like. However, even if you are terrified by change this book should be read by everyone.<br/> The book begins with the main character Jean Louise on a train on her way back home to Maycomb. Her love interest picks her up and the audience is dumped into a new, unfamiliar, and even scary world. I’m going to leave you with that to stay away from spoilers. But the book does flashback to the days with the old trio of Scout, Jem, and Dill that we knew and loved. After some extremely unexpected twists and turns, Jean Louise comes to a conflict with Henry (her love interest), Atticus (her dad), and herself. Jean Louise learns that “A man who has lived by truth – and you have believed in what he has lived – he does not leave you merely wary when he fails you, he leaves you with nothing” (Lee 179). After some wise words from her old maid Calpurnia and her Uncle Jack Jean Louise realizes she has to “set a watchman.” Or have an opinion or belief and stand by it even if that’s alone or against your loved ones. Eventually she makes peace with her conflicts (unsatisfactorily in my opinion).<br/> Depending on how you look at it Go Set a Watchman and To Kill a Mockingbird are either an extremely well written pair of twins or a sloppy, chopped, and edited rough draft and final copy. Some paragraphs in the two are eerily similar, like in chapter three of Go Set a Watchman and thirteen of To Kill a Mockingbird when Aunt Alexandra’s corset is described, or five in Go Set a Watchman and nine in To Kill a Mockingbird when Scout describes Finch’s Landing.<br/> However, this is my opinion. And I do stand by it, but I think that everyone should read this novel so that they can set their own watchman.
There will be spoilers, read at your own risk. I got this as a gift and since it was touted as a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird (TKAM), I decided it would be the perfect time to finally read TKAM for the first time. I LOVED it! I felt so connected to the story and to the characters, the writing was fantastic.<br/><br/>After loving TKAM, I was very much looking forward to Go Set A Watchman (GSAW) and started it right away, expecting much of the same writing I had loved in TKAM. I was SO disappointed. I can't even tell you how let down I felt which is probably why I ended up hating it instead of just not liking it. There were far too many details that didn't add up between the books to even pretend that GSAW was a sequel. Like Jean Louise's love interest who was supposedly present in her early life and went on adventures with Jean Louise, Jem, and Dill, but who was never once mentioned in TKAM. Or failing to make clear that Atticus had moved from her childhood home - you find out mid-book that there is now an ice cream shop where she used to live and you'd think that would be a relevant detail to bring up fairly quickly in a sequel. Or the fact that the famous trial from TKAM was different in GSAW - in GSAW's version, an unnamed black man that Atticus defended was much younger and actually acquitted. There are more, but I can't recall them off the top of my head. You can't reasonably call something a sequel with so many details out of place from the original.<br/><br/>Aside from the details that were off between the two books, the cover jacket of GSAW said that there would be many of the iconic characters from TKAM. So so wrong. Boo Radley (who I think we can all agree was a big part of TKAM) was not mentioned ONCE. Not even to mention that he had died or moved or anything. Zero references. There was one strange encounter with Calpurnia (who had apparently left working for the Finches) after which she wasn't mentioned. Jem has died of a heart attack by the time this book takes place. Dill is off traveling the world. Jem and Dill are both only mentioned as passing memories. In fact, the best parts of the book were the parts wheres Jean Louise reminisces about games they had played as kids. Miss Maudie is mentioned only once in passing and not as though she were a friend, just some lady Jean Louise knew from once upon a time. The iconic characters who actually show up with any regularity are Jean Louise (as she goes by in the book - I can't bring myself to call this character Scout), Atticus, Uncle Jack, and Aunt Alexandra, none of whom resemble their TKAM selves. In fact, they were so far removed from their TKAM selves that I felt no connection to them in this book. I think Uncle Jack was especially different. Of course Atticus being racist in GSAW is different than what we came to believe in him from TKAM, and of course I found that disappointing, but you could argue that the rosy view of Atticus was just Scout's childhood view of him. Thus Atticus' change could reasonably (though still disappointingly) be just a different perspective of the same man. But Uncle Jack suddenly became a recluse who liked to spout off obscure references from Victorian literature, not at all like the funny, light-hearted, straight forward Uncle Jack of TKAM.<br/><br/>Aside from all THAT, the story was just tedious.There were several parts where entire paragraphs had been cut and pasted from TKAM verbatim, especially about Alexandra and about Maycomb. It was weird to read because it felt like dejavu until I realized that they were the exact same from TKAM. I kept pushing through thinking it had to get better, it just had to! This was supposed to be a sequel to TKAM and that book was so great! But it only got worse. Partly because of Uncle Jack's obscure references in his important conversations with Scout, partly because there was little resemblance from TKAM so I felt disconnected from the story, and partly because I was disappointed in Jean Louise's behavior.<br/><br/>Even if this had been a stand alone book, it would have been awful. I have heard rumors that (after reading both books) I am inclined to believe that this was a book that Harper Lee wrote as a draft and had never intended to publish, TKAM growing out of that draft. I can certainly see where the basis for TKAM would come from - the stories of young Scout really were the best part of GSAW and TKAM was full of those stories. To me this reads like a draft, not ready to be published. As a supposed sequel, it's a total bust. If you loved TKAM, I would advise skipping over this one, it was just a money grab. *sigh* I wish someone had given me TKAM as a gift instead of this...
So did Harper Lee really write this or not? There seems to be more hype about the publication of this book than about the book itself. Supposedly found abandoned in Ms Lee's house, this was the manuscript that she first submitted for publication, only to be told by her editor to take the main character, Jean Louise Finch/Scout, and flesh out her childhood story. Which she did, and it became that marvellous wonder of a story - "To Kill A Mockingbird". It's a shame that this found manuscript made it out of the drawer or cupboard where it was found, because it probably should have stayed there. The story line - early to mid 1950s, a grown up Scout returns to her home town of Maycomb, Alabama where ideas and views have changed somewhat since she left, and she is forced to take a long hard look at herself and those around her - has been challenging for readers who hold Mockingbird close to their hearts. But for me, and plenty of other on line reviewers, the main problem with this is how poorly it has been written and pulled together. It is almost as if maybe, the manuscript has been published as it was found - bits and pieces of Jean Louise's early life slotted in around the few days of her visit back to her home town. I really enjoyed these early stories - vignettes of her relationship with her father, the perfect Atticus Finch; her brother Jem; Calpurnia, the black housekeeper who became Scout's surrogate mother; her days at school. Wonderful stuff, and maybe this is why that long ago editor asked Ms Lee to make a story about Scout the child. Because the writing around Scout the adult is all over the place - it rambles, it is boring, she has the most bizarre conversations with her uncle, goes through the most intense 24 hour love/hate/love crisis with her father that reads more like a soap opera than a genuine crisis. I actually wish I hadn't read this - as a prequel/sequel it has added nothing to 'To Kill A Mockingbird". Maybe it was the vision of all those dollars to be made by those managing Ms Lee's affairs....
Though I read this book as soon as it was published a little over 2 months ago, I've held my comments to let it sit a while because I was concerned about being biased, given that Nell Harper Lee lives a little over an hour from my little city of Mobile, AL.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I've watched with curiosity the reviews on this and other sites.  It seems there are 2 main camps: 1) those who say they love the book (yet cannot seem to separate it from Mockingbird, which most everyone agrees (me included) is outstanding); and, 2) those who just don't like the book (and while they give a nod to Mockingbird, wish to separate it entirely in reviewing Watchman).  In any case, there's no way, it seems to me, to  avoid the classic (written after, but published over half a century before, Watchman).<br/><br/>It's undisputed that Ms. Lee didn't want this book published until persuaded by a fiduciary to do so.  I'd say this was a decent book for a first time novelist.  And, now that we know and love Atticus Finch, Watchman is significant for outing him as a racist.  Yet, GO SET A WATCHMAN is, frankly, a drab and uneventful story with dragging didactic discourses and no sense of wonder as there was in TKAM.  Scout comes back home to rural Alabama from NYC and is shocked to learn, and struggles to come to terms with, the racism of her father, who attempts to justify his bigotry as the way of the world and as a response to those interfering Yankees (in the U.S. Supreme Court and federal govt) coming in and trying to tell the South what to do and how to think.  I wrote more in my initial draft of this review, but I don't want to be accused of spoiling the plot, though there isn't much of one to ruin for you.<br/><br/>I will say a prayer though to thank the Lords of Literature for refusing to publish GO SET A WATCHMAN in 1959 (or before TKAM) and giving Nell Harper Lee the extra kick to write the classic this world has come to love.<br/><br/>I have yet to hear a persuasive argument that WATCHMAN would have been either a commercial success or critical darling on its own terms.  I dare to say that Ms. Lee (given her shyness and sensitivity after the publication and success of To Kill a Mockingbird) might have been so discouraged by a negative reception of Watchman that the world might well have been deprived of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.
There are big questions about Go Set a Watchman and every reader will have a different opinion. Here’s mine:<br/><br/>1)  Is Go Set a Watchman a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird?  Most certainly not. Go Set a Watchman is an early draft of To Kill a Mockingbird in which Lee began to develop characters, plot lines and the small town of Macomb, Alabama. It’s described more accurately as a companion piece, but that implies it is polished, which it is not.<br/><br/>2)  Did Atticus Finch become a racist in Go Set a Watchman? No, he did not become anything in this second book because it was written before To Kill a Mockingbird. I think Lee and her editor developed his character using pieces of the Atticus in Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>3)  Did Harper Lee really approve of Go Set a Watchman’s publication? I doubt it. She has always said she did not want to publish another book. I don’t think this was a long-lost manuscript. If Harper Lee had wanted to publish Go Set a Watchman, she would have done so.<br/><br/>4)  Should Harper Collins have published Go Set a Watchman? I don’t think so. The book reads as a draft. It includes jumps, inconsistencies, long, boring arguments between Jean Louise and her Uncle Jack, and an abrupt, unlikely finish. I’m not criticizing Harper Lee here, I’m pointing out that Go Set a Watchman went unpublished all these years for a reason, it wasn’t a final manuscript.<br/><br/>5)  Is Go Set a Watchman worth reading? Yes, with the right expectations. If you’re curious about how Lee developed her characters and ideas, the book is interesting. If you’re expecting a book like To Kill a Mockingbird, you’re setting yourself for disappointment, and I think some readers will still feel betrayed by the new Atticus, even though it was an early characterization. In addition, it’s hard to miss that this book was fattened up by wider margins, more space between lines and blank pages between sections.<br/><br/>I did enjoy parts of Go Set a Watchman, however. Lee uses humor to describe her characters, particularly Aunt Alexandra and her “formidable” Sunday corset. The church scene is also amusing, when Herbert Jemson, music director of Macomb Methodist Church, changes the rhythm of the Doxology, a shock to the congregation, but unnoticed by the hard-of-hearing Minister Stone.<br/><br/>Lee also describes Jean Louise’s understanding of her place in Macomb with this simple explanation: "It was not because this was where your life began. It was because this was where people were born and born and born until finally the result was you, drinking a Coke in the Jitney Jungle."<br/><br/>I also thought Henry Clinton’s answer to Jean Louise, when she accuses him of being racist, shows insight into a person’s character and motives: "A man can appear to be a part of something not-so-good on its face, but don’t take it upon yourself to judge him unless you know his motives as well. A man can be boiling inside, but he knows a mild answer works better than showing his rage. A man can condemn his enemies, but it’s wiser to know them."<br/><br/>That kind of a “know your enemy” approach is also Atticus Finch’s strategy, however, Atticus still believes in whites' superiority, wrong even if it’s written in a draft.
This book was quite disappointing, even disregarding all the hype and hoopla which preceded its release.<br/><br/>In my opinion it should have remained a manuscript. It is a half-baked work with little or no premise to it and, therefore, the first 80% of it is utterly boring and aimless.<br/><br/>The gift for dialogue and blessedly brief narrative that made 'To Kill a Mockingbird' such a great and honest read are totally lacking here.<br/><br/>I had to really struggle not to put 'Go Set A Watchman' down.<br/><br/>The worst parts were those early on which provided flashbacks to the three young central characters from the great book. They seemed without purpose and absolutely flat.<br/><br/>Although the last part of the book held a message (finally), it was totally insignificant and the central character came across as a pathetic, spoiled brat, drowning in ideology which an intelligent person normally sheds far earlier in life. Thus, the character of Scout in this sequel was two dimensional and not at all credible - in contrast to what made 'To Kill' a great book.<br/><br/>I didn't even get the feel of the Great Old South being evoked by this book. Frankly reading it was a waste of time save probably what amounted to ten exceedingly well written sentences.<br/><br/>All around - a big, flat disappointment.<br/><br/>I gave it one star only because the character of Uncle Jack was somewhat interesting and fleshed-out, and I did appreciate the dilemma rarely brought forth (due to political incorrectness) discussed at length by Atticus in the last several pages of the book.<br/><br/>I would reserve recommending this book solely to those who read, write and critique fiction seriously, as it is a prominent example of how and why a manuscript does require polishing before publication. I have learned many lessons from it along those lines.
I borrowed this book immediately as it was taken from the Amazon box by our school librarian.<br/>I have long loved Southern writers for their wit and wisdom. Those who wrote in the time of change and turmoil in the South have been among my favorites.  They had a front row to the changes of the region.  Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird has long been one of my favorites and I have read it several times.  I knew going into Go Set a Watchman that there were those who saw Atticus Finch in a new, unkind light.<br/>  Some reviews have called him racist. I prefer to think of him as a realist. The South that he knew his entire life was not truly very far removed from the Reconstruction Era after the Civil War.  After Grant’s march to the sea, the South ultimately had to rebuild their entire infrastructure and society.  That rebuilding took decades and those in the North had no idea of the roadblocks their Southern brothers incurred. Unfortunately for the town of Macomb and Jean Louise, the North didn't think the South was moving fast enough.<br/>  I venture to say that Atticus was not a racist, he raise two colorblind children, who embraced everyone they came in contact with, black or white. His membership in organizations that Scout found offensive was his way of fighting for justice from within. Atticus always lived his life within the confines of the law and desegregation, although coming into his life in later years, would be handled in the same way. At the time of the Supreme Court ruling, I would venture to say there were few people in the South that were not racist to some degree. I found Uncle Jack's analogy of the North entering the Atomic Age while the South was just entering their Industrial Revolution to be very profound and truthful<br/>  At heart this book is a coming of age story, not only of Jean Louise but the South in general. I love the flashbacks containing beloved characters from Scout's childhood. That touch is something in my mind that is uniquely Harper Lee.  Would I like to see more of the story and have resolutions made? Absolutely! What does the future hold for the Finch family and especially Scout? Would she be a catalyst for change in her hometown or retreat to New York to live out her life?  While Ms. Lee may never answer these questions. I my mind I have formulated the story's continuation. In the very near future I plan on rereading both works and enjoying the words of Harper Lee again.
Nobody really needs another review of this long lost manuscript, but what the hell.  The unveiling of Harper Lee's only other novel was met with great anticipation and sold millions thanks to the loyalty of fans of "To Kill A Mockingbird", truly one of the 20th century's great novels, right up with Hemingway, Kurt Vonnegut and other notable authors.  It had a more immediate impact because of the time of its release, with Jim Crow and segregation still rampant, although some places were slowly but surely starting to break the race barriers down, bit by bit.<br/>  We had grown to love Atticus Finch, whom, in "Mockingbird" was portrayed as a fair man, a just man and anything but a racist as he tried to defend a black man accused of rape.  So in this sequel, it's quite surprising that Lee decided that Atticus wasn't the saint we thought he was.  The story isn't really much of one, as the returning Scout visits Maycomb for two weeks, being a resident now of New York City.  What we get is more of a picture of a town's mindset in changing times, and the reaction from Jean Louise.<br/>  We find residents are frightened of the newly founded NAACP, and the racial prejudice is heated up as fears of blacks as equals spiral nearly out of control.  At a meeting of some particularly "concerned" men discussing the negative aspects of the NAACP, complete with the expected racist commentary, Jean Louise sees her beloved father Atticus at the table in the courthouse where he had represented the black young man years ago.<br/>  Not to give the rest away, what we get from here is a war of wills and ideologies between Jean Louise and basically the rest of the town, including Atticus.  The book is as much commentary as action, and a lot of readers were taken aback to find Atticus on the white side of the social fence.<br/>  So, if you are the type who wants books to end your way, you'll be very disappointed.  However, if the idea of showing another side of a previously revered figure is interesting to you, reading "Go Set A Watchman" won't be a hard sell.  Overall though, while it seems quite timely in places even today, this novel will not enjoy the status of "To Kill A Mockingbird", as it lacks the moving story line, humor and innocence of events as explained by a young girl, whereas "Watchman" is in the second person.<br/>  It's worth the read, but not destined for greatness beyond the initial curiosity.
It is hard to review "Go Set a Watchman" because it is impossible to rid one's mind of the iconic background of "To Kill a Mockingbird." There are many of the same characters, though many years older. In my mind, Atticus Finch at 72 looks exactly like Gregory Peck at 72. It's hard to see through the haze of preconception to evaluate "Watchman" on its own merits.<br/><br/>The story is that Harper Lee's editor turned down "Watchman," but asked the author to write a new story based on the book's flashbacks to childhood. I think Lee's editor was right. "Mockingbird" is a strong novel, deserving of its decades of adulation, with memorable, well-delineated characters, a complex plot with several complementary sub-plots, and burning moral issues.<br/><br/>"Watchman" comes across as an excellent first try. The writing is strong, aided by Lee's irrepressible sense of humor. The plot is simple, involving a young woman's coming of age through her stunned recognition that her beloved parent is not the perfect paragon of virtue she had imagined. I was disappointed that it was not more thoroughly edited--there are several amateur mistakes.<br/><br/>Some have been horrified by the revelation that Atticus, that bulwark of justice for all, was a racist. But this is perfectly consistent with the times in which these two books were penned. Atticus was devoted to the law, so when he saw a miscarriage of justice, the fact that the victim was black was unimportant; justice trumped everything. But he didn't want blacks in his schools, his church, or his government. That's the way things were in the South during the Fifties. He nonetheless redeems himself by not only accepting Jean Louise's anger at his bigotry, but by being proud of her for standing up for her beliefs.<br/><br/>That being said, this is a simpler tale than "Mockingbird." It hasn't got the bite or the staying power of its successor. It's a quick read, a enjoyable read, it deals with the enduring albatross around the American throat, racism. But I don't think it will be the classroom staple of its younger sister.
This week I finished reading Harper Lee’s latest, an unpublished prequel that now stands as a sequel to her deservedly iconic "To Kill a Mockingbird." Confused? So are a lot of people.<br/><br/>The first half delightfully portrays Macomb, Alabama, in the ‘fifties, complete with relatives (some of whom are “half a bubble out of plumb) a Methodist congregation that is upset when the organist changes the tune of the Doxology and rituals of food, gossip and social expectation familiar to anyone from the South. Jean Louise (Scout to you and me), home for two weeks on vacation from New York, finds her kin folk fear that the people and culture up there may have warped her sense of propriety and judgment with their strange meddling ways. She takes up where she left off, though, squabbling with her Aunt Margaret, going out with Henry Clinton, her lower class boyfriend, and enjoying the company of Atticus and her uncle Frank.  Lee portrays an idyllic (for some) existence with accuracy, sympathy and a kind of acerbic wit that had me laughing out loud.<br/><br/>And then, as hundreds of articles and reviews have noted, it all goes south (no pun intended). She discovers that Atticus has a hateful racist pamphlet in his desk and that he and Henry have gone to a meeting of Macomb’s own “citizen’s council” where an overwrought speaker spews the worst kind of vitriol about blacks. Jean Louise is literally sick to her stomach and, in a series of confrontations, tries to make sense of the changes in the people she has known and loved for years. The degree of her success and the overall outcome I will leave to the reader to discover, but suffice it to say that while Atticus’ rationale is faulty at best, it still is true to what many whites in the South believed at the time.<br/><br/>I believe this important, well-crafted book addresses issues we still contend with today. The characters are loveable and familiar, and while Atticus is no longer the super hero of "Mockingbird," his struggles and solutions make him a credible if not sympathetic character. For my money, "Watchman" is better than "Mockingbird," but that’s up to each reader to decide.
I felt trepidation when I picked up Harper Lee’s Go Set A Watchman. From the noise surrounding the release, I feared there was no way it would live up to her previous work.<br/><br/>It doesn’t, but then what book does? It does, however, come fairly close and that in itself is a feat.<br/><br/>This is a story of the burgeoning racial struggle for equality in the south and it’s aftermath: identity, awakening, and the struggle to come to terms with a changing society. What makes this book so special—and so vilified—is that it was written in the mid 1950s. It isn’t told through 21st Century lens. It’s told through the author’s experience and perceptions during that time period.<br/><br/>As I read, I felt as if I’d discovered the book in a time capsule from that era. Modern society’s views on bigotry have evolved from when this book was written. It’s hard to read the points of view from that period without cringing.<br/><br/>Lee’s story takes place twenty years after To Kill A Mockingbird. The author is strongest when she flashbacks on Jean Louise’s (Scout’s) childhood days and when she writes about the various characters who populate the town of Maycomb, Alabama. I could have continued reading about them long after the story ended.<br/><br/>Her weakest moments come when she pontificates about bigotry. There is a tendency for melodrama. It’s obvious which side Lee is on, though to her credit she leaves us with no winners and losers.<br/><br/>Although I can understand why some readers are upset and dismayed that Lee humanized (de-humanized?) a literary icon, I also praise her for having the courage to do just that. As a consequence of that action—and as a clever bit of irony—she imbues her protagonist, Jean Louise, with the very traits she had originally imbued in Jean Louise’s father, Atticus Finch.<br/><br/>Finch is not the idol he once was, but he is still presented as someone who, for his time and place, operates within his boundaries in a more admirable light than the average person in the same circumstance.<br/><br/>Though I’m giving the book five stars, I would rate it a four-and-a-half, if I had that option. Lee had tremendous shoes to fill—her own—and nearly succeeded.
All of the negative hype about this pre-Mockingbird novel is, in my opinion, dead wrong. If Mockingbird had never been written and this book came out in the late 1950's, the time frame in which it is set, it would have been praised as a bold commentary on the hypocrisies and cruelties that existed in the deep south at the time. Atticus Finch was simply a product of his time and place. He had a sense of what was right and wrong and also a deep seated belief that the African-Americans or Negros as they were called then were inferior to Whites in most ways, but they were also human beings. He also had a deep belief in the rule of law. Taken from that perspective, his defense of Tom in Mockingbird made perfect sense. Atticus was not an early and heroic believer in civil rights. He was a non-violent southern white bigot who believed that everyone was entitled to fair legal representation, even Negros.<br/><br/>This novel is about an adult "Scout" who comes home from several years in New York to visit her hometown boyfriend and presumed fiance and father only to have her childhood blinders that hid the defects of her loved ones torn off by the reality that in many ways they were little different than most people in her home town and county.<br/><br/>It was not as compelling as To Kill A Mockingbird, set in the more remote 1930's which was written for a later audience more attuned to the civil rights issues of the '60's but it is still a very compelling novel of a time and place that, hopefully, will never return. I gave it 4 stars because it was not  as great as Mockingbird, a five star truly great novel, but nevertheless very worthwhile for Harper Lee's unique writing style and narrative.
As did most readers, I was somewhat apprehensive when I began to read, not knowing what to expect based on early reviews. Let me state clearly that I was not disappointed. My conclusion is - this book is a must read! The characters are well developed and in keeping with my understanding of the their time period. The writing reflects what it is like to live in a small town (to me as a city boy claustrophobic) in the South at a time of major social change. The first half of the book essentially sets the scene, builds the characters, etc and reads a little slow. I wasn't quite sure where it was going. It is a pleasant read, but not exciting. The book doesn't really get to the point until midway and when it does - BAM - it hits you like a ton of bricks. Both from understanding the characters and the direction the book takes in exploring the open sore of American life - racism and all of its consequences. In writing my review I am conscious of the fact that most potential readers know the essence of the story, but what they cannot know without actually reading the book, is the emotional impact of the story and Lee's writing. I now very well understand why she waited to release this book and her timing could not have been better. She clearly captures  the moment - still present today - and draws the reader into her web and you cannot put the book down. Warning - as I finished the book I found myself shedding a few tears not because of the story, but because of the impact the characters had on me and I was very surprised by that outcome. To summarize, this book is a must read to understand not only the South today (and its politics) but our country writ large.
This was certainly not the beautifully written book that To Kill a Mockingbird was. I found whole sections lifted from TKM  but that aside this book could not seem to find itself until the last thirty pages and even then it seemed to not know what was found.
Disappointing- I re read TKAM first and truly loved it. The reusing of whole pages I thought was an insult to the reader. I felt as if this book was a first draft and no one had edited it. The conflict between Scout and Atticus consumed too much of the time.
As someone who grew up reading to kill a mockingbird and considering Atticus the perfect father, I rode the rollercoaster with Scout as she comes to terms with changing perceptions. This is a wonderful book, but it is definitely better to read to kill a mockingbird first (who hasn't?), as you can appreciate the Finches more in this story.
While I absolutely love "To Kill A Mockingbird", I was very disappointed in "Go Set A Watchman". It wasn't in the same class as Lee's first novel. I struggled to finish reading it as it never captured my attention. Falls far short of TKAM.
Thank goodness her publisher made her go home and re write this from the perspective of scout as a child during Aticus defense of the African American teenager.  We would have never heard of Nelle Harper Lee if they had tried to publish this in the 60's.
I read To Kill a Mockingbird first. I enjoyed that story much more than Go Set a Watchman. Go Set a Watchman at times was confusing to me and I found it didn't flow very well. It could be that the story was not as interesting as "Mockingbird".
Lee should have listened to her original editor/publishing firm.  This is a pre-write, and none of the characters, besides Scout, are well-developed.  I didn't recognize any of them.  Jem and Dill are both absent from the plot in this story as well.
I'm a Harper Lee fan.  There's a reason this wasn't published until this year.  She knew it was just a draft and not a finished piece.  It's interesting as a literary backstory to To Kill a Mockingbird, but it is not a finished piece of literature.
A grown Jean Louise returns to her hometown on vacation and finds that the father she idolized as a child is really a human being. Scout must face the idealisms of childhood as well as the realities of adulthood in the Deep South of the post WW II era, and what she sees as the hypocritical beliefs of the people who raised her.
This book had so much hype when it was supposed to come out, so I decided I wanted to read it in spite of some of the less than stellar reviews.  The book is a follow-up to the much-loved To Kill A Mockingbird which was a gem of a book.  This one just does not have the magic of Mockingbird.  I found the second half was rather disjointed and I kind of lost interest as well as the point.  The setting is 1950's, right at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.  Scout is 26 and has returned home from her job in New York to visit her aging father.  Atticus is in 70's and suffers from arthritis but he still goes into his office every day.  Things have changed in Maycomb.  Jean Louise's (Scout) brother Jem has been killed in an accident but we never really find out what happened.  Jean Louise's best friend is working in the office with Atticus, Jean' Louse's aunt Alexander has moved into the family home to help care for Atticus, and her loved Uncle Jack seems even more peculiar.  And when Jean Louise happens to sneak into a meeting of the Maycomb Community Society and who does she find there introducing the speaker?  Her father and her best and oldest friend who wants to marry her.  Everything escalate from here.  Jean Louise is incensed with the community feeling about Negroes and it results in a huge fight with her father when she confronts him with her new-found information as to how he really feels about the blacks.  It was an interesting book simply because we had already met these characters before, but on it's own merit, it just doesn't quite make the grade.
Can understand why it sat in a desk drawer for the past few decades--reads like an outline, not a completely-fleshed-out novel and also does the Atticus Finch we remember from Mockingbird no justice. Lots of hype, but just as much disappointment.
Sad this was released. Extremely convoluted study of Southern small town life, racism, and growing up - finally - as an adult.  First editor was right to send the author back to rewrite with new clarity and focus to produce To Kill a Mockingbird.
This was such a tremendous disappointment of a novel. As one who loved To Kill a Mockingbird, this was a must buy. Unfortunately, the story and characters were lacking the development that existed in the predecessor. I wish I had saved my money.
Swan Song of The Mockingbird<br/>(Bing Chang - 7/16/2015)<br/><br/>Colonial flags are coming down; mockingbirds cheering around town.<br/>The honorable saint, once pedestalled in millions' minds,<br/>Ghosted out of their fantasies with the shocking Watchman's find.<br/><br/>Believing in morality, fighting for justice, the essence of humanity stands.<br/>The mockingbird mocks Scout's naïveté,  her senses being led astray.<br/>Realities cut unabashed adoration with a ray, many are feeling betrayed.<br/><br/>Yet, sublime integrity was indeed his goal, an imperfect but trying soul!<br/>A journey to greatness challenges one who dares to fail with bruises.<br/>Humanity advances with juxtaposition of dreams and realities with virtues.
I LOVED  "To Kill a Mockingbird"- this book was so boring I couldn't get past the first 50 pages- my son also read-but finished it- I asked, "Should I keep going? Will there ever be a plot?" He answered "No, not really."
This is obviously the first draft Harper Lee's publisher told her to rewrite.  As such, it is interesting to see how such a mundane draft was turned into the wonderful Mockingbird.  But, it should have been promoted as such and not as a sequel.
If you have only shied away from reading this book because of the media's claims that Atticus is a raging racist, please go out and pick up a copy. The focus of the novel is NOT Atticus's newly-revealed racist views, but rather his humanization and "fall from grace" in the eyes of the daughter who held him up as a god among men. It is a novel that reminds us that men are not perfect creatures who cannot and should not be relied upon to make fair and just decisions all of the time. The real takeaway from the story, and the lesson that ultimately separates Scout from Jean Louise, is that an individual cannot allow one person (or a group of people) to be one's conscious - each individual must be his own "watchman."<br/>Does Atticus espouse racist views in the story? Yes, but as you are reading, consider whether his views stem from pure hatred of another race, a fear of another race, a change in his environment and way of life, and/or the rejection of too much government interference too quickly - and then reflect on social and cultural issues in today's society. Ask yourself whether it is possible - even in the modern world - to be truly "color-blind" (or religion-blind, ethnicity-blind, sexual orientation-blind, etc.).<br/>My only criticism of the novel (and the reason I gave it four stars) is the inconsistent narrative voice. Considering the fact that Harper Lee wrote GO SET A WATCHMAN before TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, it is not surprising that her first attempt at writing lacks the refinement of a seasoned author.
Like many, I found the book to be interesting because it's the sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. But beyond that, had the book been printed today as a stand alone novel it would have never made any best selling list. The plot is very basic in terms of story telling and really only revolves around Scout learning that her father isn't the man she thought he was and coming to terms with that. Without going into details of the story, many of the earlier reports of Atticus's racism are bloated and not really accurate to the story itself. It is true that he becomes the fallen hero to Scout, but hardly the KKK robe wearing racist many picture when thinking of racism in the south.<br/>As a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird I would have to recommend not reading this book unless you simply cannot say no to a sequel from Harper Lee. I say this not because of the twist of Atticus not being the man he was, but due to the failure of Lee's editor. The book is well written and very similar in style to Mockingbird, but it seems that no one read Mockingbird prior to publishing Watchman. Many of the flashbacks and details of Scouts youth contradict the actual story of Mockingbird. These glaring errors aren't because of Scouts childhood memories, but are outright wrong facts. The worst of these I believe is that Tom (the man on trial) was aquitted when in Mockingbird he was found guilty and killed by the guards when in prison. It's because of things like this that I found Watchman to be a poor sequel to Mockingbird and not a must read followup.
After reading To Kill a Mockingbird this was very disappointing. It was very disjointed and extremely hard to follow. while there was a plot it was almost impossible to understand. At the end we wondered why this was published.
Top shelf story telling about coming of age.  I had already recommended this reading to my reading clan after part II.  A sensitive subject that resonates for 150 years is told personally, subjectively...well.  Thank you Nell.
The ideological debate between Jean Louise and her father as well as her uncle is false, didactic and full of righteousness. Fortunately, "Mockingbirds" is too big and great a novel to be killed by this redundant publication.
I'd rate it a zero if possible.  What a waste of money.  I should have waited for the reviews before pre-ordering.  I admire the Michigan bookstore that gave a refund to customers who were unhappy with the book and the hype.
I was so surprised to see how weak the writing was in this book.  I had expected much more.  Story was OK but had too many themes and side trips almost all unresolved.  I cannot recommend this for any serious consideration.
You can tell it was a draft copy. It went back and forth from first person narrative to third person throughout the entire novel. Every uneventful. Don't waste your time giving money to Harper Lee's attorney by buying this.
"Watchman" reads like a work in progress.  It's a book that hasn't been completely thought out and polished.  A series of anecdotes from the past are awkwardly patched into the present-day by too much padded expository.  Important plot elements should be deftly woven together but are not.  Atticus' shocking revelation takes a third of the book to be revealed. There's a last minute revelation that feels false, and thrown in for shock.  It's very episodic and would flow better if edited.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that she returns for a yearly visit with her father, Jean Louise (Scout) enters a new world on this visit where characters she's grown up with have flip-flopped into people she barely recognizes, including her father.  None of it rings true.  Changes like this don't occur abruptly.  Scout's anguished reaction feels flat.  The reader should be filled with the same shocked disgust , and the words just sit there on the page.  Again, it reads like an early draft with significant events enumerated but not cohesively woven together.  The writing has not been fine tuned.  It should have been edited.<br/><br/>"Watchman" would not be selling so well or getting so much attention if not for "To Kill A Mockingbird."  It's shallow and poorly-written.  It's just a sad follow up to one of the great novels of the 20th century, which was most likely published to cash in on Mockingbird's legacy.
It is apparent that this was a novice attempt. At times the story rambled. I felt very little connection with the characters. As an English teacher, I was compelled to read it but would not put it on my list of must reads.
For all you English teachers out there--tear up your current lesson plans on To Kill a Mockingbird. Go Set a Watchman adds a layer of complexity and maturity to the characters and the issue of race in the South that TKAM only began to explore. I'm so pleased that this novel was published.
It should have never been published!  She got poor advice. For this to be last Harper Lee book I read - that is a shame.  Mocking Bird was such a great & timeless book.  I got to know & love that Scout.  This is just sad.
I was disappointed--the first part really sounded like Lee, and was very good--however, I can't believe she even wrote the last half--after she saw Atticus at the Ku  Klux meeting, it suddenly turned preachy and shallow.
For all the hype and attention the release of this book got, I was very disappointed when I received it. It was difficult to follow, laborious to read, and the characters were very one dimensional. Don't waste your time.
The minutiae of small towns captured in crystal perfection combined with some painful revaluation and the realization that an idol can have feet of clay. Softer than To Kill a Mockingbird, but in every way its companion.
I love her writing style.  I think this book is just as good as her first one.  When I got through the last page, I responded with an 'out-loud' "Oh, no" because I didn't want it to end.  Harper Lee is amazing!!!
I tried to read this while putting all the media hype/controversy on the back burner. This is my opinion after finishing the book. The story did not flow. There was a writing style in the middle that did not match Lee's which made me suspicious that the draft (which had been mysteriously hidden all these years and drew much controversy) had been tampered with (I hope I am wrong). The flashbacks to Jean Louise's childhood justify why the publisher of TKAM originally rejected GSAW and ask for a story based on young Jean Louise (Scout), but the flashbacks were disjointed and did not help the story flow. However, these flashbacks were the ONLY enjoyable part of the book to me. If only Scout could have stayed young and told more stories, but then the novelty of Lee's one and only award winning book and her status in history would have been diluted. I'm not sure the publisher or agent did Lee any favors by publishing this. If you are a literary student or a huge fan of Lee, it is of interest. If you are looking for a good novel or a comparison to TKAM, you will be disappointed. The way Jean Louise deals with the discovery of the real Atticus and the whole subject of race issue can be thought provoking. Ms Lee is elderly and I can't help but wonder if someone took advantage of her good name only to make money. I will never buy the book. It simply isn't that good and I will not give them the money.
We read this for book club. I was counting the days til it was released and boy was I disappointed! The same person did not write both books! It rambled and had no plot! Horribly written! Our book club gave it no stars!
As a lifelong fan of To Kill A Mockingbird, I cannot recommend this book. As a lifelong reader with about 100 books per year read, I cannot recommend this book. I think the other reviewers with 1 or 2 star ratings are spot on: it is very poorly written. I feel I did good research to make sure, in regard to Harper Lee's mental state, that this was an ethical purchase. I am not, however, a Lee scholar by any means so am very confused by many things in this book: primarily, in the first (very dull and choppy) 100 pages or so there are many passing references to things that lend absolutely zero to the story but reference things in TKaM which is supposed to be the second novel (Jem and Dill for starters). These references are very akin to "second in the series" books to help refresh the reader's regarding the plot and characters in the first book. They make no sense. Actually, much of this book makes no sense. Most of the reviews I have read relate this book to TKaM and review it thus. I cannot fault them for that, however on it's own, this book is just not good (whether it was ever only a draft or if it was a finished novel seems to be somewhat in dispute). As either a sequel or prequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, it fails. If you are a die hard Mockingbird fan, I implore you to save your money. If you do read this book, you will want to forget it. Fortunately, that will be pretty easy.
If "Go Set A Watchman" had come first, we would never have heard of "To Kill A Mockingbird".  It's just not good enough to warrant a prequel.  The publishers made a big deal out of the fact that they had not re-edited the book since it was first presented in  the early sixties, and maybe they should have.  The writing varies from really good to pedantic, and from high-flown philosophical musings to the boring stuff of everyday life - sometimes on the same page.<br/><br/>Scout (although we don't call her that anymore) is presented as more worldly and more liberal than her friends and family back home, and having lived in New York City for some years, we would expect that.  What we don't get, however, is anything about her life in New York - her job, how she lives, what she does for amusement, who her friends are - and this gives readers little basis upon which to believe her musings that she no longer belongs in Macomb.<br/><br/>Scout's anger and indignance at the racial leanings of her father and Henry is understandable, but the fact that glimpsing them at one meeting with some racist people is the ONLY hint of their beliefs is not all that credible.  Surely, in all the time she has been in New York, she has had at least one conversation with her father or Henry about life in Macomb county, hasn't she?<br/><br/>This book left me feeling like it should have been more.
This book was essentially unreadable.  The dialogue was written as if people were lecturing one another (similar to John Galt's 100-page speech in Atlas Shrugged).  There was no clear story line.  I couldn't finish it.
Wish I could unread this book.  Harper Lee did not publish this first draft for a very good reason.  The characters were still being developed and are very unlike the ones that emerge in Mockingbird.  It has a few amusing and insightful bits but mostly it takes away from the finished book.  I'll wait a few years, try to forget Watchman and read Mockingbird again.  You just shouldn't mess with perfection.  And shame on the people who are profiting by diminishing a classic.
I tried and tried and just couldn't get through it.  Found it quite disappointing and kind of boring.  I know Harper Lee agreed to publish it as she wrote it -- no edits -- but editing would have improved the book.
Thankful I had just re-read To Kill A Mockingbird so I could understand the background. Many important factors of the characters were left out. First half interesting. Second half a "lecture" I didn't need.
“To Kill A Mockingbird” is one of my 11 most favorite books, so I undertook to read this “sequel” with trepidation, especially considering all of the uproar over the portrayal of Atticus Finch. Having finished it, I can say that I think the editor in the ‘50s who didn’t want to publish it had a valid point.<br/><br/> Don’t get me wrong: the plot is interesting and the characters relatively well drawn. It just seems to me that some judicial rewriting could have made this a much better book, but ff course the author never undertook that task. Flashes of the excellent writing encountered in “Mockingbird” show up on many pages, and some of the humor reminded me of the other work. It just seems to me that the author set out a plot and then, not knowing quite how to end the book, just rushed into something that was rather unsatisfactory.<br/><br/> I’m not even going to insert myself into the “Atticus Finch is a racist/bigot” dispute going on at this time. He is what he is, and a reader should take a character in the way an author presents him or her. Make what you want of him, that’s the man Harper Lee wrote into the story.<br/><br/> All in all, it’s not an especially bad book, but it does pale in comparison to its companion book. I don’t say whether you should read it or not, that decision is up to you. For myself, I’m content that I did read it.
This story follows a few days in the life of Scout as a young adult back for a visit to her little hometown in Alabama.  Scout hasn't matured much; which is what this story is about.  A big deal is made about her growing up in the Jim Crow South "color blind", and struggling to enjoy her visits home because of it.  Scout evidently missed any opportunities for personal growth during her teen and college years -- even ensuing years living in working in New York City.  Apparently she has formed no friendships, joined no organizations, gone on no dates, and done no thinking.  Everything seems filtered through an idyllic, rose colored impression of her father, uncle, Calpurnia (the housekeeper who raised her) and childhood.  Jem has died of some congenital heart ailment that struck down her mother.  Her thoughts on Jem don't reconcile with what we know from the previous book, but it does seem Jem grew up while Scout did not.  On this fateful "vacation" the scales finally fall from her eyes and she is SHOCKED to find things aren't what they seemed and her world is rocked.  This rang false.  Some of the details are beautifully rendered and the sense of place is spot on.  The best parts are the flashbacks.<br/>This is not a great book like "To Kill A Mockingbird".  There's a reason the author chose to put it aside.
"Go Set a Watchman".  I finished it yesterday on Kindle.  Of course if you have read "To Kill a Mockingbird it will be reminiscent of running into an old friend since characters are the same only grown up and chatting about days gone by - like you are attending a high school or family reunion.  I enjoyed the nostalgic visit down memory lane.  To me, the story is about a young white girl growing up in Alabama and trying to make sense of the ravaged land and inhabitants - remnants of the War Between the States.  This is what war does to a land and generations that follow as they try to rebuild with a fair minded approach to understanding something that has so many facets that it just gets overwhelming.  Some will judge with harshness the language used throughout the book without removing themselves from their own bigotry since it is difficult to recognize the bigot reflected in the mirror.  The book offers different ways of looking at a situation, as if you are removing layers of an onion.  They are all separate layers but as a whole they make up the onion and the whole thing is in the soup.  I recommend this book and hope readers will read it objectively and not quote phrases out of context but our society right now seems devoted to criticism and anger so I doubt that is possible.  I applaud Harper Lee's amazing talents.
4.5 stars<br/><br/>I only read To Kill A Mockingbird for the first time about a year ago. It was a book club choice one month and I really loved the story. Atticus is portrayed as this perfect person, this guy who does no wrong. Scout really idolizes him and she learns a lot from that time spent with him growing up. I remember the negative reaction to Go Set A Watchman when it came out a few months ago. We had already decided to read it for this month for book club, so I was curious to see how I would find the book since so many people were so upset with it. Atticus is a racist in this one, something people had a very hard time with. I'm glad I read To Kill A Mockingbird before this book came out and was around for all the outrage. It is fascinating to me.<br/><br/>Go Set A Watchman starts off when Scout is older and coming home for a visit. She comes home every year from New York, but this year really shakes things up for her. She finds out that Henry and Atticus are not really who she thought. She really finds that the town is not what she thought anymore. She has a hard time with all the racist issues that she sees everywhere in her town now. She is such a great character. She wants to run away from it all, leave it all behind as she is disgusted by it, but while she is there she doesn't always just let it go. There were some hilarious moments when I just thought you go Scout.<br/><br/>When she finds that Atticus and Henry as just like the rest of the town, they participate in the council where the super racists guys spew their garbage, she is physically ill. Her whole world comes crashing down on her. She doesn't understand how Atticus could be there, be part of all of this.<br/><br/>It was really interesting to me as people reading the book also had a very strong reaction to it. It seems like those who hate this story because of Atticus and the way he is now are just like Scout/Jean Louise. They held Atticus up to this incredible standard, they saw him as perfect, and when they see that as an old man he is not, his thinking is not as perfect as it was once thought, their world crashes down. It made people angry, just as it made Jean Louise angry. I found that to be so interesting. How people reading this book and their reactions mirror Jean Louise so much. How people are so upset by what happens just as she is. I loved it.<br/><br/>Really I thought this book works well with To Kill A Mockingbird as a companion novel. It is probably not very good as a standalone novel, but together I think it is a great story. You have the story told from Scout's point of view, but an older perspective. Of course she idolized her father so he is seen as near perfect in To Kill A Mockingbird (though I never thought he was as his views on some things, namely women, were not very good). Now, all grown up, she is realizing that that lens she used to view him through is not wholly accurate. You still get that calm, respectable guy, and he doesn't think he is that bad, but he is not perfect. He thinks he is helping those black people, as they are just in their infancy and they can't really be ready to have full civil rights, after all<br/><br/>For as much as some of the discussions angered me, as much as the way people thought was terrible, it felt true to the time. It felt like this could have been how it was. Jean Louise was wonderful. Even though she now sees that her father isn't perfect, she got enough goodness from him raising her that she can go on to be the warrior he is not. She can go on to be the leader, to try and change the way things are, to try and change people's opinions if she wants to. Because she saw so much good in Atticus as a child she was able to really grow up and view people as people. They all look different for different reasons, but race had nothing to do with it. Because she grew up to just view people as people she has a particularly hard time now that race is supposed to be an issue.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this book. I think it makes Atticus more human and it is a great partner to the first book. It really shows the differences between how you see things as a kid and when you learn as an adult that not everything you thought as a child was as true and right. I remember having those moments with my own family and so this story really resonated with me. Yes, it is maddening, a lot of the characters made me angry with their views, but I still see it as a hopeful story. As a story that things can change, this will change slowly, and maybe Jean Louise can help. I see it as a story of the time.<br/><br/>This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland
This is a book that should never have been published. There are glimpses of good writing but the way this books was promoted to the public, the reader would be expecting a sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird" instead of the first draft of that book, which is what "Go Set a Watchman" is in truth.<br/><br/>If you look at this as a first draft, you see how far the author came and how well it turned out as "To Kill a Mockingbird". But if you look at this as a sequel, the reader is sadly disappointed. The characters do not mesh, they do not seem to be the same characters because they are so different from the original classic we know. The writing does not draw the reader into the story the way Mockingbird did. The trial verdict is different in both books.<br/><br/>It is also completely unbelievable to look at this as a sequel and say that Scout grew into her 20's without ANY inkling that her whole family were racists. I have seen it written in other reviews that they were separatists but when you read the degrading argument made by Atticus about the black race, it is racist. I grew up a colorblind child but as hard as my parents worked to make us colorblind, we knew they struggled to reach that point and there were other members of the family who were racist. For Scout to be shocked and suddenly see everyone exhibiting racist attitudes is not realistic for the well-read intelligent child she was supposed to be. The biggest inconsistency for me was Calpurnia's attitude toward Scout, the child she raised. That does not just happen overnight. Therefore, it does not work on any level as a sequel.<br/><br/>I have read that Harper Lee said she would never write another novel because she had very high standards for the craft of writing. This would never meet her standards as stated. I see why many readers are demanding a refund. An ethical publisher would not have published this as is. If it was edited, they did a REALLY poor job. It should either have been marketed truthfully as a first draft or it should have had the names changed to make it an entirely different book, but allowing the characters from both books to try to exist in the same space just does not work. There are too many inconsistencies.<br/><br/>It is worth reading only as a historical piece in the craft of writing.
"Every man’s island, Jean Louise, every man’s watchman, is his conscience. There is no such thing as a collective conscious.”<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this book. It was fascinating to see Jean Louise grow into her own conscience. Having grown up in Mississippi-a childhood which began in the early 60's- I remember growing up with similar sights and sounds that Jean Louise did. At a point in my late teens I had that moment where I began  thinking of things somewhat differently as my parents and judging them for their beliefs. In hindsight I needed an "Uncle Jack" to help me understand my parents. It is interesting to me that the author was able to write a book way back then that crosses the generations and connects even today. Many people criticize this author as setting up Atticus to be racist in this novel after making his character so compassionate to the plight of a black man who is falsely accused in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. I do not see that Atticus has changed at all, and my view of him did not change from the first book to this book.  If I had read this book earlier in my life I would've been somewhat disappointed. Just as I judged my parents then-Jean Louise does the same in this novel. In the last few years as I have lived longer I see my parents differently again. I see them as loving parents trying to raise 5 kids in very trying times and truly making efforts to adjust to the changes occurring all around them.  I wish Harper Lee could've written another novel to follow so we could know what Jean Louise does to help bring about change in Maycomb County.  Hopefully in real life we can help bring about changes needed as we learn to treat others as we want to be treated. Every generation brings insight into this and causes previous generations to understand their parents a little better as well.
“Go Set a Watchman” is probably the most talked-about sequel to any book in the last fifty years – maybe more – and I’m writing a negative review of it. I liked it rather less than “To Kill a Mockingbird,” though that isn’t saying much. Now, bear with me. Please understand, I’m speaking as someone who wasn’t wild about “To Kill a Mockingbird” in the first place. It was fine and it was good and I was over it the second I closed the book in ninth grade.<br/><br/>Now, if that hasn’t completely shattered your psyche, read on.<br/><br/>A plot summary is hardly necessary; the bare bones of this early draft of “Mockingbird” have been splattered all over the Internet and the Arts section of nearly every newspaper in the country. All you need to know is that Scout is grown up (and now going by Jean Louise), romantically involved with someone who is not Dill, and living in New York. On a visit back to her family, she realizes that both her would-be-boyfriend and her father, the noble Atticus Finch, are bigots.<br/><br/>Well, not so bad as that, but to Jean Louise, it might as well be, because it means they’ve been lying to her. All her life, she’s thought Atticus was a champion for racial equality, but now he seems to have come out as a white supremacist, if a milder one than most of them. Henry, her childhood friend who wants to be something more, has never shown any of this behavior either, but he defends her father to a point that shocks her out of any (if any; we’re given reason to think there was none) half-fancied notion of marrying him.<br/><br/>This, oddly, isn’t what bothered me. Although I wasn’t thrilled to hear that the impeccable Atticus was nearly as bad as the rest, I thought there was a lot of potential for this to add depth to his character. That didn’t happen. Scout (forgive me; I can’t manage to call her Jean Louise) spends most of the book being blindly furious, and with good reason: no one ever gives her a straight answer as to why Atticus thinks the way he does and why she has never seen it before. Not ever. Uncle Jack tries, but he couches it so thoroughly in a literature-sodden history lesson that I wasn’t able to make head or tail of it. If you could, great, but I guess I just wasn’t smart enough.<br/><br/>Actually, that sums up my feelings toward most of the rest of the book: either I’m not smart enough or I’m not patient enough or Harper Lee is writing in circles. I would read lines that were supposed to be biting, satirical, funny, and just wrinkle my eyebrows. I would skim over descriptions of place and time, longing for something to actually happen in this story. Because almost nothing does. By telling you what I already have, I’ve pretty near spoiled the entire book. There’s just not that much plot to spoil.<br/><br/>I didn’t hate everything, though.  I liked the little sequences of Scout’s childhood after “Mockingbird,” especially the one where she tries desperately to fit in at her first school dance. And although the other characters didn’t address Atticus’s true colors well, I thought he himself did a decent job of it. At least he didn’t attack anyone else’s beliefs. And I’ll try not to, either. If you love this book like a child, that’s fine. If you dislike it in comparison to the first, that’s fine. And if you don’t even want to read it, that’s fine too. But I don’t regret the read – because if nothing else, I can say I have read the most talked-about sequel to any book in the last fifty years and then proceed to talk about it. Even if no one wants to hear.
Full disclosure: To Kill a Mockingbird sits comfortably atop both my favorite books and favorite movies lists.  I would read a phone book if Harper Lee’s name was on the cover. For this reason, I preordered my copy of Go Set a Watchman on the first day that it became available.  On the day it arrived, I made a quick decision to reread Mockingbird before starting Watchman. I’m very glad I did.  I strongly recommend reading To Kill a Mockingbird right before starting Go Set a Watchman.  Even if you have already read Mockingbird (and especially if you haven’t) it is important that you have the voice of Scout fresh in your mind when you start to read Watchman. I did this and it was easy to accept that the adult Jean Louise from Watchman is the same person as Scout from Mockingbird.<br/><br/>The plot of Watchman is nowhere near as compelling or tightly woven as it is in Mockingbird. Even so, it does much to flesh out the characters we first encountered in Mockingbird. The two books together serve to tell a more complete story than either book does on its own. My favorite parts are those that fill the gaps between the childhood that we know from Mockingbird and the present where the adult Jean Louise returns to visit Maycomb after years of living in New York City. Her path from the young tomboy Scout to the young woman Jean Louise is as entertaining for readers as it is often painful for her.<br/><br/>A large part of my love of Mockingbird is my belief that Atticus Finch is the most admirable character in fiction. Needless to say, I was concerned when reports started coming out that the Atticus readers see in Watchman is not the same Atticus we know and love from Mockingbird. Some people will disagree with me but I found that my concerns were unfounded. While the Atticus that we meet in Watchman is not the walking-on-water saint that we met in Mockingbird, he is still essentially the same person. As two paintings of the same subject can appear radically different when viewed from different perspectives, so too can people. The Atticus Finch that we know from Mockingbird is viewed through the eyes of a little girl looking at her father. As is often the case, a little girl’s father is the well from which springs all wisdom and truth. He can do no wrong. When that same girl has grown and become independent, though, she views him in a much different light. She finds that his version of truth is not always the same as hers. Her eyes begin to see spots of tarnish on his once shining armor.<br/><br/>Another way to look at Atticus is from a regional perspective. Atticus’s behavior in Mockingbird makes it easy to forget that he is a Southerner. To do so does a disservice to both the reader and the story. Both books make it very clear that the Finch roots grow deep in the red Alabama soil. I’m not saying this to disparage Atticus but to point out that every day of his life and the lives if his father and his father before him was spent looking at the world in a certain way because that was the only reality they had ever known. It may not be right but, given that reality, any other way of looking at the world was almost impossible. In short, Atticus was a gentleman whose actions were driven by his conscience. Even so, those actions were shaped and constrained by the reality of the world he lived in. It is to his credit that he raised Scout to see that another way of seeing the world even existed. Remember that his conversation with Jean Louise. The last thing he said to her after she basically ripped him to shreds was that he was proud of her. Those words did a lot to redeem him in my eyes. He may have been damned by his upbringing but he had succeeded in keeping his daughter from the same fate.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while I don’t agree with some of the views expressed by Atticus Finch in Watchman, I understand where Harper Lee was coming from when she wrote them and they contributed greatly to my understanding of the man who is still my favorite fictional character. Now we know that he is human and through his shortcomings we are given a great opportunity to discuss issues that affected our world then and still do today.<br/><br/>After back-to-back readings of Mockingbird and Watchman, I have come to the conclusion that Harper Lee’s story of Jean Louse Finch and her life borders on autobiographical. If the events in the story weren’t real, the people were. Even looking at the author’s picture on the flyleaf makes me think Yep, that’s what a grown-up Scout would look like.’ I’m not sure why this is important beyond the fact that it suggests that what Ms. Lee was writing was very close to her heart. This could explain why she never wrote anything else. I believe it was Ernest Hemingway who once said ‘There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed’. I believe that is what Harper Lee did and I thank her for it.<br/><br/>FYI: On a 5-point scale I assign stars based on my assessment of what the book needs in the way of improvements:<br/>• 5 Stars – Nothing at all. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.<br/>• 4 Stars – It could stand for a few tweaks here and there but it’s pretty good as it is.<br/>• 3 Stars – A solid C grade. Some serious rewriting would be needed in order for this book to be considered good or memorable.<br/>• 2 Stars – This book needs a lot of work. A good start would be to change the plot, the character development, the writing style and the ending.<br/>• 1 Star  -  The only thing that would improve this book is a good bonfire.
I just finished the next sequel (or prequel, or rewrite, or what have you) to “To Kill a Mockingbird”, entitled “Go Set a Watchman” by Harper Lee. I will start out by saying that I don’t know whether this was rewritten, or this was as “Mockingbird” was SUPPOSED to be or anything else. To say that accounts and opinions vary is an understatement! I intend to review the book as a book and not get tied up into suppositions and trying to read the author’s mind.<br/><br/>The story takes place about 20 years after the events in “Mockingbird”. Jean Louise Finch, who is now 26 and grown, takes the train back to Macomb, Alabama from her home in New York, where she works as a writer. Her much-admired father Atticus, is now 72 and increasingly feeble, although still practicing law. His partner, the young Henry Collins, her bother Jem’s age, is romantically interested in Jean Louise. (SPOILER ALERT!). Her brother Jem dropped dead of a heart attack a few years previously.<br/><br/>Jean Louise keeps much of her old fiery nature. She wastes no time getting into disagreements with her aunt. She also has carried new attitudes about the race question (Keep in mind this is @ 1955-60 – the specific date is not mentioned). However, in many ways, Jean Louise settles back into the easy ways of her childhood; she vaguely is leaning towards marrying Henry. Other familiar characters enter back into the story – her Uncle Jack, Jem (through flashbacks) and members of the Cunningham family, among others.<br/><br/>About mid-way through the book, Jean Louise’s world is shattered when she finds out that Henry and much worse, her father, have attended a White Citizen’s Council meeting and prove themselves not in favor of the burgeoning civil rights movement. It is here where many “Mockingbird” readers (literally or figuratively) slam down the book in disgust!<br/><br/>If they did, they missed what I thought was the most important part of the book: realizing that people change; Atticus has changed, the man she wanted to marry has changed; the town has changed; that the action of change has caused an equal reaction from those who like the old ways. Jean Louise finds out, like nearly all of our children do, that their revered parents can have some mighty holes in their makeup. You sometimes have to go through disillusionment before you can know true love and admiration. Atticus, in his own way, is true to his own beliefs – whether it is a Black man accused of rape or what he considers a Federal government out of control.<br/><br/>Having read “Mockingbird” numerous times, I admit I would have like to put Atticus on the stand and cross-examined him about some of these beliefs that I don’t feel jived with what I saw in the original book. However, as I went through to the end of the book, I think both Jean Louise and I both understood him better.<br/><br/> Do I think this book stands next to “Mockingbird” in quality? Not at all. It is a sequel: not a great one, but a good one. I would give it 3-1/2 to four stars (out of five). But I would recommend that those who loved Atticus Finch in the book and movie walk with him and his daughter about the coming of age that both Jean Louise and we, the readers must go through.
Just call her the Donald Trump of contemporary literature.  Seems Harper Lee may be the only writer out there with the courage (insert any other applicable noun of choice) to see it and say it like it is.  (Apologies to Lee, of course.)<br/><br/>That’s what she did in 1961 with the publication of her inimitable To Kill a Mockingbird; it may be what she just did (reluctantly or not) with the publication of her Go Set a Watchman, the second novel set in Maycomb, Alabama, with Jean Louise Finch—Scout—as narrator,  twenty years or so later.<br/><br/>It really is too soon to talk about this latest novel, as thinly disguised autobiography as her first one, but first gut reactions are a place to start.  The initial sound bites have not been reticent, so more thoughtful minds may be called upon to prevail if anyone is to give the novel its due and its chance with the American reader.<br/><br/>Whether or not Lee approved of the rush to publication (“rush” being relative in this case:  she presumably wrote it in the 1950s) or whether she was manipulated by advisors once her late body guard sister Alice was out of the picture (supposedly the 90-year-old author isn’t quite in control of her faculties these days) is the subject of another debate.  Whether this second book is as good (“good” always being relative) as her first is still another.  No one will argue the insurmountable task of meeting or surpassing To Kill a Mockingbird’s popularity—not gonna happen.  Ever.  Period.  End of story.<br/><br/>Partly, that is, because it was the first to introduce us to the immortal characters Scout and Jem, Boo Radley and Dill and, of course, Atticus Finch, characters we all wanted to believe existed, to emulate, to say and do the things that needed saying and doing at that time and place in our history.  Lee couldn’t have chosen a better publication date if she’d tried, putting Tom Robinson (and all of us) on trial on the cusp of the Civil Rights Movement of the 60s.  And she couldn’t have a chosen a better defender of an innocent black man than Atticus, even if his gargantuan attorney skills still couldn’t get his client justice then.<br/><br/>It’s no wonder the book has been required reading in schools from Alabama to Alaska and beyond—it’s one book whose entire makeup (plot, characters, theme, symbols, setting) meets the “Must Read” standard, even if there are sustainable arguments that a good editor could have streamlined the story, deleting a lot of the Lee’s rambling style without losing any of its charm or vitality.<br/><br/>And it’s no surprise, either, that it’s been on censorship lists for an equal length of time; both sides of the racial divide have been offended or defended it with equal vigor. That’s how dialogue gets opened; dialogue is how things get resolved.  And this is one dialogue every American needs to have at one time or another. To call To Kill a Mockingbird the Great American Novel is without hyperbole, though it may not have topped the 100 list assembled by the ALA at the turn of the last century.  It’s kind of like the popular vote vs. the Electoral College sometimes.  TKAM is without argument “first in the hearts of its countrymen.”<br/><br/>I would be remiss in ignoring the role the award-winning film adaptation played in the novel’s popularity and significance.  Even Lee herself, who refused script responsibilities, acknowledges the importance of screenwriter Horton Foote and his signature perspective that endeared everyone to the memorable characters Lee had created. (Personal note: I wrote my doctoral dissertation on Foote primarily for this reason.)  I don’t recall who cast the 1962 film directed by Robert Mulligan, but can anyone imagine anyone but Gregory Peck or Mary Badham (or any other members of the incredible cast) in these roles?  Lee’s Atticus and Scout are as iconic American figures as those etched into Mt. Rushmore, thanks in particular to Peck’s and Badham’s portrayals. This was one marriage made in Hollywood that should last the test of time.<br/><br/>All that preamble just to open the discussion on Go Set a Watchman.  First, anyone who hasn’t read the first novel needs to take care of that omission before doing anything else.  I tell everyone, all the time, if they haven’t read it, to stop everything and find a copy. Then, one must read the new novel before passing judgment—no quoting reporters or critics or whoever may feel qualified to comment.  Not only is that lazy, poor scholarship, it’s just useless and wrong.  Read it. Think about it. Then respond if so led.<br/><br/>Having met all the above prerequisites I delineated, I will attempt to do just that right now, reserving the right to return to this topic at any later time with additional observations, even if contradictory.  Time can only tell.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the narrator’s voice—Jean Louise “Scout” Finch—is the same, except this time, all grown up at age 26, the vocabulary finally fits the speaker.  (Lee’s Scout of TKAM always spoke from a lexicon far beyond her age, only justified by the manner in which her lawyer father had taught her to read.)  The same feisty personality and quirky persona emerge from the pages, so true to life one feels she is listening to Harper Lee herself and not the thinly masked spokesperson she created to hide behind years ago.  Jem is already dead, astonishingly, and Dill is off somewhere in Europe; Boo Radley isn’t mentioned and other favorite minor characters are barely identified, no longer necessary to the immediate plot.  Jean Louise (as she is now more commonly called), back to Maycomb for a visit from New York City where she has been living, has a bonafide boyfriend, one Henry (Hank) Clinton, who, if he were mentioned as the lifetime friend he has become in the first book, I don’t recall. Clearly Lee’s disposition not to marry guides her protagonist’s decision to turn down his persistent proposals, one of the few actions that occur in the couple of days the narrator shares with the reader.<br/><br/>That short space of time and the lack of any “real” action immediately relegate the latter novel to second place when compared to TKAM’s time span of several years, with multiple sub-plots intertwining beneath the primary spotlight on the Robinson trial. That Lee can depend on her readers to be familiar with her heretofore established setting and characters justifies to some degree the sparseness of the second book, and although she succumbs to some flashbacks to the original story, it is to her credit that she has kept such repetitiveness to a minimum.  (The probability that Watchman was written prior to Mockingbird is immaterial, as the reader’s access to the stories is the only logical consideration here.)<br/><br/>What does happen, though, is as significant to the older protagonist and her readers as were the famous themes derived from the plotline of the first published book.  That these messages are, perhaps, more apropos for today’s audience than even Lee’s initial lessons (so fitting for the 60s) is what makes the timing of publication so canny.  It also allows Go Set a Watchman to take its rightful place beside its famous predecessor as an equally significant contribution to contemporary American literature.<br/><br/>So what happens?  Jean Louise eavesdrops on her saintly Atticus as he attends a local council meeting in which the problem of segregation is being addressed. What makes this surreptitious knowledge so remarkable is that it convinces Scout of her father’s prejudice, a revelation that shocks both her and the reader, having come to believe Atticus Finch is the one white man in the South who is color-blind.  Jumping to angry conclusions of her racist, hypocrite of a father, she eventually confronts Atticus, dragging him down from the marble pedestal on which she placed him long ago and tearing him into bits of human flesh and blood.  He allows her tirade, while trying to reason with her, telling her “plain truths” so she can “see things as they are, as well as they should be” (243).<br/><br/>Reminding Jean Louise of the compatibility Maycomb’s races were accustomed to, he points out the unrest the NAACP is causing, stirring up resentments where there were none, and insisting on immediate advancements the Negro people as a whole are not yet properly prepared to take on.  When she tries to counter that the African-Americans are entitled to these promises, Atticus is astute in informing her of the NAACP’s primary objective:  “The NAACP doesn’t care whether a Negro man owns or rents his land,” he says, “how well he can farm, or whether or not he tries to learn a trade and stand on his own two feet—oh no, all the NAACP cares about is that man’s vote” (247).<br/><br/>Insert your favorite race-baiter in the public eye today for “NAACP,” and the relevance for today’s society is obvious.  And for those today still fighting over the Confederacy and its flag, Lee (writing in 1950) is clairvoyant in following the trail of bread crumbs  back to the Civil War.  When Scout engages her Uncle Jack in the debate, he cites a similar hastiness on the parts of the abolitionists whose insistence on immediate emancipation pushed a precarious situation prematurely over the brink into utter disaster, a chaos the South had been trying to clean up ever since, all the while forcing their Southern brothers to bear full responsibility for the sin of slavery.<br/><br/>For those who maintain the Civil War was fought over States’ Rights, Lee’s voice is their own, as even Scout comes to admit her reluctance at accepting anything when forced to do so.  Reminds me of a t-shirt I’ve seen recently on sale depicting a Confederate flag with the slogan:  “Just because you said I couldn’t.”  That’s basic human nature: no one wants to be forced to do anything, even if it’s the right thing to do; and no one wants to be told what the right thing is by those who don’t really have a dog in the fight.  The arrogance of the uninvolved and unaffected telling those in the pool how to swim from the safety of the shore is insult to injury.  A little knowledge is a dangerous thing, Lee intimates, especially when such arrogant ignorance results in such damage.<br/><br/>If for no other reason, everyone needs to consider things from the other person’s viewpoint, or, as Lee put it in her first book, “climb in their skin and walk around.”  And if for no other reason than that, one needs to read her second book to hear all sides of the argument.  Maybe then, armed with more information, we can all bring something to the table and respect each other enough to have a conversation that leads to compromise and healing.<br/><br/>The saddest scene in Go Set a Watchman occurs when Jean Louise goes to visit Calpurnia, the elderly black woman who practically raised the motherless Scout.  Jean Louise hardly recognizes her old friend when she realizes Cal barely recognizes her, either, compounded by the interference caused by the current racial unrest.  The confrontation is rescued—barely—when a heartbroken Scout demands if Cal hated them—the white Finch family—and the old woman at last shakes her head “no.”  If situations were left to individuals to personally deal with whatever inequity exists, without the demanding outside interference of, well, outsiders, perhaps the least amount of destruction would take place.  It’s certainly worth trying.  Nothing else seems to be working very well.<br/><br/>I was determined to dislike Lee’s second book, suspecting her reluctance to publish and threaten her literary status as Queen of American literature.  Fortunately, I allowed reason and evidence to dissolve my preconceptions.  I hope other readers will do the same.<br/><br/>–Rebecca Luttrell Briley, Ph.D.
Of course this book was not going to reach the expectations of those of us who are worshippers of To Kill a Mockingbird.  However, I still think it is a great book because it made me think and is timeless in nature on so many levels. It has not tarnished my view of Mockingbird or Atticus Finch, so I am relieved. I am one of the many who consider Mockingbird one of the greatest masterpieces of all time and Atticus Finch is certainly one of literature’s greatest heroes. Yet, I am not disappointed by Atticus’ portrayal like many are.  In fact, it makes me understand him and myself a lot better. Like a biblical story, Mockingbird makes seeing and teaching the right thing easy.  When Atticus does the right thing, it is not the easy thing. He puts his own life and the lives of his children in danger to defend a black man.  In contrast, Go Set a Watchman does not make Atticus into an obvious hero and Jean Louise, now feisty and angry, is not the adorable little girl who doesn’t quite get just how magnificent her father is.  Watchman makes you consider that Atticus’ actions in Mockingbird were more about the law and less about any specific cause. How a person feels about Watchman has a lot to do with what a person thinks is the predominant message of Mockingbird. I have always believed Mockingbird’s most interesting message was the importance of putting community at the same level, or even above, your family. We forget sometimes in this debate over Watchman that a great portion of Mockingbird was about Boo Radley and the Southern caste system, not just the trial. To me, Watchman’s message was consistent with that same message, but admittedly less idealistic.  If you saw Mockingbird as a fight against racism and justice primarily, Watchman may be more disappointing to you.<br/>  While I can appreciate the disappointment many have in the perceived fall of the great Atticus Finch, I don’t fully agree with it. In fact, I don’t completely understand the descriptions of Atticus as a racist.  You have to put the book not only in historical context, but also in geographical context.  Atticus puts his community above everything. He taught his children to consider things from another’s point of view. Uncle Jack asks Jean Louise to consider the motives of people before labeling them. Couldn’t we all learn something from that?  Although some of Atticus’ comments are deeply disappointing, he is still liberal as compared to the people of his community. He is trying to help them to survive the changes that are happening to his community – mostly initiated by outsiders who don’t understand the South and the rules that they live by.  Watchman makes important social commentary about a different time period. A more complicated time period. It’s easy for us to say “end racism” and harder for us to actually live with it after it happens – at least in the initial phases. This reminds me a lot of the Confederate flag debate actually.  As President Obama deftly pointed out, we can take down a flag, but it doesn’t change the hearts of the people.  Many of us fight for things that are easy to fight for. We get on our high horses about the moral integrity of a flag, but fail to do the things that are true sacrifices. Marching against police brutality or debating the moral question  of a Confederate flag does not necessarily present any sacrifice to a person of privilege. Watchman reminds us that in order to have true equality, those will privilege must be willing to give up something that they have. This is the hard part. This is what a pragmatic (albeit biased by modern standards) Atticus is trying to explain to an idealistic Scout. I don’t agree with Watchman’s Atticus, but I think his dialogue with Scout is an important one.
Many previous reviewers have detailed the history of this manuscript, its literary flaws, and its highly misleading marketing as a Mockingbird sequel.<br/><br/>Let's look beyond its literary merit or lack thereof. As a snapshot of Southern life in the mid 1950s, I think Watchman should be required reading for every American who really wants to understand the culture and attitudes of our own South, especially in light of recent events throughout the country e.g. police violence toward black citizens and the controversies over the Confederate battle flag.<br/><br/>The book is almost casual in its depiction of the abject day to day degradation of black people during this time period. "The Help" is a pleasant, sanitized romp in comparison.<br/><br/>Although Jean Louise/Scout is the most progressive person in her town by far and describes herself as "colorblind", even her ingrained racism is hard for a modern reader to take in. This for me was the most enlightening aspect of the book-- that extreme racism was so subtly entrenched. It helps me understand why many African Americans say they still suffer almost daily prejudice, and by no means is this limited to the South, nor was it ever. Jean Louise (clearly an autobiographical character) reminds me of the condescension of the Northern abolitionists.<br/><br/>At the same time, Lee's rough but heartfelt manuscript gave me a better understanding of the amorphous "culture" that some Southerners cling to. Having Atticus Finch himself speak for it dispelled the angry redneck stereotype in my mind. To be clear, however, this book gave me no sympathy for this position -- it just humanized its proponents.<br/><br/>As many other reviewers have noted, when taken in context this is a very worthwhile read. In my opinion, those who boycott it because they don't want to see Atticus knocked off his pedestal are taking a narrow view of the very issues Lee wanted us to explore.
I finished reading Go Set a Watchman three days ago. As I read it and as I finished it, I wasn't sure what I thought of it or what my review of it would be. I have never been able to come to a conclusion or make a snap judgement and I knew that it would take time to digest what I thought of it.  So here is my best attempt.<br/><br/>First of all, if you see or hear anyone refer to Go Set a Watchman as a sequel, they are just plain wrong.  It is not a sequel.  It is not finishing the story of what happened in To Kill a Mockingbird.  There are many things in Go Set a Watchman that do not line up with the facts of To Kill a Mockingbird, therefore, they are two separate attempts at telling stories, both with the same characters but each book going in a very different direction.  Remember that Go Set a Watchman was the first novel written, the first attempt Harper Lee gave to writing a book. If I understand what I have read about it all correctly, Harper Lee wrote Go Set a Watchman and her editor/publisher said what you need to do is take this story and write it from the perspective of Scout as a child as she remembers things as she grew up. It is easy to see why the publisher chose to encourage Harper Lee in that direction because in many parts of Go Set a Watchman, Lee flashes back to childhood memories Scout has and those are hands down the best parts of the book.  For some reason, when Harper Lee flashed back to Scout as a child and shared stories and memories, her writing was amazing and held you, just like it does in To Kill a Mockingbird. Whoever encouraged Harper Lee to take that voice and run with it--bless them! They saw the magic in those parts of Go Set a Watchman and because of that, we were all blessed with the marvelous book To Kill a Mockingbird. For that reason alone, it is worth reading Go Set a Watchman.  To see where the story started and how To Kill a Mockingbird was born.  It is extremely clear that Go Set a Watchman was a first attempt because the first chapters of both Go Set a Watchman and To Kill a Mockingbird have large portions that are word for word identical. <br/><br/>Honestly, Go Set a Watchman seemed unfinished, unedited. It felt like I was reading a manuscript of a novel that hadn't been fleshed out completely, hadn't gone to the editor, nor been completely organized into a final draft.  There were parts of it I found just plain dull. There were parts where I felt the author was just trying too darn hard to be philosophic and deep and it came off confusing and lame. Parts of it felt like rantings of a girl writing in her diary about her frustrations with different relationships and differences of opinions.  There were parts of it that gripped me and shook me around, that made me uncomfortable.  That shows that the author is doing a good job! There were parts where I loved it and a couple parts did make me emotional.  I did cry at the end.  But now that it has been a few days, I keep thinking that I didn't finish the book because there was so much that didn't have a conclusion for me. Like there wasn't closure in the places I wanted there to be.  And that's where I feel like it was an unfinished, unedited novel.  It had a lot of potential. It had a lot of great ideas and great moments.  But it just wasn't quite there.  I don't know how it went, but I envision that Harper Lee wasn't finished with Go Set a Watchman and that when she followed the advice to write from the perspective of Scout as a child, she started over and it just came together.  It's like she had so much she wanted to say, so much she wanted to cover and wasn't sure how to do it.  For some reason, when she went in the new direction of To Kill a Mockingbird, she tapped into the magic.  She unleashed the genius of writing that was in there but didn't know how to come out.  <br/><br/>My husband asked me if I regretted reading Go Set a Watchman and my answer is no. I know that many people have been upset because Go Set a Watchman "ruined" the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird for them.  It didn't do that for me because they are completely separate books and stories in my mind. I will be honest.  I was very, very hesitant to even read Go Set a Watchman because I was worried it would ruin the whole magical world of Scout and Jem for me. I was worried when people said that Atticus was a racist that joined the Klan. I worried I'd never see him any other way.  But there was a lot more to it than that. It wasn't just as simple as "Atticus is racist".  People who claim that either didn't read it all or chose to gloss over the reasons behind it.  I don't think it's even worth arguing the politics that are presented in Go Set a Watchman. They were kind of all over the place.  <br/><br/>Since I was 16, I have read To Kill a Mockingbird every October. There are 31 chapters in To Kill a Mockingbird.  There are 31 days in October. I finish reading the last chapter on Halloween and if you have read To Kill a Mockingbird then you know why that is a treat in itself to read the final chapters near and on Halloween.  I will read it again this October and it will make me cry in all the same places and make me laugh in all the same places and it won't be tainted or influenced whatsoever by Go Set a Watchman and for that I am grateful. It was a gamble to read Go Set a Watchman, knowing that there was a possibility it would forever ruin my To Kill a Mockingbird crush, but the gamble paid off and now I not only got to see the origins of To Kill a Mockingbird, I still get to enjoy it thoroughly.  <br/><br/>This Spring, I drove to Monroeville, Alabama with my two children.  When we visited Monroeville, Nelle Harper Lee's original home had been torn down and in its place is an ice cream shop called Mel's Dairy Dream.  In Go Set a Watchman, Scout's childhood home had been torn down and in it's place was an ice cream shop.  From what I could tell, Mel's Dairy Dream came to be in 1982, long after Go Set a Watchman was written.  So is it just coincidence that both childhood homes, real and fictional, were torn down and made into an ice cream place?  A mystery that will deliciously (the ice cream was good) haunt me! 
I read Go Set a Watchman with trepidation. To Kill a Mockingbird is an all-time favorite book, and Atticus Finch is an all-time favorite character. Early reviews suggested that Harper Lee’s follow-up tale wasn’t so easy on lawyer Finch.<br/><br/>That To Kill a Mockingbird grew out of this manuscript surprises me. Quite interesting that Watchman was penned before To Kill a Mockingbird and this aging portrayal of Atticus became the genesis of our middle-aged hero. To go from this older Atticus to that younger Atticus took some remarkable dexterity and imagination.<br/><br/>It’s not all easy reading. Lee wrote this before To Kill a Mockingbird and Mockingbird was first published in 1960.  So she wrote this at the very height of American racial tensions. As such, the book reflects an uncomfortable time and culture. Some of the thoughts and language are highly offensive today. Some of those thoughts and language are attributed to Atticus Finch and it feels contradictory to his well-known persona.<br/><br/>But that observation is some 60 years after the fact. If we accept that these ideas had life at that time, and that small southern towns struggled in that world of change, then it makes sense that citizens – even the most thoughtful and heroic citizens – grappled with those same ideas. Perhaps even tried them out or adopted them for a time. That doesn’t justify them in any way, but maybe it helps explain them. Reprehensible as they are, Lee’s discomfort with them is clearly the foundation of this story.<br/><br/>And she built a unique coming of age narrative from that uncomfortable foundation. Scout is uncomfortable as an outsider, and uncomfortable as an insider. Having now read both books, it’s apparent that Harper Lee understood the racial discomfort of those times and used story-telling genius to bring readers along. In a sense, her brilliance is a reflection of unique experience, empathy, and perspective.<br/><br/>According to her publishers, an astute editor lifted the childhood flashback scenes from Watchman and suggested they become the basis of Mockingbird. It is easy to see why. Those scenes are the very best in Watchman. There’s one delightful scene where Scout, Jem, and Dill are re-enacting a religious revival, with hilarious results. It is as good as anything in the beloved Mockingbird.<br/><br/>This book is not To Kill a Mockingbird, however, but that still doesn’t bother me. Literally millions of other books can’t scale that monumental measure. Yet, this story felt real to me and I enjoyed a glimpse or two of genuine Harper Lee brilliance. It is a glimpse I never expected to see and I’m very grateful for this chance.
I was greatly anticipating this book, much like everyone else, and I'm really happy I decided to read it right when it came out. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books. That said, I'm glad I decided not to reread it before tackling Watchman. The truth of the matter is, while these two books focus on the same family, they are two very different books, and should be treated as such. When knowing about the order in which they were written, and how Watchman was sort of an earlier draft to Mockingbird, many of the realities about the two books begin to make sense. Many people have been critical of Watchman for portraying Atticus as a racist, whereas in Mockingbird he is seen as a hero in the area of race relations.<br/><br/>And even though this is all fiction, and who know what Harper Lee really intended, I think I might be in the minority to think that I'm actually kind of glad that Atticus was portrayed so differently here. The way he acts in Watchman, racist, stubborn, but still overall a loving and supportive father, is a realistic expectation of a seventy-two year old southern man living in Alabama in the 1950s. People change, and it's not always in the best ways. I think comparing the two books is fine to some extent, but for the most part I read Watchman without thinking too much about Mockingbird, and I think that's why I was able to enjoy it.<br/><br/>The best parts of it are certainly the flashbacks to Jean Louise's time as a young girl, when everyone called her Scout. The one chapter about when she thinks she's pregnant because a boy French kissed her is a particular highlight. While these are arguably the most entertaining parts of the book, which goes to show that Lee's editor had great foresight in asking her to write a book from Scout's perspective as a young girl, the parts of Scout as an adult were also entertaining. Jean Louise is exactly the kind of person I would imagine Scout to grow up to be. Lee does have a harness on her characters, and their emotions and desires ring true, regardless of whether or not other readers agree with how they have been portrayed in this second novel.<br/><br/>I recommend it, and am glad that I read it. It's not as good as Mockingbird, but it is still strong in its own right. I think that the fact that this book now exists and can stand alongside Mockingbird is a good thing, and does nothing to tarnish the literary merit of Lee's legacy. In fact, I think it only strengthens it.
I'd first say that it would be better, if you haven't read the book, to avoid the reviews.  I did so because I wanted to judge the book on it's own merits, rather than coming into it with expectations taken from the opinions of others. I only read them after I finished the book.<br/><br/>Again, if you haven't read it, please don't continue reading my opinion.<br/><br/>I think Harper Lee has delivered a very complex book.  Themes abound, states rights, social status (locally and nationally), race relations, religion, constitutional law, personal relationships, ones relationship to their past, progress, the Civil War.  It goes on and on.  I personally feel that ultimately, the story is one of a southern woman finding her voice.  The flashbacks may at first seem out of place, but they build on Scouts journey from tomboy to womanhood.  A very difficult path for her that, in this book, she did not fully realize.  In other reviews and opinions I've read, I've seen no mention of the very obvious themes of the father/daughter relationship and the roll of women in society, particularly southern society.  Scout is disgusted by the attitudes of married women of her age who worship their husbands, but the climax of the book highlights her worship of her father.  Only the intense and concerted efforts of her father and her uncle can deliver her from the insignificance she despises about her peers.  It was interesting to me that Atticus' stated opinions of "Negroes" mirror exactly his approach to "freeing" his daughter, and that it took a slap in the mouth from a man to stun Scout back to reality.  Whether or not Scout fully breaks free from the male dominance, we may never know.  Lee leaves us hanging.  Perhaps in anticipation of the further adventures of Miss Jean Louise Finch.<br/><br/>I found that it started slowly, but not so slow that I lost interest.  Scout is a terrific character and Lee stayed true to the person I fell in love with in To Kill a Mockingbird.  She remains high spirited and ready for a fight.  Atticus has been taking a beating in reviews because of his stated beliefs and some may blame Lee for destroying his character.  I find the opposite true.  I think he is exactly the man of conviction I expected him to be.  Whether or not his views are popular is immaterial, in my opinion.  I find him to be a man of his times and cannot hold that against him.  For those who will condemn him, I'd point out that Lee not only anticipated that reaction, she delivered exactly the tone of voice that would accompany that condemnation.<br/><br/>If it's true that this book was written in 1957, and I have no reason to believe it wasn't, I can understand why the editors chose not to publish it.  Even today it can be a difficult book to read.  Harper Lee, in this book, has revealed to me that she had a firm grip on the complexities of American life, our history, social structure and prevailing attitudes.  To think that she wrote this at such a young age is just remarkable.<br/><br/>Thank you Harper Lee, for giving me so much to think about.  God Bless you.
I will make no attempt to compare this book with TKAM because this was a mere outline for a book while the other became a fully-fleshed masterpiece, but knowing this ahead of time made me appreciate this book all the more.<br/><br/>I found myself amazed at how timely the publication of this book is, with the current battle over those who refuse to give up their Confederate flags on one side and those calling the Confederates and their progeny traitors on the other.<br/><br/>As a Northerner by birth and heritage, I could simply not understand why Southerners would want to identify with roots which to me represented the worst of American history: slave ownership, racism and secession. For the past month, every time I saw a Confederate symbol displayed or used as an avatar, it set my teeth on edge.<br/><br/>Then, to pick up this book (on the very day of its publication and arrival at the public library), I was even more disturbed to find that the upstanding Atticus Finch was a racist at worst and one who was willing to compromise with evil at best. I shared all of Scout’s anger, disappointment and vitriol and at that point, I knew I was hooked and that I was reading a book that may not have been the masterpiece that To Kill a Mockingbird was, but a literary marvel in its own right. Lee’s prescience in writing this book before TKAM was almost eerie, and her conclusion, while not entirely satisfactory to me, displayed that working from within to change attitudes can be as valuable in the long term as the endless racial and military wars this country has fought. I am just now beginning to appreciate that we are not and never have been one country under God. I will always identify with the righteous North, but now I have at least a glimpse of why the South will always be “the other” in these supposedly United States.
There’s been a lot of buzz about the controversies surrounding this book—regarding the timing and nature of its release, and the shocking reveals in the book itself, particularly the discovery that Atticus Finch, one of the most idolized characters in American literature, is a racist. Even though I pre-ordered the book, I worried that I’d risk ruining To Kill a Mockingbird for myself. However, when I received my copy on release day, I accepted that Go Set a Watchman was now in the hands of the public, for better or worse, and I decided I would make every effort to put aside all the controversies and read it on its own merits. To try and make of it anything more or less than what it is would be unfair to the author, in my opinion.<br/><br/>And to my surprise, I ended up really liking Go Set a Watchman. I just started reading it a second time, in fact, the better to appreciate it.<br/><br/>In the hope that I might help another reader decide whether or not to crack open this book, here are some of the things I kept in mind while reading:<br/>• In his review for The Guardian, Mark Lawson says, “The first problem in assessing Harper Lee’s first published novel in the five and a half decades since To Kill a Mockingbird is whether to describe it as her first or second book. … Chronologically, Go Set a Watchman is, in Hollywood arithmetic, a sort of Mockingbird 2, depicting the later lives of the Finch family … However, in computing terms, Watchman is Mockingbird 1.0 to the Mockingbird 2.0 of the novel that was previously the 89-year-old Lee’s single published work.” I decided to take the Mockingbird 1.0 view.<br/>• I thought of Watchman as a fascinating artifact from a parallel universe: What if Harper Lee’s editors had chosen to work with this draft—polish it up, revise the structure and pacing, but retain the basic storyline—instead of urging Lee to do a complete rewrite, which eventually became To Kill a Mockingbird?<br/>• The Bible verse the title is taken from sets the theme of the book. Isaiah 21:6 (KJV) says, “For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.” This isn’t very telling, but it came together for me in verse 9: “And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.” It did help to find out ahead of time that Atticus is revealed as a racist, because it certainly was a shock. Reading this passage from Isaiah also helped. I understood immediately that Babylon for Jean Louise (Scout) Finch is her beloved Maycomb, and the “graven images,” or idols, are the godly pedestals upon which she put all her loved ones, particularly her father Atticus and her childhood friend Hank.<br/><br/>And here are the merits I appreciated in Go Set a Watchman:<br/>• This is not just a story about Jean Louise uncovering her beloved Atticus as a flawed human being; more broadly, this is a story about a young woman experiencing the painful but necessary transition of becoming her own person. I really identified with this aspect of Watchman.<br/>• The overall tone of Watchman, perhaps heavy-handed at times but no less truthful, is the old adage, “You can never go home again.” Before the big reveal about Atticus’ racist views, Jean Louise realizes upon coming home from New York for a visit that her gilt-edged childhood memories of Maycomb do not match up to what greets her in the present. One of my favorite passages is a conversation about Jean Louise’s discovery that a favorite haunt, Finch’s Landing, no longer belongs to her family but has been sold off to a hunting club. Childhood friend Hank teases Jean Louise about her disappointment: “I believe you are the worst of the lot. Mr. Finch is seventy-two years young and you’re a hundred years old when it comes to something like this.” To which Jean Louise replies: “I just don’t like my world disturbed without some warning.”<br/>• Although there is a lot of alienation and pain in this story, there are also many delightful moments in which Lee reveals a fondness for the South in which she grew up. Another favorite passage of mine is when Jean Louise returns to an ice cream shop after recognizing its owner as Mr. Cunningham: “She was sitting at a table behind Mr. Cunningham’s ice cream shop, eating from a wax-paper container. Mr. Cunningham, a man of uncompromising rectitude, had given her a pint free of charge for having guessed his name yesterday, one of the tiny things she adored about Maycomb: people remembered their promises.” I love details like this, and as a Southerner I also enjoyed Lee’s vivid sketches of the Maycomb people, which rang true to me.<br/>• Watchman contains some heartwarming flashbacks with Jem, Dill, and Calpurnia, as well as a couple of telling scenes about Jean Louise’s early friendship with Hank. Yes, the flashbacks are a bit jarring to the flow and pacing, but recognizing that Watchman is not a fully polished final draft, I still treasured these scenes as precious insights into beloved characters I never imagined I’d be able to read in my lifetime.<br/>• As Michiko Kakutani points out in her review for The New York Times, “One of the emotional through-lines in both ‘Mockingbird’ and ‘Watchman’ is a plea for empathy … The difference is that ‘Mockingbird’ suggested that we should have compassion for outsiders like Boo and Tom Robinson, while ‘Watchman’ asks us to have understanding for a bigot named Atticus.” What I got from reading Watchman is that while Atticus is still Atticus in many of the ways readers have adored him for decades, he is very much a flawed, prejudiced human being. Watchman does not in any way excuse Atticus’ racist views toward African-Americans, but it does encourage the reader, along with Jean Louise, to take Mr. Finch down from the godly pedestal and understand him as a mortal. I believe Lee is also urging readers to look inside ourselves and realize we all harbor prejudices of some kind.
I had to give myself a couple of days to digest this one fully before writing a review. If I could, I think I would rate this 3.5 out of 5 stars. As To Kill a Mockingbird is a favorite novel of mine and one that I would (and eventually will!) reread many times over, I knew I had to read Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman. Set in the mid-1950 against the backdrop of the earliest events of the civil rights movement in America, the story centers around Jean Louise (aka Scout) Finch returning home to visit her father in Maycomb, Alabama as a grown woman of 26. Scout soon realizes that the truths she has always held about her family and her hometown may not be so true anymore. Her visit home morphs into inner turmoil, as she tries to come to terms with the idea that the father she thought she knew so well might not be the man she has revered for all her life.<br/><br/>Described by Harper Lee herself as the 'parent' of To Kill a Mockingbird, there are definitely some passages in Go Set a Watchman that were extremely similar to passages in To Kill a Mockingbird. And there is also the feeling that you are reading a first or unfinalized draft--the pacing is off in some places, although the prose in others is just as wonderful as in To Kill a Mockingbird. Because I have loved her since she was a precocious eight-year-old, I did enjoy reading Scout's development into an independent and opinionated young woman (I did think it was interesting that this novel was written in the third person though). However, if I had not read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed her character in this book as much. I can see why Lee's publishers told her to write a version of Scout that focused on her childhood, because Scout's memories of her childhood and teenage years were some of the most compelling passages of the book.<br/><br/>Dealing with the fact that one's parents are 'real' people with ideas that may or may not coincide with one's own is a hard pill to swallow for some adult children. As the reader, I did feel let down and disillusioned right along with Scout as she uncovers truths about how Atticus feels about the civil rights movement in the country. But I thought the explanations of why Atticus and the people in this small Southern town had their opinions about the issues of the day did make some sense, given the time period and the "recentness" of the Civil War and Reconstruction, in the eyes of the South. I would recommend reading this if you've already read To Kill a Mockingbird and enjoyed it. If you have not read To Kill a Mockingbird yet, go read it now! :) It is the better book, in my opinion. I am glad that I read Go Set a Watchman. Reading this parent novel deepened my understanding of and love for the character of Scout, and it certainly had a few captivating events and passages.
I have never read To Kill a Mockingbird<br/><br/>Till earlier this week, unlike most of you who started out there reading career with this book in high school or junior high, I came at it from the other side.  After reading thousands of books then going back and reading what some people consider their favorite novel.  Then I went on immediately to read, Go Set a Watchman (stop here if you don’t want spoilers).<br/><br/>Both are novels of their time with many of the same characters, one told through the eyes of an intelligent observant little girl over the period of a couple of years, a coming of age story.  The other over a period of a couple of days of the same girl, 26 and a bit jaded who comes home to visit after living years in New York.<br/><br/>In Mockingbird, Atticus through her eyes is an almost supernatural being of good whom always has the most ethical response to any given issue and young impressionable Scout takes that into herself.  The novel was richly worded with descriptions that made you think of hot summers spent on the porch, how children viewed the world around them.<br/><br/>In Watchman, Scout comes home and her illusions are torn away, the civil rights movement is just starting and people in her hometown are taking sides which are divided along color lines.  Scout is way ahead of her time, she was raised by Atticus and tends to see people as people, not color but in that time and place, color and social status are everything.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed Watchman, it seems like Harper Lee didn’t write it for our enjoyment, she wrote it to document a portion of her life.  It’s not as polished and for fans who hold To Kill a Mockingbird in their hearts, portions of it are painful and raw, Scout has grown up, she’s not much of a lady but she carried the values that were taught to her as a little girl into adulthood and now she’s seeing her small southern town with eyes that have seen the world and is not a happy camper.<br/><br/>She is the moral compass of this story and at the end, you don’t know where she is going in life.  The case against Tom Robinson is mentioned but it says it’s an acquittal in Watchman.  Jem, who is such a pivotal character in Mockingbird has died young, Dill is off in some foreign land and Boo didn’t make the cut.  This fills in the story but I’m not sure if it offers actual answers.<br/><br/>Mockingbird rings with Robert McCammon’s Boy’s Life and Watchman reminds me of all of the times I went home and that life had continued on without me, people growing up and changing and living their own lives, not the snapshot I carried of that place I grew up in my head.
“Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends.”  I have read several reviews of this book and went in anticipating that I would not like it. Now that I’ve finished, I cannot say that I loved it (at least not as much as I loved Ms. Lee’s 2nd novel), but I can say that I would read it again, would love to be part of an intelligent book discussion on it, and will highly recommend it to everyone I know.<br/><br/>Two things to consider as you read this book – and as you read reviews about this book. 1. This story, as well as Ms. Harper Lee, is set firmly in the deep South of mid-20th century; therefore it is not fair to review it with 21st century eyes, especially if the reviewer is, a) younger than, say, 50 years of age, and b) does not have life experiences from the deep South. (Since I was born in the early 50s and spent many of my formative years growing up on a cotton farm in the delta of Mississippi, this book may take on more meaning for me. Add to that that the first real novel I ever read in elementary school, which had a profound impact on my worldview, was Harper Lee’s 2nd novel.) and 2. Although written over half a century ago, the content of this book speaks volumes into the political and racial conflicts being waged in 2015 United States. One might set back in amazement that this book was finally released just a couple of weeks after the State of North Carolina removed the confederate flag from it’s statehouse; thus making the reading of this novel as timely today  - maybe more so – than when first written.<br/><br/>A final note: I loved the flashback stories peppered throughout this book! They are engaging and woven of the same cloth as To Kill a Mockingbird. One may cozy up to these vignettes and be transported back into the innocent coming-of-age of Scout, and Jem, and Atticus.
The benefit of being bedridden for a bit is having the luxury of spending the day reading and so I finished "Go Set A Watchman'- Harper Lee's previously unpublished first manuscript. .  I can tell you that it reads  as a sequel to  the much beloved "To Kill A Mockingbird"<br/>Some of the authors best passages are Scout's reveries of her childhood in Maycomb. It allows us to revisit Jem,Dill, Henry and she references Miss Duboise, and Miss Rachel. We get to catch up with Calpurnia , Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack. .<br/>Jean Louise relives the  rape trial of Tom Robinson which made Atticus such an iconic hero to  us all. Oddly there is no mention of The Boo Radley incident and no sightings of the beneficent recluse.<br/> We don't like to see our heroic figures toppled and I will admit to gritting my teeth , shaking my head and being incredulous at some of what appears to be schizophrenic behavior on Atticus' part.  His belief system and language seem  totally at odds with the man who we always associate with this quote<br/>"“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view … until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.--"<br/>Is he a racist and perhaps most of all a hypocrite?<br/>In this novel Scout returns and we quickly realize she has internalized all of her dad's wisdom and lessons learned while sitting on his lap and watching him from a balcony in a courthouse...<br/>For those of us who have idolized a parent and put them on a pedestal---this is the painful moment when we have to come to terms with that they are not super heroes...They are flawed human beings.<br/>Through a brutal confrontation with Atticus--Scout not only reveals her dad's shortcomings and incongruities but reveals some painful truths.<br/>Lee has really fleshed out Scout's Uncle-Dr. Jack Finch in this sequel and he is a wonderment and Scout's cryptic guide through a confusing maze of past and present to achieve autonomy. .<br/> This book's hero is really Scout the feminist.  She is her father's daughter but  in order for her to really assume her rightful place in the adult  world----must  become her own person. To achieve that, Scout is forced to adjust the lens with which she  views those she  loved and  idolized  with the maturity of  life experience.<br/>Does Atticus have a horrendous fall from grace or does Harper Lee in truth just humanize him and make him more a man of his place and time.?<br/>In answer to everyone's curiosity about the harm the publication of this book will do to  the author and to someone so many children considered an ally and champion of human rights--- I will say--that there were moments in this book--that I would shield my former students from. They are ugly and soul-killing.<br/><br/>I think about how all my middle schoolers became so immersed in the reading of "To Kill A Mockingbird"and every semester I presided over our Maycomb town meeting  on the eve of the Robinson rape trial where we all inhabited characters from Maycomb---the good the bad and the ugly--so we could walk around in their skin and understand how they truly felt-----I was always Atticus--the voice of reason....<br/>I think I would not put this book on the reading list and I am going to have to get inside this Atticus' head and walk around in his skin for awhile to make sense  of how these two Atticus' can co-exist...
It is too easy to follow the usual, breathless press account, where Scout discovers that Atticus is a closet racist. This book is truer than that.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>There are definitely rough patches in this novel. It is not a finished project, and I could see several places that needed re-working with an editor's help. But in some ways, the novel's roughness is part of the honesty and the appeal. You can see the author's struggle to deal with the complex issues presented in the book. The author clearly never reaches a conclusion that was personally satisfying, as further evidenced by Lee's objection to publishing the novel. The dissonance is evident in Watchman, and may end up being the most powerful and thought-provoking aspect of the book.<br/><br/>Jean Louise (Scout) is claimed to be "color blind" at several locations in the book. That may even be the way she sees herself, and certainly her thirst for justice is something that most modern readers will identify with. But her own sense of white privilege is on full display with her surprise to the reaction she gets when she visits Cal's home, or when she talks of the black population of Maycomb as if they were ignorant children who needed to be led.The NAACP is viewed as a bunch of outsiders who are just stirring things up and preventing the benevolent whites from slowly guiding the black residents to a capability to handle full citizenship.  (On a personal level, the arguments in Chapter 17 echoed arguments made by a South African white acquaintance in the 1980s.) Then there is the revelation that Atticus' playing footsie with the KKK and the Citizens' Council was completely understandable because he was supposedly just there to act as a moderating influence. Jean Louise does call out this argument as ignoring the fact that his (and Henry's) presence lent credibility to the proceedings, but this entire theme is left unexplored.<br/><br/>I'm glad I read this book, and it is likely to make me think about some aspects of life in the modern South for a long time to come. Hopefully enough people will take something from this book to make people think twice about the modern South's war on black voting rights.
I had assumed from the discussion surrounding the book's release that I would find the book had elements that were just too controversial in 1960 for publication. I should have realized that if Strange Fruit could have been published in 1947,  that was hardly a logical scenario.  I assumed Alice Lee had locked it away to protect their father's reputation. I now think it's more likely that she did it because it just wasn't as good as the work she knew her sister could produce.  And maybe she was clear-sighted about the prejudices inherent in the family tale.<br/>It's hard not to be an elitist when the entire world seems to say that you are better than other people. Comments have abounded about the shock of discovering that Atticus Finch is a racist. Of course, it is inevitable. What I found more revelatory was that the adult Scout, despite her sojourn in New York has no discernible enlightened attitudes. She not only is a state's rights segregationist, but also seems to largely embrace her aunt's perceptions about "our kind" of people, which excludes white trash, even when transformed by education and hard work.<br/>But for me the most significant revelation came with Calpurnia. Amazing! For once the faithful family retainer has turned. It's partly because she's old and no longer dependent upon the Finches (except for the reality that her family still has to be subservient) that she can be true to herself. No, Scout is not her baby, and is not really that important to her. She knows she's not "like family." She knows that Atticus will not fight for justice for her grandson, though he will put on a show of concern. And she no longer cares enough to preserve Scout's illusion of the kind black woman whose only real purpose in life was to care for Scout, Jem and their father.<br/>The editors who worked with Harper Lee to transform this into To Kill a Mockingbird did us all a great service. By seeing this world through the eyes of a young girl, we discern great truths. Here the truth is laid out in a form that leaves us only wishing that the world was better.
Yes, I really liked this book, but (no surprise here) not nearly as much as I liked To Kill a Mockingbird. And I suppose, because it's supposedly Harper Lee's first effort at a novel, and because, she is after all, Harper Lee, I'm willing to forgive some of the novel's transgressions.<br/><br/>To sum up, Jean Louise Finch, known to everyone as Scout, returns to Maycomb, Alabama to visit her 72 year old father, now living with his sister and crippled by arthritis. Now living in New York, Jean Louise finds herself seeing her hometown and the people in it with different eyes. She feels an outsider among the people she's known all her life, including her childhood sweetheart, Hank, who wants to marry her.<br/><br/>It's the mid 1950s, not too long after the Supreme Court's famous Brown vs the Board of Education decision, which declared segregation unconstitutional. The NAACP and other groups have come to Alabama for voter drives--though the local white population views their efforts as stirring things up that don't need stirring.<br/><br/>Jean Louise has always believed her father to a man among men, with a sense of justice and fair play that applied to everyone regardless of skin color. In short, the Atticus Finch we all know and loved from To Kill a Mockingbird. She is nearly destroyed when she learns her father is, in fact a bigot. He believes the Negroes in town are like children and need to stay in their place.<br/><br/>Along the way, there are a number of flashbacks to Jean Louise's childhood years, which as we know, captured the interest of her editor who advised her to write a book from the child's point of view.<br/><br/>I enjoyed her take on her own small town. I happen to have grown up in a small town myself, and there's nothing more suffocating and comforting to live in a place where everyone knows everything about you. When you're there, it's so familiar and you long to be someplace exciting where no one knows you. But when you leave home, you find yourself missing that same familiarity.<br/><br/>The book itself seems a bit disjointed--a lot of the stories she relates from the past don't seem to have anything to do with the story she's trying to tell. And since this is supposed to be a sequel to Mockingbird, there is one glaring inconsistency between the two books. I'm not going to say what it is. I'll leave it to you to find it.<br/><br/>Still it's a good read and I'd advise you to keep your name on the the waiting list at the library.
Well, that was incredible.<br/><br/>First off, the Atticus here looks very different from the one we all know in To Kill a Mockingbird. He's extremely racist. He's a little annoying oh wait, he was in the first book as well. And yet, he's still very much the same. I don't know how much editing, if any, that Harper Lee did in the past year, but still, this book was written first. This is the real Atticus. Many readers feel as betrayed as Scout is when they find out what he really thinks, but something Uncle Jack said at the end fits perfectly: Scout (and everyone else) needed to stop making him God. Atticus is only human. He's makes mistakes, goshdarnit, but what can you expect? He's not perfect.<br/><br/>There's other shocking differences from TKAM as well. Calpurnia, Jem (OH MY GOSH I WAS SO SAD), Scout's horrific teen years, and Henry/Hank, whoever the heck he is. Frankly, I didn't remember him at all, and I'm pretty sure I read TKAM last year or something. Still, he's darling. At least in the beginning.<br/><br/>Scout, or Jean Louise as she's more often called, is back in town for two weeks when the book takes place. She's a firecracker! I wish she had held to her beliefs a little more strongly, but again, all of the characters are very, very human.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman had similar problems to TKAM, but fortunately pulled through better. It's not nearly as boring, even though barely anything happens. Scout's desperate/sarcastic narration glued me to the book. All in all, I'm so glad I read this anyway even though I didn't like the first book. Go Set a Watchman gave me a lot to think about.<br/>[Scout's] voice was heavy with sarcasm: "We've agreed that they're backword, that the're illiterate, that they're dirty and comical and shiftless and no good, they're infants and they're stupid, some of them, but we haven't agreed on one thing and we never will. You deny that they're human."<br/><br/>"How so?" [Atticus said].<br/><br/>"You deny them hope. Any man in this world, Atticus, any man who has a head and arms and legs, was born with hope in his heart. You won't find that in the Constitution, I picked that up in church somewhere. They are simple people, most of them, but that doesn't make them subhuman.<br/><br/>"You are telling them Jesus loves them, but not much. You are using frightful means to justify ends that you think are for the good of the most people. Your ends may well be right--I think I believe in the same ends--but you cannot use people as your pawns, Atticus. You cannot.<br/><br/>So many messed up morals--sexism, racism, to name a few--but still worth the read.
I approached “Watchman” with a mixture of emotions and expectations and decided to treat it as what it is, a discovery that sheds new light on well-known subjects, a long form letter from a dear friend, knowing that it may substantively change my thoughts and opinions on those involved.  And true to form “Watchman” does just that, but unlike many I’m not that shocked, saddened or dismayed by what is revealed here.  Scout/Jean Louise has grown up. She left Maycomb for New York and the scales have fallen from her eyes.  What she one saw with childish delight, wonder and awe is now laid bare and stark.  The father she revered and adored hasn’t really changed; she has changed and so has her perception and understanding of him.  Maycomb too has changed and that’s perhaps what is so unsettling for readers; the place we came to know and understand has irrevocably changed and shifted and like Jean Louise we must come to terms with that change.  It isn’t easy.  The tone of “Watchman” is also different, by turns more direct and blunt than the graceful wit and wisdom-of-a-child prose in “Mockingbird.”  But you can still feel the Scout’s voice seeping in and out again and again as she describes Maycomb and the people of the town.  What is created here is a more complex vision of Maycomb and Southern society of the 1950s as the Civil Rights Movement was ascendant.  There is a certain timelessness to the book as well, as we continue to grapple with symbols of the old Confederacy and racial issues today. Can we transcend our past and find a way to a new future, what is that new future, how do we remember the past and yet not glorify or objectify it?  Here they are all striving and struggling with these issues and the result is much as it was in real life; agonizing, heartbreaking, and ultimately unfulfilling.  It is a process and a journey which we will never see an end to, except to hopefully give way to a better society in years to come.  In that respect “Watchman” couldn’t be more perfectly timed as there’s almost certainly going to be considerable comparing and contrasting with “Mockingbird” and how the two relate to our current struggles over symbols of the Confederacy and their larger meaning in contemporary society.<br/><br/>Many are likely to struggle with the depiction of Atticus as an intolerant bigot and find it jarring compared to his depiction in “Mockingbird” but for me it was not that surprising.  In “Mockingbird” Atticus was the moral compass and center, instilling in Scout honesty, decency and a sense of fair play.  As a lawyer it was expected he would provide a vigorous defense for a client regardless of their guilt or innocence, or for that matter race, and he does just that with Tom Robinson.  So how does that square with Atticus the racist in “Watchman”?  Clearly Atticus, like many men of that generation, compartmentalized his feelings.  He likely thought of Tom Robinson as his racial inferior in “Mockingbird” but that wasn’t going to get in the way of him providing the best defense possible.  Atticus certainly wouldn’t have aired racist sentiments to an inquisitive 6 year old such as Scout who would likely question his beliefs.  Besides, society already was re-enforcing the societal norms of racism in 1930s Maycomb, why would Atticus need to ad his own stamp of concurrence?  Exposure to the criminal justice system over the 20 years from “Mockingbird” to “Watchman” also may have hardened Atticus’s racist attitudes. As he aged fear creeps in as he sees society and the town change in ways he cannot control or adapt to.  The discomfort which comes as a result is understandable even if we find it repellant.  But we live in the here and now and cannot interject our modern day perspectives on that era.<br/><br/>What makes “Watchman” unsettling and a bitter pill to swallow is the emotional connection that readers have made to the subjects and the centrality of place in “Mockingbird.”  We come to relate to and understand the characters in the relatively unnuanced naiveté of Scout.  Issues are Manicheistic, black and white, good and bad.  Maycomb shapes who Scout and all the characters are and is as much a part of “Mockingbird” as anything else in it. “Watchman” upsets that well understood order, but in reality it is more than Jean Louise’s journey of self-discovery.  In some respects she is still a wide eyed innocent navigating her own changed self and a changed place she no longer feels a connection to.  It is also a call to open our eyes and ears to what is around us, the ignorance, bigotry, hatred, and contempt that we ignore or willfully blind ourselves to.  I found echoes to Thomas Wolfe’s masterful “You Can’t Go Home Again” here and more than once found myself contemplating James Baldwin’s quote from “The Price of the Ticket”, that “The great force of history comes from the fact that we carry it within us, are unconsciously controlled by it in many ways, and history is literally present in all that we do.” This discomfort and difficulty of reading “Watchman” tells me that we have come a ways from that place but reminds me we still have a ways to go.
I almost didn't read this one, because I'd heard that Atticus turned out to be a racist, and I didn't want to tarnish one of the most honourable male characters in fiction. But, I thought, I really should read it. And so I did. But now I wish I hadn't.<br/><br/>The pacing was all over the place. I found the frequent flashbacks the most interesting part of the story, but also very confusing; I struggled to know whether she was describing the past or the present.<br/><br/>I really didn't like the way Lee portrayed the adult relationship between Jean Louise and Calpurnia. I also found Jean Louise's relationship with Hank unrealistic.<br/><br/>The ending was really confusing.  I like to think of myself as a mature reader, but I struggled to figure out what on earth was going on.  All Jean Louise's conversations with Uncle Jack left me wondering what he was talking about (I know Jean Louise felt the same way, but at least she had the historical and literary background to understand his references).  I don't know enough about American history and the constitution to understand what some of the conversations were all about. And, to top it all off, I wasn't sure whether or not Atticus was actually supposed to be a racist, or whether it was all a misunderstanding. Jean Louise never listened to him long enough to let him explain.
Some people believed "Go Set a Watchman" was a sequel, of sorts, to "To Kill a Mockingbird."  It's not - despite the fact that the timing of the book is several years after we left Jem, Scout, Atticus and Calpurnia.<br/><br/>Like many people I pre-ordered my copy and started into it the first evening.  Despite a fairly slow start, the novel does catch the interest of the reader.  There isn't as much character development as TKaM, but GSaW occurs over a much-shorter time span.<br/><br/>One of biggest challenges in my first reading was understanding when Scout (now Jean Louise) moves in time from present day to the past.  I think Harper Lee had the right idea - of how daydreams take on a life of their own, without any provocation - and the images were detailed and enjoyable.  But, moving from place to place in Scout's mind was a challenge sometime.<br/><br/>GSaW is almost like a supplement to the original story, and should be taken as such.  It offers some closure to the characters, and the exchange between Jean Louise and Atticus at the end could almost be seen in my mind.  Harper Lee showed great promise with this book, and it should be appreciated.  I am very grateful to have a copy, and will enjoy it for years to come.<br/><br/>However, the crown jewel will always be "To Kill a Mockingbird."
This book tries to make a point, but is never sure which one. It is scattered, lacking in linear thought, and leaves you at the end, thinking, what did I miss? Actually, the reader didn't miss anything, but the author did. Had Mockingbird not been such an exceptional book, this one would be universally panned. Much like a lifetime achievement academy award, or an all star game sympathy vote, too many readers' reviews are based on the other book.
It's blah.<br/><br/>Everything about this book needed to be revised and polished but the author is near death and unable to do so. So the publishers were like, eh it's good enough as is, let's ruin the image of an iconic character so we can make a few million bucks.
I honestly believe that Harper Lee would have NEVER released this manuscript if she had been asked.  Without reading To Kill A Mockingbird, much of this story would have been "missed" by the reader.
Fair. This would never have been a best seller in the day. Kudos to the editor who made Harper Lee go back and write a more interesting story. Jeane Louise was right, but she was beaten down to their level.
Writer flipped back & forth between 1st & 3rd person several times, sometimes in same paragraph. This came across as as draft and not final edition. Needed editing.<br/><br/>Interesting story line though.
I was very disappointed in this book.  I thought the protagonist was spoiled and self-absorbed.  Character development was lacking.  I only bought it because my book club was reading it.  I wish I hadn't.
I awaited this book with great expectations.  Perhaps I was expecting miracles where none exist.  I found the book did not meet my expectations.  Perhaps it is me.  While I know it was written first, I found it to be a hollow shell when compared to "Mockingbird."
I don't know why I'm surprised at what a wonderful writer Ms. Lee is. I just didn't expect so much depth from a first novel. This story is so prevalent to our time now. Maybe that's why she finally released it. I recommend this book to everyone in America today.
Very poorly written, like it had never seen an editor.  Very disappointing, when expecting superior writing from the author of a classic.  Jumped all over the place.  Hard to follow.  Lacked description.
Could barely wait to receive and read this book - expected it to be as wonderful as To Kill A Mockingbird !  Read in two days and glad I did but was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high !
If you haven't already read Go Set a Watchman--I recommend you don't. Sadly, I do not think Harper Lee gave her permission for this Novel to be published or if she did--I don't think she fully understand how much she was being used by those that allowed this book to be published.<br/>While it has a few pages--here and there--that present an interesting story--for the most part--it is exactly what is was--a rambling, under developed first attempt at writing a novel. Harper Lee's first Editor was exactly correct with his or her advice to start over and focus on Ms Lee's childhood. I don't know if that Editor is still with us but if so, it would be interesting to hear his or her opinion on this book being released and level of promotion given to it. For me, it will never color my opinion of To Kill a Mockingbird--still one of my most favorite books--but it will color my opinion of those in the Book Publishing world who used the name of Harper Lee to increase their pocketbooks at her expense. I find it really hard to believe that anyone with editing experience actually read this book and thought it worth publishing if it had been anyone other than Harper Lee who wrote it. Those that did read it and still thought it worth publishing should be ashamed of themselves.
It never took shape as a story.  Yes there were things happening there but nothing connected them into a good story line.  Very disappointing.  Didn't live up to the hype.  And then it ended!  Wow!
This book was better left undiscovered.
Watchman left too many loose in my opinion. There were many passages I found confusing.  Sometimes the dialogue jumped around so much that I wanted some blanks filled in. There were many references to historical figures & books that I had to look up to understand the reason Lee included them. Yet somehow for me those things did not add depth to the story but interrupted the flow of it instead. Also I was left wanting to know more about how Jean Louise would proceed with her future, Cal & Hank. And what about Cal's grandson?  Perhaps these were just devices used to magnify the issues in the South at the time, but then why, for example, spend so much time on Hank in the early parts of the book? Additionally, I felt that JL came to a resolution about what happened with her father & Hank way too quickly. It just didn't seem believable that within a few hours her feelings would evolve from one extreme to the other. All that being said, parts of Watchman, especially those referring back to the past, were beautifully done & reminded me of why we've come to love Harper Lee so much.  And Watchman somewhat successfully navigated the complexities of what was going on in the South at the time it was written. I guess I just wanted more depth and answers to "what now."
This highly anticipated novel, the second published by its author Harper Lee, does not stand on its own as another exciting story packed with interesting characters and rich in Southern atmosphere like To Kill A Mockingbird. I agree with those who maintain it is of interest chiefly to those who hunger for more insight into Lee’s other novel or her career and development as a writer. In this novel Scout’s grown up and facing a crisis when she begins to see her father as a more typical Southern Gentleman circa 1955, with offensive prejudices and a less noble though more practical view of his society. This conflict isn’t illustrated with a compelling story, just dialogue and debate on page after page. These ideas and events will be of interest to those who cherish To Kill A Mockingbird and the recounting here of what would become the Tom Robinson trial in Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning classic is a jolting surprise but for those who were hoping for another novel that would dramatize some of the most fascinating and important issues we face will probably be disappointed because this isn’t anything like what Lee would eventually achieve in plot, character and rich description of small town Southern life with the novel she wrote after this one.
After capturing the hearts of readers with her landmark debut 1960-masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Harper Lee returns with her second and highly controversial book after a gap of fifty-five years much to the delight of Mockingbird fans, and the consternation and skepticism of some. If To Kill a Mockingbird was a book about a racially-inflamed rape trial in Alabama narrated by a young girl named Jean Louise Finch, nicknamed Scout, then Harper Lee’s much-anticipated second book is much more than that – an agonizingly painful yet tender story of growth and maturing, for good or for bad.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee is set twenty years after To Kill a Mockingbird and follows a grown-up twenty-six years old Scout as she returns from New York City to her childhood home in Alabama to visit her ailing father, Atticus Finch, who is now seventy-two and suffering from arthritis. Scout, who now prefers her legal name Jean Louise, is deeply pained and hurt by her father Atticus who now holds views diametrically opposite to what he once proudly embraced. She found among his reading materials a racist tract called “The Black Plague.” She is forced to confront him though it did little to change him. Ultimately, the novel is about the later lives of the Finch family, including lawyer Atticus, Scout, and Scout’s older brother Jem who has died of a congenitally disordered heart.<br/><br/>What I really adored about the book is the way in which Harper Lee balances the sense of wistfulness, melancholy and longing that is running throughout the book with the cynical views of Atticus, who as a good-hearted widowed single father was a much-loved figure in To Kill a Mockingbird. The transformation of Atticus is revolting but he has his own reasons. Intermittently, there are flashbacks and references to the past. The most telling effect of the transformation and growth into adulthood of Scout is her preference of her legal name Jean Louise over Scout, the nickname with which she was addressed during her adolescent years. The on and off romance between Scout and a newly introduced character, Henry Clinton, gives the story a fillip and much-needed flavour.<br/><br/>Though some readers may find fault with the third-person narrative which is in stark contrast to the first-person account of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, I feel it syncs well with the tone and tenor of the story. Honestly, I never expected, or for that matter, wanted Go Set a Watchman to be a better book than To Kill a Mockingbird. All I wanted for this book was to showcase the adult life of Scout and Jem, and their father, Atticus. Harper Lee has not only succeeded in that aspect, but delivered an explosive plot twist that no one ever expected. Go Set a Watchman is about a young woman’s disillusionment at the racism that invades her hometown and her family. It is a story about the loss of innocence and the heartbreak at the loss of a brother as much as it is a coming-of-age story. Whatever critics may say and whatever its shortcomings may be, Go Set a Watchman is a worthy follow-up and companion to To Kill a Mockingbird.
She’s all grown up. Smoking, drinking and carousing with boys is proof enough of that. But is she an adult? Adults abandon the impervious shells we surround others with as children. But this revelation is difficult at best for Scout to concede. In fact, Scout cannot. Jean Louise must make the journey to find what it means to be a professional woman, deal with family and societal conflict and to aspire to have a family of her own one day. All these issues converge and collide while in the confines of this place she can barely relate called the South.<br/><br/>Sparse facts remind here and there that the period was set (and written) several decades ago. The issues with race relations and the interplay of women’s roles being both a wife/mother and a professional, however, are coincidentally now percolating in today’s society as well.<br/><br/>The book is well written and includes some real shockers. She discusses incidents that metaphorically grind someone into dirt. In the end, some ideas people need literally taken with them into the dirt. This journey into adulthood helps explore those issues so that only the “right” ideas will survive. Reproduce/influence. Repeat journey, and so on. This book is nothing short of brilliant.
Hard to know what to think when you actually get around to reading something with this kind of build up.  I have to mention right  off that "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my favorite books of all time.  Honestly though I loved the movie even more.  Between Gregory Peck and the uncredited narrator, it just flowed like molasses on a hot summer day.  To this book.  Had I picked this book up, with no background and no relationship to its famous offspring, I would have given up after about 25 pages.  It started dull and didn't have enough background to really understand the main character.  Also, in TKAM you could just feel the hot humid south.  I didn't get that here at all.  Admittedly it got better.  I did finish it after stopping a couple of times.  The main theme that eventually took over between daughter and father was interesting.  But honestly this reminds me of "director's cut" movies that are released sometime after the actual movie to try and drum up a bit more business.  There was a reason that stuff was left on the cutting room floor and putting it back didn't help the movie.  In this case the editors seemed to see something in the flashbacks of childhood that they liked and requested she just write about that, and the result was a great American novel we all love.  I don't believe anything was gained by releasing this book.  Although I should point out that other than many parts of the flashbacks which will be familiar to readers, this truly is a different story with a totally different point.  Albeit and lesser work by far.
Frankly, I thought this was so bad that I could not get through it. I believe the author would not have wanted this published. I am not convinced that she understood it was being published.
A real disappointment after the beautifully written To Kill A Mockingbird.  It lacked in a meaningful plot, and a sympathetic and interesting character.  Not enough real story in this one.
I thought this was a brilliant book. No, it is not brilliant like To Kill a Mockingbird is. TKAM's greatest draw, for me, was the viewpoint and adventures of the children; the flashbacks to Scout's childhood in Go Set a Watchman are just as engaging. Because GSAW's is largely an adult perspective, and at a different time period, there is a much different feel to it. That is a bit of a shock at first, in and of itself. Personally, I was not so shocked that Atticus turned out to be pro-segregation. That a man could treat individuals with the utmost courtesy and justice and still be afraid of "the collective mass" makes sense, especially for that time period. The point of the book is not racism so much, as it is the process by which a young person discovers and identifies how she is different from her family and her upbringing, and how she can separate herself and be her own person, while still loving and retaining relationship with those who are not so perfect as she had thought. As a mother of young men in their late teens and early twenties, I recognize that the process of individuation is a critical one. I plan to recommend this book to them as one that will help to guide them in that process.
This was a poorly written book.  The hype about Atticus was just that.  Hype.  After reading it I felt t wasn't written by Harper Lee.  The writing styles of each book was very different.
I tried to read with an open mind.  There were scenes that hinted at the brilliant writer Harper Lee would become in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  The characters are not developed by a mature author - I glimpsed the genius to come, particularly in the scenes with Jem, Dill, and Scout.  Jean Louise (Scout) in particular serves as the moral compass then suddenly loses her way, for no reason.  I sense that Harper Lee may have been writing what she knew.  A feeling remains of gratitude to the editor(s) who saw the potential and guided her to the masterpiece of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  The racism is disturbing.  I recommend this book for those interested in reading the works of Harper Lee.  This is not a sequel to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  The "logic" put forth by Atticus, Dr. Finch, Aunt Alexandra and suddenly, out of the blue, by Jean Louise, is childish and selfish.  I recently did not recommend this book to two friends who deeply love TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and are not interested in tracing Harper Lee's early literary efforts.  It's wise to decide your goal for reading GO SET A WATCHMAN beforehand.  Reading it has not altered my belief that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the finest novel and film of the last 60 years.  Reading most of GO SET A WATCHMAN made my heart ache.  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD changed and shaped me.  I will not allow a draft by a young writer, who listened to her editors and created the masterpiece of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, to change that.  I will continue to focus on TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.
Same old story told with different characters.  I put it down after fifty pages.  I was so looking forward to this, but was quite dissappointed.  Not really worth the time, in my view.
This is clearly an amateurish book. It also did not get edited. For example, this story states that in the trial of "To kill a mockingbird" Atticus got the accused acquitted. Untrue. He was found guilty. There is no doubt that "Watchman" is the first draft of "Mockingbird" and not a stand alone novel. It was trite and boring and lost in the 50's. I only finished it because I was hoping for improvement. There were ways this could have been lifted up to be more interesting. For example. we don't know what really happened to Jem other than he "dropped in his tracks." Atticus is about to take on the trial of another young black man. This book could have gone in to the trial and perhaps Scout would have seen how Atticus could have used his "old boy " network to get a very light sentence. However, Scout just seemed like a brat throughout and wanted to convey an anti bigot message. Although the message is commendable. there was little likable about Scout.  I could see flashes of Ms Lee's talent but many rewrites were needed. It is a shame this novel got published. I have to believe it was for money only with no real attempt at good fiction.
In Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman, Jean Louise Finch as a young woman discovers that racial tensions in the south are not as black and white as she thought they were when she was a young girl, Scout, in To Kill A Mockingbird. Her father, Atticus Finch, is not the paragon of virtue she thought he was either and is in fact a “segregationist,” a “gentleman bigot,” and affiliates “with raving anti-integration, anti-black crazies.” The story pivots on Jean Louise’s discovery of her father’s flaws, her shock at that revelation and the process she goes through to reach a sort of acceptance around the dethroning of her father. Atticus Finch has been my hero since Gregory Peck played him in the 1962 movie. He has always been the literary example I aspired too whenever I encountered my own moral conundrums. This takedown of the character by Harper Lee is a shock for sure. But in the end, Atticus Finch is still my hero. It is kind of a relief to know that even our heroes are not perfect in every way; that you can still admire and emulate a person even though you might not agree with everything he or she believes. This novel makes him more human and I guess I can live with that.
The critical drubbing this has received is not surprising.  This is raw material and not on par with its predecessor; it's also funny, fiery, political and completely captivating.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" was the big moral lesson and "Go Set A Watchman" is the ugly truth.  It can't be written off and should be embraced.  I've read a lot of whining about the character Atticus Finch being defiled in this book, mostly by people who refuse to read it.  Without giving anything away, I can tell you that the final forty pages - written in the late 1950's, no less - is an unsettling reflection of attitudes regarding race relations that are still present in our society, and Atticus - if anything - is given more depth and complexity.  Harper Lee, it seems, figured she still had something to say on the subject and chose to publish this.  Unfortunately, the statement - in my opinion - is: we haven't come as far as we'd like to think.<br/>I've read more articles about Harper Lee's supposed feeble-mindedness than of the content of this novel, and that's frustrating.  A person can indeed be 89-years old, nearly blind and deaf, and still have a sharp mind.  I have no doubt that she sanctioned this publication and as a reader and long-time admirer, I'm grateful for that.  I urge those who've drawn quick conclusions to reconsider their decision to not read this.  It stayed in a drawer long enough and has the strength to stand the test of time.  It's a thinker.  Enjoy and discuss.
For many years after "To kill a mockingbird" was published "Go set a watchman" lay abandoned by Harper Lee.  It does not detract from the To kill a mockingbird.  It  underlines what a perfectly crafted novel that is compared with this first attempt which Harper Lee never had published.  She knew, and I am sure everyone who reads it will know that it is clumsy compared with "To kill a mockingbird".  They are novels.  The people are from the imagination of Harper Lee.  She improved their characters and the story in "To kill a mockingbird".  It is interesting to read "Go set a watchman" but it is neither equal nor comparable with "To kill a mocking bird".  It would have been very easy to find a publisher for "Go set a watchman" and had she wanted it published Harper Lee could have done so immediately following the success of "To kill a mockingbird".  She obviously decided not to and now, many years later, somebody else has over-ruled her decision for reasons of their own.  I am not sorry to have read it but I wish that it had never been published because I believe that is what Harper Lee had decided.
Perhaps my expectations were too high due to the success of To Kill A Mockingbird.  I struggled to finish this slow moving story which I felt was weak on content plus a poor ending.
I have heard a few people speak about this book and the behavior of Atticus Finch.  I tried to stay away from any comments or criticism before I began reading.  I wanted to read the book with a clear head and I was pretty much able to achieve this goal.  There were a few times I had to walk away from people with my ears covered when they wanted to comment about some character shifts in the book.  The bothersome part is that none of them had read the book!  My suggestion, WAIT, finish the book then have a cup of coffee with a like minded friend who has also read the book and just talk about your feelings and observations on "Go Set a Watchman".<br/><br/>It is not as polished as To Kill a Mockingbird but the characters in the story have stayed pretty much true to TKAM.  Good lessons are to be learned from both books.  "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it." also "I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks."<br/>― Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird<br/><br/>Keep these references handy when reading "Go Set a Watchman".  I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.  I was finally able to discuss the book with my sister Pat last week.  We had a wonderful chat about the characters, the story line and the theme of the book.  We ran out of time but promised each other we will talk more on the subject soon.  We both felt it was worth the wait.  Enjoy reading!
I am not a literary critic, I am a just a reader. I loved TKAM. It drew you in from the first few pages. I cannot tell you why, it just did. You loved the characters. It moved and kept you thoroughly engrossed. You did not want to put it down. And when you reached the end of TKAM, you wanted to read it again or wanted a sequel. Not true of Watchman. It is just plain boring. You are not drawn in early in the book. I had to force myself to keep reading, trusting all the while that it was going to get better. It doesn't. Who wants to go through flashbacks verbatim? Not I. I am not really enthralled by who is sitting next to whom, or word-by-word accounts of child's play that occured years before. This book is just plain boring from a reader's standpoint. If you've read TKAM, then this book feels like a rehash of what you already read previously. It makes sense since this was originally a draft for TKAM that was rejected. There was so much hype about Watchman, and I could not wait to get it. Sorry Miss Lee. I feel like Watchman flew on the reputation of TKAM, I can't discuss "fleshing out a character" etc. I just know I did not like it as a reader.
First let me say that I wish with all my heart that my Dad was alive. (he was an English teacher) He and I would have talked about this book endlessly.  Short and to the point….I loved it. Those of you who spurned it because of ‘talk’ you heard…..?.....I feel sorry that you didn’t ‘take the plunge’. I hope this review will change your mind.<br/> Because of all the ‘talk’, it really was a leap of faith for me. I was in love with Atticus Finch and I had steeled myself to fall out of love. I mean, the reviews I read had me starting this book with a heavy heart. Maybe that was a good thing.<br/>This book was truth of the times. It wasn’t truth of what we WANT….it was truth of the times. It was an awakening of things that were and an insidious reminder of things that still are. I hate the way things still are, but this book gave me a peek at how things of ‘that’ nature got started. And all along the way I was still in love with Atticus and I still am.<br/>Harper Lee wrote with her same aplomb and wit. She didn’t disappoint. I think she did a masterful job, writing from the past on a subject that we should, today, still learn from.
First of all, I think it's a sin to sully the memory of Atticus Finch in a book like this. Second, it’s impossible for Harper Lee to write anything that measures up to To Kill A Mockingbird — even a good book couldn’t to that. Third, this isn’t a good book. It reads like a draft; it needs an editor to send it back with notes to help Ms. Lee improve it. It’s got some delightful stuff in it: The part where Scout thinks she’s pregnant, her experience at the high school dance, and when Atticus excuses himself from dinner with Reverend and Mrs. Moorehead to go out on the back porch and laugh. But there are tons of problems here. The legal case of Calpurnia’s grandson is mentioned, then dropped. The inaccurate reference to Tom Robinson’s case is more proof: this isn’t a finished novel — it’s just a proof. And Scout’s loooong, dramatic talk with Uncle Jack that ends the book never reaches a satisfying, or even an interesting, conclusion. Atticus himself is barely here in the book. There’s some material here the author could work with and a lot she should throw out. It's not a waste of time; it's just unpolished and unfinished.
This book should never have been published. It does the image of an icon no good. Shame on greedy attorneys and publishers who did it within weeks of her gatekeeper's death.
I hate to admit this but I haven't read "To Kill a Mockingbird" (though I did see the movie a very long time ago) so I couldn't compare the two books. I viewed "Go Set..." as a stand-alone work. I think that made me like it better than some people who had read both books liked it. I thought parts of the writing kind of ran on and didn't relate to the meat of the book but setting those aside, the book seemed to have a message that relates to our current times. When people have biases, sometimes they are quite good at justifying them just as Atticus was doing. They attempt to put a spin on their reasons to sound  like there's a really good and valid reason for their actions or opinions. As I read how Atticus justified his bias against blacks, I was thinking we could insert any number of current biases - African refugees, Mexican immigrants, same-sex marriages, liberals, conservatives, and the list goes on! So many biases and so little real reason for them except our own venom. That thought was my take-away from the book though I doubt that the author was seeking this global type of consideration.
The Atticus that I came to know in to TKAMB has totally vanished. I simply could not marry the two Atticus'. Please reflect back to the closing arguments in Tom Robinson's trial, and even when the sheriff wanted to say that Mr. Ewell slipped on his own knife, but Atticus would not hear of a thing like this---in his righteousness in fairness, he wanted to bring his own son before the courts. No, this character turned into something that I was not prepared for. GSAW was almost a total contradiction of the character construct of Atticus in TKAMB,<br/><br/>My applauds are with Scout, she took what her dad taught her, and rejected the views of the men gathered together at the courthouse, and righteously so. Yes, she may have hero worshiped Atticus, as they so lovingly called their dad, but it was he who taught them in every inch of TKAMB-not to be racist (again, go back to his closing arguments during Tom Robinson's trial). So, her uncle calling her the bigot was surprising and wrong to me, although I do understand the meaning of bigot used in this sense.<br/><br/>The book was good, but quite blistering---ijs!
Obviously Harper lee is an outstanding writer and can create an incredible story from any point of view. The plot is interesting as well and made an addicting book to read.
Don't bother buying..... poorly written..... just read the last 50 pages.  A royal rip off !!!  Return for a refund or donate so someone else doesn't spend monty on it !!!
Tedious, kind of a tortuous read.  If you liked or loved To Kill a Mockingbird, keep your expectations low.  There is a reason why Harper Lee never published this earlier.
Awful, I didn't finish it.
Garbage.  To Kill a Mockingbird is a masterpiece, a book I have read and reread.  This worthless book makes one seriously question whether Harper Lee was truly the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, and if she was, how she could possibly have been the author of this awful piece of offal.  The issue is not how the author portrays the characters who would also appear in To Kill a Mockingbird. After all, most White Southerners of the 1950s did not consider negroes to be their equals, deserving of the right to vote, so it would be perfectly reasonable for Lee's characters to be patronizing "benefactors" of the Negro race, without wanting them to have the full rights and responsibilities of citizenship - including universal suffrage.  The issue is that it is such a poorly structured, rambling, inept piece of awful typing that cannot even be dignified with the term "storytelling".  Most of it consists of long speeches made by characters who are trying to justify their racist efforts to deny negroes the vote.  And conveniently, there are constant brief references to a multitude of characters who would appear fully fleshed out in To Kill a Mockingbird.  It's as if someone who had read To Kill a Mockingbird plotted this, and wrote something that would mention as many characters as possible from the book, and decided to make the book "shocking" by portraying the honorable, exemplary, tolerant, and justice-seeking Atticus Finch as a racist. It's as if it were deliberately written and published to make tons of money by perpetrating a fraud on the fans of Harper Lee.<br/><br/>Shame on whoever released this.  If it truly was the work of Harper Lee, she was right to keep it hidden - not because of its portrayal of racism, but because it's just not worthy of being in print.  If it truly was the work of Harper Lee, it severely detracts from her legacy.  And if it wasn't, it's a cheap grab for money, a fraud perpetrated upon the reading public.  Shame.
I honestly don't get why any adult would not love this book. It's so real. To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my all-time favorite books. It was written from the perspective of a child about her father, and it mesmerized me both when I was in 6th grade in 1976 and today as an adult. The courtroom speech is one of my all-time favorite scenes from a book. So I'll start my review of Go Set A Watchman with that comment.<br/><br/>Having said that, Go Set a Watchman is absolutely fantastic. It's written from the perspective of an adult about several adult themes. One is leaving behind a child's idealism and having to somehow connect one's own conscience and integrity with the reality that a hero is not an action figure that you will still agree with in every way. To me, that's about growing up. People we idolized as perfect turn out to be not what we thought they were. And that's okay. They're humans, not perfect robots. Atticus becomes a human in this book with ideas and beliefs that I totally disagree with. But isn't that what all adult relationships are like? Don't we in reality completely disagree at times with people we really do like?<br/><br/>At the same time, Atticus Finch is still a man of integrity. He sticks to what he believes in. That's acting with integrity. He did it over his whole life. That's resilience. Even though I 100% disagree with his fundamental beliefs about African-Americans, he actually is the same person in both books. He did what he thought was the right thing to do in both scenes in the courtroom in the two books. Those character strengths of integrity and resilience that he demonstrated in both books are what ultimately he passed on to his daughter even though they ended up having completely different points of view on race issues.<br/><br/>I actually think if Go Set A Watchman had been published in 1955 it could have had a great impact on moving the Civil Rights Movement forward. My reason is because a 26-year-old woman from the Deep South would have expressed very clearly why she believed that African-Americans deserved the same rights to a bright future that white people had at that time. Harper Lee could have been a representative voice of young people all over the United States on why old ways of thinking about race needed to be left behind. I think this book could have generated a movement in a really effective way. I think a lot of people in their late teens and twenties would have said, "I agree with Jean Louise Finch, and I'm going to stand up to people and tell them why I think they're wrong, and I'm going to show them their inconsistencies in what they say and what they actually do."<br/><br/>I really encourage you to read this book. I really think Jean Louise's conversations with her uncle, boyfriend, and father all make a tremendous impact on the reader's thinking. At least those conversations had a great impact on me. This is a book that I think addresses several major topics of importance. The other reason I encourage you to read it is that it provides a time capsule perspective on the key issue of that era.<br/><br/>I can imagine a very similar book being written in today's era on same-sex marriages where an adult child and a parent disagree about allowing for same-sex marriages and the child has to stand up in an adult way to the parent that he or she admires so much. I can see Jean Louise standing up to the parent. Or maybe Jean Louise would play the role of the parent disapproving of same-sex marriages and her adult child who idolized her would be trying to show her the inconsistencies of what she said when the child was young as compared to when the child is an adult.<br/><br/>This book will definitely be worth your time. By now I'm sure you know that it's a very different perspective on the beloved Atticus Finch. So get over that. You won't see him as a hero in this book. And with that you can read this book from an adult perspective. It's about the importance of hanging on to our own individual conscience.
Due to the fact that this book has been reviewed by much brighter minds than mine, I'll keep it brief:<br/><br/>1) This isn't 'To Kill a Mockingbird', so don't expect it to be, but it is still great nonetheless. It was also Harper Lee's first attempt at a novel, and 'TKAM' was born out of the draft of this book, so it isn't a true sequel by definition.<br/>2) The main theme of this book is disillusionment. Jean Louise (Scout) is a grown woman, and returns to Maycomb in the late 1950s (a few years after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling) and is shocked by the attitudes of her fellow Maycombians (including her father)<br/>3) In other reviews Atticus has been described as 'darker', 'more complex', and  'racist segregationist' All of these descriptions have a kernel of truth to them, but I would argue that he is the same Atticus that we find in 'TKAM.' Jean Louise (unfairly) has Atticus on a pedestal, and the heart of this story is her struggle to come to terms with her father's (and Maycomb's) flaws. I think that many readers will have the same experience.<br/>4) I didn't find this book to be as polarizing as many reviewers made it out to be, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes 'TKAM'<br/>5) Lastly, the only editing that this book received was a 'copy edit' (grammatical errors, typos, etc.) because Ms. Lee believed that an editor in 2014/15 couldn't bring a 1957 Southern sensibility to this book (and I agree with her). That being said, there are passages in this book that could benefit from some editing (mostly in the flashback sequences), but for the most part the story keeps a good pace.<br/><br/>Some final things to keep in mind for the sake of context: This novel was written in 1957 (the Civil Rights Movement was still in its infancy), and is set in the 1950s American South. Keep this in mind when you come across the racially-charged dialogue.
When this book was first announced, I knew it would be good, but I was never expecting it to be THIS good. It is quite obvious that the reviewers giving negative reviews (here and elsewhere) really do not understand the historical context in which the book was written. I would advise that if you don't know much about the civil rights movement, read a thorough history of it first (perhaps something like At the Dark End of the Street by Danielle McGuire) before reading Watchman. Harper Lee was speaking the absolute cold hard truth at the time, one that no one wanted to hear. No wonder it was rejected.<br/><br/>So she was convinced to write a version from the perspective of a child, because that's what America was ready for in 1960. We needed white heroes who weren't racist in order to convince a younger generation of what was possible. I don't think Atticus is a different character at all; it's just the same person 20 years later and Lee makes that very clear. In Watchman, Jean Louise has grown up and now can see him clearly for what he really is. She uses the fairy tale of the Childe Roland who had to slay his father in order to save his siblings; in this case, Scout has to slay her father in order to grow up and become her own person. It's something we all have to do eventually; those who willfully refuse to read this book or to try to understand it are also, in a way, refusing to grow up.<br/><br/>Besides tackling race, Lee also took on class and gender in Watchman, something that most reviewers ignore. These three things were the pillars of Southern patriarchy, and Lee understood how they intertwined to keep wealthy white men in power for so long.<br/><br/>As other have pointed out, no wonder Lee retreated from publishing after Mockingbird. It was a sellout for her and likely soured her on the whole publishing process. But how could she ever act ungrateful? She did exactly what Uncle Jack suggests that Jean Louise should do at the end of Watchman: come back to Maycomb, because friends who are wrong need her more than friends who are right. And that's exactly what she did.
Go Set a Watchman is a vivid, beautifully written novel that places the reader in the postwar American Deep South, a place that knows change is coming and that nothing can stop it, as physically, intellectually and emotionally as possible.  The characters and story are compelling.  Its tone spot on.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a young women living in New York, who has come home to visit her family, which now consists of her father and his siblings, her mother and older brother having both passed.  Her longtime friend and beau is now her father’s junior law partner.  The novel alternates between her childhood in the 1930s and the South of the 1950s, deep in the throes of the early Civil Rights movement.  During her trip, she comes to realize that things have changed dramatically since her childhood tries to piece together what has happened to the South, her home town and its inhabitants, both black and white, since the war.<br/><br/>Harper Lee uses her characters to paint a brilliant portrait of the attitudes that permeated the region when confronted with the NAACP, an increasingly hostile northern press and a Supreme Court whose decisions were dealing death blows to their way of life.  As one character phrases it, they are fighting a “rear guard action” and it has taken a heavy toll on the very good people of Maycomb that she knew growing up.  Written in the 1950s, Watchman presents racial issues with a frankness and intelligence that is missing in today’s dialogue.<br/><br/>If this were all to the story of Go Set a Watchman it would rank as among the greatest of novels ever written about the American South. But of course there’s the other book.<br/><br/>For the characters in Go Set a Watchman are not strangers.  The Finches - Jem, Scout and especially Atticus - are as tightly integrated into the American literary psyche as any in American literature.  Perhaps because To Kill A Mockingbird is read by nearly every high school student no one, not Huck Finn, Ahab, or even Jay Gatsby, looms greater in our collective conscience.<br/><br/>Many people will therefore (knowing what is now widely understood about plot and character development) choose simply not to read the book.  Ms. Lee didn’t approve the release of this book they say (we don’t really know).  It’s therefore a “cultural crime” as someone put it to me (a bookseller who saw no problem with selling it).  Others have celebrated it as a refreshing, more brutally honest look at the American South during the period, one sadly more honest and less fantastical than that of Mockingbird.<br/>Blind, deaf and confined to a wheel chair, Ms. Lee is sadly not in any position to provide further insights into the controversy.<br/><br/>It would be a mistake in my view to simply take the events in Go Set a Watchman as occurring to the same characters 13 years later.  Because it was written before To Kill A Mockingbird and because Ms. Lee is in no condition to reconsider it, I’d say it was highly unlikely that she would have ever written the book the same way after having written to Kill A Mockingbird.<br/>Therefore it’s best to think of Go Set a Watchman on its own terms.  The Finches of Watchman and the Finches of Mockingbird will remain in their own universes and be understood on their own terms, separate and apart.  Each tells a brilliant and compelling story.<br/><br/>Let us reject false choices and celebrate both of Ms. Lee’s great works.
Let me start by saying that this was the most unique reading experience that I've ever had.  It wasn't that there was anything especially unusual about the story, but the circumstances around the book are one-of-a-kind.<br/><br/>It is important to know the context of this novel--this was the first book that Harper Lee wrote.  It was rejected by the publishers with a note that she should explore the childhood of the main character, Jean Louise "Scout" Finch.  Lee took that note and wrote another book, To Kill a Mockingbird.  This manuscript was filed....until something happened.  Things get murky from that point and it isn't really clear when this manuscript was "discovered"and if Harper Lee actually consented to the publication.<br/><br/>So, it is set after To Kill a Mockingbird, but it isn't truly a sequel.  It is more of a story about an alternate universe Maycomb, Alabama and its famous literary inhabitants.  The first question that came to my mind was why was this book rejected in the first place?  After reading it, I can think of a couple reasons.  For one thing, it might have pushed the boundaries of what was considered "acceptable" in mainstream fiction in the 50s.  There are reference to child molestation, someone is compared to Hitler, a lot of discussion about racial issues, and a scene involving an unfortunate pair of falsies (and that last one is excellent!).  I have a feeling that some of the things this book touched on may have been a bit too "hot" for a publisher to take on.<br/><br/>There is also the problem that, plot-wise, this book is a bit light.  The plot isn't "bad," but it isn't really novel-sized.  This plot could have been expressed in a short story or a novella, although most of the very entertaining, but non-essential, scenes would have had to be cut.  I would love to know what someone who has never read To Kill a Mockingbird would think of this because, for me, this is really dependent on To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>There were also some stylistic things that don't show up in To Kill a Mockingbird that may not have gone over well--mostly things where the narration switches from third-person to first-person stream-of-consciousness.  I don't recall this happening in To Kill a Mockingbird and I'll admit that I was a little confused by it at times.<br/><br/>The original suggestion that Lee should write about Scout's childhood does make sense.  We all know about the wonderfully precocious Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird, but I must tell you that the Jean Louise of this book is freaking awesome.  I can't think of another character of that age in literature who I have enjoyed as much as I did Jean Louise (who I will call Scout from here on out--because she will always be Scout in my mind).  She's opinionated and brash and knows how to make a situation deliciously uncomfortable.  Also, this Scout is a natural evolution of the Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird.  There are a lot of flashback scenes to her childhood and they read as if they could have come out TKAM.<br/><br/>And, now, the elephant in the living room--Atticus.  Unless you have no access to the internet (in which case, you wouldn't be reading this review) you know that Atticus is not what we expect in this book.  I would like to take a moment to call every outlet (The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Mashable, The Guardian, and others!) who felt that they should spoil this jerks.  You are all jerks.  There, I said it.<br/><br/>But it is an important part of this book.  Is Atticus a racist?  By, 2015 standards, yes.  By Scout's standards, yes.  By mid-1950's standards?  Maybe not.  I mean, this was a contemporary novel when it was written, I mean, by 2015 standards, some of the things that Scout says are racist as well.  (And to be fair, neither is as racist as Ma Ingalls....)<br/><br/>I'm not excusing any of this, but I think that it is important to place it in history.  I think that modern readers should be upset about the racism here--not in a "how dare you" sort of way, but in a "we were wrong" sort of way.  I think that a reader needs to be able to separate the myth of Atticus Finch from the literary Atticus Finch.  I have to say that because what I'm about to say next may not sit well with some people:  In my mind, I can see that the Atticus of To Kill a Mockingbird can become the Atticus of Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that Atticus was racist in TKAM--but what I'm saying is that he could have been.  Remember, TKAM was told through the eyes of a child who idolized her father.  In Go Set a Watchman, that child has grown up and lived on her own in another part of the country.<br/><br/>Should you read this book as a sequel or as an unrelated book?  I don't think you can read it as a completely unrelated book--there is just too much overlap between the two.  But I don't know that you can read it as a strict sequel either as there are things that just don't add up.  For example, the trial of Tom Robinson is alluded to in passing in this book, but the details-and outcome--were different,  I guess you have to find where you are comfortable between the two options and read it from that point.  I will say, though, that this book does seem dependent on To Kill a Mockingbird.  However, I am a person who has read TKAM several times, so I already had that at the forefront of my mind going into Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>I'm going to close with what I thought was so profound about this book--and that is that it was published when it was.  The issues this book deals with are still with us.  The same arguments that are used against Civil Right in this book are used to support flying the Confederate flag today.  Things that are said about African Americans are still said about minorities.  It is amazing how little has changed in 50+ years.<br/><br/>I am immensely glad to have read this book (and I truly hope that Harper Lee DID give consent to its publication).  The experience in reading it is something I will never experience again and it takes the issues that are raised in To Kill a Mockingbird and brings it home.
Racism is alive and well in this country. It may be subtle, or not, but it lies just beneath the surface, ready to rear its ugly head. The term racist has been applied to Atticus Finch in this book and the reversal of how he is portrayed in To Kill A Mockingbird has some people upset. In my opinion, they have misunderstood both books.<br/><br/>In To Kill A Mockingbird, Atticus is asked by his maid, Calpurnia, to talk to Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman. After talking to him, Atticus believes he is innocent and agrees to defend him. This decision is based not on being black or white, but seeing a man unjustly accused and who needs a good lawyer. While the town is upset about him defending a black man, for Atticus it is about justice and the law.<br/><br/>In Go Set A Watchman, Atticus is defending a way of life and the intrusion of the federal government. I may not agree with his view of how life should be, but again he sees it as defending justice and his view of the constitution.<br/><br/>To understand both books, we have to realize they are from the point of view of Jean Louise (Scout) and that she has a narrow and naive view of the world. Remember she thought letting a boy slip in his tongue when they kissed caused her to get pregnant. While growing up she was not aware of racial issues, things were just how they were. When she returns to her home as an adult and sees the change in everyone except herself, she cannot grasp what has happened. She does not understand the threat to a way of life the others feel.<br/><br/>This book is a revelation of how a lot of the South reacted to the enforcement of de-segregation when civil rights became the law of the land. The diatribe of Uncle Jack is worth the price of the book alone.  In an age where many would like to rewrite the past, this book is a reminder of how a people can justify the oppression of another.<br/><br/>Harper Lee has written a novel that speaks probably louder today than had it been published when she wrote it. This is a thought provoking, hopefully discussion starting, look into how we perceive each other, how embedded our beliefs can be, and how we need to listen to those with whom we may not agree. A happy ending, feel good novel it is not.<br/><br/>This one gets five full stars
Astounded at the grace of Harper Lee. I think Ms. Lee knew exactly what she was doing when she waited to publish "Go Set a Watchman"--her vision of the world--the birthright of belief: in race, in status, in government change and upheaval and most of all in the evolution of the speed at which mankind matures was decades ahead of its time. So she waited until the world allowed history to repeat itself again --until we became so self-righteous and intolerant that we regressed into childhood....and then she published her swan song. I admire the character of Mr. Atticus Finch as much as I always did....and of the opportunities of free thought he provided Miss Jean Louise Finch to change the world. But I admire Miss Harper Lee for making me see the way our individual communities (not our color but our towns) raise us and mold us into status and ideas and how it happens so slowly we may miss it until we're allowed to leave and get exposure to something more worldly and bigger than us. I relate to someone who suddenly doesn't belong where she was molded because education and experience broke the form and I relate to the pain (and to the goodness) of aching for a home that no longer is mine. She weaves so much charm and reality into the good and bad of human nature that it's quite easy to see both sides of the argument and, if you're willing to open your mind, eat a slice of humble right along with Atticus and Scout. I am moved beyond my comfort zone, beyond my own little reality into the knowledge of how I have been created and what might come next. "Go Set a Watchman" is every bit as beautifully rendered as I had hoped. Read the book and leave every idea of what you've ever believed about how you were raised to think on the back stoop and open your mind. Then open your heart and become color blind and status blind....and suck up the language of the book; It was meant to be that harsh on purpose. If you can intentionally stop being offended for just one moment, you'll find yourself in a position of an ether world where you just might be able to see all sides of an argument and come out a little more compassionate and mature.
I just finished reading the novel on Kindle. Without expecting a prequel or sequel to TKAM, I greatly enjoyed it as a stand-alone story.  As a life-long fan of TKAM, I was excited to read about these characters 20 years after the events of TKAM. The story in GSAW has almost nothing to do with TKAM, but the characters and issues are fresh and welcome in their return.<br/><br/>I disagree with those who write off the Atticus of GSAW as a racist. Much of the book isn't about what Atticus says or does, but about how Scout reacts to what she THINKS his beliefs must be after seeing him at a "citizen's council" meeting.  At the end of the book, Atticus explains to her what he actually believes, which isn't exactly what she thought.  I can also reconcile the Atticus of TKAM with the Atticus of GSAW. Remember, during Tom Robinson's trial in TKAM, Atticus said "the one place a person should get a fair shake is in the courtroom."  That statement (made during his performance of duties as a lawyer) is narrowly about the rights of a person accused of a crime. His opinions stated in GSAW are more personal regarding his world views.  It's important to remember that the character of Atticus is a Southern male who was probably born around 1882 (given that he is 72 years old in GSAW, and the year appears to be 1954, when the Supreme Court ordered desegregation in Brown v. Board of Education).  So, GSAW is set in 1954, a full 61 years ago for today's readers, and was apparently written in the late 1950s.  I think GSAW is an interesting look at then-current issues (many still current today).<br/><br/>While Atticus is the hero in TKAM, Jean Louise takes that role in GSAW.  I can see why Ms. Lee's editors may have suggested she write a "second" book focusing on Scout's childhood.  The events and jury trial of TKAM certainly make for a better dramatic story.<br/><br/>GSAW clearly suffers from a lack of professional editing. The storyline and pacing is uneven, and we can only wonder how much better the book could have been if edited better. That can only be written off as an unfortunate consequence of how this book was eventually "found" and published.  (I'm not going to weigh in on the controversy, since we don't know all the facts, and maybe never will.) But I'm very glad that it was published "as-is" from Ms. Lee, without any revisions. I will say that within five minutes of starting the book, I have no doubt it was truly written by Ms. Lee.<br/><br/>Anyone who truly loves TKAM and its characters (as I do) will probably enjoy this book if they approach it as what it is:  a separate story from TKAM, but with the same characters.  GSAW stands very well on it's own. It's not the complete masterpiece that was TKAM, but what is? I highly recommend it.
Flashbacks to Scout's childhood foretell the brilliance of Mockingbird, but the rest is an exercise in sophomoric and self-righteous indignation  Terribly disappointing.
I haven't read "To Kill a Mockingbird" yet, it will probably be better. I agree with the original publisher to send Harper Lee back to the typewriter after reading this.
Good thing she put this out second because it's a slow read. People would have been bored to death. The Bird is much more exciting and a faster<br/>read then this one.
Everyone at some time idolizes someone they consider their god and this book uses the prejudices of the South to show how this young lady began her journey to maturity.
A long awaited novel by an author who is adored by many for her genius and ability to transform her readers to another place and time to witness the story first hand as if part of the story ourselves.  Amazing
Ok, so I'm not gonna go into the whole Atticus-Finch-is-a-racist-and-it's-not-TKAM thing. This is a different book with similar characters as TKAM, but they seem to be almost in an alternate reality (for one thing, we are presented with a different version of Tom Robbins's trial). It's also filled with people that we don't get to know or care about. That's hard to reconcile. It seems like Lee is getting at a fallen-icons-loss-of-innocence story, which might have made a lot more sense if this was Jean Louise's first visit to Maycomb as an adult.....but it's not. She's 26 and has been visiting regularly each year, and only just now noticed that everyone's a racist. She is so gobsmacked by this that she stews on her own for a day and a half without talking to her father or any of the other principal characters about it, reaching HUGE world-shattering conclusions and making drastic decisions in that very short length of time. Every time a character opens their mouth, out falls a stilted set piece about racism or bravery or whatever. The lack of resolution is frustrating - why bother to tell us all this if it's not going anywhere? This books clearly thinks it's schooling you about race relations and heroism again, only this time it has a creepier message.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not taking issue with Atticus as a segregationist per se - that could have been plausible with better writing and editing. I'm pretty surprised and disappointed that a brilliant lawyer would resort to the stupid and lazy "You're a bigot for not accepting my bigotry" argument, and even more so that Jean Louise would swallow it.<br/><br/>tl;dr - it's ok to be a white supremacist as long as you are an honest gentleman about it.
First of all the book is very easy to read as I did it in two sittings, probably around five or six hours.  Second, the book has a lot of flashbacks to when Jen, Scout (Jean Louise), and Hank were children.  That’s good.  Third it’s small town southern thinking in the south, fifty years ago.  After reading the book my main thought and reflection was, how a woman of twenty eight years could be so uniformed, especially after living in New York for a couple of years.  However that’s the story and I must take it as it’s written. The story is told from the viewpoint of Jean Louise and her view of how life should be.  Her take on the issues, right and wrong, is the same as what she thinks her father’s views were when she was a child.  She has carried this notion into the present day, when she visits her home town and father.  When the beliefs she grew up believing true are found to be false, her emotional world is destroyed.<br/>The views presented appear to be factual in nature and within reason and recollection to my memory of events of the time.  I too was dumb as a doorknob when it came to race relations until I entered the military and even there, in the early sixties there were few problems.  I can see why the publisher sent the manuscript back for a rewrite.  I’m glad it was published as written instead of being plied with sugar and spice.
It was interesting to see that such a boring rough draft could be edited into a Pulitzer Prize winning novel.  That is just about the only positive thing I could say.
It's Harper Lee! Enough said! I particularly loved recognizing phrases and descriptive passages used in To Kill a Mockingbird. What a gift from this wonderful author.
Harper Lee is very lucky to have had such a good editor for To Kill a Mockingbird.  If this was published, I don't think she would have had anything else published.
There is no actual story line, and the protagonists is boring and repetitive. The overt racism is disappointing at best.  I hate to think that Harper lee allowed such a rummy book to be published.
This book should never have been published. It espouses the racist dogma so prevalent in the 60s. The publisher took advantage of an old woman to make money.
I approached this novel as a cynic, thinking it was a scheme by promoter and publisher to capitalize on the fame of Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. It was puzzling that a completed manuscript put aside a half century ago would suddenly merit publishing.<br/><br/>I was wrong. GO SET A WATCHMAN is an equally powerful work and as beautifully written.  It takes place in the same setting, Maycomb County Alabama through the voice of a polished adult, Jean Louise known to readers of MOCKING BIRD as Scout, and in a different time from the depression of the thirties: post 1954 Brown v Board of Education.<br/><br/>It may lack the impact of the social justice issue of the Tom Robinson trial in MOCKINGBIRD, but the impact of a child returning home as a refined adult shocked at the hostile change in race relations, is equally effective.<br/><br/>The book has a superbly crafted ending, a bruising, but family-resolving encounter with her Uncle Jack that leaves the reader wondering if anything has changed since.
It is a worthwhile read. The publisher was wise in sending her back to the typewriter for a prequel. Still, "Go, Set a Watchman" is sufficiently interesting not only as a depiction of the aftermath of the portrayal in "To Kill a Mocking Bird." It has its own virtues as well. It is very realistic in portraying good, humane Southerners as incapable of believing the Black people capable of self-governance.  The long-held rationale in the region that made slave holding tenable for such people--that blacks were biologically inferior, incapable of taking the responsibilities of fellow citizens, ran (runs?) deep in the psyches of Southerners generally.  Good men like Scout's father were convinced that totally enfranchising Blacks would mean disaster for the region, for blacks and whites alike.  It seemed to them like responsible citizenship to take whatever action was needed to suppress the civil rights movement.<br/><br/>They were proven wrong, of course. But that is still another story.
I always feel vaguely guilty when I don't like a book that many people rave about.  I am listening to this book on cd and I am on cd 2 and it is just so boring.  Scout seems cartoonish and Henry, whom I don't recall from To Kill A Mockingbird, yet he lived right in their pocket, seems really one-dimensional with his hero-worship of Scout.  The theme at the moment is how low down on the social scale Henry is, or that is how it sounds.  It is just so flat and uninteresting.<br/>Because I borrowed it from the library, I will merely return it.  I am not interested in the main event where apparently a great issue is discussed, that of whether people of all races are equal, because I knew the answer to that one when it actually was being enacted and I know the answer today and who cares what pseudo-intense dialogue I would experience?<br/>I know this is very negative and I did not give it a fair chance but I know boring and inauthentic when I hear it.  Maybe reading the actual book would be different.
I'm not sure this book was written by Harper Lee.  The entire premise of "Mockingbird" has been lost.  This book was, at best, a poor soap opera.
A poorly written book.  Editing clearly lacking and a weak story.  Of interest only because of the huge buildup and all or the notoriety surrounding it.
The main character, Jean Louise Finch, whose childhood nickname is "Scout," travels from New York by rail to visit her family in her childhood hometown of Maycomb, Alabama. During this current visit she stumbles onto an event and becomes the "Watchman" who finally sees what she had never seen before, due to her upbringing in a southern democratic state by a paternalistic, southern lawyer, father. She manages to lift the veil of her childhood and sees the stark reality of southern prejudice in both her own family and the town itself, while also failing to notice her own prejudicial leanings.<br/><br/>This book, by Harper Lee, reads just like To Kill A Mockingbird, but delves deeper into the paternalistic attitude of Atticus Finch and the Finch family; true southern aristocratic democrats. The family's paternalistic attitude toward Negroes and their disgust of White Trash is more apparent in this book than in her first published novel, but it is without a doubt an excellent read, and suggests that with each generation, we can improve our relations with those whose race, or whose culture is different from our own. We simply have to remove our blinders to see what each of us have to contribute to the other.
Disappointing followup to "To Kill A Mockingbird" lacks the glorious prose of the fist book and almost seems as though it is written by someone else. Filled with familiar characters, but Atticus Finch is almost unrecognizable.  His overt racism, while realistic for a southern gentlemen of the period, is still oddly shocking for those familiar with the iconic character of "Mockingbird". There have always been rumors that "Mockingbird" was reworked by Truman Capote and the original editors and publishers when "Watchman" was first submitted for publication. This current work casts some new doubt on whether Harper Lee actually wrote "Mockingbird" completely.  "Watchman" is less a sequel than it is the original outline for "Mockingbird" and was written first, before others reworked it to create the great classic we all know. It is better that we not elevate this book to classic status.  It doesn't really deserve the accolades.
So many moments of humor....especially in the flashbacks.  Also great truths for Scout to realize about herself and the wisdom of her family members...
Go Set a Watchman is the courageous second novel by Harper Lee that adds depth to the characters first introduced in her class 1960 novel, To Kill a Mockingbird.  I enjoyed it immensely!  Robert Grant, author of Naked Tao.
I'm glad this book was published as it tells us more about Harper Lee herself and her father. Much of the dialogue seems contrived and it's hard to get into the story. The book seems carefully edited, in at least one place with more modern cliches than were used at the time. I want to explain, as a southerner from that era, that Atticus is the same Atticus. That's the way whites of his class, and even those who were thought to be progressive and kind, thought. He was right there in court to help his former maid's grandson get representation, just as before, working for justice. But he was a segregationist which as a well-respected white lawyer in rural Alabama he would have been. He believed in the system as most people do and feared change. My relatives were similar and they loved the black people who worked for them. It was a paternalistic system that of course held the blacks down.<br/>Katherine van Wormer<br/>co-author The Maid Narratives
As poor a book as I have ever read.  Tedious, unpleasant, too much summary, especially at the first.  This book should never have been published.
This book absolutely did not even come close to "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I thought it boring and slow.  I would not recommend this book.
Disappointing. Not the worst read ever but certainly not equal to all the build up and not an equal follow up to "to Kill a Mockingbird".
This is a disappointing sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird."  It was clearly written by a white person before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
I just finished reading this book about half an hour ago, so I'm still mulling it over in my mind.  I tried to read it as a separate book from To Kill a Mockingbird because I thought of it as a first draft of that work.  I also tried to read it as a book written about 50 years ago, but just now being published. Of course, it was tough to do, but I attempted to see it from the 1950's perspective, and as such, from the point of view of a lawyer born sometime in the last two decades of the 19th century, someone who would have remembered some aspects of reconstruction. I think if you read it as a sequel to Mockingbird you might well be disappointed. I tried very hard to read it as a work written at the days shortly after Brown v Board of Education and the ugly turn of events in the 1960's.  That's not to say the treatment of African Americans was kind and gentle during this time, only that some naivete on the young author's part existed. What I see this novel as achieving is the beginning of a movement that many saw as necessary if divisive, and those who thought they knew the best way to take care of  what they considered to be childlike adults (a view that I sure many of us rolled our eyes when reading). If you read this book, not as a current work, but rather as a newly published but old manuscript, you may have some insight into a time period that is gone, but still lingers in the the fringes of some folks' minds.
True representation of a first attempt. Lee took someone's advice and went back to the typewriter to create and write one of America's classics.
I can see why Harper Lee decided to stop publishing after "To Kill a Mockingbird".  There was simply NO way to top that incredible tale.
Hilarious, sad, thought-provoking, a reminder of the way we were fifty years ago.  Beautiful descriptions of an American small town, its people and the way the people interact.
I picked up this book as anxious as I have ever been when approaching a text. I love “To Kill a Mockingbird” and was anticipatory and scared when I held Ms. Lee’s only other novel in my hands. I needn’t have been worried.  A disclaimer here, these are my initial thoughts on this book. It merits rereading, as there is much to digest.<br/>The style of “Go Set A Watchman” is instantly recognizable as Harper Lee. In fact there are many phrases, especially in the early chapters where the focus is on setting, that were later used verbatim in “Mockingbird”. Also present are many of the characters we love and remember, the only new character of any special prominence is Henry Clinton, a man the adult Scout is kind of dating, and who was a childhood friend who entered their lives in the period after “Mockingbird” took place. Occasionally in the early chapters Ms. Lee puts us in his head for brief periods. Promoted to more relevance in this text is the character of Uncle Jack, who has moved back to Maycomb from Nashville (where he lived in “Mockingbird”). He is central to this story, and the book’s most profound moments (surprisingly & appropriately) belong to him, not Atticus.<br/>In chapter five we get the first flashback to Scout’s childhood, and I relished the chance to see Jem, Dill, and Scout at their imaginary games once again. It was simply a joy to read in those moments. When the 26 year old Scout has memory flashbacks (there are a few, but not too many) the book is firing on all cylinders.<br/>Chapter 17 deals with constitutional & judicial conservatism. Scout (and perhaps Ms. Lee?) clearly have those beliefs and I fear it will go over the heads of modern readers who have a limited understanding of these issues and how they played out in the racial politics of the 1950s. It is important to remember that at the time this book was written this chapter and its contents would have spoken directly to the audience. It actually still does considering the far reaching Supreme Court rulings of this past year, and Lee handles these issues with dignity and intelligence and it makes me sigh when I realize that this kind of intelligent discourse has probably left the American political stage for good.<br/>Now, to those who have this image of a sacred and infallible Atticus, chapter 18 takes them down and makes it unflinchingly important why this is a bad way to view this character. In “Watchman” Atticus is old and tired and that makes him wonderfully human and in no way diminishes him. All I can say about this chapter (which is the thematic centerpiece of the novel) is wow. It is so wise, so profound, so simple, reminding the reader of everyone’s humanity. I have always loved Attics Finch. He is the father everyone wants for themselves, and what they hope to provide to their children. And he is not possible. “Watchman” brings Atticus into the human realm, and it is important that this happens. I adore him even more now than I did and it is because now that I see he is flawed (not terribly, just realistically) I see how in some manner I could actually be a little like him. And that realization makes me hopeful, and happy.<br/>“Go Set A Watchman” is a wonderful text, full of the vibrant locales and local color that made “Mockingbird” such a delight. You can see how “Mockingbird” was influenced tremendously from this earlier text, and it serves as a great compliment to “Mockingbird” as it rounds out that tale even more completely.
This book was touted as the "Literary Event of the Century". I would preface that with the word "Worst". I looked forward to the release for months and purchased TKAM and re-read it in preparation since I had not read Mockingbird in years. To compare these two books is difficult. Not in the same league; not even in the same ballpark. TKAM has humor, pathos, great dialogue, and is simply but eloquently written with a message mostly shown to us by the actions of well-rounded characters and a great story-line where everything pretty much comes together and the plot comes full circle and at least makes sense. Go Set a Watchman (touted as a sequel) is so poorly written that it made me sick for Harper Lee, to think that someone would take advantage of her name and status from TKAM to publish this "book". There is not much good I can say about it. The characters are flat, stereotypical, and none of them is interesting enough for us to care much about what happens to them. In fact, none of them who were even in TKAM seem like the same people in GSAW.  For example, Scout is no longer even referred to in general by Atticus by her nickname- he almost always refers to her in GSAW by her formal name of Jean Louise, which seems like a very unusual thing for him to call her. It's almost as if she's no longer his daughter. He never really mentions Jem, who (SPOILER ALERT!) has been killed off with barely a mention ( a quick mention of his death, with Hank conveniently taking his place). Dill has become a distant memory and is not an active character. Henry, who was never mentioned in TKAM, is now alive in all Scout's flashbacks to her childhood and adolescence but where was he in TKAM? Atticus is a completely different person, Calpurnia has abandoned the family because suddenly she was so emotionally attached to Jem that once he died, Scout and Atticus no longer matter. There are small passages copied almost verbatim from TKAM (for example, how many times is there mention of Alexandra's corset in an attempt at achieving an hour-glass figure, and the tedious, disjointed history of Maycomb County is almost identical in both books). Poor Boo Radley, such a central figure (albeit, behind-the-scenes for the most part in TKAM) is not even mentioned in GSAW. Dialogue is funny and realistic in TKAM. In GSAW, it's as if the speakers hike up their skirts or pant-legs and climb up on a soapbox and perform a non-musical drama or a soliloquy to the heavens instead of speaking to one another like real people. BTW, lots of unrealistic use of words that no one would use in normal speach, as if the writer is trying to show off. Not only is this unrealistic, but it is so tedious and boring political rhetoric that I could barely get through some of it...it literally goes on for page after page. Amateurish telling instead of showing, lots of exposition for no reason. Add to that the appearance that the author was trying to show off her knowledge of literature every time "Uncle Jack" (referred to by "Jean Louise" (formerly known as "Scout") as "Sir" and as "Dr. Finch" in many passages) opens his mouth. So much of those conversations are so convoluted and preachy that I was embarrassed for the writer. Flashbacks are so long, detailed, and irrelevant that they make the reader lose sight of what was happening prior to each one (and there are quite a few of them). The writing is not lyrical like in TKAM; tense shifts in some chapters from present to past. There is a distance between the writer and the reader- we lose the first person intimacy of TKAM with a detached third person narrator in GSAW. But it is more than point of view...Jean Louise is no longer the Scout we knew from the beloved Mockingbird novel and it is not simply the formality of the more adult name. It goes deeper...her personality has changed to a snobby person who mentions the superiority of New York to the stereotypically-portrayed South with all its "predictable" Southern prejudices, which she somehow never really saw? Her father has become, inexplicably, an entirely different person, a man of noble character in TKAM who, for no reason and beyond believability, is now a racist (but he somehow managed to hide that fact from her for her entire life). Hank also managed to hide his real racial biases from her as well. Seems a bit too conspiratorial, almost pathological and with no real explanation. I realize that the attempt in GSAW is to show disillusionment, but the complete about-face and apparent naivety of the narrator seems very immature, and frankly, unbelievable, as if thrown in for shock effect, or laziness. And her Uncle Jack's explanation? Complete rambling that just filled page after page with literary references that made no sense at all- there were so many, that they became almost comical in the number of references, as if Harper Lee wanted to show off her extensive knowledge of obscure literary characters. This does not even seem typical of the author's character, although she has been reclusive (which makes it even more unbelievable that she would have been so arrogant). Jean Louise's scathing attack on Atticus is unrealistic and his explanations non-sensical...he says that "he had to kill her"? Little mention of Jem and references to him seem to be tossed in and superficial. The ending is unrealistic and unsatisfying. Boring and no real plot, no real action. Like some others, I find it difficult to believe that these books were written by the same person. Maybe I missed something, but some of the references to the past are disparate- for example, I dd not get the reference to a trial Atticus presided over as defense attorney for a black man who was acquitted of rape; this is not what happened in TKAM, of course. I agree that this book is incomplete, more like a jumble of notes thrown together, and might have well been the first draft of TKAM; however, if so, the book was almost completely re-written or edited to the point of a re-write. The writing styles are so different, it is hard to believe that the same author even wrote both books. One seems lovingly written, the other seems bitter and angry. One gets its point across by showing us, the other fails miserably by trying to tell us.<br/><br/>I not only pre-ordered the book in Kindle format from Amazon, but I also used an Audible credit to pre-order the audible version. I am going to request a refund for that...the Kindle version wasted enough of my money. I feel that, whatever the real story is regardsing TKAM vs GSAW, Harper Lee's reputation has been sullied. If she had wanted to pulblish this, she would have done so. Poor thing, she should have burned GSAW if it was in fact written by her years ago.
There is nothing like waiting almost five decades for a book's publication to whet the appetite. This much awaited "sequel" to To Kill a Mockingbird picks up with the Finches almost twenty years since Scout's childhood memories of Boo Radley and Tom Robinson's trial. Atticus has arthritis and is visibly declining before Scout's eyes and her beloved protector of an older brother, Jem, "dropped dead in his tracks" in his youth of unexplained circumstances. Once the reader recovers from these early bombshells and is ready for some "good" news, Scout discovers that her moral compass (or watchman--a biblical allusion to Ezekial that is central to the text) has joined the Maycomb city council's efforts to fight the Supreme Court's recent Brown vs. Board of Education decision. It is this discovery that shakes Scout to her core, and sends her reeling into fury and depression as she realizes that the one person she thought she could trust was no better than all the open racists in Alabama. The confrontation between Scout and her father is painful to read from a 21st century perspective. Both Scout and her father show attitudes that most Americans would find deplorable in 2015, but that resonate with current events such as the Charleston church mass killing and the subsequent Confederate flag debate. While Atticus allows Scout free rein to her own "conscience," it is her Uncle Jack who helps Scout come to terms with her adult realization that her father is a product of his time and place. He helps her see a flawed man, who may have different political and racial opinions than her own, but a man who has lived his life with honor to the "spirit and letter" of the law he was entrusted to uphold. Jack's advice that "Every man's island, Jean Louise, every man's watchman, is his conscience" and that achieving an individual conscience requires "separation pain" from the idols of our youth is one of the most memorable conversations in this novel. Without To Kill a Mockingbird, this novel would not be a classic--it lacks the Southern gothic descriptive magic of its prequel, and the memorable supporting characters of Jem, Dill and Boo Radley, but I am grateful for its publication, as we gain a more nuanced understanding of the Finches and see that Scout has applied the lessons of her once idealized childhood to her complex adult life, and is the true watchman, or heroine of the family.

Disappointment does not begin to describe what happened after I cracked open the cover and began to read. There are many things that can be said for the development (or lack there of) of character, plot, and theme. But boiling down to its foundation, the truth is that these characters that we fell in love with in "Mockingbird", these larger than life  people that defined the struggle of growing up, of standing up for your beliefs in the face of pressure, turned out to be the most ordinary, smaller than life people that it's almost impossible to care about.  Each is whirling in his/her own world without a great understanding of anyone else's.  My heart goes out to Ms. Lee because I think she deserves better than to have this published.  It reads like an unedited draft and that where it should have stayed: as a draft. Shame on those involved in the selling of and publishing of this less than ready for publication work.
I am not a book critic. But I feel the need to express a disappointment in this novel. As you might have figured out by now, this is not a sequel. It is more like a parallel universe to the story in To Kill a Mockingbird. There are also paragraphs of exact duplication between the two books. This favors the theory that the book was a first attempt at expressing a civil rights theme through a story told through the eyes of a southern girl.  In short, I am glad they chose To Kill a Mockingbird first. And if nothing else, this book got me to read and appreciate it again. If this would have been sold as a "draft work of a novel by a great author" rather than a sequel of an amazing novel that was "found by a friend" I think I would have been a little less disappointed.<br/><br/>All that said - if you do choose to read it, make sure you read it all the way through. The last two chapters are somewhat redeeming.
I loved this book. For the life of me I can't understand all the negative reviews it received.  My only guess would be that the reviewers were born after the fifties and truly do not understand the unrest and conflict concerning desegregation.  Although Atticus may have some currently unpopular opinions, they were not that unpopular during the fifties and he still remains a caring and gentle man.  It was wonderful to reconnect with Jean Marie (Scout), Atticus, Dill, Calpurnia and others in Maycomb.  I was sorry to learn that Jem had died and a little surprised that Boo Radley wasn't even mentioned in Go Set A Watchman. Since To Kill A Mockingbird has been my favorite book for many years, reading about Maycomb and the residents there was like finding old friends again.  My only regret is that there will not be any more of Harper Lee's wonderful books.  I read this one very slowly because I simply did not want it to end.
it's just ok. If you're curious about it, wait until you can get it for free or its paperback is $3 on Prime. It just never went anywhere. I disagree with those that think it's "powerful."  There's nothing powerful about it. It's like watching people you know in community theater. It seems pretty good but maybe it's not that the play is any good, but that you like it because you know everyone who is acting. Definitely not a "blow you away" from paragraph 1 type of book like Mockingbird. Maybe it's a lesson that even great writers need great editors. I think it would have been way more interesting, for example, if she had teased out the subtly in contradiction of velvet gloved racism by purported Christians. Instead, her protagonist comes to terms with this in less than a page of dialog. She goes from screaming, cussing mad about it to: "oh well, then, it is what it is." in a flash. Ham handed.
All other considerations (her OTHER book) aside, Go Set a Watchman is wonderful. It captures the early Civil Rights period in the South through the eyes and heart of Jean Louise Finch, a headstrong young woman raised in a small Alabama town, home for a visit, who discovers that things have changed. The old comfort between blacks and whites has become tension. Her old nurse has moved on and seems to have lost all affection for her. Her family hint that danger lies ahead. Her old boyfriend, now a lawyer in partnership with her father, is a member in good standing of the White Citizen's Council. Can this be the quiet, loving town she was always so comfortable in?<br/><br/>The character of Jean Louise is bright, witty and not a little sarcastic. She remembers her childhood as she wanders through town, and Miss Lee is expert in calling back the play and prankishness of children left to their own devices. And she examines the many faces of love when she is challenged to discuss the racial situation with the father she once worshiped. She is a whole human being, fully realized and fully a woman, and in this book her father comes through as calm, conservative, and even wise, although she, as a young and vital woman with worlds to conquer, must reject his values while loving him still, in a different way. It's a quick read, full of insights and humor, and totally engaging.
Disappointing and should never have been published. Much has been said about the disappointing revision of Atticus' character -- so I won't repeat that thought here, though I agree with it.<br/><br/>The real problem is that this book tries to make a hero of an unreliable narrator, and fails. Scout is not a heroine, and nothing in the character development or plot of this book make her so. Instead of trying to make her a heroine with character development or a decent plot, the story tears Atticus down and then puts a puppet, his brother, in his place, to give voice to the real conscience of the novel. The only things that make it bearable are Scout's (long!) flashbacks to when she was a child. Those parts were like visiting an old friend. Though one of the flashbacks, Scout's "pregnancy scare," was cheap and unbelievable.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's raking in the bucks, but at what cost to literature?
Lot's of filler in this book, flashbacks to Scout's childhood, that have nothing to do with the main storyline.<br/>Jean Louise's assumption that Atticus is immoral because he attends a citizen's council meeting in the company of people of poor character is a reflection of her immaturity and impulsiveness. It is also an indicator of her inability to remember what her father told her as a child: "you can never understand a person until you step inside his shoes and see things from his point of view". Jean Louise left Alabama to live in New York forgetting the culture, right or wrong, of where she was raised. A confrontation between them both, initiated by Jean Louise, reinforces that lesson.<br/>The reference to the Old Testament quote of setting a watchman is a great reminder to us all of the importance of having a check & balance on our conscience.<br/>Not great but a must read for anyone who is a fan of the original.
"I was an exceedingly odd young lady --- Suffering much from spleen and vapors."  Scout Finch is all grown up at 26 and  is returning home for her 2 week visit to Maycomb.  This book is thoughtful, evocative, argumentative and extremely well composed.  The narration and dialogue are top notch and you feel and think what Jean Louise Finch is thinking and feeling.  A wonderful conclusion to, To Kill a Mockingbird.  "I need a watchman to lead me around and declare what he seeth every hour on the hour.  I need a watchmen to tell me this is what a man says but this is what he means, to draw a line down the middle and say here is justice and make me understand the difference."  Scout finally comes to terms with the fact that her father Atticus Finch is not the man that she set upon a pillar all her life.  He is just a man like any other and he makes mistakes just as any other might make.  Enjoy!
After generations of segregation and the supporting belief in the inferiority of the Negro race, the good citizens of The South found themselves sitting next to the descendants of slaves in schools and at lunch counters. It was an uncomfortable if not downright ugly time. But it passed, as generations grew up with different ideas.<br/><br/>Unless you are old enough to have lived through that time, you most likely have no understanding of what a shock desegregation was to both Whites and Blacks, alike. Particularly in the South where the lines had been so carefully drawn by society. Until desegregation, both races had lived in a sort of understood equilibrium that suddenly became a disturbing disequilibrium. Regardless of intent (not every White hated Blacks, and vice versa) people didn't know what to do. It was a huge change that happened very fast. Adjustments were confusing and insecure.<br/><br/>It's about time to look back on that time, honestly. And this book presents a good introduction.<br/><br/>Forget the silliness of "OMG! Atticus is a racist!"<br/><br/>He isn't anything different than he ever was. The Times just changed.
This was kind of a disappointment.  The difference in Atticus Finch from "Mockingbird" to "Watchman" was not the problem.  Even though "Watchman" was written before "Mockingbird," the evolution of Atticus was interesting and not unexpected.  What was problematic for me was the actual writing and editing.  I found this a hard book to read, it was choppy and things did not flow as you'd expect in a well  edited book.  Perhaps it wasn't edited at all to conserve Ms. Lee's original voice, but as I understand it, she'd shopped it around unsuccessfully for years so it never really got the professional edit for continuity and readability it would have gotten had it been published back in the 50s.  Too bad.  A little work on this to make it more readable, and the evolution of characters within the context of the times may have made it as excellent a read as "Mockingbird."
I actually wouldn't give it any stars.  I couldn't get through it.  It reads like a first draft of something better, which it probably was.
Didn't like it atvall
Did not hold my interest.  I think I expected too much from it.<br/>Nowhere near To Kill A Mockingbird. I probably wouldn't recommend it.
Not as good as her first book. This was a sad, disappointing story. Unexpected content, after having grown up with, To Kill A Mockingbird.
After all of the articles about Atticus Finch's racism, I was pleasantly surprised with Go Set A Watchman.  It ideally aligns with To Kill A Mockingbird when you consider the narrator.  In the first best seller, Scout is the voice.  Her father, Atticus, is a saint . . . a God . . . a perfect man.  In the new best seller Scout grew into a mid-20's Jean Louise.  A third party is narrating.  Reality is setting in.  What Jean Louise sees in her father, as an adult, may have always been there had Atticus not been a saint in her mind.  Regardless, Jean Louise is the primary character, not her dad.  The theme is dealing with change.  There is change in her town, her family, and the society.  How each character deals with Jean Louise, as she pushes back on change and reality, is brings complexity, and satisfaction for both books by Harper Lee.  I hope a third book is found.  She remains a great writer.
As you may know, Go Set a Watchman, penned before To Kill Mockingbird but set nearly 20-year later, takes place in the same fictional Southern town as Mockingbird (Maycomb, Alabama) and has many of the same characters. Except, as people do over time, Scout, Calpurnia, Atticus, and the rest of the holdover characters are much different than the iterations of them that we come to know in To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman takes place in the 1950s, when Scout (now 26 and known by the more adult “Jean Louise”) returns to Maycomb after living in New York City. But Jean Louise doesn’t return to the same old home she left. Modern creature comforts (e.g. televisions) are now ubiquitous and we watch as she grapples with understanding how the people and places she has long loved have changed along with (or, rather, have failed to keep pace with) a modernizing society.<br/><br/>What is shocking to any reader who loved To Kill a Mockingbird, nobody has changed more than Jean Louise’s beloved father, Atticus. Scout returns not long after the Supreme Court’s seminal Brown v. The Board of Education case, but learns that her father is not the crusader for equality and justice that she idolized in Mockingbird. Rather, Atticus has become what in many ways is a modern conservative trope – a segregationist and anti-Federalist who believes strongly in the rights of the states to determine their own path but also shares dark and ugly beliefs about the superiority of the White race.<br/><br/>As Scout comes to grips with her father’s abhorrent proclivities, we also watch her as she awkwardly tries to shed her tomboyish ways and navigate romantic interests. As Jean Louise moves through the novel, it is clear that she feels like she has one foot in two different lives, and is struggling to find her place in the world.<br/><br/>In the end, this novel will likely be a bit of a disppointment to those who, like me, loved To Kill a Mockingbird. At times, the novel can feel very disjointed and lose pace, and can be especially confusing and out of place as we learn more about the new Atticus, who quite simply seems like the same literary character in name only. Nevertheless, this novel is worth a read though it ultimately falls short of the lofty mark set by Mockingbird.
I wanted to read Go Set a Watchman to see what all the hype was about. I didn't know what to expect. I tried to enjoy it for what it is - a writer's first novel set in the 1950's in a southern Alabama town called Maycomb.  If this had been written by an unknown author, it would never have been published.<br/><br/>I have read To Kill a Mockingbird and saw the movie. I tried not to compare these two books but it's hard to do since there are so many of the same characters. The content is from another era and reading the terminology used then was hard for me.<br/><br/>The author did a nice job on the flashbacks to Jean Louise's (Scout's) childhood. Otherwise, it seems as though Jean Louise has not matured as much as she should have since leaving Maycomb. Even she should have known that nothing remains the same:  people, towns, and other things change. It's incredibly hard to come home again.
Let me preface this by saying I was very torn about buying and reading this book. First of all, To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book of all time and knew this would be hard to top. Second, I think Harper Lee did not ever want the book published and was being taken advantage of by people.  If she really wanted it published it wouldn't have taken 55 years for her to agree.  With that being said I am glad I read the book, it was ok.  It was not really a sequel as it is advertised but a series of flashbacks to Scout in high school and her at age 26.  Jean Louise (Scout) is her usual spunky self but Atticus' character is flat. I didn't hate Atticus at the end but I think Scout came to the realization that her father was not a God.  I didn't care for her relationship with Henry, it seemed forced.  I wasn't disappointed I read it because my expectations weren't that high, it was better than I thought it would be but I definitely wouldn't call it a sequel but vignettes of Scout's life and how Maycomb, Alabama changed over the years.
My reaction to this book is WOW. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is told from the point of view of a little girl living in the south in the 1930's.She worships her father like little girls do.The people around her are loving as they guide Scout and Jem.We also see the the south of this  time.through the townspeople. We are horrified by what happens at the trial of Tom Robinson.GO SET A WATCHMAN is set in the 1950's south. Scout is now a woman and like all girls her image of her father must give way to reality.The south is changing too. Scout wants fairness.Atticus represents the segregationist views of many people in the south at this time.The painful years of the civil rights movement are still ahead . Scout is in the process of changing as the people of the south will change in the years to come.  As someone from the south ,I believe this is a story of us.
Not only does Atticus Finch, one of the greatest heroes in literary history come across as a racist (You don't need to join the KKK just to know your enemies are wrong) but he is also portrayed as being a lousy father that doesn't really understand his daughter Scout (Scout tells her Grandad Atticus doesn't understand women and their issues). This is a complete and utter contradiction of the character of Atticus in To Kill A Mockingbird. Furthermore these contradictions of character are never explained or explored. If you really enjoy books that destroys heroes, this is the book for you. I think Harper Lee has issues with men and decided it was time to kill off any semblance of a strong male character and make pile of money for her family. I wish I'd never read Go Set A Watchmen. It has a very thin plot which spends too much time reflecting on events that have happened and really reads like a first draft at best (the one star is for the cover-art). I plan on re-reading To Kill A Mockingbird to get this bad taste out of my mind.
This novel offers historical interest for  HL fans- otherwise it is such a shame to dilute her perfect legacy with this dull read.
I loved To Kill a Mockingbird, so I was eager to read this book, which was my Book Club’s latest selection.  Boy, was I disappointed!  Half way through I kept telling myself “it’s got to get better soon,” or, “any page now it will start coming together and make some sense”.  Jean Louise (Scout’s) private introspections rambled on and on occasionally interspersed with a fleeting temper tantrum aimed at relatives or longtime boyfriend and that was about it.  Chapter after chapter I kept asking myself when the plot would reveal itself.  I would have stopped reading and chucked the book shortly after the half-way point, but dedication to my book club kept me going.<br/><br/>I read this novel on my Kindle, and lost track of how far I was into it when suddenly it was all done.  The End.  WHAT?!  THAT’S IT??!!  Well, that was a HUGE waste of time!
Not as well written as To Kill a Mockingbird.  Story is disjointed and does not have the nuance that the more famous version has.
Don't bother spending money on this, borrow it from your local library if you are curious.  Doesn't come close to her other book.
I see why she didn't publish this after publishing Mockingbird. I'll just regard this as a practice novel.  Weak characterization, slim plot, and boring.
After reading several reviews of Harper Lee's novel, "Go Set a Watchman', I was somewhat afraid that this book would disavow all that Atticus Finch stood and meant to be as a book and motion picture in her "To Kill A Mocking Bird".  But, I was wrong.  To me, this is not the story of Scout's father Finch becoming a racist.  Instead it is a coming of age novel in which Scott, 20 + years later than she was in "To Kill a Mockingbird", has to come to the realization that her father was not or is G-D. It is important for her, the town, and her father for this to happen so Scout can get on with her life without always asking herself, 'what would Atticus do'.  In short, it is time for Scout to grow up.  I liked that. Also, Atticus Finch never uses foul racist language in the book.  That he hears from others, but does nothing about it, probably because the novel takes place right after 'Brown vs. Board of Education' in 1954 which totally alienated many long time southerners.
A surprising but excellent development of a fallen hero. Atticus wounds me with his ideas, but I love the thread of the book.
A true let-down. After all the hype I was very disappointed. It took reading 30% of the book to figure out where she was going with the story.
I didn't like the book.  I enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird but this book seemed to take so much away from the original.
Reading this as an adult really puts to kill a mockingbird in perspective. As we get older we realize the world is grey not black and white.
I feel so bad for Harper Lee.  There was a reason she never wanted to publish this book - it stinks.  That's why she wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird" using the same characters, but completely changing everything.  This book is a giant ripoff and probably never would have been published if she had tried (I don't know if she did).  The book is so boring and contains giant arguments between Scout and her father that I didn't even understand.  The arguments went on and on for pages and pages, and then magically, their differences were resolved.  Huh??<br/><br/>Nothing interesting happens in this book.  In this book, the black man is found not guilty after the trial.  In TKAM, he is found guilty.  There is at least one passage that is verbatim in both books.  Read the book if you like, but borrow it, or wait until you can get it for a quarter at a book sale.  I'm sorry, Ms. Lee, you were right all along.
Wonderful story, I was apprehensive at first but once you understand the underlying subtext it all becomes clear. Would definitely suggest
I'm going to be honest here: I have not read this book and I don't plan to. I know, I know; this completely discredits me as a reviewer, but bear with me for a second. I've heard about a lot of dissapintment surrounding this book; mainly because everyone's beloved Atticus has done a complete180 personality change. Why? Simply because Go Set a Watchman was written BEFORE To Kill a Mockingbird, so of course Atticus is going to be different. And don't nt forget Harper Lee never wanted the book published in the first place. I don't know if the rumors about the publishers tricking her into publishing the story by taking advantage of her dementia are true, but I do find it odd that she published this story after many years of being admant about not writing again.
I wanted to love this book. I am always worried when a sequel or anything like it comes out. I was wanting this to be on my classics list as TKAM was. And while there were a couple of entertaining parts and some good quotes and one-liners, this book just confused me. I hated that Scout would go in and out of first person. I hated what Atticus has become. I still love the writing style for the most part but if there were race motivated problems with TKAM it seems to me, this one is flat out rough. Where in TKAM the story sort of takes on a civil rights cause, this one just demolishes it. Maybe I misunderstood. The characters explanation of why were somewhat vague to me.  I feel like there should have been a better solution in the end. Not my favorite. Dang.
I see I am not  the only person in the world who was disappointed in this book. Harper Lee's writing style in tis book is so different from To Kill a Mockingbird that I would think it was written by someone.else. The narrative was plodding and the dialogue was overkill and the plot was...well, not there.  The highlights were Scout's reminiscences, but otherwise it was a bit boring and I had to force myself to finish. There were some good points made, but some were just beaten to death. Uncle Jack's rambling robbed the impact of what he was trying to say. I had to read his dialogue twice to make sense of it. There were two other events in the book that I didn't care for, but I don't want to give away any spoilers. I really wanted to like this book, but I felt as if I were reading a first draft. There is so much potential for this to be a great book, but to me it comes across as an overlong short story.
I wanted to love this more. Lee builds incredible characters and scenes, and like its predecessor, Go Set a Watchman delivers that much. The pace was steady -- not fast, not heart-pounding by any means, but even in the chapters where we're getting to learn the characters, you feel part of the story and you want to read on.<br/><br/>Where it went wrong for me was the climax and conclusion, which I will not reveal here. The almost unbelievable way in which Scout resolves the main plot point made me almost angry. Perhaps it was more revealing of the characters than I was ready for, but I think it was more of a revelation of Lee's personality.<br/><br/>Worth a read for the joy of savoring her structure, but don't expect the ending to satisfy.
All hype, boring.
Doesn't seem like author who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird could possibly have written this. Such a disappointment.
My thoughts on Go Set a Watchman: ***Possible Spoilers Ahead***<br/><br/>I read it once and unlike To Kill a Mockingbird,  it will not be read again.<br/><br/>I know it is said to be the first version and unedited but the inconsistencies around Tom's trial are too much to overcome. Not only are the details about why he was on trial wrong,  but so was the result.<br/><br/>Scout's interaction with Calpurnia was completely unbelievable. She would never treat Scout that way.<br/><br/>The character development was horrid and non-existent,  almost as if we were supposed to already know all about the characters and needed no introduction to them.<br/><br/>I have serious doubts about this actually being the first book written,  for the reasons above and because it makes little sense without the context of TKAM.<br/><br/>I also have serious doubts about it even being penned by Harper Lee. It feels awkward,  as if someone made a very poor attempt of copying her writing style.<br/><br/>I wanted to like the book because of TKAM,  but I can't.
Glad to see Scout  grown up. Brought back memories of life in Alabama and that era we went through in the south.
There were many parts of the book where it was not clear who was speaking, particularly when there were 3 characters involved in the discussion; not enough groundwork earlier in the book gave the reader the knowledge necessary to sort the response of each character.  Better editing would have helped the story flow better as there were repeated statements where none was needed.  The other thing that seemed inconsistent was the extreme little girl outlook on people and life when you take into account that Scout was 26 and had lived/worked in New York City for some time.  She had to be either totally asleep at the wheel or simply stupid to be so naive and I don't believe either was true because of the later content of her arguments.
I'm really glad I read this book. I was afraid of the controversies that surrounded its release, and I did not want to be disillusioned by any of the characters.<br/><br/>The more I think about it, the more I believe this novel does not necessarily address bigotry, but the underlying cause of it. Its characters are profound and human. Their conversations are harsh and shocking, but the reality is they still this same dialogue takes place all over the world, not just in the South.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is about relationships, about the preservation of a culture at the expense of another one. It deals with the need to feel acceptance and the fear of stepping out of your comfort zone. These wonderful characters are trapped in their own prejudices, and it takes someone as feisty and beautiful as Scout Finch to point it out to them.<br/><br/>I loved this book!
Atticus did not hate blacks nor did he fear them. Rather he thought them children who he needed to protect. He believed that in time they would perhaps become a mature race but that they were not at that point in their evolution. He, like most southerners at the time resist change. It scares them. But, he attended a Klan meeting only to find out who was behind the masks. He's still a decent person. He's just a man and not a god like his daughter thought he was. The town is racist and "many" whites do feel superior for the most part. But the Finches really do not.<br/><br/>The book is structured like a first draft and it is far from polished. The transitions are awkward and I doubt the book will be anywhere near Mockingbird. But, in my opinion, for it's historical value alone, it is a rich read.<br/><br/>Atticus and his male friends were concerned with what they felt was being destroyed in the Constitution, namely the Tenth Amendment. That amendment reads, "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." In other words, states rights.<br/><br/>Atticus told his daughter that "Negroes" were not capable of holding important jobs or running towns. Of course, his daughter greatly disagrees. She is hurt by things that came out of her father's mouth at a meeting when he did not know she was listening.<br/><br/>"After the verdict, he walked out of the courtroom in the middle of the day, walked home, and took a steaming bath. He never counted what it cost him; he never looked back. He never knew two pairs of eyes like his own were watching him from the balcony. . . ."<br/><br/>I also saw, although it was tacit, that Scout was, what I always thought, a lesbian. Not overtly. Not ever mentioned. But even in her relationship with the man she "thought" she loved, she showed all the signs of not being heterosexual. And her aunt Alexandra appeared to be of a similar nature although she had been married and had one son.<br/><br/>"Uncle Jimmy’s defection caused not a ripple on Alexandra’s bland horizon: her Missionary Society refreshments were still the best in town; her activities in Maycomb’s three cultural clubs increased; she improved her collection of milk glass when Atticus pried Uncle Jimmy’s money loose from him; in short, she despised men and thrived out of their presence. That her son had developed all the latent characteristics of a three-dollar bill escaped her notice—all she knew was that she was glad he lived in Birmingham because he was oppressively devoted to her, which meant that she felt obliged to make an effort to reciprocate, which she could not with any spontaneity do."<br/><br/>You have to read between the lines and understand these things or you totally miss them. And most people will indeed miss them. "It had never fully occurred to Jean Louise that she was a girl: her life had been one of reckless, pummeling activity; fighting, football, climbing, keeping up with Jem, and besting anyone her own age in any contest requiring physical prowess. When she was calm enough to listen, she considered that a cruel practical joke had been played upon her: she must now go into a world of femininity, a world she despised, could not comprehend nor defend herself against, a world that did not want her."<br/><br/>This book can't compare with Mockingbird. It's a different book entirely. It is, I think, I terrific and very raw discussion, debate, on race. One who is a child of the fifties, as I am, can understand both sides. That does not mean condone a side but understand. The two words are not synonymous.<br/><br/>Jean Louise was hurt terribly by her father and she lost all faith in him. She had been living in New York and she had seen a different kind of life. Also she never heard her father talk the way she did at the meeting. Her hurt was very real and raw and she returned to New York.<br/><br/>At the end, however, she talks candidly to her Uncle Jack, Atticus' brother. He calls her a bigot. She looked the word up in the dictionary. "One obstinately or intolerably devoted to his own church, party, belief, or opinion."<br/><br/>Jack tells her kindly that she didn't like what she heard and what she saw from the people in the town. He said, "You said, in effect, 'I don't like the way these people do, so I have no time for them.'<br/><br/>He then says, "You'd better take time for 'em, honey, otherwise you'll never grow. You'll be the same at sixty as you are now --- then you'll be a case and not my niece. You have a tendency not to give anybody elbow room in your mind for their ideas, no matter how silly you think they are."<br/><br/>In the end, she understands her father and respects the fact that he's trying to preserve the south for her and others like her. She sees he defends blacks and is not a hater, regardless of what he may say or do or have done.<br/><br/>This story, in my opinion, is autobiographical. I found it a good read and good writing for the first draft of a novel. I rather imagine it will be studied by writers for many years and certainly studied by historians.
I so wanted this book to be a timeless classic .. and it does have a few moments.<br/>But most of those parts are when Scout reflects back to her childhood. It's easy to see why her publisher felt that was where the real treasure existed and asked her to center a story there, hence the birth of Mockingbird.<br/>The writing is not terribly nuanced, the main storyline is pretty much a forth grade level plot, and the whole thing is wrapped up in the final pages with major handwringing and page upon page of diatribes reminiscent of Ayn Rand, like it was time to hammer the message into the reader's head.<br/>You won't appreciate Atticus any less but like most sequels to something special, it will leave you a bit disappointed.
Enjoyed reading this novel.  It was definately written by Harper Lee.  So sorry this will be her last writing.
The entire book is a disappointment on all levels...boring story, mediocre writing, empty characters, no plot.
This is the original book that Harper Lee wrote. After editorial critisism she wrote her landmark novel: To Kill a Mockngbird.<br/><br/>This book is disjointed and difficult to follow at times.<br/><br/>There is NO reason to read this book. It is confusing and can be hard to follow. It totally corrupts one's image of Atticus Finch, making him out to be a racial bigot. Ditto for all Scout's relatives. The housekeeper who raised Scout doesn't want to see her.<br/><br/>If you loved To Kill a Mockingbird--book and/or movie, save your money. This book offers NOTHING except the reason/s why Harper Lee's original book was tossed back.  Unless you are a historian or critic, this book is a waste of your time and money, IMO.
It was a hard read for me, growing up in that era.  It was extremely thought provoking.  My feelings and thoughts were so twisted and mixed I had to read it again immediately in order to try and digest all that was happening and how the main characters really felt.  I had wanted to buy the book for my granddaughters because they love "To Kill a Mockingbird" so much.  But after reading it, I decided there was no way at there age 15 and 16 that they could possible understand the social climate of that time period.  I found it disturbing but at the same time true to the feelings of the people of south at that time.  Younger people like me were confused and my elders were very set in their ideas and ways.
Very disappointing. Ms. Lee's wishes should have honored and this book should have NEVER been published!!!!
I loved this book, just as I loved To Kill a Mockingbird.  Harper Lee is a Pulitzer -prize winning author and she can tell a story that draws the reader into the details without them realizing it. I did not even admit that I wanted to know what had happened to Scout and Atticus, but I pre-ordered this book at first mention and waited patiently for its release. I was concerned about the negative publicity that surrounded its release, but once I read the entire book I made my own decision. I loved it!  I am so glad that it was published after all these years instead of before TKAM. GSAW is clearly the book where Jean Louise "comes of age" and TKAM is her world before this. Both books tell accurate, but not pretty, stories of the South in the 60's. I wish  we could find out how Jean Louise deals with the issues of today.
Excellent prequel. The characters are filled with depth, new meaning, and questions are finally answered that the original book did not want to address with regards to the struggles of the period, culture, class and white privilege - an ongoing crisis in America. The writing is a lyrical, visionary combination of words that only Lee could have written. I was embraced by the dialogue from the very first page. Hold space for this book, be open and willing to step through and embrace this hero's journey in the next chapter of Scout and Atticus's life. Don't compare or contrast this book - it contains a message on its own merit and therefore should not be judged with "Mockingbird." Sometimes our hero's turn out to be better than we could have ever imagined and provides for us a more meaningful step towards the truth.
The high rating on this book is all for Scout! She is amazing. Even though this book was written before To Kill A Mockingbird, it's still the same ole Scout. She cusses up a storm, doesn't put up with anyone's nonsense and fights for what is right!<br/><br/>I was very sad at some things in the book..no spoilers. And there are some things that just made me sick. I could understand Scout up there cussing every body and their mama!<br/><br/>Aunt Alexandra is the same hateful woman. I thought she needed to be smacked in Mockingbird and she needs to be smacked again in this book!<br/><br/>I loved how they put in some of the old times with the kids when they were young. It makes me want to go and put in the movie :)<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone that did have a great love of Scout, but know that it's a bit rough to say the least!<br/><br/>MY REVIEWS:<br/>www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.com<br/>https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1189756746
Wow, what a disappointment!  "To Kill a Mockingbird" is such a classic, and such a feel good story.  So I was pretty excited to read this new book by her, with Scout as an adult.<br/><br/>For the first half of the book nothing happens.  Nothing.  Then we have the revelation, Atticus is a racist!  So is her boyfriend, who she is considering marrying.  So is their housekeeper.  Sorry, just couldn't buy it.  It seemed contrived, and unbelievable.  Not just because it was Atticus, though that was some of it.  But all those years growing up with these people they never said anything that would make you think they were bigoted?  Couldn't have happened.  The conclusion of the story just gets even worse.<br/><br/>The writing was weak, the story unreal.  I was glad to finish it and move on to something better.
Horrible book. If you want to feel depressed and disappointed this is the book to read. So disappointed.
I hated this book.  I cannot believe the same person who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird wrote this.  I wish I had not wasted my money on this.  It, in no way worked for me.
I did not go into this experience expecting the novel to be a true "sequel" to "Mockingbird'.  It is always hard to follow a classic with another classic.  I went in expecting to see the changes in the main characters over time. Some reviews that I saw before reading the novel indicated that Atticus had become a bigot.  I saw an element of that, but also saw a element of how events and different belief systems influence life choices. I enjoy Harper Lee's narrative of some rich characters and a way of life and I thought that the novel, though essentially fiction, did give some insight as to political and social issues that developed during the era that this novel is set.
Terrible writing and boring book. It doesn't seem possible that the same person wrote GSAW and TKAM. Save your money on this one. I wish I had.
Absolutely great read. I grew up in Alabama in the 50's and 60's.  Harper Lee very accurately depicts the behavior, language and mindset of many people from that time and place.  I could totally relate to the characters and almost felt that I knew them myself, in my youth.  Having lived in the time and setting of this story probably made it much more enjoyable to me than someone who never experienced this southern culture first hand. Still, I think it reveals a very realistic picture of the thinking of many of the southern people from that era and would be a very worth while read for anyone who would like to know more about that time and place and the race relations that existed.
I understand why this novel was considered a first draft, or a rough draft and completely rewritten. The story was okay, but so many times I felt bounced around from one thought to the next. One minute we were in the present and the next we were lost somewhere in the past. Scout evolves somewhat as a character, and I was glad to understand Alexandra and Uncle Jack better, but I honestly didn't have much excitement for the story. I read this with a complete open mind and kept my love for To Kill a Mockingbird separate so that I could really try and enjoy it. She poured her heart into this novel and even though it was not my favorite I am sure others would love it for what it is.
This was a very good read.  While I'm sure many were expecting 'To Kill a Mockingbird' part two, this wasn't exactly it.  It is obviously an early work of a very talented novelist, it was not as disappointing as others have said.  I did like that I could see the character of Scout grown up, turning into a very intelligent and honor bound woman, as I dreamed she would be.<br/>But I don't believe that this was written as the sequel that it's being sold as, I believe it's just another representation of Harper Lee's life. I believe it represents the era and the place where it was set: rural Alabama. It was told in a very honest and entertaining style, I would recommend this novel.
I have been teaching To Kill A Mockingbird for over 25 years, and was so excited about reading this. It was a big disappointment. Harper Lee's writing is certainly more polished in Mockingbird. The thing that disappointed me most is that I could not develop any love or sympathy for any of the characters. Even nasty old Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose was a redeemable character when Atticus uses her as an object lesson for Jem about courage. There is not much to like about any of the characters in Go Set A Watchman. There is passion, nobility, or depth to the story.  It is my fervent wish that Ms. Lee's Great American literary legacy will not be lessened by this unfortunate book.
Just finished. Could not put it down. Funny and charming in parts. Mainly, I suppose it's a brutally honest portrayal of seeing what really is, rather than what we always wanted to believe. Kinda makes me sad. But I will always treasure TKAMB because I read it when I was 10 and it set my world on fire for books and for racial justice.  Watchman may well be my own personal reality check about my part in today's racial/social challenges. Just as my beloved Scout's eyes were opened, so, too, are mine. In its own right, Watchman may be just as explosive as TKAMB was if people will stop for reflection, self examination and consider what actions are needed in our own hometowns.
I gave this novel five stars, not because it was written as the best piece I have read ,but because it had so many simplistic but heart touching moments when you knew it was Harper Lee speaking to you. The scene with Calpurnia was one which really hit home and is the essence of the title. Was this a finished,polished work? Absolutely not! It could have used an editor, for sure. However, it truly had glimpses of the author we came to know and love and leaving it exactly as she wrote it shows you how far she came with the publication of her masterpiece. More people should keep that in mind when they read this amd take it for what it was, a first attempt at writing a novel.
I can't imagine having any understanding of "Go Set A Watchman" without having first read "To Kill A Mockingbird" or at least seen the famous film. Watchman reads somewhat interestingly in a "Whatever happened to..." sort of way, but that is really the only thing about it that stands out. If you want some "further adventures of Scout" you are in for a small treat, albeit rather bittersweet. I'll admit to questioning the origins of this novel. I wonder if it was a sequel Harper Lee might have attempted and abandoned AFTER the publication of Mockingbird. We probably will never know. So, for Mockingbird fans, Watchman is a curiosity at best.
Very dissapointing. I don't think she ever intended this to be published; my guess would be she was talked into it in her dotage and didn't have full control of her faculties when the decision was made. It's not ready for public consumption, full of scenes with one character sitting quietly while the other explains how the world works - violates the "show, don't tell" principle constantly, in other words. Also sort of an apologia for southern white supremacy that might feel right to a southern white supremacist (or the child of one) but that doesn't really hold water. It's too bad, because the love story within it has some legs - could've been a very good book.
Tho I'm a huge Harper Lee fan, I barely got started and did not finish this book.One star was a gift.
It's important to remember that this is NOT a "sequel" to the classic "To Kill a Mockingbird." This is Lee's first book, which she spent a few years completely overhauling into what was eventually Mockingbird. As such, this is the "rough draft" of everyone, including Atticus, so, no, it does not take away from his character as rendered in Mockingbird. That said, GSAW shows me why the publisher wanted an overhaul. Lee's strength is drawing beautiful character portraits of Southern childhood, and morality, as seen in Mockingbird. But the moral conflict in Watchman is rendered in a way that is sadly lacking: it is not convincing; it is instead a back and forth sermon between Scout, her father, and her uncle as some kind of facilitator. In a word, it's tedious.
This just isn't a good book. Occasional bits of Harper Lee's future talent show through for a few pages, but then... The action doesn't start until you are 40% through the book. The political discussions toward the end go on endlessly, lecturing not showing. The fact that by today's standards they are racist and classist is bad enough.  But we might forgive the past, if it were described well. But it isn't, and by today's standards I don't think any company would dare publish such a racist book, if it weren't for Harper Lee's reputation from To Kill A Mockingbird. Finally, the fact she finally sees her father is only human would be a fine subplot, if it weren't described as though this is unusual, and as though her father and uncle plotted to have her see through them. Many young women go through this change in pt of view, but it usually happens younger, and without being plotted by who she finally sees as human.
This was the book we all wanted but didn't want.  Would it ruin MOCKINGBIRD or enhance it?  In my opinion, the editor Harper Lee had for TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD brilliantly brought out Lee's writing talent so that her characters shone and were etched into our minds.  WATCHMAN is not quite that book.<br/><br/>WATCHMAN is worth reading if for nothing other than more background.  It is a very good read, better than most available by today's authors.  Yes, there could have been some editing, but all in all, it's a very good book.  And it leaves us with much to think about.  Thank you, Nell Harper Lee, once again for showing us ourselves, our friends, and our families.
I kept waiting for something to happen, like the major event in her other book, but nothing ever did
This was a disappointment. I am keeping it because I have a copy of "To Kill a Mockingbird"
While the novel is short, it does an excellent job of balancing idealism with pragmatism. It also gives an excellent insight into a very timely issue: the fight over the Confederate flag. While the Confederate flag is not mentioned in the book, it helps non-Southerners better understand why this flag means so much to so many Southerners. My parents were from the Northeast, but I have lived in the deep South for over thirty years. I thought I knew what the Confederate flag meant down here, but Harper Lee dug deep into the Southern psyche, as only a native Southerner could, to enlighten those of us with only a shallow understanding of a very complex issue.
I just finished Go Set A Watchman. There will be those who find some of the language offensive. I kept in mind the era and the setting of the story. Through her characters, Ms. Lee conveyed that many white people found the word n****r offensive back then. My heritage is the Carolinas and I grew up saying "sir" and "ma'am" to my elders no matter their skin color. Had I ever used the word n****r, I know my mouth would have been washed out with soap! I was a small child during the timeframe set forth in the book but I was aware of what was happening around me.<br/><br/>This book is very well written! I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird. It was delightful to see the changes in Scout as she became an adult. I enjoyed seeing her relationships with family and friends evolve from what they were when she was young.<br/><br/>It was hard to describe the "mood" of the book with just a one word option...it had moments of hope, moments of nostalgia, moments of lightheartedness and moments of sadness/gloom.
Having pre-ordered this book in February, I awaited its arrival with great anticipation. Perhaps it was the great anticipation that let to my feelings of great disappointment. There was the racism factor which has been overly-discussed so I won't go there except to acknowledge the period in which the book was set and the time in which it was written. I thought the plot plodded along and was not well defined. I had to force myself to read the last 80 pages.<br/><br/>It has been several days now since I finished the book, and the more I reflect on it, the more I dislike it. If a similar book by an unknown author had been submitted, I doubt that it would have been published. If Amazon.com offered a refund on books that disappointed, I'd be first in line.
I purchased this book with both trepidation and eagerness.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" is my favorite book of all time.  This book was a disappointment and I'm sorry for Miss Lee that it was ever published.  The editor had it right the first time when he encouraged her to tell the story from the vantage point of a child, twenty years earlier and scrap this version.<br/><br/>This writing is a pale reflection of "Mockingbird."  On its own merits and absent the hype, the story is longish and not terribly interesting.  There are still flashes of Lee's wonderful language, but none of the magic of its predecessor.  I cannot recommend it, sadly.
I hate to rail against this book when I've waited for it for so long and I believe you should be kind about people's efforts to speak their minds and create their art; however, I want to save other people time and money.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*<br/>This book would not have been published if it weren't associated with To Kill a Mockingbird. It doesn't stand on it's own and it doesn't stand up as a prequel, sequel or companion piece. It was like no one bothered to edit it. The whole story takes place over a few days and is a sort of wandering meditation on racism that lands with Jean-Louise conceding that black people should not hold government office or be responsible for their own lives. She just doesn't like the "n" word.<br/>To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books. I didn't hold this to a high standard so I wouldn't be disappointed, but she kills off or writes off or alters beyond recognition every good character. Plus, the trial that defines the first book is completely re-written as it's opposite.
I really enjoyed the grown up Scout character and several parts, especially in the first half of book, were enjoyable. Second half of book was not well-written/edited and pretty clearly left me feeling like there was a reason Ms. Lee probably did not want this published. I have no issue with the revelations about Atticus's character. In fact, I find them believable. The arguments between Jean Louise and her father reminded me of a bit of bad arguments in Ayn Rand books trying to hammer one with some point. The book is worth reading if you want to see what was written that lead to To Kill a Mockingbird, which is a very finished and good novel.
I'm glad this manuscript was turned down at first, otherwise Harper Lee may never have written To Kill a Mockingbird. I suppose it's interesting to see what her first concept for a "Southern Novel" was, but it's only engaging at all (and not very much) because I know she was advised to change the concept and write the story she did in To Kill a Mockingbird. Thank goodness for wise publishers.<br/><br/>I did read the whole thing, so it's better than many a book I've started to read, and then tossed aside because life's too short to finish a bad book. I know that's faint praise, but that's all I've got for this one.
Due to the circumstances behind this book's emergence and publication, it's hard to remain objective in its rating and review. Is GO SET A WATCHMAN as good as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD? Of course not. The writing and characters are less developed, and the story lacks intrigue and build-up. Nevertheless, I enjoyed reading it. What a pleasure to see how Scout and Atticus evolved in their later years; what an honor to see how Harper Lee further envisioned Maycomb. GO SET A WATCHMAN is a great companion novel to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. I would not recommend it as a stand-alone, as readers might find it lacking context and substance.
It was boring.
There is a line in the book that says, "If you weren't expecting much, there was plenty."  I think that, if we read this book on its own merit and not try to compare it to TKAM, it is still a great book by a talented author.  Her literary sense still enables us to see, hear, smell all that is going on.  Agree with the perspective or not, it is amazing to read a book by the same author as TKAM from a totally different viewpoint.  Harper Lee was spot on from both perspectives.  Agreeing with an author's point-of-view does not indicate good works.  Good works are honest and I believe both Harper Lee books are honest.
I loved it but realize that the reader needs to bring historic context to the book.  It's interesting that the timing of the release hits the mark on so many modern day, political and social issues:  Supreme Court overreach, voters rights, racism and hate of others, what it meant to be a Confederate, social structures within a society and parental God syndrome.  It made me realize how far we've come and how far we still have to go.  Harper Lee was a very insightful young woman.  I can see where it wasn't ready for publication in the 50s and I'm glad that it wasn't over edited to be proper for today.  I truly hope that she was okay with publishing it because I think it will be another TKAM in terms of controversy.
Let me make a confession.  I didn't finish this book. I love To Kill a Mockingbird and think that it may very well be one of the greatest American novels ever written.  So I was very interested in reading this earlier work of Lee's.  Unfortunately, I didn't find it all that compelling, and life is too short to read books that are not fabulous.<br/><br/>It's not that this is a bad book.  It's actually very well written and does flesh out what happens to some of the characters that we've come to love in Mockingbird.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't in any way have the magic or existential depth of that amazing work.
The book had a lot of dialog, mostly it was too wordy or did not make sense. There are parts of the book you wonder where the rest of the story is,  or is the plot there or am I missing it. Harper Lee can write, but this book was not finished. If it was rewritten it may have been good, not as it stands now.<br/>I read it because I felt I had to know what the book held in the form of her other book.  Otherwise I would not have bothered finishing it.<br/>I could put myself in Harper Lees place and not want it published, writers know whats good and whats not. I feel like it was published in spite of what she thought. I frankly think she had nothing to do with it and someone made a pretty penny on her behalf.
I was disappointed.  I hoped for the rich imagery of To Kill A Mockingbird and received the scant depictions offered by a serial romance novel.  A good novel shows you what is happening. This read more like a screenplay culminating in a near monologue by a heretofore relatively minor character who psychoanalyzes not only his family but the entire South into harmony.<br/><br/>The complexity of Atticus Finch is heavy handed and seems more that his dark side was simply unobserved by an inattentive child.<br/><br/>Additionally there were a few inconsistencies that drew my attention out of the world Lee presented and flipping through pages.  It reads more like fan fiction than the artistry Lee is capable of.
Ms. Lee should have stopped with "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD".  This offering appears to be, in my opinion, an attempt to use "outside sources" to explain and justify the overt and lingering bigotry and prejudice of some people and institutions in the south.  Mr. Finch, the hero of "Mockingbird", for his fight to save a wrongly accused black man, destroys the image he created by trying to "explain" to Scout that, if the existing conditions had not been disturbed by interference from the "outside" peace and harmony would have continued.  A narrow view presented by someone who still does not understand what it meant and still means to be an African-American in this country.
This book is much better than I was led to believe by professionally-written reviews.  Ms. Lee's original publisher was right not to publish this book first - part of the beauty is reading TKAM first so that this book makes sense.  The writing in this novel was every bit as good as Ms. Lee's TKAM.  So many TKAM readers elevated Atticus Finch to such a high level after reading the book.  In Go Set A Watchman, I realized, just as Jean Louise did, that Atticus Finch has feet of clay, as do many people who are put on a pedestal.  He was, after all, just a man with human frailities who could not live up to the mantel of "perfection" he was saddled with, yet he never asked for.  I see now that Jean Louise was a much more complex character than we were led to believe in TKAM.  I can't wait to read this one again!
What a shame that this obviously deficient collection of scenes (not a novel) was allowed to be published under Harper Lee's name and thus tarnish her amazing legacy.  Whoever advised Ms. Lee to allow this tripe to be released under her name should be thrashed and dismissed.  The book is just a working piece of character development and experimentation that she probably used to set the backstory for the fantastic "To Kill A Mockingbird."  There are rumors of another manuscript hiding somewhere that is being considered for publication.  To anyone who has anything to do with this decision, PLEASE please do not release anymore substandard books in Harper Lee's name.  Her reputation as a great American novelist already took a big hit with the release of this exhibit of sewer-borne effluvium.
After having read it, I object to the publication of this book.  I wonder if Miss Lee was somehow manipulated into agreeing to it.  This was a book that was initially rejected by publishers and, because of that, Miss Lee went on to write To Kill a Mockingbird.  The latter book is, of course, a masterpiece of American fiction.  Go Set a Watchman portrays the character Atticus Finch (an iconic figure in literature) in a very unfavorable light, and, as Watchman was essentially a draft, I wonder if this depiction of Atticus was one that Ms. Lee reconsidered and abandoned when creating Mockingbird.
I am hesitant to give it even one star. There is a clear reason why this book was not published until now. It was never meant to be published and was obviously published strictly for financial reasons. At best it is a VERY rough draft of a novel. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my favorite novels. This contradicts so much of "Mockingbird," that reading it proves it was never meant to be published in this state. My heart breaks for Harper Lee; she would have never wanted this published. If you love "To Kill a Mockingbird," the book or the movie, do not read this book.
A very superficial treatment of an era of cultural upheaval.  Not worth the time to read.
This is only of interest as an author's first draft- it should never have been published.
I love it! It is so hard to believe that this wasn't published after the success of "To Kill a Mockingbird". I doubt that would happen today. I expected a more unpolished attempt at a first novel and was thrilled to experience so much more! The characters and thought provoking story are depicted with much more skill than expected from a first novel. We learn of Scout/Jean Louise, Atticus, Jem and the other characters through not only the present but from incidents in their past. No need to read "Mockingbird" to experience this book. Thank God it has finally been published!
Don't expect Harper Lee's "Go Set A Watchman" to be timeless as her debut novel "To Kill A Mockingbird". If anything, "Go Set A Watchman" is a time-stalled story, clinging to its memories set in a controversial time in American history that we have moved on from as a society. The writing is naive, script-like and needed an editor.<br/><br/>Novels carries readers on its current until finally hitting shore. When the story is over, we find ourselves closing the book and reflect on the journey.  Not the case here. I was glad to be back on shore and looking forward.
The pattern of writing is engaging and the character of Scout is intriguing.  On the issue of race in the South, this plot ends with a total 180 degree change from what Scout has thought was right, and how her father has brought her up.  It was written with a sense of go slowly, things will improve.  However, this involves accepting a pact with the racist elements of the town, a compromise that today's readers will surely reject for every reason.  The setting is realistically portrayed.  One can see how the true power of a good novel develops into To Kill a Mockingbird from this novel.
Most of the book reminded me of a teenage love story. I was REALLY disappointed with it.
Critics call this a purely marketing move. I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.
EXTREMELY disappointed in this novel.<br/>I had such high hopes because To Kill a Mockingbird is in my top 3 favorite books.<br/>Don't get me wrong, Harper Lee is an amazing writer, and she used big words and such but I had a really hard time understanding the point of the book.<br/>I'm also disappointed that it was really about Jean Louise and her issues.<br/>I'm just glad I borrowed this from the library.<br/>Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this book; that would be a waste of your money.<br/>Actually, don't even read it; there's really no need to.<br/>Just stick to TKAM!!
"Go Set a Watchman" should not be viewed as a story about Atticus as it is more a story about Jean Louise (Scout). The story is of a young woman (assumed to be Harper Lee) who is a progressive and feminist for her time and would still be today. It tells of her shock and frustration that society can hold beliefs of inequality and try to legislate and manage that which it views as second class. She is also a feminist in her views that women should be who they are comfortable being and not marry to become possessions. The more I digest the book, the more I appreciate Harper Lee as an intelligent observer of the way societies operate. Don't be afraid to read it!
This is an interesting contrast to the original novel. I understand it was the first manuscript submitted but it seems to be a logical sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird".<br/><br/>Regardless, it portrays the central characters in a new environment, new circumstances and a more mature perspective. The social commentary is eerily relevant today. I find it interesting that it comes to light now. Whether it's publishing now is intentional or by chance is speculation.<br/><br/>It remains to be seen what the literary scholars will say but I thoroughly enjoyed the new novel.
An embarrassment to the memory of a younger Harper Lee and her masterpiece.  At best a rough draft.
Positively awful.  What a total waste of time.  Did Harper Lee really write this book?
not as great as "To Kill a Mockingbird" but that's not quite a fair comparison; it's almost a different genre. it dealt with issues facing the South and the country at that time, which relates closely to today's issues of racial conflict, and gave explanations (not excuses) of the white position in the fifties South. worth the read. She became somewhat didactic toward the end, but her views and perceptions deserve consideration. the story gets a little lost amid the personal relationships and attitudes, but the characters are interesting; Atticus is still Atticus.
This book was not what I expected.  The rambling, disjointed writing style does not feel like Harper Lee's voice.
I don't believe this was ever meant for publication and in the end doe Harper Lee a disservice.  Disconnected, with little plot, this reads as more of a character development than a novel.  I could imagine such a script for each of the characters to then build a story from.  The quality of writing versus "Mockingbird" further questions how much influence and writing Capote may actually have had in regard to 'Mockingbird".  While an interesting look at an adult Scout and the mindset regarding emancipation in the south, this leaves much to be desired.  Scout and all Lee's characters deserve the depth and color they held when we first met them.
After all the hype and build-up I was disappointed in this novel. After the adult Scout has lived in NYC for several years she returns home and finds her hometown in the middle of adjusting to the civil rights movement. She finds herself confused and torn between the past she grew up with, totally unaware of the discrimination that had existed and the desire to see it change overnight. She mistakes her father's desire to see a gradual transition free from outside influences lik the KKK or NAACP as discrimination and finds herself turning on him and her entire past and hometown. This book takes us on her journey of learning that what he believes is the best and safest way for their town to change is not because he is a racist but because he cares .
This is an absolutely terrible book. To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books because the plot is so in-depth and riveting. However this book offers nothing. The character, Scout, who we have grown to know and love, is still a strong willed woman, but she is still altogether dependent on her father. The book does little to develop her character and is overall a dull read. It throws in new characters and stupid flashbacks that really do nothing to advance the plot. There is actually no plot besides Scout discovering her father has a differing opinion.
Illuminates To Kill a Mockingbird. So thankful to have glimpses of Scout as an adult.
I liked the book very much.  It moves quickly and reflects my experiences growing up.
This is a book that should never have been published.  It should have stayed "lost" or "hidden" as it supposedly was all these years.  Harper Lee's book "To Kill A Mockingbird" was recognized as a classic, with a hero (Atticus Finch) who was a person to be admired and emulated.  GSAW trashed Atticus and tore down the image of him.  I find it hard to believe that Ms. Lee really wanted to see GSAW to be published.  I wish I hadn't read it.  As far as I'm concerned, the story should have ended on the last page of "To Kill A Mockingbird."
I was hoping for more of a story than the book provided. Not nearly as good as TKAM.
I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll keep this review short.<br/><br/>This book is pretty much nothing like I would have expected from a sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird. However, in spite of and perhaps even a bit because of that, I absolutely loved it. It's explores some dark themes that seem to have some people upset, but I think it does a great job of showing that even our most upheld heroes are flawed and that everyone struggles through some areas of life. If you liked TKAM, you should definitely give this a go, even if you're feeling a bit timid.
This is a wonderful book and a worthy sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. It brought me back to the early days of Atticus, Scout, Boo and all the other characters that made the original books so memorable. I know some readers were disappointed in the way Atticus was portrayed but I was not. I remembered him as a perfect man as Scout did. While reading Get Set a Watchman I was reminded that nobody's  perfect, not even Atticus. But, in my eyes he remained noble in his desire to have his daughter to develop her own values and defend them. The ending was inspiring.
Very good.  Scout grows up and realized that things are not always what seem to be.
Having read "Mockingbird" multiple times as well as viewed the movie adaptation, I held high expectations for "Watchman."  Although I finished the book with my expectations not being fully met, I still enjoyed it and especially the last third of the book.  It did make me appreciate "Mockingbird" even more!  For readers considering it, many of my family and friends have said that it is difficult "to get into," but I would still recommend reading it if  only to have further exposure to such a talented and well-read author.
Viewing the world of Maycomb, Alabama once again through the eyes of Jean Louise Finch - voice again by Harper Lee - is as delightful and thought provoking as it was when I, along with countless other readers, first met her in To Kill A Mockingbird. Those who have reacted to initial reviews by swearing off Watchman in protest to unwelcome revelations as to Atticus Finch's politics are denying themselves an opportunity to once again be Scout's allies and confidants as she confronts life's lessons. The prose is as smart and beautiful and the story is as sweet, funny, and sometimes downright terrifying, as they were in Mockingbird.
To say that this book was a disappointment would be an understatement.  It bounced around - tenses and narrators - and was not anywhere near the caliber of Harper Lee's writing.  I think I have to agree with those who believe this was a first draft of her book.  Curious that the lawyer waited for Harper Lee's sister to die before she pursued publication.  I have to believe if Lee was of sound mind, she would NEVER have allowed it to be published.  If that is, in fact, what happened, that would be a terrible shame on both the publisher and the lawyer.
All my heroes have feet of clay. What we often forget about heroes is they are human beings, and are as capable of mistakes as the rest of us. When news reports suggested we would become disillusioned with Atticus Finch I momentarily fell for it, but as I recalled my own life in the 50s and 60s and my relationship with my own father I found it quite reasonable Atticus would have a problem with integration. After reading the novel I discovered the character was not as bad as we were led to believe. Atticus was a hero, but he was a product of his times. Harper Lee created a very believable character, a hero with feet of clay.<br/><br/>The story is a bit slow in the beginning as the background is being set, but once into the novel the interest picks up. As good as To Kill A Mockingbird? No, but still a good read.
Harper Lee's character portrayals were remarkable in their continuity and realism. This is another thought-provoking book placed in yet another time of heightened racial tension.  As I read this book I grieved, but was able to accept the fallibility and humanity of Atticus as a part of growing up.  I wouldn't have been the same if I hadn't idolized him as a teen and young adult.  As I read this book, I came to believe there was always a piece missing that I had never realized until this revisitation.  It completed the characters in a way that somehow seemed to give me a sense of closure?  This, too, is a truly amazing book!
To Kill a Mockingbird was so much better. I would not recommend Go Set a Watchman.
I was very disappointed with The book. I would not recommend it for anyone to buy.
After finishing this book, I feel let down, disappointed.  I knew better than to expect GSAW to be a masterpiece like "To Kill a Mockingbird", but really; nothing much ever happens!  It just plods along, capturing Scout's musings intermingled with numerous flashbacks to events of her childhood (which take up too much of the story in my opinion).  I am generously rating it 3 stars as it is beautifully written depicting the Southern culture of the 1950's.  All in all, I should have just borrowed it from my local library instead of buying it.
If this is the best - after all these years - that this author could come up with - to basically put Atticus on trial in his daughter, Scout's eyes, she should have saved her efforts.  What exactly was the point?  Jean Louise (Scout) thinks she is color blind - no - she is a self-centered immature, scatter brained Southern spoiled brat, who will probably contribute nothing of merit to society.  Most of the story dealt with random incidents which happened during Scout's growing up and were disjointed and primarily irrelevant.  What a shame - had expected so much more from this author.  But as they say, many writers really only have one book in them - and To Kill A Mockingbird was that book - this was not.
Awkward writing for the first half, and a long time before a plot line developed.
I had seen the movie, To Kill a Mockingbird several years ago. It is one of my all time favorites. I decided to read "Go Set A Watchman" before I read To Kill a Mockingbird and I'm glad I did. This is the order that the books were written in and "Go Set..." actually informs "To Kill..." I would recommend this order especially if you have some familiarity with the characters through the movie. Go Set is enthralling. There were a couple of dry patches, for me anyway, but they were more than made up for by the whole of the novel. I'm half way through "To Kill..." and really love it.
This book probably should have never been published. It is definitely not a very nuanced addition to contemporary race discussions (and not even really a useful addition to 1950s race discussions, I imagine). But it would be great if it continues to lead to a scrutiny of the racism that was already inherent in To Kill a Mockingbird and cemented for so many young white kids a kind of insidious paternalistic racism that is quite hard to shake.<br/>That being said, it has all the charm of the book that originally taught so many of us how to understand metaphors and reads like the best (G rated) fanfiction ever.
This is the book that was rejected by the publisher.  Harper Lee then took the characters and re-wrote her novel about racism, and came up with "To Kill A Mockingbird." This novel is clunky, disconnected, and not very well written. Even the childhood flashbacks are not charming as they are in the novel  (TKM) we have all come to know and love. This is the practice work of a person learning to write a novel. It's not a prequel. It's a disappointment if you think it's going to be well-written, charming, or full of revelations.
This thought provoking glimpse at a rough draft shows us the backbone of the rationalization of southern thoughts about racial equality. It's very timely with all the talk of taking down the confederate flag, and erasing all traces of rebel generals and wars, and provides some insight to what the<br/>southerners are really objecting to. It's a must read for all TKAM aficionados! The first part is catching up with old friends. In the second part, Scout has to lose her ideas of what people are like, and accept them for what they are.
It was interesting to read this knowing it was written prior to the To Kill A Mockingbird which tells a very similar story with some controversial perspectives.  Since it was written first, it is not a sequel and clearly stands alone providing an alternative view to the story of segregation and race relations in Maycomb County.  This novel raises questions and discussions regarding the atmosphere of the characters and politics of a particular time period.<br/>The rewrite of this initial story, Go Set a Watchman, has resulted in a novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which will always remain a beloved classic.
For those of us who appreciate well written literature, Harper Lee doesn't disappoint.  Could it have been even better had the publishers given it the time and effort they do with most novels?  Of course it could have been but considering that the author was not able to work with the same effort as she could have fifty years ago, does not diminish the beauty of the writing.  Expecting it to equal Mockingbird is much like expecting a toddler to run in the olympics, however fans of the former should not be left wanting by the latter.
I love To Kill a Mockingbird so much and couldn't wait to read this book, but was disappointed. Although chronologically speaking this appears as a sequel, it was actually written first and rejected by publishing companies and that was quickly apparent. Harper Lee wasn't yet as skilled a writer as we saw in her later work of Scout and Jem's earlier years, To Kill a Mockingbird. If this had been a book about completely new characters, I might have liked it, but I prefer Atticus, Scout and Jem to be preserved in my memory forever.
I enjoyed the book, but it was not of the caliber of "To Kill a Mockingbird." Having lived during the period in the book, I did not see Atticus<br/>as a bigot, as many have stated. This was a period of great upheaval and all Citizens Council members were not wild-eyed racists. Of course,<br/>some were and these are the types that are represented, most of the time. I will always see Atticus as brave and having great integrity.<br/>As for the characters, I saw no hint of Scout in Jean Louise, and this was disappointing.
Terms I'd apply to this book are muddled, lumpy, and meandering.  It certainly wasn't a compelling read and in fact, I struggled to finish it.  The childhood reminisces were interesting but towards the end, far too many lectures that might have been deemed insightful during the civil rights era but not so much in 2015.  Ultimately, the "watchman" is all about Scout developing her own conscience and values apart from her father's.  I'm sure glad I downloaded this as a Kindle through my library as opposed to purchasing it.
Painful to watch Jean Louise find that her hero of a father was just an ordinary man.  Reminded me very much of my own passage to adulthood. Our parents mean so much and we are shocked when we find they have faults. At an age close to the authors I remember the days of turmoil. My Mother was from the south and we heard hair raising stories of her childhood.  Then we learned that all of us have prejudices and attitudes that disappoint our off spring. I am glad this book did not come first but I found it very real in the sense that sometimes reality is not as wonderful at imagination of childhood.
Written before Mockingbird.  And without the superior editing.  Disappointing.
I reread To Kill a Mockingbird before reading Go Set A Watchman.  Mockingbird is one of my very favorite  books but Watchman is not in the same league.  It's not that Atticus is so different but the writing is not as good.  Probably it needed a very good editor.  What I have read about Mockingbird is that it was written and rewritten and edited a lot.  It is obvious that Watchman was not.  I still enjoyed it and wanted to see for myself whether it was good or not.  It would be very,very hard to be better than Mockingbird.
This manuscript was only published to make money from Harper Lee's  name. It is really just the first draft of To Kill A Mockingbird (several paragraphs are EXACTLY THE SAME). And what a coincidence that it was only published after all of Lee's siblings had died and Harper, a stroke victim in a nursing home, would sign anything her money-grubbing lawyer put in front of her. Shame on the lawyer and the publisher for rooking the beloved author's fans out of their hard earned cash and denigrating Harper's legacy and trust!
A travesty.  If you love 'To Kill A Mockingbird' (as I do), pass this up.<br/><br/>Seems like a mish-mash of early notes and outlines, combined with amateurish fanfic.  Unpleasant and poorly-written, this so-called prequel  alternates "shocking twists" that seem designed to upset fans of the previous work with long, dull screeds that read like a high school civics essay.<br/><br/>Not a credit to Ms. Lee.  It ought to have remained unpublished.  Don't spoil your memories of a cherished novel by reading this.
I loved the book, found it both disturbing and stimulating. The best parts were the superb characterizations.. I've "known" all of those people in my lifetime.  Lee's ability to clearly describe the social stratification of that period in the South was also impressive. I found Jean Louise (Scout) more than a little irritating... but it was definitely a very good character sketch.  It could have used a little more editing, but all in all I am glad I read it. I would recommend it to start a lot of conversations.
This novel is a far cry from To Kill a Mockingbird.  Based on the fact that it was an earlier piece of Harper Lee's writing, one can forgive some weaker character development and a plot that at times is thin and seems to go nowhere for vast stretches.  Having said that, if To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel you love, this is a nice trip back to Maycomb where you can hear a few more of Scout's stories from growing up while she muddles through trying to fit into a racist Maycomb with her own color-blind view of the world.
I read this because of all the hype and To Kill a Mockingbird was such a powerful book when I first read it 3 years ago.  I was not as moved by this book.  I didn't feel that Scout's intellectual development and the author's depiction of the impact of the equality movement on Maycomb was enough for a whole book.  There are some interesting flashbooks here and there, and the writing is good, but I thought it needed more to happen, but my expectations may have been too high, comparing it to To Kill a Mockingbird......
Very disappointing...long passages of material that does not move plot along.
What am I taking from this book? Kill your heroes. Think for yourself, and don’t accept that change cannot happen. Work to make it happen, in whatever capacity you can.<br/><br/>There are a lot of reviews out there tearing this book apart. That’s cool, but seriously, we don’t need 13 paragraphs to tell us your beliefs.<br/><br/>As for me… I liked it a lot. There is SO MUCH to think about and consider. Nothing is as straight forward in this book as many people like to think.<br/><br/>Reese Witherspoon (Narrator): She was amazing! Her voice was perfect for this novel.
I was very disappointed in this book.  I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.  My advice is to borrow it from the library, don't waste your money on it.  It really went sour for me with the endless discussion about the 10th amendment (states' rights), the n-word repeated over and over, Uncle Jack's striking Jean Louise in the face, etc. etc.  Like many others I came away thinking this book could not have been written by the same author of To Kill a Mockingbird.  It was just confusing and ugly.
This book was just.....okay.  Nothing much really happens in the book...lots of reminiscing, and lots of just what "Scout" is thinking...<br/>If you are expecting another classic read like "To kill a Mockingbird", you will be disappointed.  The book is sort of sad and depressing, and I really found myself rushing to get done with it.....I am not sure the author ever wanted this book to be published..It seems sort of incomplete and more of a character sketch than a full bodied novel...
Somehow, this much-anticipated novel did not impress.  The writing was wonderful, the beginning of the story interesting, but then it got rather preachy, particularly dialogue between Scout and Atticus, and Scout and Uncle Jack.  And, although I understood where Scout was "coming from", her actions and motivations, to me, were muddled and confusing.  I closed the book feeling frustrated and a little sad that I did not appreciate it more.  Or maybe I expected too much.  You read it and decide.
I kept waiting for a plot and was disappointed when it never materialized.
Story lacks a compass<br/>And conclusion is personal and weakly expressed
I was so excited to read this and it was probably the worst book I have ever read. It was a struggle to get through it. The conversations were tedious and way too lengthy, had to skip through several just to get past them. I can understand why this book was turned down when she first submitted it. I was determined to finish it and was just thankful when it was over. I couldn't believe how she kept yelling at her father saying the same thing over and over and over without once letting him speak.
There certainly was a lot of pre-publisher hype surrounding the book.  Was it merited?  From this reader's standpoint, sadly no.  The book read like a first draft. Scenes needed to flesh out the storyline, the storyline itself needed more telling and explanation.  Maybe Ms Lee herself felt it was not ready for prime time; it would also seem that neither editor or editors could provide the history and balance needed to make it a complete novel. That is too bad because it certainly had potential.
The book doesn't promote Civil Rights and racial equality for black people in America.  It comes at a time when events on our streets and in our judicial system are making it clear racial prejudice against black people in our beloved Country is alive, well, and growing.  It has changed the view I had when I first read "To Kill a Mockingbird," that Atticus was fighting for justice for black people.<br/><br/>I did enjoy revisiting the characters in "Go Set a Watchman: A Novel."
So much has been written criticizing this book. I totally disagree. It is a love story, really, of a father & daughter. We can be @ odds with those we love the most BECAUSE we love each other! Scout is an idealistic young woman who gets a big dose of reality. Because Atticus, her Uncle Jack & Henry ( even her aunt) love her, they try to show her the complications of southern life gently. Being familiar with TKaM really enriched my reading of this book. I also enjoyed the "watchman" reference.
Many reviews have stated that this novel diminishes Atticus's character from our perceptions of him in "Mockingbird." I started the book with trepidation, because "Mockingbird" meant a lot to me as a young person and I continue to cherish the movie. This newly discovered novel will not disappoint fans of Atticus, if they persevere through the beginning and appreciate the deeper levels of character development that the adult Scout discovers. This actually is another type of "coming of age story:" a young adult learns to be an individual in a new way.
Cannot say that I enjoyed this book.  Curiosity drove the need to read.  I can say now that I really wonder how much editing, as in almost ghost written her first novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" must have needed as this novel has none of the beauty that the first did.  Got a feeling that Harper Lee had little to do with this release.  Her physical and probably mental condition at the time of the decision, not good.  So if this was a money making venture, it did accomplish those ends.
This is, of course, not To Kill A Mockingbird, but one should not expect it to be. This was her true first novel written during an on end time in our social history. I believe Harper Lee was trying to cover far too much in all aspects in this novel without expanding any one area--that is why her publisher told her to rewrite and develop the characters; thus the great To Kill A Mockingbird was born. This was a good first novel later made greater into a second Pulitzer Prize winning novel.
Scout sees her town and family from a grown-ups point of view, seeing the change that has occurred. After reading several reviews, I understand why Atticus is different than he was in TKAM which was a child's point of view. Lee stuck to her theme in this book. The main allusions of "Go Set a Watchman" and Chiles Roland were executed well. The writing wasvery familiar in Lee's style, but the ending conversations were a bit difficult to figure out who was talking. I liked the book.
Pretty dissapointed.  Now I know why Harper Lee didn't want it published
After finishing reading this novel, I can say that it cannot be compared to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, many years my favorite novel. I liked the writing style which I am sure of more than I can of whether I took the grown up Scout to heart or not . The ," parts of a novel " are there in a scattered way but I don't feel a resolution.  The more remarkable element is how Ms.Lee took hold of Womens' Liberation in its babyhood. Surely, I need to read it againto dispel the stranger feelings.
Though this book wasn't what people thought it would be, I thought it was very realistic.  Atticus was a man of his time.  And we do well not to forget what that time was like.  To forget history is to doom ourselves to repeat it. That Jean Louise finds that her father isn't the saint she had pictured him is a classic situation. I think Harper Lee does a fine job of writing - though the story line isn't what our romantic desires had wished.  It is realistic and it is well written.
With all the pre-release drum beating there were no surprises.  It was interesting to discover that all the hype of Atticus turning into a racists were not on target. His reasoning was explained in the book.  While perhaps unacceptable for our time putting his reasoning in the context of time in the book, he was advanced in his thinking/reasoning.  Read with the time context in mind, if you are old enough to remember whites only signs on water fountains, stores. movie houses, etc.
Well, it is a good book, but not nearly as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. It's pretty evident that this was written first, because it isn't quite as well written as TKAM, and some of the facts don't line up with the way things actually played out. Additionally, I am really disappointed in Atticus, and the fact that both Jem and Dill don't make any appearances (except in flashbacks) was a bit of a bummer. All in all though, I would stay it's still a decent book, and worth reading.
I had heard the bad reviews and was a little apprehensive about the book since it wasn't published until Miss Lees beloved sister and advisor died.  I think it is a great read and really hits home to someone raised in the South and who continues to live in the South.  The language of the book at  times seems harsh but very real.  It is timely as there continues to be a great divide between the "haves and the have-nots "and race issues are still here. We have a long way to go and there are words of wisdom written in this book.
I'm not sure yet how I feel about the book.  I'm not going to criticize the story because I think it is what is.  I'll just say that it was a bit different than what I was expecting.<br/><br/>My only complaint, if you can call it one, is that the editing was bad.  I believe the principal is referred to as both a Mr and Mrs.  This made it a bit difficult to follow at times.  This may only be an issue with the kindle version.  I wish Amazon would do a little better with stuff like this since it can really hurt the reading experience.
All I can say about this was that it was awful - what a waste of money!
I understand why it was not published.  It should have stayed that way.
It turned out to be a presentation of the southern view of segragation and right to vote during the 50's....I think.  The time period was somewhat unclear.  The reader needed to be aware of the approximate time of the amendments discussed.  One of the younger characters had served in the army in World War II, and that seemed to not fit with the time being discussed.  It was definitely not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird which is one of my favorite books. I was disappointed.
What a disappointment this book was to me.  I was so very much looking forward to this read.  In the first chapter, I couldn't understand what was going on in the family dynamic.  This was an example of poor writing. Then again, when Atticus' brother and then Atticus himself provided a explanation for their racism, I thought that Harper Lee did a poor job.  Her explanation was difficult, if not impossible to follow. Harper Lee droned on and on making it even more painful.
I read TKAM a couple of months ago, just for the sheer joy of reading. I found it an easy ready.  It kept my interest.  GSAW did not keep my interest as much. It was very wordy an the jumping back and forth (present back to past then back to present again) made it difficult for me.  I also didn't care for the way that Atticus was portrayed as a racist.  It seems uncharacteristic from the the original store.  I guess if you are a literary scholar, you might like this book.
Not well written. Very slow. A real disappointment after all the hype.
This novel have been left in the drawer where it was supposedly found.
/I waited the whole novel for something big to happen but nothing did.
Save your money and think of Harper's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' a great success.
Nelle Harper Lee wrote this book before To Kill a Mockingbird. It is set in 1950s Alabama, 20 years after Mockingbird. After the early press releases, I was cautious about reading this. What the other reviews left out is this book confronts the way the NAACP affected the views of southerners at that time. Ms Lee has done an excellent job of showing the way of life of the whites and the negroes of this time. I wish Ms Lee had written more books. This is a definite winner.
Did not feel "Go Set a Watchman" was of the quality of "To Kill a Mockingbird."  In my opinion, the writing was average at best.<br/><br/>In addition, the press changed the atmosphere of this book release to one of commercial gain.  In contrast, the atmosphere in "To Kill a Mockingbird" was one of respect, ethics and justice - a book that spoke to the destructiveness of prejudice and left one with a message of hope for great goodness in people.
I wish that I had never read this book and that quarter stars could be given!  Jem was lucky that he was dead because he was one of the few protagonists whose noble character from "To Kill A Mockingbird" was not besmirched.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" had an ending that really was worth the read whereas this pulp suddenly ends and I was left thinking WTF.<br/>I also feel that I was conned.  I clicked to buy this book before I realised that it was a pre order.  Why was it a pre order?  Probably because once the critics got hold of it and also ground swell public opinion was expressed sales would have died, a deserved death in my opinion.
If you are expecting the famous "To Kill a Mockingbird" you are mistaken. Although the writing style is pretty on point for Harper Lee, this is a much more adult version of TKAM. Jean Louise is not longer "Scout", but a grown woman learning her place in society. She is having trouble with life; however, her father doesn't make her life easier compared to TKAM. Jean Louise has a lot of growing up to do, and in this book she is forced to realize what is going on in the world, and faced with moral dilemmas.
Not her best work--don't think it should have been released. Really just a working draft with publisher which she eventually reworked into To Kill a Mockingbird. However, I read To Kill a Mockingbird first and appreciated the depiction of post Brown v Board of Education south and role of Atticus--and dichotomy of his prejudices regarding black people and his impeccable role as an attorney-both existed side by side so from that perspective, it was an interesting book.
Fairly accurate potrayal of the thought processes  of that time period. No great plot.
I did not read the book, but saw and very much liked the movie, "To Kill a Mocking Bird".  Was looking forward to this book, but was very disappointed.  It was hard to follow, boring in places, melodramatic in places, and the message incongruent.  A woman "finds herself" through standing up for what she believes, confronting her father, family and fiancee, and then being slapped to her senses by an uncle???  Sounds like a southern male fantasy to me.
I didn't like this book. It is no wonder the publishers told Harper Lee to go back and write something else. We read it for our book club because we felt we should. There was much to discuss, and I will admit that the publishers did an excellent job preparing questions to be discussed post read; but there was not much any of us liked about the book itself. That said, it did provoke a very lively discussion among us when using the prepared questions about the novel.
Without giving too much away...I found this book thought provoking and it definitely brings about a social awareness.  What I got from it was humans are not perfect beings. I don't think my generation has yet learned enough from our mistakes and an unwillingness to bend and understand another's point of view..I hope the next generation becomes more color blind and the next generation until we no longer see color or fear.  We are all human beings...no more, no less.
Am from the generation that enjoyed "To Kill a Mocking Bird" and loved it.  The prepublicity for this novel was mixed and gave "off" signals that if you like the first {To Kill a Mockingbird} you might be disappointed with this novel.  NOT SO!  Took a few chapters to get into the reason for this novel, once there, I couldn't put it down.  When I did, I had tears in my eyes and a "lump" in my throat.  Ms Lee has created another classic. Won't tell  anymore than that. Enjoy, I know I did.
more like go kill a writer's reputation. the family should sue lee's lawyer and harper Collins for this.
Terrible....reads like a first draft! Feels like a money grab to me.
It was hard to believe that the book was written by the same person who wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird". To me, the characters that were introduced in "To Kill.." seemed to have very little relation to the same characters in this book - not only had their behavior changed, it seemed that their entire outlook on life and code of conduct had changed.  Also, I felt that the book is peppered with boring monologues which were arcane and bewildering.
We knew it wasn't going to be To Kill A Mockingbird, but we had high hopes. We really wanted to like it, but neither my husband nor I could get past the second chapter. Scout was clearly "slumming" in Maycomb, and her patronizing tone was beyond offensive. Both of us wish we had just left it alone.<br/>  Giving it even one star was being generous, but there wasn't an option for zero.<br/>  I don't remember when a book has disappointed me this much.
I'm glad the book was found, but there's a reason Harper Lee didn't publish it.  The best parts are the reminisces of Jean Louise's childhood, which, of course, are the charm of TKAM.  The furor over the depiction of Atticus as less than perfect seems to reflect the theme of the book, that the daughter must discover for herself that her father is less than perfect and that they are two individuals who differ yet love each other.  It's just not a good read.
When my book club discussed this book last night we all agreed we could not understand how the person who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird could have written Go Set a Watchman.  We were really curious about what happened to Harper Lee between having this book turned down for publishing and writing her beautiful second book.  It must have been close to a miracle.  I would only recommend that someone read Go Set A Watchman out of curiosity and not for enjoyment.
I found all the negative comments on this book as they relate to racism to be laughable.  I rated it on the low side simply because it was quite boring compared to To Kill A Mocking Bird.  Atticus is NOT a racist as has been widely portrayed.  He simply attended a meeting in which some men were vocally racist and he provides a very clear and rational reason to Scout as to why he attends those meetings. The book is very forgetable. Don't waste your money.
Considering the hype surrounding this book, I was vastly disappointed.  Slow moving to the point where I didn't care what happened next, but faithfully read the author's random thoughts ad nauseam.  "Scout" a/k/a Jean Louise Finch, a naive daughter of Atticus Finch visits her home town and discovers that Atticus wasn't the hero she had romanticized her entire life.  Uncle Jack, Atticus' brother, while intellectually gifted is a pompous old fool.
Although I had waited for what seemed an eternity for this sequel, I was quite disappointed with this novel. For starters, it seemed to lack a clear focus. Some of the same themes presented themselves here....I.e. Racism and disillusionment......the context in which they were set was not convincing. I felt as if Harper Lee wrote this sequel hurriedly, more as a rough draft of ideas than a more captivating kaleidoscope of events and descriptive passages.
The book is a characterization, revealing the idiosyncrasies of each that we came to love in To Kill a Mockingbird and a couple of new ones. The greatest figure to rear its ugly nature is the South accurately depicted here within the novel's era. The epitomization still rings true on some levels today. Some may find this hard to take as did I. If you would like to continue as a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird, and the Atticus, as portrayed beautifully on screen by Gregory Peck, do not read this book.
I'm one of the zillions who have now read Harper Lee's prequel to the Mockingbird book. This book shows flashes of greatness that would be clearly evident in Mockingbird, but it drags a bit here and there, and Scout's righteous indignation at times seems strained. Nonetheless, Lee has a beautiful way with words and her picture of the South circa 1950s seems spot on. This is an important historical work that eveyone interested in fiction should read
While it was interesting to explore the origins of Lee's classic characters, the novel was clearly written by an amateur writer. The plot moves very slowly, and the only moments the reader is fully engaged with the characters occur when Jean Louise's reminisces about Scout's past adventures, which is probably what the original publishers recognized and encouraged in TKAM. Go Set a Watchman should have been left as it was meant to be, a manuscript.
You have a better chance of enjoying this book if you don't think about "Mockingbird".  However, it seemed incomplete to me.  I wanted some loose ends to be tied up, but I won't say what; read it and see if you knowl what I mean.  The writing is clear and interesting, but sometimes tedious.  For example, too much chatter at a house party.  I can't help but think that if there were no "Mockingbird" this book would never have been in print.
This book would not have been published if not for To Kill A Mockingbird.
I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this novel.  Having heard and read reviews that were none too kind, I was not expecting much.  It was like  finding a favorite sweater in the back of a closet, slipping it on, feeling the comfort, but realizing it's not quite nice enough to wear out of the house anymore.  If Scout hadn't gone on a typical young person righteous indignation rant than went on for far too long, I would have given it 5 starts.
The writing and style are as clean as "Mockingbird", but, as has been said, I am not sure this is the finished novel.  There are some things that don't make a lot of sense in terms of people from "Mockingbird" transitioning to "Watchman".  Have to wonder if this is the lawyer releasing anything he (she) can get their hands on.<br/><br/>For those who have literary heroes . . . how nice to see your Heroes have not fallen.
This was an interesting read, but I can see why the manuscript did not make it as her first book.  I am glad that she went back and expanded one of the small segments contained withinin Go Set A Watchman.  She wrote To Kill A Mockingbird and it sends a message that is just as potent as when I first read it so many years ago. TKAM should be required reading for all of us as the powerful message contained within is one we should never forget.
The book was interesting - and provided a timely reminder that race relations in this country still have a long way to go.  However, I understand why her editor originally suggested that Harper Lee re-write the book with Scout as a child instead of a young woman.  This was both short on plot and took too long to get to the point.  It's an interesting coming-of-age story and, honestly, it makes more sense as a sequel than a stand-alone book.
I am so elated that,court case be hanged, this first novel has finally been published. Jean Louise is the woman I imagined she would be, and the exchanges she has with familiar family and others ring true, with relevance to the times of the middle 1950s.  My only question, based on her age, was why an editor did not rectify what she wrote about the results of the trial as written in her second novel (the much beloved To Kill A Mockingbird.)  If I had a real "bucket list" and had even known about this novel more than just about two weeks ago, this book would have been at the top of that list!
Seems to wander pointlessly, would give it up if not for bookclub
There was no plot to this book.  It was a memoir really, and because of that alone it was very disappointing.  I can see why she was asked initially to re-write it.  Because of the reviews I expected that Atticus would not be portrayed as the hero of her childhood, but that is a common experience.  It resonates more because of the important issue involved.  It was a better book as re-written and this would have been much better as a memoir
There is little in common between this book and To Kill A Mockingbird. The good news is that the better book got published first. But how could Harper Lee have improved so much between both books? Go Set A a Watchman is a verbose opinionated book about a confused young woman in Maycomb, Alabama. She is not particularly likable and neither are any of those surrounding her, except perhaps for her doomed suitor, Henry. I almost blame myself for staying with the book through to its end.
Clearly, this is her first attempt at telling Scout's story.  Its main interest is in seeing her story telling & character building skills that developed into the wonderful later book.  It does give you some insight into the difficulty Scout would have adapting to the southern cullture's prejudices and limitations after living in New York, as Harper Lee would have, herself.  This is also a less idealized look at her father, Atticus.
My favorite novel of all time is "Mockingbird" so I had high expectations for "Watchman."  This novel, however, reminds me of a line from an Elvis Presley song:  "A little less conversation, a little more action, please."  There's not much of a story here just a lot of sermonizing. Some of the writing is witty, some is murky. I'm glad I read it but I don't recommend it to anyone but hardcore Harper Lee fans.
Ugh, couldn't even get half way thru. Never again will I order a book before first reading the sample. I couldn't believe I was even reading Harper Lee and this had nothing to do with all the hoopla surrounding it on racial issues. I didn't even get that far. I was forcing myself to sit down and read it and finally just gave up. Maybe it got better but I didn't want to take the time to find out. Too many other great books to read.
It took a long time to reach the point. However, I found it a good read. I tried NOT to compare it To Kill a Mockingbird. I realize the book has caused a lot of controversy, but I read it as the story of the South, a family of the South, and the idiotic bigotry that still lives there. Scout and Atticus, as usual, are wonderful characters who love one another, but hold different views as Scout becomes her own person. Love prevails.
Just like"To Kill a Mockingbird" this is a very good portrayal of life in the South at this time in history.  I can totally understand Scout's confusion about what was happening it Maycomb since I lived in Omaha in the 50's and 60's and we had no race problems until blacks came up from the South and started rioting. Until then, most of my friends had been blacks even though I am white, so I definitely understand Scout's confusion
This book deserves  high marks in several categories, Harper Lee created a great deal of interest because she even wrote it and for withholding it for so many years. The anticipation has been exciting in itself and reading the book was surprising and every bit as interesting as a reader could hope for. Thoroughly enjoyed each page. Looking forward to reading To Kill a Mockingbird again. Reading is such a joy! Thank you Harper Lee
If you're expecting this book to read like a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, you'll be disappointed.  I got the impression that editors took Harper Lee's initial approach to her amazing novel and converted it to what we see today in Go Set A Watchman.  I was happy to finally reach the end - which was rather uneventful.  I'm not sorry I read it - but had I not, I wouldn't have been disappointed.  I have mixed feelings about it.
I was so looking forward to reading GSAW -- I was excited just seeing the box when it arrived. But from the moment I began reading it, I felt it had been written by another author -- the novel's voice seemed very informal and modern, especially when you consider it was "supposedly" written before TKAM. By the end of the novel I wanted to weep -- except for the flashbacks, there is no emotional connection between this novel and TKAM -- and the ending was simply dreadful. What a major disappointment.
I just couldn't really get into this book. I read it for book club so I had to finish it but I put it aside three times for something more enjoyable. To Kill a Mockingbird it is not!  I guess there was a reason it was rejected by so many publishers. But still it's Harper Lee (and I can say I own a first edition Harper Lee now) so I couldn't give her any less than 3 stars. Thank goodness for her good friend Truman Capote!
A vehicle to present a perspective, but there is no real plot.
Spoiler alert.<br/>I don't like this book.  I think it's sloppy & boring.  I think what pushed me over the edge is that on page 29 we were told that "Calpurnia had run off the place & not come back when she learned of Jem's death."  On pages 31-32 we were told that Calpurnia had done the housework until 6 months before, (years after Jem 's death) but was now too old, and so had "returned to the quarters in honorable retirement."  I couldn't believe such a glaring error got through the editing process.  The romance stuff is repetitive & boring & serves no purpose.<br/>So disappointed...
Go Set a Watchman is decent reading, offering passable entertainment. But it is no match for To Kill a Mockingbird. The storyline was predictable and not very complex. Overall ok, but honestly seems as if it could have been written by any number of writers that had read the first book. It does not portray the complex story telling and character development skills that Harper Lee demonstrated in To Kill a Mockingbird.
I enjoyed the book and was not terribly disturbed that Atticus attended a KKK<br/>meeting once the author explained his reasoning for going. He wanted to discover firsthand who was behind the hoods  of the KKK so he could represent his clients optimally. He never declined to represent an African-American in a court of law. Harper Lee's values predominated in "Go Set A Watchman" and that's all that matters.
I wish that I had not read, let alone spent money, on this book.<br/>One quickly realizes that Harper Lee was fortunate in having a truly gifted editor to work with on To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>It might have helped for her to have had, at the very least, a competent one to work on this book. Unfortunately it reads like a rough draft.<br/>And I won't even go into how I felt about having one of the most admirable characters in American Literature given feet of clay.
Hard to believe it is the same author. Didn't like it at all.
I can understand the impulse to publish this, but after reading it I understand why Harper Lee would have preferred that her first attempt at a novel were kept hidden. The writing is clunky and painfully stilted. The characters are thin. The dialogue is awkward. Within the text there are glimmers of her novel to come. It should be read more as a study of a writer's first draft, and the role an editor can play in steering the direction of a masterpiece.
I may have given this another star if I wasn't comparing it to Mockingbird.  Not only did the story have less depth, the characters weren't as developed and the style did not flow as well.  And one of the major characters in Mockingbird had died - that seemed like it was an afterthought to explain why he wasn't in the story.  With that said, I did not find it's offensive as some reviewers.  I still loved Atticus.
Atticus Finch is a titan among literary heroes. But he also had clay feet, as this wonderful book explores. It is a coming of age story, both for Jean Louise and the Old South. Full of discovery, rage and regret, the tale is told showing the warts of all the characters, so human and lovable. So happy it was finally brought to daylight. Harper Lee, your power as a writer is overwhelming and beautiful. Thank you!
I was disappointed.  I had to read it because I really Loved To Kill A Mockingbird. But although I didn't agree with the idea that it showed Atticus as a racist, I was disappointed overall in the story and didn't find the switches back and forth to Jeans (Scout's) childhood of interest except for her interaction  with her uncle which to me explained the actions of Atticus which others characterized as racist.
I have read To Kill A Mockingbird 6 times. first time at age 11.  Each time at a different age. I am 62, and at each reading, one discovers something new, about one's self.  Go Set A Watchman would never have been published in the time/history, Harper Lee wrote the book, but later, To Kill A Mockingbird was published, followed by HOLLYWOOD script/movie. People of all ages should read both Harper Lee's books.
A lot of familiar flashbacks to "To Kill A Mockingbird", I enjoyed the silent conversations in Scouts head all through the book. Chapter 8 was a jaw dropper, but by the end it all made more sense and I can see the relevance to the south today (especially in view of the Confederate flag contentions). I would not read it again, probably, but it did make me go back and re-read TKAM with different eyes.
Like so many others, I have revered Mockingbird since my first introduction!  I too taught the novel for years, loving its many virtues.  I began reading the Harper text with some apprehension but I totally enjoyed it!  It provides so many levels of deep thought while presenting the same Scout we all love. It is witty and poignant, a definite must read!<br/>I did not see an Atticus so very different than the fatherly figure of Mockingbird!!!
I liked the premise but definitely not up to "To Kill a Mockingbird" standards. It was written in a way that was so vague and confusing that I had to keep re-reading parts of it to figure out what was going on. Lots of "between the lines" stuff and if you had not read TKAM you would be completely lost. Very disappointing and I promise, you won't be missing anything if you do not read this.
I have trouble believing that this is even written by Harper Lee.  Scout, the strong willed child of Atticus in Mockingbird, grows up to be an indecisive, insecure woman using all the clichés of modern times to describe the conflicts of women in a man's world.  Someone cashed in on Ms. Lee's name.  This book does nothing to build on the characters of Mockingbird, making them two dimensional at the most.
Throughout my life, I have read To Kill a Mockingbird many times. The characters are well developed, and the story speaks to the emotions of growing up in the south during the civil rights movement. Go Set a Watchman never allows Scout to grow up, and the reader doesn't get to know Atticus as a man. Both characters are shallow; the book spends much too long telling a story that is not very interesting.
Don't waste your money. After the media frenzy about this book we all now know that Atticus is, or at last could be, considered a racist. A practical racist but a racist none the less. Having read this book I felt scammed, not be Lee perhaps but by her faithful lawyer who wants to perpetuate the Lee estate after her death. Mockingbird was a seminal book for its time and if you've read it -- stop there.
I had no idea where she was going. I was very disappointed.
I only saw the movie of To Kill AMockingbird, so I really didn't know Lee's style of writing....but it is a classic!  I enjoyed Watchman so much as I was getting to know that style.  Now, I must read Mockingbird.  The dynamics of how Scout was taught other peoples's views and why they do what they do, was just delightful......and how she can love them, but hold very different views. Such an interesting comment on overall social growth.
GSAW is actually Ms Lee's first book.It hasn't had the extensive rewrites that TKAM had.You can still recognize Ms Lee's writing style.I think it's worth reading,esp to find out what happened to "the Children",including Dill.Like the statement in TKAM,about Lawyers and Children,Scout always questions what she sees,even as a young woman,and no one by Ms Lee could've or should've written the continuation of the Finch family saga.
I took this with me on vacation, was so excited to read it and was so disappointed.  After ordering hundreds and hundreds of books from Amazon, I have never felt inclined to write a review, but I have to say that this is THE absolute worst book that I have ever read or ordered!!  Please don't waste your time or money. This book is absolutely nowhere near "to kill a Mockingbird." and it's no wonder that the publisher initially didn't want to publish this and told her to go back and develop a different story.
Despite all the hype about the book, it is a worthwhile read. I doubt that it would be widely read but for the previous highly successful book. Descriptions are fairly realistic of the times.  Characters are complex and well-developed.  Should produce a lot of discussion and social analysis when read together with "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I still think there is a comma missing in the title!
I was told that when Harper Lee handed this to her publisher, she was told to write a "prequel."  That "prequel" turned out to be :To Kill a Mockingbird."  When she finally let this be published, she told them NOT to make any editorial changes,  Without editorial changes, parts of this book that relate to the prequel, make little sense.  I prefer "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Full of surprises as in it was terrible.<br/><br/>It was a very disappointing continuation of the characters.<br/><br/>Jean Louise has zero character development and becomes increasingly annoying with every chapter. She is naive and manipulated to no end.<br/><br/>Not going to spoil anything but lets just say it feels very incomplete.<br/><br/>Bottom line some things should be left alone.
I did not purchase Go Set A Watchman personally from Amazon but was given the book as a gift. This book is definitely not on the level with To Kill A Mockingbird. Author does not write like a professional. The plot was sketchy and scattered. The story had little or no character development. I can't figure out why she published it. If Harper Lee penned this book then I'm reminded of the old speculation that Truman Capote actually wrote TKAM.
It is probably unfair to compare it with "To Kill a Mockingbird," but it is not as good. It was an interesting read, and the parts that reflected back on Scout's childhood were very good. But the apparent attempt to justify the bigotry of the citizens of the South during the early Civil Rights Movement was unconvincing. I much preferred "To Kill a Mockingbird."
I sincerely loved the book!  It was replete with struggles of Jean Louise regarding Atticus's (and others')  attitude and posture on blacks.  It was well written!  It was very obviously written by the same author as To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee.  I couldn't put it down, but I did not feel it was as gripping as Lee's "Mockingbird"!  Thus the 4 stars, rather than 5.
So very disappointed. I don't have a problem with learning more about the characters, it just seemed not as nuanced and visual as To Kill A Mockingbird.  Very simply written, not terribly deep, the story really didn't develop into much.  Everyone will read it because it is by Harper Lee but were it to be a contemporary book by an unknown it would probably not be a bestseller.
Spoiler Alert: While Scout (Jean Louise) is grown, the world of Maycomb has had some hard stagnation. It has reflections that you could have easily seen where this was a rough draft for To Kill A Mockingbird. I think that perhaps it could have been revised differently for the two books. However, living in the southern Gulf Coast for several years, some of the novel's ideas still resonate to present day.
There is a reason Harper Lee didn't publish this when she could have under her own power. This is an unpolished snipet of a story, but the worst thing about it is the justification and forgiveness of racism. This was written in a different time, but I can't believe Lee would have wanted her characters from Mockingbird portrayed in the way they are in this earlier draft. This is not a sequel. To claim so by the greed driven entities that pushed the publication of this long lost manuscript is the real sin.
Not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird". Thought provoking and realistic for the time. We all hope things are better now. It demonstrates the shades of grey in racial and class relations in the 1950s. Some people will be offended, since that seems to be common these days. I grew up in this time and she just tells it like it was. Can't change it by covering it over.
This book shouldn't have been published.  A total money grab from the publishing company.  Poor Harper Lee.  She would have never allowed this if she'd been in her right mind.  The writing is sophomoric and there is an incredible absence of editing.  Not to mention the distasteful, bizarre (considering what we read in To Kill A Mockingbird) racism; it was just poor writing.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
I do wish that Harper Lee would have made it as polished a literary work as To Kill a Mockingbird. If she just spent more time on reworking it it also could have been a great novel. It is an important to read it in that context. Very interesting had important insights into Jean Louise becoming her own person with her own identity. A must read. Great religious symbolism.
People who are upset, I'm sure, are people who haven't read TKAM recently. They know it (maybe from high school) but not well enough to recognize the fundamental differences in the "worlds" of TKAM versus GSAW. Sure, some of the characters are different- that's because they are not the SAME  characters. If you don't know TKAM well, then you take GSAW as a sequel which it absolutely is NOT.
As a standalone book, I wouldn't particularly recommend reading GSAW. But I reread TKAM just before GSAW and then found GSAW very illuminating.  I thought it provided valuable insights to Harper Lee's thoughts and perspectives as she crafted both books... especially keeping in mind the order in which they were written.  I think it is a worthwhile read in this context.
I was very disappointed in the book.  As a  sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, it was a major rip off.  It lacked a plot and much of the humor and humanity of the first book were severely lacking.  The thing I found most charming in the first book was the story was told from the point of view of a young girl, Scout. This honest voice of a young child was sorely missing.
Typical outburst of young liberal without accurate sense of history. Editors rightly thought the story of Scout and Jem, handled in flashbacks in this book would make a more unified book. Also, given the date of publishing To Kill a Mockingbird would be more acceptable but this book is still pretty interesting and Harper Lee has a wonderful grip on southern  idiom/
Disappointing!  Atticus was nothing like his character in Mockingbird; neither was Scout's adult character a product of her childhood.  Jem was, unfortunately, not part of the "sequel" for tragic reasons.  It would have been much more interesting if he had been a part of the story.<br/>The extended family had a greater role than Atticus himself.  Strange.
I read "To Kill A Mockingbird" in the early sixties as a high school English assignment.  "Go Set A Watchman" was written in the fifties yet only just released.  Now I understand why.  The only word that I could use to describe this story is BORING.  It seems to take forever to discover any plot and by that time one can only be overtaken by sleep.
I was completely underwhelmed.  Disappointed at best.
I was very disappointed in this book. I agreed with the original publishers who sent it back for a rewrite.<br/>After reading this book I felt that the only reason it was published was for financial gain. I commend Harper Lee  for turning this flawed manuscript into To Kill  a Mockingbird which I consider to be one of the greatest works of American literature.
To be honest... I was disappointed.<br/>I was really excited at the release of this book. However I had to drudge through it to the finish.<br/>It was not very interesting to me at all.<br/>Of course we are all very familiar with past writings of Harper Lee and those are to be celebrated... but you won't find me placing this novel among those.<br/>Bummed ;(
A welcome addition to literary canon of the South. Eloquently written about the struggle of persistent racism in the effort to hold fast mores of a fading once proud valued heritage. Highly recommend this to readers of Faulkner, Welty, McCarthy, Styron, et al...kudos for timely publication that "pairs" Mockingbird & Watchman for stimulating discussion, forever!
Could not and did not put it down! So compelling! If it truly was unedited, it's a masterpiece of writing; those who criticize just don't know the southern dialect. I read a lot, different styles and genres and I can't tell you when I've so thoroughly enjoyed a book! I only hope the rumors of another manuscript are true! After all these years, it is so good to once again enjoy the mind and heart of Nell Harper Lee.
I am glad I read the novel, as a study of Lee's first attempt at writing her philosophy concerning the subjugation, mistreatment, and misceptions of blacks and the Anglo heritage passed on from Eastern Europe to the white settlers of America. Her naive and amateurish attempt is interesting in contrast to her leap to a polished novelist in her second attempt.
I really enjoyed this book.  Although not written as well as To Kill A Mockingbird (obviously her first attempt), I found the change in the characters fascinating.  What a feat to take this book, extract and develop the characters, and write TKAM.  Too bad the editor didn't encourage her to finish this one afterwards because I think they make a perfect pair.
I'm a huge fan of "To Kill a Mockingbird". I was very excited to hear of Ms. Lee's new release. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. I know many have said they enjoyed the book and were able to delve into the whole debate of whether this was a rough draft for Mockingbird. I will remain a fan of Ms. Lee's but this book was not for me.
What has happened to Harper Lee?  VERY DISAPPOINTED!
It is difficult to believe that Harper Lee wrote it.
I am glad this book has been published. I am glad it was published now - rather than when originally submitted. I believe this novel is a rich addition to the meta-world of "Mockingbird" - rich in nuance and the dichotomies of real life. The story around this publication served to lure me back to reading literature again- and I am a happy camper.
I loved the writing.  The text was laden with an excellent vocabulary which supported the thoughtful insights into a culture in flux.  The book fares better if considered free of thoughts about "Mockingbird."  Atticus is a fictional, flawed person; let hi be and consider him as such.  I really do not care when, or under what star Harper Lee wrote this.  Enjoy it standing alone.
My favorite book is "To Kill a Mockingbird" as well as my favorite movie.  However, I just couldn't get turned on by this story. I finished it but it left me empty.  I was disappointed that Jem's death was elaborated on,like her feelings about the loss or Atticus' feelings. I thought that should have been covered. It just wasn't what I expected.
The original editor was right not to publish this book.
I am honestly not sure how I feel about this book. It is not up to the quality of To Kill a Mockingbird. It was fun to revisit characters but my idea of Atticus has been crushed. I was shocked at the discussions between Scout and Atticus and what I felt were disgusting reasons for bad behavior. In an earlier time this might not have shocked me as much.
This read provides an insight peek into origins and nature of southern prejudice. It paints a painfully detailed picture of why some of its notable characters can harbor unseen bias while appearing just the opposite on all other occasions.<br/>  It is a slow read, not a page turner. It lectures and teaches, while making feeble attempts to entertain.
Wasn't what I had hoped it would be. Disappointing.
As a HUGE fan of To Kill a Mockingbird, I was so terribly disappointed with this book. The characters were not very well fleshed out and the writing was nowhere near the quality of what you would expect from Lee. I hate to say it, but I think this book should have remained an unpublished draft, or endured several more rounds of rewrites and editing.
I was a little disappointed in this book.  Don't know exactly what I expected, but was hoping that Scout had added to the family legacy by working in civil rights or women's rights, something along those lines.  Instead, I found it to be about Scout growing up finally and realizing that even one's family is never perfect, but love is always there.
I was not able to put it down except at a couple spots where it called for reflection.  I can understand why it was not published initially, it is not as polished as Mockingbird but stands up pretty well.  Certainly fleshes out Atticus.<br/>There are a couple of inconsistencies, and omissions - not really significant unless you have a bit of OCD.
The story seemed disjointed and poorly organized.  It would have been extremely confusing if I hadn't already known the characters from Mockingbird.  I see why the publishers encouraged Harper Lee to rethink it.  It was interesting to look at it as author's craft and see how an author can revise and rework a piece into something very different.
I had high expectations for this Harper Lee novel but it did not measure up.  From the prose of her other novel to the prose of this one, much changed.  Toward the end of the story, there were some situations concerning race relations that would make for good discussion-starters in book clubs.  Other than that, I was disappointed in this book.
It's no mystery that Mockingbird was born of this manuscript. Most of what transpires in Watchman amounts to nothing more than elaborate sketches. There just isn't very much happening here, and there isn't much of a reward at the end.  The editors were spot on to realize that those parts that became Mockingbird were the stuff of a great novel.
If there were an option for NO stars, I would check that.  I cannot verbalize how disappointed I am in Harper Lee.  I have always loved To Kill A Mockingbird, read it, and re-read it.  Watched the movie umpteen times.  I could not force myself to even finish this book.  Even if you are a big Harper Lee fan, as I am/was, don't waste your money.
Poor character development of characters you loved
The key to enjoying Go Set a Watchman is to not compare it to To Kill a Mockingbird.  Who knows why it came out now, whether it really is a first draft, what could have caused Atticus to have feet of clay. Read it for itself. The main flaw for me is dialogue; Lee sometimes has her characters make speeches instead of talking with each other.
I was so excited to read this book, but it didn't take long for that to change. Ugh. What jumbled up mess this book is. I don't recognize any of the peeps from To Kill a Mockingbird. The names are the same, but that's the extent of it. I do not like any of them, especially not Scout. I'm not saying Harper Lee didn't write TKAM, but I honestly can't see how this book could have been written by the same author.
I wouldn't want a manuscript I wrote in my early 20's to be published without me having a final say.  I feel that this book would have been better kept in the safe deposit box.  On the plus side, it does let us walk with Jean Louise as she finds that her beloved father, Atticus, has feet made of clay.  Our parents are human, not demigods.
I had been looking forward so much to reading this novel, and now that I've completed it, all I have is an empty feeling, all the air sucked out of me, limp like a deflated balloon. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my top 20 favorite books, and I've read thousands. I couldn't wait to meet the grown up Scout and Jem; now I wish I hadn't.
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED
I was completely disappointed with this novel!  The writing was so-so and the story line became beyond cloudy when Scout sought her uncle's explanation of Atticus's unexpected lean toward racism.  Despite this, I still hold To Kill a Mockingbird close to my heart as the best and most important piece of 20th century literature out there.
So disappointed by this book, chagrinned even, I'd like to delete it permanently from my e-library. Not only do Atticus and his brother reveal deeply troubling racist personalities, Scout appears to be swayed by them. I wish I could give it no stars--it's an apologist's view of slavery and racism and it never should have been published.
It was a disappointing read. I expected so much better from the author of my all time favorite book. Now I wonder if the rumors I've often read about Capote being the ghost writer of "To Kill a Mockingbird " are true. This book was nothing like the best selling book & it didn't have the rhythm of the book it supposedly inspired.
I loved it.  I thought the quality of the writing was the same as To Kill a Mockingbird.  I think Lee digs deeper into Atticus, and her revelations about him don't necessarily represent a change from his character in the first book.  I thought it was interesting hearing the point of view of an independent woman during that time as well.
I lived during all this period of time and knowing that Harper was just out of High School when she wrote the book, it speaks of the way she felt during those days that we lived. At that age we were all idealistic and judgmental about our parents.  It took life's experiences for me to understand and admire my parents for who they were.
This book will not change your opinion of Atticus!  It might teach you about bigotry, though. When Scout tells stories from her childhood, it's just like old times.  I think Harper Lee wrote a better book in Mockingbird, but Watchman satisfied this fan who has always wanted more from this great story teller. I think it's a great read.
The plot is rambling and unfocused with long angry dialogues that provide little thoughtful insight into the racial issues of the time. I was very disappointed especially after just re-reading To Kill A Mockingbird. There is none of the careful plot development and subtle clues to the characters as there was is "Mockingbird". I can't believe it was written by the same author.
I loved t o Kill Mocking Bird and so looked forward to reading Harper Lees 2nd  book. It was a total disappointment. How could the author  change Scout so much that she became a stranger to me  she was selfish  and self serving. However, the uncles spanking still did not improve her character. Ship her back to her  beloved New York.
While it was tough to come to the same realization as Scout that her father, Atticus, isn't as perfect as she believed, it was refreshing to see that even those ideals we hold up in society still have imperfections--are still real people. In true Lee fashion, the story is well-written with beautiful prose and effective description.
It is definitely of the period..and, in light of all that is going on these days in terms of civil rights, I found it terribly depressing to remember that it was even worse in the period during which this was written.  I so preferred To Kill a Mockingbird and the defenses of Atticus.  This takes you to a very dark, segretory place.
I struggle to write a favorable review for this book.  I loved To Kill A Mockingbird but not so much Go Set A Watchman.  It's really all about Scout's selfishness and inability to view the world outside of herself.  To Kill had a much more engaging plot with lots of twists and turns.  This book was dull.  I would not buy it again.
An interesting look at that era of racial tensions.  And whether truly this book is written before 'Mockingbird" and why not published is a mystery. And also whether Miss Lee is the author, who knows?  Book is a wonderful look at the changing times of race relations and Grown up Scout's take on her father and her childhood community and family.
It was confusing in parts. The majority in the book club didn't like it.The most interesting parts was when she had flashbacks.<br/>It started a whole conversation on racism. What it was like when they were growing up, in the area the lived. We couldn't believe that a young girl living in a city could come home and be so naive.
There are powerful, lyrical sections of this book where the author we remember from To Kill a Mockingbird takes command of the story and takes our breath away. This is usually in the flashback sections, but then that remembered author slips away. Scout told a story.  Her grown up self tries to explain and justify, and we don't really care.
It was Harper Lee's first novel and it showed. I found it a little boring in spots. I probably will re-read it sometime to see if my first impression changed or I missed something. It definitely wasn't near as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. Still, I am glad I read it to see if it lived up to the hype. In my opinion it did not.
Given this was Lee's first novel I should not have been disappointed, but I was. This work is not comparable with Mockingbird. Watchman lacks depth. The storyline surrounding Atticus is not well developed. Some of it isn't plausible. The uncle is a joke. I'm glad her legacy will east on Mockingbird. This one will be forgotten.
The writing seemed all over the place. Made it hard to follow in places. Some sections had me go, "Wait what?" and I had to reread it. overall I finished it because I wanted to see how it ended. I LOVED To Kill a Mockingbird and could not wait for this one. I feel disappointed. It felt like someone else wrote the book.
All I can say is WOW!  So much hype and controversy about this book.  All I can say is read it.  I was expecting good things from it in spite of all that and it exceeded my expectations.  As someone who grew up in a small southern town in the 60's and 70's, every word rings true.  Many of us found ourselves in Scout's position.  Please, read it.
Harper Lee writes well.  Problem being that she didn't have a story to tell.  The publishers were correct  the first time when they refused to publish it.  If I were she, I would be embarrassed that this was put into print. Unfortunately, this action will now color the public's perception of her and her abilities.  This book could have used a severe editing and a release as a novella.
Lame, waste of time.  In need of a good editor.
Not a good read and really not what I expected.
I found that the book was readable, but really not as well written as its predecessor and that Scout seemed very confused about things most of the time. The contrast between the two books relative to Atticus is roughly explained,but weakly done. I can easily understand the initial publishers reluctance to publish this work.
A challenging story.  Most of us learn our parents have "clay feet" as we mature.  Then we learn our own faults.  As an old woman who has experienced integration, studied it, grown as it grew, I find the realism of these people's experiences "close to home."  I wish we were truly color blind, but we are not.
This book was thought-provoking and reflective. Many of the issues that are discussed in the book can apply to so many issues facing America still today. It is deep and not for those who cannot open their minds to other points of view. It is a coming of age book about Scout finally seeing her father as a man, a human and not a "God."
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS BOOK. THE FIRST HUNDRED PAGES WERE PROMISING HOWEVER, THE CHARACTERS BECAME INCONSISTANT. THE PLOT AND LANGUAGE WENT INTO AREAS THAT WENT TOO FAR. THE BOOK BECAME OFFENSIVE AND REPITIOUS. INSTEAD OF BEING REFLECTIVE OF THE SOUTH IN THAT ERA, THE POINT WAS LOST IN AN INCONSISTANT PLOT AND OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE.
I was so exited to receive Go Set a Watchman on the day it was released, & I had it read within a couple of days.  I was such a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird & even have had pets named for Scout and Atticus.  Needless to say, this novel (which I now understand why it was never meant to be published) left me disappointed.
Somebody (probably Lee Harper's attorney) should be paying me to read that POS !!<br/>Go Set a Watchman is a preliminary draft of TKAM that wasn't good enough to be published back then, and it certainly is not good enough for today's readers.<br/>Go Set a Watchman  is a poorly disguised effort to squeeze money from Harper's audience.
Not as good as "To Kill A Mockingbird"
There are pages of brilliant writing (usually what was poached, word for word, for Mockingbird) but the story isn't great and the writing in between the brilliance is shaky at best.  The last third of the book is just ranting and it's pretty boring and obnoxious.  This is Scout becoming an adult in a few days time.
Although just published, knowing it was written first, I read it as a study in how a novel is developed and how it can change from the first iteration into what is now considered a classic. I found the 20 something Scout to be as I imagined her as an adult, feisty, driven, at times funny, and always her own person.
Had high hopes for this but it turns out to be a lot of character development and aimlessly jumping back and forth 20 years in heroines life even between paragraphs. I agree with NYT editorial that it was published as a greedy money grab! I got 80% through the book and found no discernible plot so I put it aside.
It's too bad that Harper Lee's novelized diary was "discovered", and published.  Shakespeare's "....the good is oft interred with their bones." is the fate of Lee's literary fame; until now, secure in the public and academic acceptance.  Mockingbird will always suffer from remembrance of Watchman.
I can't say anything new that other people who were disappointed in this book have not said already.  I just add my name to the list of deeply disappointed Harper Lee fans.  If it were a well-written book, I could suffer the time-appropriate staining of Atticus' reputation but the prose was just bad.  Sad I spent the money to sully Lee's and Atticus' reputations.
Very disappointing, stylistically and content-wise.  The only enjoyable parts were those when Scout reminisces about her childhood and youth.  Because "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my favorite books, I felt almost betrayed after finishing this novel.  And Atticus' social and political views had nothing to do with it.
The novel starts out with the comfortable style we know from "To Kill a Mockingbird". I felt right at home and nostalgic. However, as the story develops,  there seems to be gaps and apparent writing style differences. Unfortunately the book left me wanting, and unfortunately wishing I had never read it.
Sad that this was not edited before publication. Very disjointed. Can see why it wasn't published earlier. Glad Harper Lee found a good editor that helped her take this and make it into the wonderfulness of "To Kill a Mockingbird". If her sister was still alive I don't think it would have been published
I found it more realistic than "To Kill a Mockingbird".  The writing was somewhat less polished than in Mockingbird.  But it was great for showing what life was in Southern Society on the eve of the Civil Rights Revolution.  The characters were very flawed humans but also I found them to be sympathetic.
I had a hard time with the first third of the book and then it did spark my interest.  She brought up a car accident involving a racial issue and then there wasn't another mention of it.  I found it interesting to compare to To Kill A Mockingbird and found it hard to imagine it being written by the same author.
Nowhere near the novel To Kill A Mockingbird.
I read one third of the book and couldn't read anymore. It's just boring. Nothing of significance occurs. The book is well written, perhaps better written than To Kill A Mockinbird. However, To Kill A Mockingbird is a significant book and with a significant message. Go Set A Watchman is not a significant book.
After you've read Go Set A Watchman start turning the pages of Something Must Be Done About Prince Edward County by Kirsten Green.  In brief its her personal observation and fact finding about her home in Virginia and Southern culture in general.  A culture that persists and perplexes me. Thank you Ms. Green!!
Not a single likable character, with the rough beginnings of a plot that drags along until it finally peters out without concluding.  You also get the sense that you walked in in the middle of the conversation.  If it didn't have Harper Lee's name on it there is no way it would have been published.  I think it would have been kinder to have left it in the safe deposit box.
Did not like anything about it.  Disliked everyone except Hank.  Only one anecdote about an incident at the prom was amusing.  The rest was totally boring.  I strongly do not believe a movie version of this book will be forthcoming.  Had to force myself to finish it, thinking it might get better.  IT DIDN'T.
Read the article in the July 25, 2015 issue of "The New York Times."  Find Joe Nocera's editorial called--"The Watchman' Fraud."<br/>Your view on this new publication will be completely altered and changed!  Complete money-making, con job by Rupert Murdoch, owner of HarperCollins, will surprise all readers.  Duped again by a snake doctor?
I became weary after about 30 pages and found it hard to keep reading. Felt very stilted and  simply didn't, flow smoothly,<br/>I had been looking forward to the read.<br/>Yes, there was a lot of racism but that was part of the South back then.<br/>Atticus was a good father but definitely misguided in his everyday life.
This book was meant to be a draft for To Kill a Mockingbird, and was never finished.  The author, Harper Lee, made it clear that this book was not to be published.  The publisher published the book for financial gain after her caregiver died, and after she had a stroke and severly disabled.  Poorly written.
I really enjoyed this book and the sincerity to the period and the people with all their flaws. Much more complex and definitely reflects that time. I was hesitant to read it because of my fondness for To Kill a Mockingbird. What came to realize is they can't be compared. They both have a place in my heart.
The book was disappointing and I wish it had not been published.  Ms Lee had a reputation for her wonderful book "To Kill a Mockingbird" and it would  have been better if we had never known she could write a poor book.  Sometimes you should quit while  you are ahead and this is ons of those times.
I was looking forward to this book, after growing up with " To Kill a Mockingbird".  What a disappointment.  Its easy to see why this was rejected by the publishers 50+ years ago, and should have been rejected by the publishers in 2015.  Its dull, boring, senseless, and a waste of time and money.
Although I did like it, I was just a bit taken back and surprised.  This novel is worth reading, and if Harper Lee had written a third book, I would read it as well.  I guess I have mixed emotions, having just completed the book.  None the less, I recommend this to anyone who like, To Kill a Mockingbird.
I was disappointed.  Her first novel, I loved and reread before this one. I think Go Set a Watchman was reality, but Atticus Finch, in my mind,<br/>as in Scout's, was above all that.<br/>I wasn't sure where the story was going. The setting and characterization was good. It needed more. I felt cheated.
If you've read To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman characters are in your mind as mostly developed from the previous book. The South that Atticus and his children knew was a much different world than we know today.  I found Atticus, his brother and "Scout" to be very sympathetic characters.
Just finished reading and was very disappointed in the book overall. Good characterizations, but really wordy and not tightly written. Where were the editors? For all the hype the book got, I would have expected much more from Harper Lee and her publishers.  Seems like this book is about the money. Sad
Better than I had hoped for.  It is not as complete a book as "To Kill a Mockingbird"; not as polished.  I enjoyed it and I believe that the stories about Racism are unfounded.  It was written in the "50" by a southern and views are true.  Some people can't take the reality of the past.
I'm an English teacher, and I've loved To Kill A Mockingbird since I was in high school. Despite media reports that the book is racist or diminishes characters, this story truly is meant for a more mature audience than the high school crowd. The characters' problems are problems we face today in our personal lives and as well as as a society. It's worth a read.
After reading this book I now understand why the original publisher passed on this book back in the day and asked Harper Lee to write about Scouts childhood more.  The book was sort of a jumbled mess.  I'm not upset or surprised by the character developments. Typical of the south during that time (and still today).
Nothing could entice me to put it down once I began. The melodious writing of Nelle Harper Lee sings once again. Moral and political views aside, it is one hell of a piece of work. No one has a voice like Ms. Lee.<br/><br/>I only wish Scout's profession had been revealed. Perhaps that story is waiting to be told.
Others have written reviews more detailed. I'll just add that as I breezed through this obvious draft, it's interesting to me to see how much an involved editor contributes to the writing process. Maybe we just don't have editors like that today. Or agents that will protect their clients. I feel this shouldn't have been distributed as a novel.
This book will suffer by comparison to its sibling. Both born of the same author but somehow so much different, not unlike most children of the same family. The big let down if the lack of a central story to hang all the themes upon. But give it a chance, it's worth a look and maybe a return someday.
I am very pleased that they came across Harper Lee's novel. It was a page turner and a very quick read. It makes the reader reflect and think back upon their childhood memories. It was interesting to see the characters again after reading the first novel so many years ago and teaching it several years after that.
To Kill a Mockingbird is a hard act to follow - but i found this book to be a let down.  The adult character of Jean-Louise was aloof, disappointing, not at all as i had imagined from her vibrant personality in the former book....<br/>The story-line seemed barely there....not one i would recommend.
The frequent criticisms that the book destroys reader's admiration for Atticus don't hold water for me.  People----both real and imagined---grow and change with time.  Atticus did what he could at both stages of his life.  The writing was more than adequate for what is thought of as her first novel.
To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books. That said Go Set A Watchman was not nearly the book it  predecessor is, but it is still a good read. It is interesting to read about Scout as an adult and Atticus as a flawed human. If you love TKAM, you should definitely read this as well.
Not nearly as absorbing as 'Mockingbird'.  There are no characters with whom the reader can identify. Jean Louise is not as appealing as Scout.  Atticus is not the image of conviction and integrity in this book, but he is not the hooded Klanner that the media suggested before the book was released.
Nothing really happens in this book and that's a sad payoff for slogging through the never-ending paragraphs of obscure and rarely used verbiage throughout this book.  Add to that the huge font to make the book seem meatier and it was really just a sad disappointment.  Nowhere near worth the money.
This story had relevance in the early 60's,and should have been published then. Now it's a slap in the face,that I,for one didn't appreciate. The book drug on and on,pontificating the whole way. I'm sorry I read this. To Kill A Mockingbird was a wonderful story,this book just didn't need to be written.
Did not enjoy this book nearly as much as "To Kill A Mockingbird."  I sort of plodded my way through it.  The character of Atticus was more complex than in TKAM.  I preferred his character as he was portrayed in that book more.  Don't think I would recommend it to any of my friends.
If you read Mockingbird and it is only a book about race relations and prejudice, then this book is not for you. If you see characters or want to see them fuller then this book is outstanding. I would love to take a college english class on the character developement/morality of Harper Lee.
Boring
Go Set A Watchman is difficult to not compare with To Kill A Mockingbird.  However, the reader needs to take the book on its true value. It is honest, polished, and well worth the effort.  It should have been edited, but it wasn't.  Atticus is human and believable.  Really enjoyed the book
First half of the book was ok, the second half was too wordy.  It had some good points, but it was more like a,dissertation about the history of race relations down south.  Some points made were an eye-opener and a unique way of looking back at our history, but not the greatest storyline.
I was disappointed in this book aside from all the buildup it got. It was boring! Full of platitudes and opinions and confusion. A round about way to present racism in the south. A lot of it was about things that weren't even interesting. I should have saved my money for a good mystery.
This was a very disappointing book by an author I had, and still do, revere. It really gives a black eye to a character, Atticus Finch, who has been an heroic figure since I read the book when I was about 12 years old. I am sorry I ever read this book and I'm going to try and forget it!
This is the most disappointing book I have read in years. I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird" and had high hopes for "Watchman". The pace of the book was tedious and it made no sense portraying Atticus as a bigot. There's clearly good cause for not publishing this book early, that being it sucks!
I found  this book very hard to comprehend.  A lot of the time I did not understand what was going on.  At the end it cleared up some of the misconceptions.  I was happy it turned out the way that it did.  There were some numerous places  in the story.  I enjoyed when scout reminisced.
Juvenile writing made book uninteresting.
In To Kill A Mockingbird Harper Lee told a story infused with symbolism that was anuanced and poetic take on American Justice and racial equality. Go Set A Watchman is literally a Soapbox rant about the same. Save yourself the $$$ and leave your memories of Scout, Atticus & Jem intact
It is not much more than dialogue and flashbacks.  The climax is not really until the last ten pages, and by then you are just ready for it to be over.  I was very disappointed in how Atticus was written.  The main point of the story was interesting, but it took you long to get to it
It was a painful experience finishing this "monologue".  It never revved up or really changed direction throughout.  I was disappointed after reading Harper Lee's TKAM first.  No comparison.  It's my understanding that GSAW was written before Mockingbird, and if so, it shows.
This book was poorly written and filled with boring details. It also seemed politically motivated. It's as if it was trying to reconcile the fact that a liberal hero (someone who believes in justice for all) could also be in favor of states rights and keeping the power structure the way it is.
Pleasantly surprised after reading negative reviews. Fascinating look into the minds of a number of people in that part of the south during those years. The racial situation then, as it is today, is far more complex than usually presented. My only complaint? The book was too short!
I haven't finished reading this yet because I got bored with it.  When (if) I finish it, I will give a more detailed review.  I can say this, though...I'm really glad I read To Kill a Mockingbird first, otherwise I wouldn't have picked it up if I had read Go Set a Watchman first.
Shame on those profiteering off Harper Lee.
Wish I hadn't read. Not what I expected.
Using personal memories/experiences helped me find the plot believable; no actual surprises.  I do believe that the editor who encouraged Ms Lee to focus on Scout's youth and the trial (To Kill a Mockingbird) made a very wise decision.  This seems a much more powerful and enduring story.
Cannot hold a candle to the classic To Kill a Mockingbird.  She brings forth whole passages from her first book into the second.  Much of the dialogue is too drawn out and very muddy.  Helps to put it into the place and time it was written, but overall a real disappointment.
With To Kill a Mockingbird as my all time favorite novel, I was looking forward with great anticipation to Go Set a Watchman.  Unfortunately I was deeply disappointed with the book and especially with Atticus's portrayal as a segregationist.  I am kind of wishing that I had never read it.
very little content not much of a story
Mockingbird was a tale of genuine morality, which had a lot to do with how endearing it was to everyone. Watchman has a much more political mindset: a bit disappointing. Lee relies heavily on Scout's flashbacks to the childhood era we loved to keep this somewhat engaging.
I was anxious to read this book as I loved To Kill a Mockingbird but to be honest, I've not been able to finish the book.  It's very slow and I'm not really sure of where the storyline is going.  Maybe one day I'll get through it but I was very disappointed in this book.
Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee is a must-read. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as To Kill a Mockingbird<br/>but wouldn't have missed reading it. I loved hearing Harper Lee's voice--the grown up Scout's voice, and the<br/>vivid characters that come to life on the page.
I felt like I was catching up with an old friend I hadn't seen in a long time...wonderful hearing Jean Louise's voice again!  Of course, the developed plots of TKAM aren't there, but I relished the character development...especially the parts that seemed like old family secrets.
I tried soooo hard to like this book, but it was just painful to read. I read the first 100 pages and still  had no idea what the plot was. Harper Lee would go off on side stories and you couldn't tell who was talking or when or what time frame you were in.... Save your money!
The characters did not seem adult and were childlike. A woman who was an adult and now lived in New York would not act and react in the way the main character acted. I had a hard time believing the same person who wrote this also wrote "To Kill  A Mockingbird"!
It appears that Atticus was not the man we thought he was but he was a good father, good at hiding his real self and almost destroying his daughter's love for him.  Too bad but I guess life is like that.  Nothing has changed in all the years that that book was written.
I understand why the original publisher assigned would have encouraged Harper Lee to develop the childhood character of Scout.  I think the release of this book fell short of the public's expectations.  To Kill A Mockingbird was a masterpiece and would be hard to top.
It read like a unpublished manuscript.
Not a well written book. Needs edited.
Surprising from the author and the special place that To Kill a Mockingbird has in our culture, but the novel does match my experience with the times and racial relations.  Only mystery is was it written first and publishers wanted to know more about her childhood?
Can't be the same author written before "Kill a Mockingbird."  Characters are not expanded upon at all and the entire premise of the book is southern racism.  I wasted several hours of my time.  I will still remember Atticus as I knew him before this book.
While I am a big fan of "To Kill A Mockingbird,' this book was edited to fit the agenda that if you are white, you ARE a racist. How the heroine was exempt from this was that she was written to fill the feminist agenda.  I found the book dull, slow and not worth the time or price.
I'm just not sold on this being entirely Harper Lee's works.. the characters have the same names but it's definitely not a normal progression of its predecessor. Marginally entertaining, poor plot development, and ridiculously and purposefully confusing language.
I waited patiently for this to be released once I heard about it, and I was not disappointed. We see Atticus Finch in a different light, but it fits the time and the setting, and it makes sense, even in light of the apparent differences in To Kill A Mockingbird.
Boring writing with none of the warmth, color, character that one would pair with Harper Lee. Feel as though we were tricked into buying this book based on the legacy that was established by "To Kill a Mockingbird." I wish I had borrowed it from the library...
Not sure Harper Lee wanted this released, but maybe her estate needed the money, read the original, pass on this one.  This was a library e-book  loan not a purchase, I was surprised Amazon prompted me for a review.  The e-book loan program is great by the way.
i enjoyed the novel very much, a little short in development but it does analysis the issues in the south during the 1960s.<br/>i would recommend it anyone that enjoyed to Kill Mocking Bird.<br/>do not listen to reviewers Acitcus is still a hero, look for it!
Go Set A Watchman was both nostalgic and dark, and developed slowly a very complex character for both Scout and Atticus.  It makes one really think about what we all have become.  I have trouble believing that this book was written before To Kill A Mockingbird.
Positively awful!! It should have stayed lost. I find it almost unfathomable that the person who wrote this was capable of authoring To Kill a Mockingbird. Waiting for the Truman Capote aficionados to renew the claims that it is HIS wizardry in TKAM which made it so memorable and mesmerising.
As a huge TKAM fan, this book was a disappointment.  Clearly Harper Lee was a progressive thinker and well ahead of her time - the message of the book was excellent.  Not especially well written and some parts, especially memories of Scout's dragged on and on.
If TKMB had not been published and loved, this book would have not seen the light of day. Everyone knew it would sell. Was all about the money. Hey, it's America, land of opportunity. But I hope no one actually believed there was literary value in this thing.
They should have kept this hidden in the trunk where they found it. It reads like a draft. No wonder the first publisher rejected it and told her to write it from Scout's perspective as a child. I'm sure they published it just for the money based on her name.
What a huge disappointment.  Don't waste your money or your time on this one.  There is a reason why it was not published when first written.  Slow, plodding, confused, and with an abrupt ending.  It's more of a novella or short story than a full blown novel.
Pretty good story if you read it for the individual story it is. Why would you expect it to be anything like To kill a Mockingbird . The same character's were in this book but the two books are not meant to be the same. The times of the two were so different.
Great writing but no comparison to ".....Mockingbird".  Weaker theme..what does Uncle Jack represent?...Scout is too smart to not figure it out and why all the tears?<br/><br/>Sorry...disappointing....don't read if you love "Mockingbird"...
Very disappointed. First half of the book was uninteresting and the writing seemed scattered. Atticus' true beliefs were so sad and disappointing to Jean Louise (Scout) and myself. Ingrained values(?) - I get it. Ending in poignant- but still not satisfying.
I like history.  Obviously characters change from 2KAMB.  Harper Lee's ability to structure conflicts and resolutions is as good in this book as ever.  An enjoyable read, and I still like the the original characters as much as ever, after enjoying this book.
The dialog was very disjointed and hard to follow. I'm also a cynic and wonder why this was published now with it's talk about state's rights and how the civil war wasn't really about slavery. I wonder who got this published and it's more rewriting history.
I was disappointed. It doesn't compare to Lee's first book and I suspect its #1 best seller rating is due to people expecting it too. It is rather wordy and pedantic on the subject of race relations and doesn't generate a lot of interest in the characters.
This is not To Kill A Mockingbird, but it was good. All the hoopla about Aticus being a races is a good example of people using today's standards to judge people from the past. I thought the story was more about family dynamics and "coming of age."
It was good overall, but I'm so glad "To Kill A Mockingbird" came out first.  This version just gives a very different prospective, an adult perspective and is not as moving as "To Kill a Mockingbird" .  It is good to have read them both.
I think Harper lee's editor gave her great advice to revise and write "To Kill a Mocking Bird" first.  I enjoyed the book but was expecting more.  To kill a mocking bird is my all time favorite book so I don't think anything could have compared.
Loved this book and the chance to get to know these beloved characters better -- warts and all. Just wondering -- is Jean Louise's childhood nickname in any way related to the 'Watchman' in the title? Both 'Scout' and 'Watchman' share the meaning 'sentinel'.
Poorly written, which makes sense as its a draft. Confusing flipping between flashbacks and present day. I'll give it two stars because the flashbacks seem well written and more thought out. Even if I hadn't read its predecessor, the rating would remain the same.
I have nothing new to offer that hasn't already been said by other disappointed readers. I think this was a money making ploy on the part of the publishers and not something Harper Lee would have gone ahead with in younger days. I too wish I hadn't read it.
poorly written and just plain boring
I didn't feel it shows Atticus as a raciest. It just shows Scout as immature, not at all like the smart loving Scout of To Kill a Mocking Bird. I thought it was boreing and preachy and can see why it was not published. It should have stayed that way.
If you’ve cherished To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee’s Go Set A Watchman will probably be a curious, challenging, and possibly unsatisfying experience. Mockingbird, both the book and the film, has, of course, claimed such an iconic niche in the public psyche that this related volume is at an immediate disadvantage. Yet Watchman also surprises with its own course and, I found, lingered in my mind long after I completed it.<br/><br/>At first Watchman seems to meander with its story line, perhaps like small-town life in the heat of summer. The protagonist, Jean Louise, returns to Maycomb Junction, Georgia, her hometown, for an annual visit to her beloved father, Atticus, who has aged considerably since he first appeared in Mockingbird as the single father of two young children. Soon enough Maycomb’s cast of characters appears, each of study of tradition, ritual, and quirkiness. There’s an early suggestion that race relations will dominate this story, but the start of the incident seems much-delayed. In the meantime, the flashbacks of childhood reminiscences sometimes seem almost irrelevant. Jean Louise’s close relationship with her older brother and her flirtation with her childhood friend and perhaps future husband set the scene further.<br/><br/>Once Jean Louise is exposed to the reality of how her family, especially her father, experiences and accommodates the questions of race, she is thrown into a tailspin. What surprises and troubles the story is the turn from attitudes about race to a young woman’s coming of age. How does she live with an idyllic childhood and romanticized relationships and how does she set herself free to find her own way as an adult?  The turnabout is intriguing, but Jean Louise’s conclusions about race in 1950s South seem unresolved. The author does present the question of how much understanding and patience are required for something as complicated as a way of life tied to racial disparities and, frequently, outright racism.<br/><br/>Although Watchman might have been better told with greater focus and story development, it is an intriguing story that is ultimately as nuanced and complicated as Southern racial traditions and way of life.<br/><br/>Michael Helquist, author, MARIE EQUI: Radical Politics and Outlaw Passions
I don't have many fond memories of assigned reading back in my school days. In fact, aside from the ones I hated, (Fahrenheit 451 still tops that list to this day) I can't even recall most of what we were forced to read. I do, however, remember To Kill a Mockingbird because, as seems to be the case for most, I actually enjoyed it. 50 years or so later, the story still rang true, had a strong message, and I found Lee's writing style to be, while simple, easy to read and simple to grasp. It always amazed me that such a successful book never seemed to have a follow-up, or, even more surprising, that Harper Lee never bothered to pen another novel.<br/><br/>Well, as we can all see, a sequel-of-sorts, did end up coming down the line. Like most folks, I was excited to hear the announcement of another book by Lee, and though it took me a little bit longer than most, I did eventually manage to get my hands on a copy of Go Set a Watchman. In a way, I wish I would have just gone and gotten the book the day it came out, that way I could have avoided all the controversy that seemed to pop up after it was published. The news of the fight for the release of the book by Lee's family (an obvious money grab on their part) and hearing that Lee herself is stuck in some retirement home, basically senile and not even really understanding that her uncompleted draft had been expanded into a novel (for which she will probably see very little royalties) kind of put a damper on the whole mood even before I started reading.<br/><br/>And then there is the book itself. While Lee's similar style is still there, and it still has that classic Americana feel that To Kill a Mockingbird did, the impact and lesson that Go Set a Watchman tries to teach, feels quickly dated and not as poignant. Yes, racial tension is an important subject, and yes, in 2015, it seems that the general mood of the 1950's South has returned, but to me, at least, it's just a rehash of old ideals. When Atticus defended the black man in To Kill a Mockingbird, it was statement that all men, regardless of skin color, should be treated fairly and in accordance with the law. Here though, when Atticus goes on, at length, of the infancy of the African American population and their lack of cohesion, it just didn't feel like the same message was there. Plus, it could easily come off as racist...which has seemed to put a good number of folks off this book. I'm going to leave my own opinions and beliefs out of this one, but I will say this...take a look at Baltimore and Ferguson, MI. Then look at Harper Lee's descriptions. An interesting parallel, if I do say so myself. And, remember, though the copyright says 2015, this book was mostly written in the midst of the late 1950's, early 1960's American south, where attitudes and ideas where a lot different, and culturally more acceptable.<br/><br/>I also found the story to move at a glacial pace. Don't misunderstand me, I do enjoy the typical "slice-of-life" story every now and again. They make nice breaks from my typical horror and thriller fare. However, when it takes nearly 60-70% of the novel to get moving, and the basic premise is solved in the last 3 or 4 pages, then I have a bone or two to pick. This book is relatively short (278 pages or so in the printed edition), but at times, it feels like War and Peace. There's a lot of unnecessary flashbacks and too much inner-monologue from Scout's point of view. And while I get this is her story, the stronger characters from Mockingbird (Atticus, Jem, etc.) are relegated to bit players or are absent altogether. Even Scout herself, who is 26 now and a full fledged woman, seems immature for her age and not the same, insightful young tom-boy we saw previously. The love story angle could have been great, and Lee had some nice insights into love, and the questions it poses, yet it peters out and quickly takes a back seat to the more mediocre main plot.<br/><br/>I didn't exactly hate Go Set a Watchman. Like I said, it's easy to read, and it's a nice mirror of atomic-age America. It's also nice to see that Harper Lee did have eventual plans and more stories for the Finch clan. Plus, I did get the chance to be alive when this much wanted book finally came out. I just wish it lived up to its hype and presented a stronger plot. Really though, when it all comes down to it, Harper Collins and the Lee family are laughing their way to a ridiculous pay-day, for an otherwise underwhelming book...and that's really the worst part isn't it?
In ninth grade English class, I read To Kill a Mockingbird for the first time. I gobbled it up, finishing the novel in less than a week. Because of my love of the first book, I hoped the sequel to be just as riveting. My opinion of Go Set a Watchman is not black and white: Through language, the novel is as nearly entertaining as its sister book, yet lacks the action featured in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>By itself, Go Set a Watchman is an easy and reasonably pleasant read. I appreciated the historical allusions throughout the book that keep its setting realistic and interesting. The novel does a good job of displaying the small town of Maycomb as just what it is: a slow Southern town that has not seemed to change since Scout's childhood-- that is, from an outsider's perspective. The novel talks minimally of Jean Louise's life in New York City. Although a reader may initially crave an explanation of her new lifestyle, the book's way of painting Maycomb anew is intriguing. The small changes are ones that Scout notices, and what most of the novel focuses on. The amount of war veterans and African Americans has increased, and prove to be a struggle within the town's conservative aura.<br/><br/>One thing in Maycomb has hardly changed, and that is its citizens. The characters are as laugh-out-loud and back-and-forth as they were in To Kill a Mockingbird. Their dialogue makes the novel quick and fun to digest. The Finches's humor is displayed on page 86 when Atticus responds to the family scandal of Jean Louise late-night swimming by saying only, "'H'rm... I hope you weren't doing the backstroke.'" Even within serious topics that the novel touches on, the family humor keeps the book going. Without these interactions, I believe the book would not be realistic enough to follow. Surely Maycomb could be considered a strict, boring town-- a town that is even suspected to dabble in incest. However, because of the large importance of family, the sequel is kept lighthearted and is prevented from becoming too drab.<br/><br/>The largest contrast between Go Set a Watchman and its prequel is Watchman's lack of action. In Mockingbird, there was drama, anticipation-- a new episode one after another. I believe the youthful characters contributed to this previous excitement. With the new adults, less is happening and the book therefore strongly relies on conversation to develop the plot. Without the past fun of a child's summer, the book begins to become boring and lackluster.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe Go Set a Watchman is a enjoyable read, full of fun dialogue and interesting contrasts. It is not as exciting as its prequel, yet many may say it is unfair to expect a sequel to be as wonderful as the previous novel.
I have avoided reading reviews of this book because I didn't want to read spoilers and I also didn't want other people's thoughts to influence my thoughts of the book.<br/><br/>I also was a bit nervous to start to read it because To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books and well I didn't think this one would be as good, but at the same time since I read how disappointed many was over this book and how angry they were over how Atticus was portraited in this book. And, I can understand that. But at the same time I can understand him since racism against African Americans was very common in Alabama at that time. I also think that the ending with Scout and her uncle Jack discussing her different opinions and how important that she sees her father as human and that it was time for her to stop thinking of him as a God was an important part of the book. And, since I have never put Atticus on a pedestal didn't my images of him shatter when I read about his opinions of African Americans people. I didn't agree with him, but I was also not upset. I was more surprised that it took 26 years for Scout to realize it. But the flashbacks in this book I think showed quite well how little Scout knew and how blind she was and how blind she is.<br/><br/>But I must admit that this book was just not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. The story in this book had just not the same impact as the previous book had. I was wondering quite a long time while I read the book what the point of the book was. It had some funny moments, for instance, young Scout thinking she was pregnant. But Frankly it feels that this book is not that necessary to read unless you want to know what happened with Scout, Jem, and Dill. And, I missed Jem and Dill in this book.<br/><br/>So in the end all I want to say that I'm glad that the publisher told Harper Lee to write a book about Scout growing instead of publishing this one. Because if they hadn't done that we probably wouldn't have had To Kill a Mockingbird.
Jean Louise Finch, twenty five, has been living in New York City. She returns home to Maycomb Junction, Alabama, to visit her father, Atticus Finch, who is now elderly and suffering from arthritis. He is having a hard time getting around and doing things for himself. He moved in with his sister Alexander who still lives in the house that she and Atticus grew up in. Atticus has his own law firm and has always been known as a very fair lawyer. Jean Louise, known as Scout to her family and childhood friends, is being persuaded by her Aunt to return to Maycomb permanently to help and continue her life there. Her childhood friend and now boyfriend, Henry, lives in Maycomb as well. He is a lawyer in Atticus's law firm.<br/><br/>Within just a few days, Jean Louise notices nothing ever changes in Maycomb. She goes on a date with Henry and they are spotted swimming in the river together. The next day at church, the gossip is already spreading that they were skinning dipping and the disgrace she must be to the family, especially Alexander.<br/><br/>Aunt Alexander hosts a tea for the women in town to say hello to Jean Louise. Jean Louise realizes from the conversations between the women, that all they have to talk about is themselves, their family, gossip, and the black race. Jean Louise having lived in New York for five years, is now used to seeing black people everywhere and treated more or less as equals. But the South is still the South, and the Negro race is still considered to be less equal to the White race in every way possible.<br/><br/>In the Finch house, they had a black maid and workers.They were never treated badly, unfairly, or disrespectful. Jean Louise's mother died when she was two so she never knew her. She and her brother Jem, who passed away when he was in his twenties,(it is never explained how he died), were raised by their father and their maid, Calpurnia. Calpurnia was the closest thing to a mother Jean Louise knew.<br/><br/>After the tea, Jean Louise was to visit her Uncle but heard of meeting at the Court House that both her father and Henry were attending. She slips into the Court House and up to the balcony where she use to go to watch her father argue his cases. She is shocked to hear a visiting speaker talk about the Negro Race as being one of less than human and how they needed to make sure they were kept separate from the Whites no matter what the law said. The fact that Atticus and Henry were there as part of the group horrified her. She then lost all respect she ever had for both of them.<br/><br/>Scout grew up with a father who could do no wrong. He always treated her, along with the people in town, fairly and just. Seeing another side of her father, one she did not know, threw her whole present and past in a tail spin. She didn't know which father was the real one, so to speak. It was time for her to grow up and figure out how to put the father of her past memory into the father that she sees before her now.<br/><br/>Harper Lee wrote this book in the 1950's. On the advice of her editor, this was not the time to publish this book. It was too relevant for the time period and could cause a backlash resulting in low sales and ratings. She suggested that Harper Lee write a book with her characters being younger. Hence, we have, "To Kill A Mockingbird". We all agreed it was the best advice she could get and indeed take.
I rated this a three not because it isn't written well, but because it doesn't have the re-readability that to kill a mockingbird has. I read to kill a mockingbird as a child and again as an adult. Knowing this book was "lost" while I read it became increasingly more like this book has been waiting to be let into the world when it may have been accepted.<br/><br/>~SPOILER ALERT~<br/><br/>To kill a mockingbird absolutely revolved around racism in the south and how some reacted to it. To set a watchman took that idea and hammered it in. It was not as enjoyable as to kill a mockingbird. Not because the writing wasn't rich enough, or the characters were not lifelike enough, but because it took the ugliness of racism and pushed it too hard. It also changed my views about Atticus and has now made it so I cannot read either book again with the same feeling I did upon re-reading to kill a mockingbird before reading this book.<br/><br/>What does that mean? I lost my wonder and excitement of reading about a truly atrocious court case where even though I know the outcome I can't help but expect a different one. The case is so compelling and clearly laid out that it flabbergasts me every time when the verdict is guilty. I felt this as a child and an adult.<br/><br/>To set a watchman expanded too much on growing up and being your own person without really going anywhere in the story. Not much has happened by the end except that scout will never see the world the same, and neither will I.<br/><br/>Does this make it a bad book or not worth recommending, no. But it certainly isn't a pleasant walk down memory lane. It's a slap in the face, even while I know it speaks truth.<br/><br/>America has a bloody, messy, ugly, hot mess of a past. We know it happened, but we (those presently alive) may never fully be able to comprehend the level of hatred that was (and I pray is not still) like breathing for some people.<br/><br/>I'm a typical American, I love the freedom I have but I do not fully know the path that was forced to be walked to get to the freedom I enjoy. That may be confusing because I don't mean freedom from slavery, I mean the freedom from hatred and utter ignorance simply because it's how things are done.<br/><br/>It took many people far better than myself to do the heavy lifting to get to this day and age, and we haven't completely finished the fight.<br/><br/>We still don't have equality for all, special privileges for none. The really ugly fact is, that ideal will never happen as long as people who are selfish and rich make the decisions that change how our country lives.<br/><br/>This book talks about being afraid of the black mans vote because we only get so many blocks of votes. The only think that has changed in this fear is that it has now been exchanged for the fear of the impoverished vote. Again, selfish rich people don't want to share their earnings, lest they lose the power the earnings give them.<br/><br/>We know what's wrong with how things work, but the age old adage of "it's how we've always done things" keeps the status quo cranking.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this to someone who loved "to kill a mockingbird?" No, because although written well it doesn't have the magic that makes the first book re-readable.
As an initial matter, it needs to be realized that this is NOT a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. While GSAW's characters have the same names as TKAM, those characters have the same relative ages in both books, live in a small Alabama town with the same name in both books etc. there are differences which make clear they are not the same people. Rather this is an early draft of TKAM which was apparently rejected by publishers causing Harper Lee to extensively rewrite it to set it when Scout was a child with a child's views on the world. I think we got a much better book in TKAM.<br/><br/>With that in mind, GSAW should be read without trying to compare it to or setting its plot congruent with TKAM. They are simply two different books albeit, two books with a related genesis. And because of that, criticism (both positive and negative)of GSAW should be of that book on its on its own merits.<br/><br/>That said, I found GSAW to not be a very good book. It's not that it's so badly written for the most part; it is as clear and easy to read as TKAM. But I found the structure to not make much sense, the characters weak and not very likable and in the end, found the whole thing to be a rather despicable excuse for racism in the deep south in the 1950's.<br/><br/>As to the structure, I have no idea what the point of the flashbacks to incidents when Scout was growing up was supposed to be. Well, maybe "no idea" is a bit strong. They must be to impress on us about how wonderful life as a child of Atticus Finch was growing up in Maycomb so that when Scout finds out about Atticus' gross racism she is suitably shocked. But while these flashbacks are cute, what they really serve to do is to show how utterly oblivious Scout had to have been all the years of her life before coming back to town at age 26. Atticus views on race are so pervasive, deep, and morally repugnant that it is not possible to believe that there was not reason for Scout to have been unaware of them before she goes to the meeting of the Citizens' Council.<br/><br/>Nor did I find any of the characters to be even marginally likeable. Neither Atticus' or Henry's excuses for their behavior is even slightly mitigating, at least in 2015. Back in the 50's maybe it would have been different but the book wasn't published then even if that is when it was written. Nor did Scout's backtracking after her long philosophical discussions with her uncle and father (which are particularly badly written) impress me. In the end, while they all find some of the excesses of the Klan disturbing, even Scout accepts that the negro population is nothing but a group of children who can't take care of themselves and who certainly have no right to equality with their betters. Even Jean Louise thinks the bad guys are the Supreme Court and the NAACP because they want to change things. In the end, my biggest disappointment in the book comes from Scout's apparent acceptance that Atticus is right and that she should return to Maycomb.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed out that without having read TKAM, the reader of GSAW would have no understanding of much of the motivations of the characters in the earlier book, in particular Jean Louise's utter shock at her father's and Henry's presence at the Citizen's Council meeting. For that and other reasons, that GSAW was not published when it was written was certainly appropriate. It certainly would not have been published now but for the success of TKAM and it is unfortunate that it was published.
Having read To Kill a Mockingbird many, many times and having taught To Kill a Mockingbird to my 8th graders I was elated when I learned that Harper's Lee's long-awaited sequel, Go Set a Watchman, was finally going to be in print!  However, as soon as I began reading Lee's new book, I felt like a leaky balloon, slowly deflating as I went from page to page.  The book contains many of our beloved characters: Jean Louise Finch (Scout), the famous Atticus Finch (Scout's father), & Calpurnia (the Finch's black maid and cook).  We also get details about some of the lesser known characters: Aunt Alexander (Atticus's sister) and Uncle Jack (their brother) and Henry "Hank" Clinton, Scout's long-time friend and love.  However, some of the main characters, whom we cherished in days gone by, are simply gone:  Jeremy (Jem) Finch is dead, Dill has moved away, and the elusive Boo Radley is not mentioned a single time!  What we are left with is Jean Louise (Scout), now a New Yorker, who has returned to Maycomb, Alabama to visit her aging and declining father and finds herself at great odds with two forces:  Hank's undying love and Maycomb's staunch resistance to a rapidly-changing society in which blacks are seeking more rights and the locals are fiercely opposing those changes!  I found myself growing more and more frustrated as I turned the pages because the story seemed to get bogged down in minor details along the way -- often going off on tangents about various characters whom we had little time to get to know or care about -- and often launching us back into the time of Scout's childhood (the Mockingbird days) with little details about her adventures with Jem and Dill, which seemed to serve no greater purpose other than the "telling of stories."  Perhaps we were supposed to feel a bit of nostalgia with Scout, but I felt these "throw backs" did little to advance the story.  At one point, I put the book down, read another book I had gotten from my local library, and then I picked up Go Set a Watchman again to see if I could finish it.  I finally forced myself to finish, although I was no happier at the end than I was during the entire reading. Jean Louise learns that Atticus isn't quite the "saint" she'd made him out to be - I got that.  She also learns that society is a tangled, complicated web of standards, emotions, norms and ideals - I got that, too; and she learns that Hank probably isn't the love of her life.  But I felt like something was missing!  I felt as though the story had been "TOLD" to me in erratic, disjointed pieces, rather than me immersing myself completely in their world and passionately caring about the characters and their struggles.  Although I am an English teacher and a writer, I cannot even adequately describe what was so "off" about this book, but at the end, my balloon, which had been so full of anticipatory air, was completely flat!
Going into this novel I didn't expect it to be as great as To Kill A Mockingbird. I knew that after it being so long since it was published that this one probably wouldn't be nearly as good. That being said, I did enjoy this novel. It was interesting to see how Scout turned out in her young adult life. I was sad to find out what happened to Jem. It would have been nice to have him in this book to see what he had turned out like as well. But the book did hit on some serious issues like To Kill A Mockingbird, but it didn't show up in the book until probably about 60% of the way through the book. The rest was Scout reflecting on her childhood and we learned a few things that were not in the first book.<br/>But like I said, I did enjoy this book. It was a nice read. But it felt more like a very long epilogue than a sequel. I was expecting more about the racial difficulties that were happening at the time since Scout is older and able to understand things more and is more involved. But it was almost too similar to the first book when Scout was a child. But even in the first book there was more about the case her father was on than about the racial up-comings in this book. It just seemed kind of thrown in at the end after Scout's reminiscing to herself most of the book. I don't know, I guess on further looking at it I'm kind of torn about this book. Probably because To Kill A Mockingbird was so perfectly written, and in a child's perspective none-the-less, I probably had more expectations for this book than I thought. But I did really enjoy it regardless; I was just expecting more I guess.<br/>I would recommend this book if you liked To Kill A Mockingbird, just don't have your hopes too high. But I would say it is good to read this to continue the life of Scout and her discovering herself even in her 20's, because honestly we never really stop discovering ourselves.
I was on the fence about reading this novel since To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book of all time; once an author has written the perfect book, how can they possibly top that?<br/><br/>So while I found this book a good enough read, no way would I put it in the same category as Mockingbird.<br/><br/>I think this book suffers from lack of editing. With Mockingbird, Harper Lee spent several years rewriting the story with helpful suggestions from editor Tay Hohoff, with the publishing firm J.B. Lippincott. As the saying goes: There is no writing, only rewriting, and with Mockingbird, that paid off. She took Lee's natural brilliance and polished it like a diamond and the book ended up being a jewel, a national treasure. If she worked with Ms. Lee on Watchman before the manuscript was tucked away for all these years, I don't see it. Good? Yes. Great? No.<br/><br/>Not that Watchman isn't an interesting, intelligent read. There are familiar characters and touches of Harper Lee's prickly humor throughout. But it didn't grab me and pull me in the way Mockingbird did, and still does (I reread it every year).<br/><br/>And I'm still upset she killed off Jem! And while Dill is mentioned, in memory, having him there as part of the action would have been very welcome.<br/><br/>Some years ago, knowing Harper Lee was getting on in years and not wanting to miss an opportunity to tell her how much I loved Mockingbird and how it had affected my life, I sent her a brief letter. To my surprise, she responded with a few words on a postcard that she mailed from New York, where she was still living part of the year. Such a thrill for me; it is a treasured possession.<br/><br/>It is my belief that if her sister Alice - a lawyer who watched over her sister's affairs - were still alive, Go Set a Watchman would not have been published until after Harper Lee's death.<br/><br/>My humble opinion only.
Go Set a Watchman is Harper Lee’s long awaited follow up to her classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. The original story took place in the 1930’s in the deep South and portrays a young white lawyer, Atticus Finch, acting idealistically and his two admiring children, Jean Louise and Jem. The sequel is set in the 1950’s and centers on Jean Louise who is now grown up and living in New York City. She returns to her hometown of Malcomb, Alabama to visit her now 72-year old father and Henry Clinton, Atticus’ partner and a man she is in love with and may marry.  But Jean Louise discovers that her father and Clinton are accommodating racists and segregationists and is horrified. She confronts them and her uncle, Dr. John Hale Finch and by the end of the book comes to some understanding of them as human beings living in and adapting to a particular environment. The title refers to a Watchman as your conscience and thus suggests the notion of examining your conscience in relation to others.<br/><br/>One way to view this novel, in my opinion, is that Ms. Lee is commenting on the changes in attitudes and moral climate that occurred in the Deep South between the 1930’s and the 1950’s. In the earlier period African-Americans were seen as non-threating, inferior and incapable of acting responsibly. Finch takes on the case of a black man because he believes the man deserves to be treated fairly before the law. But by the 1950’s with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, whites in the South felt threatened by blacks and take a harder stance against them. Atticus and Henry join a citizen’s council composed of people who express such bigotry without protesting and it is this action that Jean Louise cannot accept. She represents Northern sensibilities and thus sees their action as wrong. She feels betrayed by her father. Dr. Finch, however, tells her that she is also a bigot because she refuses to try to understand the actions of the locals. She viewed her father as a god, he says, when in fact he is just human.  Those of us who lived in the North and grew up in that era remember such events as police dogs threating black children as they attempted to go to all-white schools and George Wallace saying, “Segregation, now and Segregation forever,” and having the same sense of horror as Jean Louise.<br/><br/>I rate the book at three stars because I think it presents a rather superficial view of the issues. At the same time it does provide some insights into the attitudes of people in the 1950’s that can help to explain the real world events of that time.
I think that this book suffered from a surfeit of bad press. It was hailed as a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird and then a prequel to the same. It was called a finished manuscript, a true treasure. Who didn't want another book from Harper Lee? Setting aside the circumstances of its discovery and release, which I have definite opinions on, a few matters do need to be made clear.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is not a finished book.<br/><br/>It was a manuscript that was rejected from the publisher. This was the original book that she intended to write, but the publisher felt, with reason, that the sections that focused upon her childhood were far stronger than this finished product. To Kill a Mockingbird came from the rejection, and aren't we all quite lucky it did?<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is not a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird<br/><br/>It's really an entirely different book. Some characters make appearances between the two books, yes, and this book does follow a grown up Scout. It focuses a fair bit on Atticus as well, but they aren't exactly the same characters. Things have changed, and if you read the two back to back I've a feeling you're going to be deeply disappointed.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman focuses on very different themes than To Kill a Mockingbird. It's a study in what it means to idolize your parents and realize they're human. It's a study in what it means to be a good person, and how to stand up for your values when they're compromised. While it can be argued that To Kill a Mockingbird holds similar values in high esteem, and it does, Go Set a Watchman views them in a far more mature light. Which, again, is why I think people struggled with it.<br/><br/>There's a truly extraordinary book lurking between the lines in Go Set a Watchman. There are hints of genius in it, flickers of sharp insight, and beautiful turns of phrase. There's also a good deal of excess as she creates the county of Maycomb, grooms the characters, and decides just what she's going to do. You can see the portions where she was truly writing with the flow, and the places where she was wobbling to get her footing. You can see what she focused and polished, and what she struggled with. It's an interesting case of truly seeing an author develop their craft, and in my opinion, is something invaluable for an aspiring writer to read and compare with her later book.<br/><br/>Regardless of one's feelings of what happens in this book, I think we all can agree that Harper Lee is an American treasure and a truly wonderful writer. I hope that people don't judge her too harshly by this unfinished product, but rather remember her for the glory that is To Kill a Mockingbird and the wonderful character of Atticus Finch and Scout - may they both linger strongly in all of our memories.
Jean Louise Finch, known as Scout in her younger days, is 26 years old now, and is coming back to Maycomb County from New York to spend vacation time with her fiancé Henry Clinton, and her beloved father Atticus.  But Jean Louise finds out something shocking about her father and her husband to be that makes her re-evaluate her feelings for the idyllic town she grew up in, and her upbringing.  Does she ignore what she’s found out and go ahead with her wedding, or does she leave Henry and her father in the rear-view mirror?<br/><br/>Let me say that I loved To Kill A Mockingbird, anyone whose read my review of that book can see how much I loved that book.  Go Set A Watchman is not To Kill A Mockingbird.  I did not like Go Set A Watchman.  The characters in Go Set a Watchman are paper thin.  The new character, Henry Clinton, is hardly an indelible character. The readers immediately know he’s Jean Louise’s fiancé, and readers find out other facts about him, but it’s not a full characterization of the person, for sure.  To Kill A Mockingbird had so much depth to it, something that is sorely lacking in this book. The iconic Atticus, the eloquent lawyer is rendered mostly mute, until the second to the last chapter, and that’s a disservice to one of the most iconic characters in literature. Characters evolve, they get older, I’m not sad or angry about Atticus, I wanted to hear more from him in this book to know more about his evolution, but he is largely silent. Other iconic characters from Mockingbird are barely mentioned or not<br/>mentioned at all.  Jean Louise is a flawed character, especially to enter into the conflict that she enters into, but that makes her more human in a way.  I will give Lee a Lot of credit for discussing race in a realistic way, rather than the idealistic way it was discussed in Mockingbird, but that credit is revoked for the way Lee ended the book, the ending doesn’t match the tone of the entire book, and so, if some part of this book was ghostwritten, I would say that the ending seemed like it was ghostwritten, because it felt added on and wholly unnecessary.<br/><br/>I know Harper Lee went to New York for a time, so there are definitely autobiographical elements in this book, but I don’t know how much is autobiographical and how much is fictionalized.  Every author starts with a story they know and fictionalizes parts of it, but maybe it’s too autobiographical, and maybe that’s why she never wanted it published. It is a difficult book to read for sure, and not worth it for the ending that is delivered to the readers.<br/><br/>For more timely reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com
Despite the more literary writing style (it was written in the 1950s), I really enjoyed this book. It's the story of Jean Louise Finch, a 26-year old girl from Maycomb, Alabama, who has been living in New York City for many years. She comes home on her annual visit and finds the town much changed in her absence. Her father is aging. Her aunt has moved in to take care of him since, at 72 years old, he suffers from arthritis. The town has changed too. I found these elements of the story to be universal. Who hasn't dealt with moving away from home and coming back after a time to find things very different than her memory? Aren't we all trying to cope with our parents getting older?<br/><br/>Jean Louise is also trying to decide whether to marry her oldest friend, Henry. Her father took him under his wing and trained him in law after her brother died unexpectedly. Jean Louise knows she loves him, but she's not sure she should marry him. And she's not sure she can live in Maycomb again. I enjoyed this plot as well. It's another common internal debate of young adulthood. And the banter between Jean Louise and Hank was amusing.<br/><br/>Later in the novel Harper Lee gets to the part everyone is commenting on. Jean Louise discovers that her father in a racist (in her mind). I found it to be a very enlightening commentary of the South in the time of the Supreme Court Brown vs. the Board of Education ruling. Jean Louise, Atticus, and Henry had reactions that I would not have predicted. Ultimately, it's a young girl dealing with her father not living up to this god-like man she's imagined all her life. Again, it's something many children struggle with as their beliefs progress with those of the younger generation, and their parents remain in the past.<br/><br/>The writing wasn't perfect. There were quite a few random flashbacks and tangents this didn't necessarily enhance the story. And the climax of the story was a little confusing and took a long time to resolve. But knowing that this book was unedited, I tried to look past all of that. And what I found was a highly reliable story with interesting characters and some enjoyable political commentary.<br/><br/>I'm glad I read this book before reading To Kill a Mockingbird. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>http://momsradius.blogspot.com/2015/08/book-review-go-set-watchman.html
If I could have given this book ten stars I would have done so.  After browsing through the reviews I am wondering if I am the only person who really READ the book.  It is not a sequel to TKAM - TKAM is a "prequel" to and a necessary "explanation" to this book.  These two books are an integral pair (if that isn't an oxymoron) and "Watchman" is the mature big-dog of the two.  TKAM, by itself, is a warm and fuzzy story relieved by the warmth and the innocence of some of its cast - notably Scout herself, though Harper Lee also takes advantage of the innocence and ignorance of her readers, by the cast-iron heroism of Atticus, and by the anguish of its inhumanity to the "others" who live in Maycomb County.  "Watchman" without the "explanation" of TKAM would have been an unpublishable puzzle.<br/>Is Atticus a segregationist?  No, of course he isn't.  He is smart enough to understand the ponderous weight of two centuries of wrongheadedness and wise enough to see - as he explains to his daughter - that the only hope of countering this blind evil without also destroying what is gentle and good in his culture, is to steer the segregationist organization from the inside.  Who would have "thrown the baby out with the bathwater?"  Harper Lee answers this question with her methodical picture of the delightful, well-meaning but recklessly impulsive Jean Louise who represents the dangers of starting a good fight without accurately foreseeing how it will end.  And with the help of Atticus and his brother she finally understands that you've got to understand all the consequences before you can plan your strategy for a campaign.<br/>To Kill a Mockingbird is a very good book - "Watchman" is a great book.  Before I read the second book I was a little surprised by the honors which have been awarded to Harper Lee; now I understand.
GO SET A WATCHMAN<br/>Harper Lee<br/>Published by Harper –Collins Publishers 2015<br/><br/>  IMPRESSIONS ON THIS NOVEL<br/>Before I read this book I took the opportunity to re-read TO KILL A MOCKINBIRD,(Mockingbird) written by Ms Lee .  “Mockingbird” is one of the best written novels of the 20th Century because of the character development and vividness of the environment of t he South post World War II.  Ms. Lee captured the culture and issues as she wove a story that focused on three or four main characters.  The reader of “Mockingbird” is drawn into the lives and times of the characters like no other novel of its time.<br/>GO SET A WATCHMAN (Watchman) was not written by the same author.  The character development was not close to “Mockingbird”, it was shallow and difficult to follow in some aspects. Granted you are reading the story of an adult “Scout” but it did not ring true.  Characters were introduced in the beginning of the story that were not either mentioned or developed in “Mockingbird”.  Two that come to mind are the boyfriend and uncle.  I really did not understand why the boyfriend even needed to be in the story.  The uncle was an odd person and really needed to be developed more in the first book to play his role in this novel.  It was nice to see Aunt Alexandra remain the same, a true reflection of the “old south”.<br/>Whining seemed to be the basis of the story teller which was disappointing. Many of the reflections of the characters sounded like what I am reading and hearing on the political front today.  This book was supposed to be set in the 1950’s, it didn’t ring true to me I grew up in the 50’s and went into the Army in Alabama in 1963 and the culture was like it was in the 20’s in relation to race.  This read more advanced than the early 60’s.<br/> They said he was reasonable in every respect until someone mentioned the president’s name,<br/> Then his face would become distorted , he would assume a whooping crane attitude and hold it<br/> For eight hours or more, nothing or nobody could make him lower his leg until he forgot about<br/> that man.  (since I read this on my kindle don’t have exact page- first chapter relation to cousin<br/> Joshua).<br/>As for the character of Atticus it was not well written, but  I did not get the sense of a racist as much as a man who was realistic about the community  in which he was living and pragmatic in the way he dealt with the world around him.  He realized that times were changing and that it would be slow and painful for the country not just his home town.  I don’t think the character was as believable as in “Mockingbird”.  Sad to say but this was not a good book.
Don't read this book before reading Mockingbird. I'm giving it 3 stars as a "work in progress."  The thing to keep in mind at all times is that it was written FIRST. Lee was still honing thoughts and shaping characters. Approaching it this way makes it easier. Otherwise it may be a big disappointment and you will have to force your way through it. Thank God this book wasn't published until now. Don't know Lee's condition but if  she was able she should have insisted on polishing and (yes) fixing it.<br/><br/>Lee's Mockingbird Scout is awesome and the young Scout in this book is wonderful too. When the memories come the words dance. I now understand why Lee's agent urged her to tell the Mockingbird story from Scout's 10-year-old view.  When Lee gets to grown-up Scout there's a huge  disconnect. The 26-year-old Scout still has a little tomboy in her but her soul is lacking. There's pages and pages of silly, Hollywood-ingenue bluster but that isn't the Scout we need. It reads as though Lee was still forming the grown-up Scout and wasn't quite sure what to do with her.<br/><br/>The other characters seem OK except for three glaring disappointments: A "racist" Atticus, a "racist" Henry (Hank) Clinton; and Uncle Jack's behavior. We read Mockingbird, so we know...........Atticus and Hank would never ever be racists, NO WAY, NOT HAPPENING. Atticus raised Hank to the law, he is like a son. As for Uncle Jack -- no kindly uncle, educated "Victorian gentleman" would ever do what Lee has him doing to Scout. The scene was so shocking it just didn't work. I won't spoil it here............ I will only say the old Scout would have decked him. Grown-up Scout just takes it and chats with him. WHAT??? (Am I missing pages or something?)<br/><br/>Wrapping up -- Italics or indents should have been used when grown-up Scout is thinking during present day conversations. Sometimes those paragraphs were hard to navigate.
After reading Harper Lee's "Go Set a Watchman" I'm not outraged or disappointed or any of the other things that the media hype was about because  Atticus Finch had become "a racist."  Most books I take at face value when I read them and that's what I did with this one.  If this had really been written as a sequel to "Mockingbird" I would have an issue with it and advertising it as a "new Harper Lee novel" gave the impression that it was a novel that came after our unforgettable favorite.  However, since it is what the critics and publisher are saying is the first draft of "To Kill a Mockingbird" it makes it sound like this was the original "Mockingbird" with a few edits here and there.  To me, it's a book that Lee wrote with the intention of making Atticus  the way she created him, and it wasn't going to be published until she made some changes.  Granted, those changes made for a much better book, but "Watchman" on its own isn't bad, either.<br/><br/>Jean Louise (Scout) has returned home for a visit since her father is having some health problems.  Atticus Finch isn't the man that Jean Louise  remembered him as when she was a child and  when he was like a god to her and could do no wrong.  Scout, Jem  and Atticus were all so close that they were never separated from each other until Jem died at an early age and Jean Louise set out on her own for New York and left Maycomb, Alabama far behind.  When she comes back home she learns that her father is attending meetings of the Citizens Council that is in favor of segregation.  Once Jean Louise finds out about this, her father becomes a fallen idol. Atticus hasn't said anything about it but has been the same loving father to Jean Louise that he has always been.  His new  law practice partner becomes a romantic interest for Jean Louise, and she learns indirectly of her father's sympathies.<br/><br/>It didn't shock me or surprise me that Atticus wasn't the man he seemed to be in "Mockingbird."  He is 72-years-old now and it is in the mid-1950s in small town Alabama.  His racism in this book manifests itself as he explains to Jean Louise as being akin to carloads of uneducated people going into schools that would be slowed down by them, thereby needing their own schools.  I think that, unfortunately, what we see in Atticus is the evolution of his life as it moves along through the years and the times, and although this looks like something entirely new to his daughter, it really isn't because somewhere within Atticus it's the way he has always been. Sometimes aging softens people and sometimes it hardens them.<br/><br/>There is a good bit of humor in the book that comes from most of the characters, and Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack are still themselves.<br/><br/>I like the book enough to give it four stars but I do wonder if this book will knock Harper Lee off her own pedestal just a bit.
With so many reviews already of Harper Lee's new-old book, "Go Set a Watchman", it would seem that there is no need for one more.  Yet most of the reviews so far--including early previews that came out months ago when we placed a pre-publication order--miss some essential factors in this recently-published novel and some essential points of comparison with her greater story, "To Kill a Mockingbird".  The latter is deservedly renown and hopefully will continue to be read, but there are some distinct reasons for reading the former, particularly in our old-new struggles with racism.<br/><br/>If one is looking for "Mockingbird" quality of writing in "Watchman" one simply is going to be disappointed.  The story is disjointed and there are some internal contradictions in "Watchman".  For a simple one, late in the book Jean Louise speaks of being born in the house she now is visiting on her return home to Maycomb, Alabama from her current residence in New York, yet earlier we had learned that her old house had been torn down and now is an ice cream parlor.  The unfolding story makes too many jumps without needed clarification and there are twists that simply are too abrupt and therefore essentially unbelievable.  An example here:  it is incredible that Jean Louise, a precocious child in "Mockingbird", could just be perceiving for the first time in "Watchman" at age twenty-six the pervasive racism of a community in which she had grown up, and therefore it is incredible that her reactions could be so dramatic and full of disgust.  In fact the whole end of the story, including especially her sudden rejection of and then return to the love of family and community after she is assaulted by her beloved Uncle Jack, is not compelling because it simply could not happen--the abrupt and literally jerking changes defy the more-gradual psycho-social development of human emotions and relationships.  It has been suggested that the book never moved beyond manuscript status, and certainly it has been published now without much-needed editing and probably a massive rewriting to fill out the skeleton of a story.<br/><br/>That said, it has some definite strengths.  Harper Lee seems at her best when recalling Scout's childhood in Maycomb, and there are some brilliant chapters in "Watchman" that are flashbacks to that childhood.  But the apparent purpose of the writing in the first place seems to be quite different from "Mockingbird".  Harper Lee apparently set out, in writing "Watchman" during the turbulent years of 1954-55, to describe the aftermath of the Supreme Court's desegregation decisions of 1954 on the South, a description which was then and usually still is lost on smug critics in the North and elsewhere.  "Watchman" contains a highly-nuanced description of the nature of race relations and the shock of an external authority's invalidation of an established way of life.  The incredulity of Jean Louise at just discovering the racism of her beloved father and others in her childhood community, looked at in a different light, serves the purpose is illuminating the complexity of social relations and institutions that cannot simply be erased by fiat.  And this narrative of illumination continues to be important because it describes the pervasive racism of our culture, continuing well beyond the South today as it existed over half a century ago.  We probably cannot eliminate our racism until we come to a realization of how it affects and infects our social and economic structures far beyond simple race relations, and "Watchman" served and serves as a needed lens and mirror to help us navigate the true complexities of who we are.  Harper Lee seems to have set out to help us see ourselves more clearly.  The story as it stands does not work very well, which is unfortunate to what seems to have been her main purpose--unfortunate partly because we still must learn the lesson she set out to teach.<br/><br/>"Mockingbird", written several years later, probably did not so much have the purpose of resurrecting the beloved figure and icon, Atticus Finch, nor of being simply a children's story (Flannery O'Connor's verdict), as it did of examining the intricacies of life where racism persists amidst an equally-prevalent human respect and decency.  "Mockingbird" shows that human nobility can exist even in the midst of darker aspects of ourselves and our culture.<br/><br/>Perhaps I give Harper Lee too much credit.  But perhaps, just as she wrote a masterpiece in "Mockingbird", she has given us in "Watchman", and even more in the comparison of the two books, a still-needed and unusually nuanced look at ourselves.
I had very high hopes for this book. Perhaps that’s in part why I am so terribly disappointed. I must credit Harper Lee’s editors: it was a wise decision to insist that she rewrite this novel, and continue revising it, until it turned into the magnificent To Kill A Mockingbird that we all know and love. There are only perhaps two or three parts of this book that I found actually enjoyable; the rest I grudgingly endured. It had its good points: her vocabulary is strong, and some of the writing is eloquent. Unfortunately, much of the writing in this book is nebulous. There is a great deal of philosophizing, which I found tiresome. Also, most apparent in the beginning of the book, Lee chooses to “tell" the reader about her characters, rather than “show," as she did in Mockingbird. “Showing" rather than “telling" is a much stronger writing technique. I found the “telling" juvenile, prosaic, and not engaging at all. Fortunately that ceased after the beginning of the book. If I weren’t so determined to read this book for its historical value, having been published some sixty years after it was written, I would’ve dropped it after the slow, poorly told beginning. So I pushed through, and upon completing it, I found myself with an empty, dissatisfied feeling. I’m almost sorry this book was published. I just re-read To Kill A Mockingbird very recently, in anticipation of this book, thus deepening the stark contrast between the brilliance and delightfulness of Mockingbird and this disappointing book. I do recommend reading it just for the sake of historical background, because it is interesting to see where one of the best, most revered pieces of American Literature got its start. I’m giving this three stars, which I feel is a bit generous, but I’ll allot extra credit for the admirable vocabulary.<br/><br/>Here is a video review/ discussion of the book that I feel hits the nail on the head. https://youtu.be/vPNk-0dv5_Y
As most of us know by now, Harper Lee sent the manuscript of Watchman to a publisher in the 1950s, when the Civil Rights Movement was in action. That submission been described as a rambling, incoherent work, and she was told, in effect, that she was a good writer but this book didn't make the grade. The editor went on to suggest the work that became To Kill a Mockingbird. That book is indeed a classic, and a moving and beautiful one.<br/><br/>Watchman, however, is not the bad book it was painted: It is a very good book, as published (and it is said to be without drastic editing). If I were still teaching American Literature, I would use it in my classes. It has clear characters who develop and change, scenes that are well-turned and fascinating, a story line that gives a moving portrait of its time and place. No, it is not the electrifying book that Mockingbird is. Few books are. But Watchman failed to see the light of day not because it was bad, but because in the mid-1950s, during the Civil Rights Movement, the truth was deemed unpublishable.<br/><br/>A week or so ago, the NY Times reviewer expressed surprise and doubt at the distress the Movement causes to the good white folks in Watchman. But that distress was very real – it led to a kind of blind and cruel hysteria in Southern towns like Maycomb. I know. I grew up in one. That the world doesn't know it is probably because so few books portrayed it properly.<br/><br/>In Watchman, Jean Louise Finch, 26, comes home from New York for a family visit. (You don't have to know Mockingbird to “get” Watchman.) She inadvertently discovers that her father and her lover are embroiled, along with the town's red-neck brutes, in the struggle against the Civil Rights Movement, which was seeking Simple Justice, as the title of Richard Kluger's excellent history of the era expresses it.<br/><br/>The crux is this: everyone in Maycomb, including Jean Louise's fair and kind family (no red-necks here), buys into the picture the panicking racists are painting of the events. In this view, the happy "Nigras" have been tricked by “outside agitators” into rebelling against their “place.” These happy Nigras are, as even the narrator agrees, "backward" and incapable of governing themselves, let alone the "civilized" whites. They are "not ready." “You understand what 'backward' means?' Atticus asks Jean Louise.<br/><br/>Well, it means that there were more blacks than whites in Maycomb and if the rebellion succeeded (pushed by the evil NAACP), blacks - ignorant and wayward - would take over at the next election and become mayor, sheriff, coroner, and so on. There will be, Atticus implies, chaos.<br/><br/>I grew up in the South in this era, and that is exactly what I heard. What is missing, in this book as in life as it was then, is the voice of reason to point out that this "storyline" is a lie. There is a difference between being at a disadvantage and being backward. Many of the black citizens in our towns were educated, courteous, reasonable, intelligent. Many ran businesses, and there were professionals - teachers, doctors, preachers, people of "substance." Whites could ignore them because whites usually did not use their services. In the hinterlands, however, both blacks and whites were lacking in education, opportunity, income. “Backward” was not the result of skin color, but of circumstances.<br/><br/>I wish that in this book, and in the town where I grew up, someone had made this point. But no one did. In the book, Dr. Finch, Jean Louise's uncle, may have hinted at it, but oh so obliquely. ("Maycomb needs you. . .you'll find many others who agree with you.") The truth is that whites were blinded by fear. Fear of change, fear of loss. And that fear is a powerful and dangerous thing - if the have-nots get something, the haves must have lost it. One commenter on the NY Times review said that if he could make a movie of this good book, he would want to fill in the other half of the story - the NAACP story, and so tell a fully rounded tale. I hope he does. It would be a rich, hard work. It would surely be a story that could have been life changing had it been told as it was happening.<br/><br/>What Watchman does have is a marvelous portrait of a family in the throes of a changing culture. The workings of, yes, a good family. The disagreements, the compromises, the love, the effort at understanding, the fear. The scenes between Jean Louise and her father and her uncle are based on deep love and connection. If the American South ever redeems itself, it will on the shoulders of such people who possessed a powerful conscience.<br/><br/>What Watchman also has is the plight of women in Maycomb, and that too is very real and frightening.  Jean Louise herself, with Atticus's urging, has gone to New York to become the valuable, engaged person she is capable of being. The women in Maycomb, black and white alike down to the last one, are crippled by the restrictions once endemic in this country and culture, but at that time powerful largely in the South. Not one female member of my graduating class in a rural Virginia high school became a professional unless she left the South. Most did not leave.<br/><br/>Watchman is - in a sad irony for Harper Lee - a good book. Sad for her because the official response to the manuscript was, I suspect, why after Mockingbird, she never wrote again. Another Southern writer of that era wrote a strange book about the Civil Rights Movement – one that imagined a concentration camp on the Virginia-North Carolina border for people "taken in" by The Civil Rights Movement. The story centered around two people, the white narrator who tries to help an angry young black man struggle against a fascist tide. The book was turned down by a NY editor, who asked the writer for a different book -  a novel about a friendship between a white child and a black child. The writer was appalled that a fire-breathing portrait of the South in the throes of lies and evil could be reduced to a pretend friendship between children who could not have been friends. Unable to go to school together or, after the age of about 11, even to play together, how would they have known each other? That writer refused, and went on quietly writing. Lee, on the other hand, agreed to write the great book her editor saw in her novel. And we are the richer for it. But she never wrote another.<br/><br/>After reading Watchman, I think you'll find that a tragedy.
I purposely avoided reading any interviews, news reports, or book reviews before reading Lee's second novel, Go Set a Watchman (I wanted my impressions to be untainted by others' disappointment or fandom) ... so some of what I may say here may be based on conjecture. Much of what struck me as vivid and interesting in GSAW (e.g., Scout's embarrassment at the siblings' ball and the legal advice Atticus offers her rescuers) felt like the kinds of incidents writers write about as they try to realize characters in their minds but later discard as unnecessary because the points they convey are better realized in incidents more integral to the main story line. The intimate interactions between Jean Louise (Scout) and the African American domestic who raised her, Calpurnia, also felt authentic and emotionally well-expressed, but unfortunately seemed nonessential. Gripping though they may be, these bits are the "darlings" editors and writing teachers are always encouraging writers to kill. As background material to TKAM, I felt these passages were worth reading and I'm sure they will color my next reading of Lee's earlier work.<br/>On the other hand, the main story line/conflict of GSAW (Scout's soul-crushing disappointment in her father, family, and community as they make unfathomable--to Scout--accommodations to segregationist ideology) is never really successfully argued. As a northerner, I was intrigued by Lee's suggestion that there was a time in the South (post-slavery and pre-integration) when southern whites and southern blacks trusted one another, or at least a time when some white southerners genuinely believed themselves to be color blind (Lee's term). Unfortunately, Lee puts the provocative suggestion out there but does nothing with it. Consequently, Scout's dilemma has no larger social dimension and remains a matter of a young woman's personal disappointment in her childhood idol (father).<br/>Although Go Set a Watchman will never be a worthy partner to To Kill A Mockingbird (it serves the greater work much in the manner that William Faulkner's The Town supported and augmented The Hamlet and The Mansion in the Snopes trilogy), it contains numerous passages of lovely writing and much that will challenge readers to reassess the two novels' common characters. (Footnote: I like the effort HarperCollins made to emulate the design and typography of the earlier book.
The story is much more than what it seems on the surface. While it does focus on post-WWII South and the social and racial problems our entire country was facing, it goes beyond that to reveal family, personal growth and wisdom in an unexpected way
I was rather disappointed in this book. I guess coming from reading and watching "To Kill a Mockingbird," I was expecting something big to happen. There were no big twists to the story, nothing suspenseful, and only a little interesting.
Don't waste your money on this book.  It is poorly written and is an apparent attempt to draw on her other book.  I was sorely disappointed. The protagonist is a whiney, selfish girl who makes no point at all.  I didn't even like Atticus this time around!
I checked this book out from my local library.<br/><br/>If one has not read "To Kill a Mockingbird" then one will be less than impressed with the character development in this novel and one might also think think, "well its not bad novel". If one has read Mockingbird one might think, " what has been done to my beloved characters" and "Wow that's the power of a editing and a rewrite."<br/><br/>Watchmen gives us our cast of characters from Mockingbird (except the new character of Henry), and has jolted us about 10 years in the future. Our beloved Scout ( Jean Louise) is a muddle brained New York living girl, returned to her southern home for a visit. If my first impression scout was the first few chapters of the book, I might have thought of this as a badly written YA book. The complexities of young love or not love.<br/><br/>The portions of the book that stand out are of course her flashbacks to childhood, and this of course is what made Mockingbird such a fantastic novel. I think this novel does portray rural southern race relations in a true light. I am not troubled by Atticus' seeming moral switch. I believe it was possible for a man like him, versed in the law, to view race relations in a way that, to us modern readers is startling. I think this is where many readers are having issue. They too hold up Atticus in the glow of childhood (an earlier time) and can't reconcile it with the actual man. Now I don't believe the author was really trying to make this point. I think this point has only come about to us readers due to the release of this second novel. It is like we too are the child Scout now a grown up Jean Louise and seeing the world through adult eyes.
The story was disjointed and lacked cohesiveness. Although there were some interesting characters and moments in the book they were not connected. I would not recommend this book which is sad because To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my favourites.
This was a very disappointing read. Perhaps it should have been published upon completion instead of hiding it away for several decades. It was more of a rant than an interesting read. Very disappointed that I had recommended it to the Book Club.
This was just an excellent read.  It is unfortunate that Harper Lee did not write more, but the two books she has left us are memorable with extraordinary character development and superb use of language.  Aspiring writers should read Harper Lee.
Maybe the most applicable adjective for this book is "uneven."<br/><br/>I'm not going to approach the "Atticus Question." Decoding the motives of fictional characters isn't particularly interesting or fruitful. I will  say that Atticus' new critics seem to miss several points of both books.<br/><br/>Unless you haven't heard, it's not a sequel to "Mockingbird." Before she  wrote "Mockingbird," Lee was working on a rough draft of "Watchman."  > Eventually, she took part of a backstory from "Watchman" and developed it into "Mockingbird."<br/><br/>nIn "Watchman," "Scout" (now "Jean Louise") character is 26 years old, and home to visit Maycomb from her home in New York City. She's engaged to Henry, a childhood friend who is now an attorney in practice with Atticus.<br/><br/>Interesting? Sure. Lots of potential. But maybe due to her inexperience as  a writer (and it was, after all, a first draft), Lee indulges in a lot of amateur devices. There are many long, complex backstories, some of which don't add very much to "Watchman's" events or the reader's understanding of them. There are excruciatingly detailed descriptions of the inconsequential.<br/><br/>Perhaps most distracting is that it's told in the third person, but without a central, narrating character. The point of view occasionally shifts from Jean Louise to an omniscient narrator. You never know when you'll be looking out of someone else's eyes.<br/><br/>But even with these flaws, there are several stretches in which Lee's real gift dazzles. She has the ability to let the reader forget s/he's a reader, that what's happening isn't a physical reality.  In those parts of "Watchman" (told in the third person through Jean Louise), you will be wholly swept away<br/>to Maycomb; you will see hear, smell, taste the world Lee describes, and you will remember that world forever, and physically.<br/><br/>That was the genius of her invisible craft in "Mockingbird": many of us remember what Scout described as if it were our own memory. The images Lee created were so vivid we forgot they were images.<br/><br/>The weak points and lapses of technique in "Watchman" unfortunately overbalance its strengths. Still, I'm glad I read it and got to see a master at her craft.
This is not To Kill a Mockingbird; Go Set a Watchman is its own story.  Of course, you'll see some of the same characters, twenty years older.  Jean Louise Finch, also known as Scout, is 26 years old, living in New York City, and returning to Maycomb, Alabama, the place of her birth, for her annual summer visit.  Atticus Finch, now in his 70s, is stricken with arthritis and literally can't as good a grip on things.  Aunt Alexandra (featured in the novel TKaM but not the movie) has moved in to help her brother Atticus.  Dr. Jack Finch, their brother, an eccentric, lives nearby.  A new character, Henry "Hank" Clinton, a childhood friend of Scout and her brother Jem, has worked himself up from the wrong side of the tracks to become Atticus' junior partner in the law practice.  Hank wants Jean Louise to stay home and marry him.<br/><br/>Jean Louise bristles under such Maycomb practices as the weekly church service, the women's afternoon Coffees, and the overall strict social strata and racial snubs.  She revels in old locations that bring back old memories of childhood play with Jem and visiting friend Dill, as well as previously unrevealed episodes and misadventures of a growing schoolgirl, making and losing friends, going to her first dance.  However, when Jean Louise follows Atticus and Hank to a special Sunday afternoon meeting, she gets a shock to her system, and feels her roots torn and her foundations falling apart.  Can she trust anyone anymore?  Can she ever live in Maycomb again and make peace with what she saw and heard?<br/><br/>The style is different: Go Set a Watchman relies on third-person narrative rather than Mockingbird's first.  Watchman is a quicker read, without all the dense descriptions in Mockingbird; sometimes I felt as if I were reading a play or even a YA short story.  The stakes in Watchman are largely psychological, as opposed to the life-and-death situations in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman explores the issues of the 1950s, such as civil rights versus states' rights, and the emergence of the single career woman who might consider marriage an option rather than a necessity.  It also deals with issues of courage, maturity, and self-reliance.<br/><br/>I'm still digesting the book after I've read it, so I'm not sure if I'll ultimately like Watchman as much as Mockingbird: probably not.  However, Watchman is a good read by an excellent author who has brought her characters to a new stage of growth.  It's definitely worth reading.<br/><br/>Addendum: I forgot to mention that this book is hilarious in parts!  The "YA story" I mentioned earlier, about Jean Louise's first dance and its aftermath, should be excerpted and put into a short story anthology.
It's inevitable that fans of [book:To Kill a Mockingbird|2657] will be disappointed (and possible devastated) by its newly released predecessor, [book:Go Set a Watchman|24817626].  Like the character, Scout, many lovers of Harper Lee's Mockingbird set Scout's father, Atticus Finch upon a mythological pedestal from which he single-handedly fought racism in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930s.  Go Set a Watchman takes place two decades later as the town of Maycomb (and the United States as a whole) is embroiled in the struggles of the civil rights movement.  I can't say I enjoyed reading this book, since my illusions of Atticus Finch's nobility were painfully shattered along with Scout's, but I have to admire the way Lee personified the struggle of our nation's conscience in the character of Jean Louise Finch.  Jean Louise is forced to take a hard look at everything and everyone she has loved through eyes altered forever by her experiences in New York.  Nothing much happens in this book; rather, it is a series of conversations made difficult to read for modern readers sensitive to today's politically correct language and rhetoric.  If we, like Scout, are willing to face honestly the issues of race which, in light of recent events in Ferguson, Missouri and other U.S. cities reaching the boiling point, have merely been simmering beneath the surface, perhaps we can begin to have meaningful conversations that will lead to understanding and move us forward together.  Reading this book is like taking medicine--distasteful, yet beneficial.  To Kill a Mockingbird is much more tightly constructed and dramatic, with characters who are better fleshed out.  If readers take up the challenge to read Watchman, they will not be treated to a nostalgic and inspirational tale; they will be forced to examine their own values, beliefs, and attitudes as they are allowed a rare glimpse into the evolution of a revered writer's process as she struggles with the desperately important message she wants to relay.  I recommend this book for those who are ready to feel the sting it will inflict.
There are many good, bad, and in between things about this short book. Let's start with the good ones:<br/><br/>Atticus is shown a man of his times - with all flaws bred by one's environment along side the steely, idealistic convictions we had seen before. To what degree they are pardonable is a matter of debate, like everything in real life. Jean Louis is perhaps too quick to forgive out of love but the novel does show Calpurnia's viewpoint too. It takes a courage to expose the man behind the saint. The experience is unpleasant and contentious. Where does one stop forgiving and start incriminating in the shades of grey? And how much of one's views are based on one's position in the society (say whether one is a white or coloured) or one's relationship with the person (would Jean Louis have been persuaded to change her stance on a short conversation in a matter of hours if Atticus was not her father)? The subjectivity involved is what the real life is, unlike the good guys versus bad guys stuff one reads in most novels.<br/><br/>Bad: Yet, if the novel was not by Harper Lee, would it really have been read or made much impression? Or even if it was not her second but some twenty-second? The meandering around the childhood incidents is mostly purposeless. It holds interest simply because of the deep connections established by the Mockingbird. So much of the book is ireelevant despite good descriptions. Almost nothing that happens until the last fifth has any bearing on the tale, characters or the issues raised. One meets Aunt Alexandra and Dill and a host of minor characters but they seem to come in and go out more to ensure that it does not appear like a story set in the world of three-four people.<br/><br/>And the so-so part: the book is too long for only one issue it raises and too short for leaving so many other promising themes. The author could have added more tension to bring force in various characters' views: by fermenting violence borne out of prejudices and testing Atticus versus Jean Louis' views. Or by conjuring a real debate or two. This could have provided some fundamental basis behind Jean Lewis' views rather than provided as given.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman does not provide a closure to the Mockingbird but throws it open for a totally new set of interpretations. Future generations will never be able to appreciate Atticus the way he has been in the last five decades. While this is realistic, it is still sad.
As many have stated, this book is really a draft that led to To Kill a Mockingbird, so it's no surprise that it is not nearly as good at its successor. That said, it's a worthwhile read, though didactic and preachy at times. I gave it four stars because Harper Lee's brilliance shines through the cracks quite often.<br/><br/>In reviews I have read of Go Set a Watchman, the nearly universal interpretation seems to be that Atticus Finch is a racist in this story and that Harper Lee and her publisher have done a disservice by soiling the reputation of one of the greatest heroes in the literary world.<br/><br/>Not only are these reviewers wrong about Atticus Finch, they are the ones who are soiling his reputation by misinterpreting the story, its theme, and its heroic character.<br/><br/>In our current society, there seems to be a quickness to slap the racist label on anyone who doesn’t toe a certain “politically correct” line. Atticus Finch is not a racist, and those who give him that label completely miss the point of the book.<br/><br/>Harper Lee took great pains to thematically teach the opposite mindset. She chastised those who are quick to dismiss opposing viewpoints by negatively labeling their opponents without due process, that is, going beyond the superficial and learning what is really going on in someone’s mind.<br/><br/>In the story, Jean Louise Finch (Scout) was the foil. She was the accuser, the one labeling her father as a racist (among many other intemperate insults), and Lee’s entire point was to show how wrong Jean Louise was. She saw only the surface, the superficial evidence against Atticus, and she was too blinded and too fearful to dig further to find the truth. Jean Louise was the bigot, not Atticus.<br/><br/>With every evidence of racism in Atticus, there was a counter explanation that Jean Louise either couldn’t see or refused to see. Through an illustrative flashback, Ms. Lee employs sharp cunning to demonstrate Jean Louise's blindness with regard to a completely different topic. When Scout was eleven, she began her menstrual cycle. Soon after, a boy kissed her and tried to push his tongue into her mouth. Later, an older girl tried to explain to Scout how a girl gets pregnant. The girl said that it begins with French kissing.<br/><br/>From that point on, Scout zoned out. She couldn’t listen to the rest of the explanation. She was certain that she was pregnant. If she had continued to listen, she likely would have heard that getting pregnant involved more than tongue contact, but her fear blinded (deafened) her to further inquiry.<br/><br/>She decided that she would kill herself before the baby could be born. Then one month before the baby was due (according to her ignorant calculations), and with no other evidence of being pregnant, she climbed a tower intending to jump off.<br/><br/>Fortunately, and unexpectedly, someone saw her and stopped her. Later, when she confessed her fears, she was corrected and understood her blindness and ignorance.<br/><br/>In the same way, Jean Louise saw evidence of bigotry in her father. The revelation shocked her. Fear invaded. Blindness ensued. She couldn’t explore further and find the truth. Her own terror became a crippling handicap. Later, she climbed the proverbial suicide tower and exploded at her father with all sorts of insults, and he absorbed them with patience and tender answers.<br/><br/>Jean Louise was committing family and relational suicide because of her fear and ignorance. Fortunately, and unexpectedly, her uncle found out and stopped her. He explained the truth. Atticus Finch lived in a region in which he maintained friendship with real racists, and to Jean Louise his association with them appeared condoning, but she was mistaken.<br/><br/>As her uncle said, “The time your friends need you is when they’re wrong, Jean Louise. They don’t need you when they’re right.”<br/><br/>The racists were wrong, and Atticus was their friend. He refused to spurn them. He stayed close in order to help them.<br/><br/>The tie that binds Scout’s flashback suicide attempt and the adult Jean Louise’s emotional suicide is clear in the following exchange with her uncle as she comes to realize her blindness and foolishness:<br/><br/>Jean Louise put her head on the steering wheel. “Uncle Jack, I’m so ashamed of myself I don’t know what to do. Me yelling around like—oh, I could kill myself!”<br/><br/>“I shouldn’t do that. There’s been enough focal suicide for one day.”<br/><br/>Uncle Jack prevented her emotional suicide. He helped her see her blindness. Her father was not the racist devil she had foolishly believed him to be.<br/><br/>Indeed, Atticus Finch was not a racist. He was a states-rights gradualist who resented the federal government’s intrusion that forced immediate equality. His observation was that Negroes (his term) were not ready for a dramatic shift, and their state, their community, needed to gradually blend the two races according to wisdom instead of fiat.<br/><br/>This ideology doesn’t conform to left-of-center views that insist on Washington-based solutions, so it’s no surprise that accusations of racism come from those camps, but it is an unfair and unwise accusation. It is the product of the same kind of blindness that Jean Louise exhibited, and it is the kind of ignorant labeling that Harper Lee excoriates in this book.<br/><br/>Ms. Lee’s character, Jean Louise, served as the ignorant labeler, the arrogant judge on high who, without the courage to dig deeper, had the audacity to unfairly label her father.<br/><br/>Another exchange between Jean Louise and her uncle is poignant:<br/><br/>“I thought fear of the Lord was the beginning of wisdom.”<br/><br/>“It’s the same thing. Humility.”<br/><br/>May we all show humility by withholding labels and seeking to know more about people and their views. Let us refrain from unfairly judging them. This was Harper Lee’s message, and it is sad to see so many reviewers blindly missing her point and doing the opposite.
First and foremost, what most people are failing to recognize is how much courage it has taken Harper Lee to publish again.  It is unbelievably brave of her to change her mind and publish a work that is receiving so much criticism.  This work is meant to be entirely different than To Kill a Mockingbird; many are failing to see it as such.  While To Kill a Mockingbird was meant to convey justice and civil rights, Go Set a Watchman is a coming of age story.<br/>It’s a statement about how no matter how far we travel or how long we have not visited, one can always go home, but just remember that it will not be the same home one comes back to.  Just because we come from a certain local does not necessarily mean that everyone in that place is “your type of people”, your type of people could actually the next town over or 1,000 miles from where you call home.<br/>Most importantly, it’s a story about every lesson every young adult learns; that our heroes are not infallible.  It is a lesson about how our greatest heroes are flawed, that what we see in them when we’re children becomes something different as we get older and learn more about the world.  Also, even though our heroes are flawed, it is through their flaws that we learn to be better people than they could ever be; this is why Atticus is so proud of Scout when she finally confronts him.  Children are meant to be the improvements that their parents are unable to fulfill.<br/>What is also poignant about this story is the reminder that even the most color-blind, universally accepting individuals can be bigots (but only turnip sized bigots).  Just because you radically disagree with an opposing message to your world view, it is important to listen to all sides of an argument.  Not only does this make you a better debater, but it also makes it easier to tailor your argument into ways the other side may understand.  This is still the same lesson as from To Kill a Mockingbird:  you have to understand the other side’s point of view, to walk around in their shoes.  By keeping a holistically open mind, one can be a better agent for change.<br/>Lastly, the actual writing style is different than many of this current generation is probably accustomed with.  “OMG” Lee actually uses sophisticated words, the reader may have to actually think about what the word means within the context of a paragraph or have to look it up somewhere.  My god, one may have to learn new words and increase their vocabulary!  I enjoyed the first person narrative, this is by all means Scout’s coming of age story and should be told from her perspective.  Aside from a few grammatical and consistency errors that should have been caught by the editors, it is a wonderfully written story.<br/>Go Set a Watchman should not be considered a sequel of To Kill a Mockingbird; both works should be read and analyzed for its own merit.  Both of Lee’s works teach valuable life lessons that took Moxi to have published.  Thank you Harper Lee for creating life lessons that jump off the page and into our hearts.
I loved the book.  As a reader, I felt Scout’s disappointment in her father right along with her.  We learn that Atticus had racist views, but the racism displayed in this book, by Atticus and the others, is representative of the area and time.  It’s hard to take, since we love Atticus so much, but it’s real.  People disappoint us.  Our country’s history can disappoint us.  The pedestal that we and Scout have put Atticus on, make the story that much more powerful.<br/><br/>Racism is a main part of the story and the part that most readers are focused on, because it’s so appalling to most of us today.  Even Scout, with her relatively progressive views, would be considered racist by most people today.  There is a lot more to the book, though.  We get to see Scout learning to be her own person, realizing she has her own beliefs and thoughts, separate from those of her father.  There is a point in many of our lives when we realize that we are not our parents.  We have our own unique opinions. We may not agree with everything they think.  We may have different values and morals.  We may even find some of their beliefs are abhorrent.  We have to learn how to deal with that.<br/><br/>It’s also about learning to accept those who have differing views than we have.  Accepting a person for who they are, does not mean agreeing with them or accepting their beliefs.  When Uncle Jack tells Scout that the town needs people like her, he tells her that just being her, and thinking as she thinks is a way to effect change.  He is telling her that hating her father and the others for their beliefs is not the way to help, but by showing them another way.  As Martin Luther King Jr said “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.  Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”<br/><br/>The story made me think and it made me feel.  I felt sadness, disappointment, hilarity, frustration, happiness, and relief at different parts of the book.  This, to me, makes it a good book.  I don’t know if it was Harper Lee’s wish to have this published and I think it is a shame if this was done against her will, but I am glad that she wrote it, and I’m glad that I had the opportunity to read it.
55 years after the iconic To Kill a Mockingbird was released, Harper Lee’s second novel is finally available. Unfortunately, Go Set a Watchman, is not the novel you are looking for.<br/>Go Set a Watchman, set two decades after the Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece, is not a sequel. It falls short of that designation not only in the sense that it was written prior to TKaM, thus making that familiar book a prequel, but more so in that it does not continue the world created in the original. Instead, the novel is like an episode of The Twilight Zone in which the characters, places, and histories have all been replaced with identically named ones that are eerily similar, but just different enough to create a whole new world.<br/>The story itself is unfortunately flat and uninteresting. The plight of Jean Louise Finch as she struggles to separate herself from her past and become her own person is weakly contrived and set off with an unimaginative catalyst. Instead of seeing a character who learns and grows from experience, we are presented with one who fumbles through understanding her past and stumbles into misunderstanding her future.<br/>And speaking of character, it’s not there. This is not the family that lives within the pages of TKaM, brought to life through their delightful words and actions. Instead, we’re presented with a cast of flat, uninteresting, static, and cliche’d characters. There is a strong tendency to bring in our previous understanding of these classic characters to round them out, but it is important to note that this book is not, as I said, a sequel. Should someone read this novel without (heaven forbid) having read the original, they would likely be left confused and unsatisfied by the majority of the characters.<br/> One redeeming characteristic of Go Set a Watchman is, strangely enough, the fact that it seems to have only been very lightly edited. Instead of a book that stands alone as a fantastic novel based upon its own merit, we have something incredibly unique and interesting: we have a glimpse into the creative process that brought about one of the greatest works of American literature. Watchman gives us a glimpse into both the writer’s early skills, or lack thereof, and what she has done to improve them. We see ideas in their infancy and what talent and craft has done with those ideas to cultivate a masterpiece.<br/> Go Set a Watchman was not published when it was first written because it was just not good enough. It’s still not good enough to be published as a novel for that same reason. So, should your read it? Absolutely! I have a daughter who is uncoincidentally named Harper, what else am I going to say? But when you do read it, approach it as a writing artifact perhaps unlike any other that we have access to. Know what you’re in for, and enjoy.
Although considered her sophomore novel, Go Set a Watchman was written in the mid-fifties, before she wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. Set some twenty years after To Kill a Mockingbird, we can see the town of Maycomb is struggling to keep pace with the rest of the country. Many characters are stuck in the Confederate South and fail to accept that blacks are human beings, just like they are. Finding out who Atticus Finch truly is, and seeing how Jean Louis "Scout" Finch responds to her father's true identity, makes this novel worth the read.<br/><br/>That's not to say that this novel doesn't have its issues. Structurally, it is faulty. In some areas, the text reads as choppy and fragmented; in others, it's difficult to see in which direction Lee wants to go. And, most characters lack development. (If you haven't read Mockingbird, I strongly suggest you eat that as your main dish, then dine on this as your somewhat unsavory dessert.) Although we see a little development with Jean Louise, she goes from an angry firecracker to a sparkler on its last few seconds too quickly. And, Uncle Jack (or, Dr. Finch, as he referred to in the novel), isn't the man he is in Mockingbird. As for Atticus, readers learn about a few dark secrets he's been keeping hidden, and, well, prepare yourselves for a slap in the face. Aunt Alexandra (or, "Zandra", as Atticus calls her, which is not at all likely based on his character in Mockingbird) is just about as one would imagine her based on her characterization in Mockingbird. However, a few characters never make an appearance (you'll need to figure that out on your own).<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is a good read, one that will most likely leave the reader feeling as though he's been kicked in the stomach. And, that feeling lasts a while. However, one will most likely come to terms with why he was kicked and will take the necessary steps to make sure it won't happen again.<br/><br/>(On a side note, Watchman was published "as is"; that is, it was not edited from its original text. That is obvious with some descriptions of characters who are essential to Mockingbird's plot. Just keep in mind that this was her first novel, and, if given time, could have been edited so that these errors do not exist.)
Although this review does not have specific plot spoilers, it does have thematic spoilers.  *Thematic spoiler alert?*<br/><br/>If you're hoping for the idealism and child-like dreaminess of To Kill a Mockingbird, you will be disappointed.  Scout tells the story, twenty years after To Kill a Mockingbird, of her visiting home again.  Maycomb, though going through some changes, is also much the same.  Atticus is now in his seventies and suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, but he's still Scout's loving, patient father.  Scout also has a love interest and she is conflicted over her future with him.  Thus goes the first third of the book- relatively shallow and almost boring.  Somewhere in the middle, things get very shaken up. Scout realizes that what she thought she knew as a child is very different from what reality has always been.  She's angry, she's disappointed and so was I.  I kept thinking, "this isn't the way things should be!" just along with Scout.  Towards the end, things come to a head and Scout sees things as they are- not in the idealistic way that childhood and youth makes one think, but in a reconciliation of what reality is and the still hopefulness for the future.  Although it's not really a coming of age book, it is really a coming of true maturity book.<br/><br/>Scout grapples with what it is to be an adult, to see parents as they really are and not the gods of our childhood, and what it is to live with that.  She becomes her own person, not just who she was raised to think she was.<br/><br/>I give this 4 stars instead of 5 because the first bit is shallow and slow, and parts of the end are so complex, it's hard to make any sense out of it.  At the end I felt like I didn't understand half of it, yet I understood all of it.  Hard to understand until you read it.
Such a disappointment. I can see why it had never been published and I wish it had stayed that way. To Kill a Mockingbird was my favorite book from childhood, I even named my dog Atticus. Now that memory is tarnished. Awful book, poorly written.
i did not like this book - i found it very dull and boring.  icouldn't finish it, and couldn't believe it was written by the same person who wrote mocking bird.  dull and preachy. where mocking bird was full of life and sympathetic real characters.
No where close in the quality of writing style and character development compared to her first or was it her second novel, "To Kill A Mockingbird".<br/>No wonder this one was rejected by her publisher, if it really was her first novel.
Interesting read. Enjoyed the perspective of each character on how desegregation effected south Alabama. Readers should keep in mind when the story was written and the time/place of the story. Can see how people today will get quickly offended.
Had To Kill a Mockingbird not become a well-regarded classic, this book wouldn't matter. However, in revealing the clay feet of even the best Southerners on the issue of race, it should be read.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman starts to pull back the thin veil that To Kill a Mockingbird placed over the monstrous racism of the deep south.  However, after leaving the south, Harper revealed the limitations on the distance she could travel from where she was born.  A progressive born in the deep south in 1920s would be a racist by today's standards: Go Set a Watchman reveals both Lee's impulse toward a better future, and her ingrained acceptance of horrific stereotypes.  Viewing historical figures through a modern lens rarely results in a flattering portrait.<br/><br/>Such is the case here.  Atticus, her literary father, and Lee herself indicate their unquestioning acceptance of the inferiority of blacks.  Neither could see a future where blacks were viewed as integrated equals.<br/><br/>The book is as much diatribe as narrative. The characters are mostly shallow and poorly developed, particularly regarding the few black characters that are prominent.  The only arc is Scout's initial discomfort with the worst sort of racism and her eventual acceptance that reactionary racial violence inevitable given the Supreme Court's hesitant steps toward giving life to the promises of equality embodied in the Civil War amendments tot he constitution.  The moral of her story is that change comes slowly, and people of good will should simply monitor the craziest racists to ensure that the level of violence and vitriol they employ is within bounds, though the acceptable bounds are never spelled out.
I couldn't put it down. Much like the first book, this one is also a rite of passage of sorts. Scout has to deal with seeing her father through new eyes and the aftermath of him falling from the pedalstal she put him on as a child. I loved it all.
I enjoyed the humor of Scout's childhood reflections and the strength of her adult beliefs, but it was difficult to accept the expose of Atticus's bigoted and patronizing  attitude towards blacks. I liked him better in Harper Lee's first book.
To Kill a Mockingbird will always be my favorite but this book was very interesting I didn't feel like it was showing racism later in life for anyone really I think it was just the growth of the environment and the times but I enjoyed the book
I do not have a connection with To Kill a Mockingbird that others have.  I do not remember reading it in school during a time when such things make a lasting impression.  I vaguely remember parts but could not tell you if it was from the book or from the movie.<br/><br/>Without having an emotional tie with the classic book, I went into Go Set a Watchman with open eyes and a deep curiosity as to how a book could be so derisive.  What I was greeted with was a woman that had a strong up-bringing, a curiosity for life, a life altering moment in her younger years, a handful of decisions to make and in the blink of an eye, the realization that the man that she thought she knew was a stranger to her.<br/><br/>There is nothing more earth shattering then when a woman learns that her father is not the man that she thought he was.  Though it was not under the same circumstances, I could relate to Jean Louise “Scout” Finch at this exact moment.  The moment when you world crashes and you begin to questions your whole life.<br/><br/>Flashing back to her past, Scout reminisces about her growing up and the times and situations that helped her to be who she is.  As she states, she was blessed to be color-blind, so the realities that she must face when she returns to Maycomb County are harsh.  Henry, her almost fiancé, tries to explain how you have to be in the middle of something, no matter how horrible it is, to see it from all parts and change it from within, but Scout is having no part of that.  With Jem now gone, she is confused.  Calpurnia and even her Uncle Jack have tried, but when times change, there is no going back.<br/><br/>I love southern humor.  There are long drawn out parts of this book, but the humor is what kept me focused.  Not to say that this is a funny book, the subject is very serious, but the south has a way of telling a story and peppering it with humor. Your heart breaks for Jean Louise, she has been gone a long time and home tends to change when you are not there.  Home can even change when you are sitting at your father’s knee, but we cannot always see it when we are living it.<br/><br/>As others have said, this book is not To Kill a Mockingbird; it takes place almost twenty years later.  The people are the same, but the time is different.  I cannot say if it is better, but to me, it is lasting.  The heartbreak is palpable.  The frustrations are real.  The realization that everything is bearable when you become your own person bounces off the pages.<br/><br/>Scout had to become a separate entity from her father.  He was her God and when he descended to human level, her world was rocked.  It was time for her to return to Maycomb, she was on the cusp of maturity and humbleness of mind.  As the tide was turning, she now had to run to meet it.
This book shows that Atticus and Jean Louise were not the only products of their times it shows that Harper Lee, born in 1926, was also.  It is the bravest book I've ever read.  It's also the most hopeful.  The primary premise is that change comes and it's arc is toward justice.  The best a human can do is to stay open to evolving.  We are all products of our times and the challenge is to love and evolve.<br/><br/>This book is a template for exemplary parenting of an adult child, a recipe for staying open to the next phase of unfamiliar justice, a study of humility, and a much needed recitation of the dictionary definition of bigot.  We needed this book NOW because we have become a nation of bigots.  We are every kind of bigot!  Conservative, liberal, apathetic, libertarian, religious, atheist, anarchist, you name it, we've figured out how to bigotify it!<br/><br/>This book is the remedy.  It's humility itself because it knew it was a product of it's time and wrong.  It redeems itself by shining a lantern on the path ahead.  This lantern knows it's not a lighthouse bright light just a puny little lantern.  It's not going to show very far down the path.  Only far enough for the person who is holding it to walk slowly and safely while partly blinded by the very light held.  I'm glad and grateful beyond words for this book.  This is the grown up Mockingbird.  I love Atticus because he knew he'd be wrong.  He couldn't see how but he and Uncle Jack know they are just steppingstones for the next generation to leave behind.  (Sorry for the mixed metaphors, I'm not a writer just an observer).  Any way, all who have been fortunate enough to find a lit place further down the road, beckon the rest of us to you.  Some of us will come and light the way for more.  We will make this old world a better, more just place by doing our part and cheering the next generation to leave us behind, gently, kindly and humbly if they can, do their part, and do likewise.
Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman will make you love and hate her literary agents.<br/><br/>It will make you love the agent who saw potential in this novel -- but in an entirely different kind of story. It was that agent who nurtured Lee and helped produce one of the great pieces of literature in To Kill A Mockingbirds.<br/><br/>It will make you hate the literary agent of today who found this manuscript and decided that what the world most needed was more of the story of Maycomb and a chance to check in again with Scout, Atticus and the rest. I won't go so far as to say that this one ruins the literary legacy of To Kill A Mockingbird (as others have), but I will go so far as to say after reading it, I wish it had stayed locked in a drawer and never seen publication.<br/><br/>An older Jean Louise returns to her home of Maycombe for a two-week vacation to spend time with her father. While there, she's romanced by an old flame and makes some discoveries about her father, her town and her childhood that unsettle her and cause her to doubt if she ever really knew any of them.<br/><br/>I suppose you could argue that Watchman is about a girl growing up and struggling to reconcile the image she has of her father with the reality of who he is or aspects of his life that he kept hidden from her. But given what we see in Mockingbird, the revelations about the town and Atticus don't necessarily add up in the final equation. I couldn't help but find myself hoping this was all some trick or plan of Atticus' for some reason beyond the obvious. But like Scout, I came away disappointed.<br/><br/>Watchman reads very much like a first draft -- and one that could have used a strong edit. There are sections that are clunky and difficult to wade through while others will remind you of Mockingbird. Ironically, these sections are those that flashback on the younger days of Scout, Jem and Dill. One section sees the trio playing revival after the various churches of the town hold theirs while another gives us a glimpse of what Scout would be like in high school and Jem's growing up to be the big fish in a small pond of the high school and town.<br/><br/>Had Watchman focused on these areas, it might have worked.<br/><br/>Alas, there are too many clunky moments in between to make this the companion piece to To Kill A Mockingbird that many of us hoped it would be.
I wasn't going to get this book because of the controversy about whether or not Harper Lee was taken advantage of. I still don't know what to think in that department, but I chose to get this book. I don't regret it.<br/><br/>There are a couple of inconsistencies between the two books, that if Ms. Lee was in better health, could have been remedied. There are some passages she copied directly from this book and into TKAMB.<br/><br/>Those issues aside, this was a solid novel. It wasn't as good as TKAMB, It wasn't as cohesive or smooth. Had this been her published novel, I don't believe it would have won the awards or the hearts of the people. As a follow-up, it is excellent. It fills in the spaces and fleshes out some of the characters.<br/><br/>I don't find myself disappointed in Atticus. I see him as more human, more rounded and his intentions for what he does are better explained. The message that staying in your community, to effect change, even when you cannot stand the general mindset, is a valuable lesson. I find the story even more appropriate today, more relevant today, because of the controversy around  racism and the uproar about the Confederate battle flag. The arguments are the same today as they were then. I miss not finding out more about Boo Radley, but seeing the depth of Atticus was important. The last chapter of the book was the most important. No, I'm not disapointed in Atticus, I simply understand him better. Maybe some people are disappointed because they, like Scout, lose their image of the perfect hero. Of course, no human is a perfect hero and that is why this book is so very valuable.<br/><br/>Yes, it is about Scout separating from her Dad and not viewing him as her unquestioned hero. To me it also demonstrates how families SHOULD work, that a person can vent their heart and still be loved. It is also about community and society and how we need to learn to talk together and work together and STAY. Running away won't change anything, but staying and working and working to create change - those are the things that matter the most and make the biggest impact.<br/><br/>Having lived in the South and having sworn never to return, I see many parallels between my experience and Scout's.
There is a reason this book received initial editorial rejection.  It's deeply flawed, but shows the promise of a writer that vastly improved by the time she published TKAM.  Without the reader's knowledge of Mockingbird, we would be disappointed with Watchman.  After writing her second book, there was a reason Harper Lee never sought to publish this first one. [ I believe it was only the estate lawyer's greed that allowed Watchman to be published at this time, but that possibility is discussed in detail in the main media.]<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is really two stories in one book.  The first contains the reminiscing about a small town Southern childhood by a 26 year old woman returning to her home town.  This is the majority of the book and, although often dull, Lee's writing about these childhood memories shows signs of the brilliance that she will later exhibit in TKAM.  The second story line is really composed of two conversations, one with Jean Louise's uncle and one with her father.  In those later sections, the writing style changes considerably and is mostly lecturing to the reader.  The transition between these "two stories" is awkward, making the reader feel like the first part, although better written, was merely filler for the eventual main point of the book - the fall from grace of a revered parent whose faults are now more realistically seen than they were in childhood memories.  All of this occurs with the background of a culturally changing South.<br/><br/>Some of the book's characters are either inconsistent, not filled out, or left hanging in an un-followed plot line.  Jean Louise (Scout) has typical and exceptionally well described childhood memories.  Jean Louise, the 26 year old adult, seems immature and sometimes churlish.  Did she not grow intellectually in college?  Why is she surprised by the changes in her home town or its inhabitants?  Does she not read a newspaper or watch TV?  We understand her disillusionment when she is revolted by her adult discovery of her revered father's moral lapses and weak defense of the racial status quo.  He's not the God she wanted him to be.  All parents are evaluated more realistically as we age ourselves.  But her discovery and his defense come out of the blue, with a minor set-up and a poor transition from the wispy memories of the majority of the book.  As a result, Jean Louise’s conversations with her uncle and father only give the reader a summary explanation of why such supposedly intellectual and moral men could be part of defending a morally bankrupt cultural status quo.  Jean Louise is bereft of nuance in this book, making her morally correct but without any understanding of flawed people.  The book leaves the reader in the same position.<br/><br/>Atticus, a symbol of justice, fairness, and tolerance in TKAM, is here portrayed in Watchman as a seemingly calm, rule revering person trying to preserve old cultural prejudices and racial paternalism to maintain order.  The different portrayals of this character are immaterial to me (they’re both fictional, after all), but Lee needed to explore Atticus’ character more fully in Watchman to help us understand why he acted in the way that he did.<br/><br/>What ever happened to Zeebo’s son who was charged with manslaughter?  Why was Calpurnia estranged from the Finch family?  Why, in a book about race, do we not meet any fleshed out black characters?  These dangling plot lines could have been used to advance the moral ambiguities of other characters.<br/><br/>This book is already a huge commercial success because of its TKAM predecessor, however there’s a reason Harper Lee kept it in the vault all these years.  TKAM is better written and an improvement over Watchman.  I gave it the second star only because of the well written memories of childhood.
I now realize how this could have been the first draft for "To Kill a Mockingbird". If you take this novel and put the former's title on it, you will immediately recognize that it is a calculated recipe for Atticus to kill HIS mockingbird, Scout, and grow her into the independent thinking Jean-Louise Finch. The first novel tells us that to kill a mockingbird is to destroy something innocent. Atticus needed to destroy Scout's perception of him as this 'can-do-no-wrong' demigod. He feared that if she continued to live by his moral compass, that she would not develop into someone who could better the world by thinking for herself. Atticus knew that Scout would predictably follow him into the town hall meeting; in fact, he counted on her going there because he felt that it was important for her to see her dad as a man, and not as a god. Many will argue that this isn't the same Atticus from the first book -- but it is. If you are disappointed because you see Atticus as this racist bigot, then you have been fooled just like Scout. Harper Lee trained us to hold Atticus Finch in such hi regard for over 50 years; here, she plainly outlines that Atticus is just a product of his environment, and that we should try to consider is point of view. Just because he was pro-segregation didn't mean that he hated black people; on the contrary, he went so far as to say that just because he let people talk didn't mean that he agreed with them. He just believed that his town should progress at its own pace, and not by the dictation of foreigners who didn't live within his construct. I don't think it matters if he was right or wrong. We can't fold today's reality over Atticus' reality and expect it to be judged fairly. The man was 72 years old in 1955, which would place his birth at 1883 -- 18 years after the civil war and the abolishment of slavery. Atticus basically tells Scout to consider how long it took white society to mature to what it is (right or wrong), and then consider that black people had only been free 90 years. Pretty nascent, by his estimates. He didn't want to rush his understanding of 'progress'.<br/><br/>Anyway, this book is food for thought. I like its release so many years later. It's probably controversial today for different reasons that it would have been controversial in 1955. Back then, it was most likely controversial because the subject matter was too close to contemporary. Today, it's probably controversial because we refuse to see our heroes broken down as normal by upbringing. We are the mockingbirds, innocently believing that there wasn't any subtext to the bubble created by the original novel. Harper Lee had to kill us through metaphor. See the world for what it is. Develop your own ideas. Make it better.
(Spoiler separated at the end of my review) I was very much looking forward to reading Go Set a Watchman in spite of all the controversy that surrounded its publication. I absolutely loved TKAM, so I was so excited when I heard that Harper Lee had a new book coming out. Unfortunately, I probably should have just stayed away. This "book" was not ready for publication. It was hard to follow, it alternated strangely between third and first person when entering Jean Louise's thoughts, the dialogue between Jean Louise and Henry I thought was atrocious, the plot was barely there at all, the climax was rather pathetic and the resolutions was just ridiculous, there were a few strangely placed flashbacks (which I actually enjoyed more than the rest of the story, although they lacked the charm of TKAM), and honestly it was really quite boring. The story also rambled a bit like it wasn't sure where exactly it was going or how this ties into that, etc. There were also descriptions in the book that were exactly the same as in TKAM, which I guess I should have expected since this was supposedly TKAM's first draft. Those didn't really bother me that much though, rather they made me smile because they reminded me of one of my favorite books. Then there were inconsistencies between this book and what happened in TKAM which probably shouldn't have bothered me too much, but it kind of did anyway.<br/>Really, I should have just left this book alone. It wasn't worth it.<br/><br/>(SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>Then there's Atticus's character... WHAT HAPPENED?! I found this to be the most devastating thing about the book. All poor first draft writing aside, the character in this book who goes by the name of Atticus FInch is not the Atticus Finch I remember so fondly from TKAM. I know people can change and everything, and this book takes place over ten years after TKAM, but seriously? How could he have changed that much? It made me so sad. Jean Louise's feelings on race I also found objectionable as well, but I did think they were more believable than Atticus's change in character... Also, Jem's dead in this one. That disappointed me because I was looking forward to seeing what he was like as an adult. Really though, given how the rest of the characters turned out, it's probably for the best that he wasn't in this one in any way other than flashbacks.
I absolutely love this book, and find the characters very true to the period, and I think that's what's gotten so many people upset.  Our memory, collectively, is short enough that we do not recall that during the time Harper Lee was writing, the subject matter she's exploring was very much on the minds of thinking people, such as Jean Louise (Scout), the main character of this book.  The surprise, to many people, is the portrayal of Atticus, her father.  Without giving anything away, many readers, apparently, felt just as shocked as Scout did when they observed her father's behavior, and just as dissatisfied with his explanation.<br/><br/>But, while the reaction of various people, white and black, to the things that were happening to the young woman version of Scout was very true to life, and the actual theme being explored by the book is definitely coming-of-age.  The exploration of race relations is a backdrop to Scout's becoming her own person, becoming Jean Louise.<br/><br/>The problem a lot of people have, like the problem this main character has, is that they've put Atticus up on a pedestal.  But he's a person (or at least a literary portrayal of one), and we're all flawed.  So, I found this to be a fantastic read, with intricately-developed characters, and as thought-provoking as Mockingbird, if not more so.<br/><br/>It's my feeling, as a writer, that this book, which Harper Lee wrote first, is the real story she wanted to write.  Getting it published at that time would have been nigh unto impossible.  It's Harper Lee's story, partially autobiographical, and, like all fiction, partially imagined.  I understand she's not doing so well these days, and I don't know what she thinks about all this, if she does.  But I have an inkling that she probably always intended to have it be published some day.  While it would have been seen as too inflammatory at the time it was written, and apparently still has some inflammatory affect today, one would think we could all take a lesson from Jean Louise, again.<br/><br/>The title is taken from Isiah (21:6), and it means someone must be the moral compass.  But who?  That's part of Jean Louise's lesson, in the book, and there's a good passage in it that will turn you on to the true meaning of the title.  Whereas, to kill a mockingbird is to destroy innocence, and Scout, Jean Louise's childish self, is representative of the nugget of meaning in the title, again, in this incarnation, the meaning is brought forth through her relationship with her father.<br/><br/>Harper Lee has done us another great favor; we just haven't wrapped our collective heads around it yet.  Everyone's stuck on the surface, on the events in the story.  In fact, we, as a nation, are still living through trauma of being and becoming that Jean Louise is in Watchman, as evidenced by the necessity of exploring, today, the true meaning of equal justice under the law.  As a nation, we still have not healed all the wounds of the Civil War, more than 200 years later.  And, slavery and the mindset that was required to perpetuate it, damaged everyone.  To own another human, you must dehumanize him.  To do so is destructive on so many levels.  To do so for hundreds of years leaves scars on the psyches of people of all races.  We still need to be provoked.<br/><br/>And it's working.  We're actually talking about the true meaning of a book and investing ourselves in literary characters, as opposed to drooling over the latest celebrity, famous for nothing more than being famous.  Read the book.  Think about it.  And talk to people about it.  That's what it's for.
"The novel must tell a story," says Dr. John Finch on page 188 in this most anticipated novel of the year.<br/><br/>Was Harper Lee even paying attention to her own writing?<br/><br/>The setting is irrelevant. There is no plot, no character development, theme or style because this story could happen anywhere. The time period is supposed to be the late 1950's yet all featured characters, including Atticus Finch and his precocious daughter, have been reduced to 21st century stereotypes. Harper Lee has conveniently forgotten the Atomic Age came before The Feminine Mystique and the Equal Rights Movements.<br/><br/>Only two passing references are made to To Kill a Mockingbird. Any reader who picks up this book anticipating another fascinating and exciting "Where are they now?" tale will be very disappointed. Jem is dead. Dill Harris fought in The Good War and is currently living it up in Italy. The glaring absence of Boo Radley, the Robinson family and Mayella Ewell is why this book has no place alongside it's counterpart.<br/>Go Set A Watchman is no Great American Novel. Readers will have a hard time walking around in its shoes. It has no shoes.<br/><br/>Told entirely in third person limited, Jean Louise is rarely called "Scout" these days. She's here in Maycomb for a visit and spends the entire novel drinking coffee, shunning marriage to Henry Clinton, and looking down her nose at everyone who doesn't appreciate equal rights and feminism the way she does.<br/><br/>When she's not daydreaming about her coming of age experiences (menstruation, how babies are made, her first school dance) Jean Louise Finch is screaming bloody murder at her boyfriend and Atticus for attending a KKK meeting.<br/>The Horror!<br/><br/>That's the entire plot of this novel. I'm serious. Nothing happens.<br/><br/>After talking to everyone: Henry Clinton, Uncle Jack Finch, Aunt Alexandra, and finally her father (to whom she should've run to in the first place but that would be plagiarizing To Kill a Mockingbird) Jean Louise Finch finally comes to terms with the fact that Harper Lee was wrong to make Atticus Finch into a Christ Figure because what kind of a world would this be if men were actually good for something?<br/><br/>Oh, and she's never getting married. This is 1957 after all.<br/><br/>There is some swearing but no f-bombs, sex scenes or violence. It is appropriate for all middle-grade readers and above but it is no literary classic and will never be celebrated in freshman English classes like that Other Book.<br/>Please, let's keep it that way.
I was all prepared not to like “Go Set a Watchman.” We kept hearing those rumors about the reclusive Harper Lee’s health and why would she supposedly change her mind after decades of not allowing publication of the novel. Besides, how could anyone, even Harper Lee, dare to mess with the classic millions of us have loved for so long? I wanted the young Scout left alone, forever immortalized in my mind and yours. The final straw was all those professional reviewers, with a jump on the rest of us, reporting that Atticus was revealed as a racist. Say what?<br/><br/>In spite of all that, I started reading, waiting to pounce on those phrases and scenes and every little thing that would make this “novel” read like a less-than-ready manuscript. But, darn, the beautifully crafted writing and the interesting story started pulling me in. The years had gone by, but I couldn’t deny the fond memories I had of these characters, this town and their story. I cared what happened to them—and when that happens, the writer has her reader hooked. Yep, I fell in love.<br/><br/>A lot of readers have focused on Atticus' racism, which is certainly there in some very ugly words straight out of the character's mouth. I believe Lee is challenging each of us to think deeply about our own prejudices. Do you really not see skin color? Do you really not make automatic assumptions about a person based on appearances? I mean, if you need somebody to snap your group’s photo at the beach, who do you assume will do a better job, the little old white-haired ladies sitting near you or the teenagers waking your way with cell phones practically attached to their hands?<br/><br/>While “Watchman” doesn’t reach the soaring heights of “Mockingbird,” it’s a fantastic novel in its own right.
‘Go Set a Watchman’ is Harper Lee’s first draft and “parent” novel to her 1960 Pulitzer Prize-winning, ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’.<br/><br/>I liked it. Quite a lot actually. And my liking the book worried me a bit at first. I thought for sure that I was simply being incapable of an unbiased opinion where Harper Lee is concerned. I found a comment left on a Wall Street Journal article about the discovery of the manuscript, and I can concede that it may well apply to me in many ways; “The author and book have been given an exalted status well beyond the quality of the book. People have projected their own opinions about race onto the book.”<br/><br/>So take that concession as you will – I may well be an unreliable reviewer.<br/>You have been warned.<br/><br/>A brief summary of the book, if you’ve been living under a rock ... While (GSAW) was written as the first draft that eventually would turn into ‘Mockingbird’, it is in fact set in Mockingbird’s future when ‘Scout’ – now, Jean Louise – returns to Maycomb, Alabama for her sixth trip home since boarding at a girl’s college in Georgia and then moving to New York. Jean Louise is twenty-six, Atticus is an old man in his 70s and riddled with rheumatoid arthritis to the point that his sister, Alexandra, has had to move in with him to help him cope.<br/><br/>Atticus is still practicing law, and his partner at the firm is young man Henry ‘Hank’ Clinton – orphaned at a young age, he was an old friend of Jem’s, whom Jean Louise long had a crush on and has been dating for a while now, but is putting off his many attempts at engagement.<br/><br/>Early on in the book we learn (devastatingly) that Jem died rather suddenly at the age Jean Louise is now. Later we learn the reason; “Jean Graham Finch had brought to the family the heart that killed her son twenty-two years later on the sidewalk in front of his father’s office.”<br/><br/>The book is set in Jean Louise’s annual two-week trip home, when she has her eyes opened to Maycomb’s unchanging ways … and while the rest of the nation may be far more progressive and responsive as a result of the Civil Rights Movement, Maycomb – in fact, the entire South – lags behind in its insistence to keep the ‘colored’ population in their place.<br/><br/>Jean Louise is particularly horrified to learn that Atticus and Hank share the views of the white populace in town – in particular, Atticus’s abhorrence to NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People). The novel deals with Jean Louise’s shattered worldview, her loss of the father she had built up in mind and memory.<br/><br/>‘Go Set a Watchman’ may not speak as profoundly as ‘Mockingbird’ does on racism, but I won’t let that subtract from my high opinion of the novel. Besides, while she may not deal as deftly with the matter of racism, I do think Lee shares some profound thoughts on racists. A particular triumph of ‘Mockingbird’ was that Lee was able to discern the difference; like in the character of Mayella Ewell, and how she is unraveled to reveal a scared, ignorant girl under her father’s boot-heel. I always found Lee’s portrayal of Mayella to be a more sympathetic one than even some reader’s would allow, and that she encapsulates the very notion that racism is bred from ignorance.<br/><br/>GSAW is told in third-person, where ‘Mockingbird’ was first (though told from Jean Louise looking back at several summers of her youth). I was initially a little thrown not to be inside of Scout’s head … but I finally got to thinking that GSAW’s third-person more easily allows readers to be as disenchanted by Atticus’s turn. That may not have been Lee’s intention as this was her first draft before ‘Mockingbird’ existed, but it came across that way to me at least. It is sad and almost hurtful to read Atticus has turned out this way, but that makes it all the more impacting. And by this point, Atticus has become such a literary hero – such a pillar of justice – that the one removed third-person more easily allows readers to take this hurt on for ourselves, rather than just for how it hurts Jean Louise.<br/><br/>I also finished reading GSAW, having recently been moved to tears by Scottish MP Mhairi Black’s maiden speech to Parliament … it is sad, but may well be the case that Atticus was more weathercock than signpost; “Weathercocks will spin in whatever direction the wind of public opinion may blow them, no matter what principle they have to compromise. And then there are signposts, which stand true and tall and principled. They point in one direction and they say, ‘This is the way to a better society and it is my job to convince you why.’”<br/><br/>One aspect of the novel that I read and particularly enjoyed was Jean Louise’s feminism, or rather – Harper Lee’s. Jean Louise muses on her time growing up a “juvenile desperado, hell raiser extraordinary." Scout Finch as a rough-and-tumble tomboy was a statement in itself in ‘Mockingbird’, and Lee continues to make similar ones with Jean Louise as a twenty-six year-old woman. There’s a particularly delicious scene at The Coffee (when Aunt Alexandra invites all of Jean Louise’s old schoolgirl classmates round for coffee and gossip) – Jean Louise archly notes the various camps of women, from those who are newly married to the recent mothers. She is withering and wary of them all, and it is a scene that rings like something out of Kathryn Stockett’s ‘The Help’ (oh, I would love Jean Louise to meet Skeeter!), particularly for how many of the women spout their husbands’ views of ‘negroes’ as lore.<br/><br/>Then there’s the fact that Jean Louise is a holdout to Hank’s proposals of marriage. He teases her for not being a more complacent woman who agrees with everything he says … and while it is teasing, there’s a subversion going on too. I will say that Jean Louise and Hank’s exchanges offer some of Lee’s clunkiest dialogue – a lot of “baby” and whimsy that’s hard to slog through at times – but there are still charmingly dissenting statements to be found there.<br/><br/>The feminist push-back in me even wonders if a lot of the critics’ resounding dismissal of GSAW stems from the fact that a big focus of the novel is on Jean Louise’s rejection of settling into marriage and babies, and the overall feminist subversion …<br/><br/>Though I would never have thought it before, GSAW got me thinking that there is something rather masculine about ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’. The two quiet heroes of the book are men – Atticus and Boo Radley – and Tom Robinson acts, along with Boo, as a symbol of the book’s underlying message. Scout and Jem are very pointedly devoid of much feminine company, since their mother died when Scout was two. There is even a rape trial at the heart of the book, concerning a woman who is very clearly lying. ‘Mockingbird’ is in many ways, a very masculine fare … but then again, most books deemed “classics” or universally praised tend to be. Natalie Kon-yu recently wrote for The Conversation, about how few award-winning novels are actually about women’s stories – the successful literary books tend to feature male characters, and male-centric stories. ‘Go Set a Watchman’ is very pointedly not that.<br/><br/>This book concerns Jean Louise’s disillusionment of her father, her rejection of feminine ideals (mentions of her Aunt Alexandra’s bone corset sort of wallop you over the head for symbolism, but they’re there nonetheless), and turning down a man’s many proposals of marriage. At one point, Aunt Alexandra even muses to Jean Louise; “Men in this age have turned the Other Woman into a psychiatrist’s couch, and at far less expense, too.”<br/><br/>Heck, Jean Louise even tells a long flashback story of getting her ‘curse’ (period) and discovering that a girl in her class was sent to an orphanage when it was discovered that her sister had gotten pregnant by the girl’s father. GSAW certainly has a stronger cast of women than ‘Mockingbird’, if only for Aunt Alexandra being on the scene … and the Finch’s old housekeeper, Calpurnia, features in one of the book’s strongest, most heartbreaking scenes (Jean Louise also pointedly acknowledges that she was raised by a white man and black woman – again, this felt like Stockett’s ‘The Help’ was somewhat prophetic).<br/><br/>GSAW is far from perfect. One of my favourite articles read in connection to the book was in the New York Times, about Harper Lee’s editor Tay Hohoff – which reveals how much Lee benefitted from her editor’s mentorship and guidance. It’s a great read for offering us a glimpse into this fascinating partnership between editor and author – and got me thinking that the same way ‘Mockingbird’ inspired many to the law, ‘Go Set a Watchman’ may well ignite interest in a lot of would-be editors. It sure is fun to try and imagine where some threads in GSAW carried Lee into what would become ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’, and they can mostly be found in Jean Louise’s recollecting the lazy days of her childhood; “She was silent. Time stopped, shifted, and went lazily in reverse. Somehow, then, it was always summer. Hank was down at his mother’s and unavailable, and Jem had to make do with his younger sister for company. The days were long, Jem was eleven, and the patterns was set:”<br/><br/>But you can definitely tell that Lee was improved by Hohoff’s suggestions and patient guidance as GSAW turned into ‘Mockingbird’. Her dialogue needed improving, particularly the Southern-drawl, long-way-round writing that’s so distinctive in ‘Mockingbird’ but was sometimes bloated in here; “With the same suddenness that a barbarous boy yanks the larva of an ant lion from its hole to leave it struggling in the sun, Jean Louise was snatched from her quiet realm and left alone to protect her sensitive epidermis as best she could …”<br/><br/>I rather loved ‘Go Set a Watchman’ anyway. There are more than a few flashes of the writer Harper Lee would turn out to be, and some paragraphs and lines cut the reader right to the bone; “Rest well, Jem.”<br/><br/>True, ‘Go Set a Watchman’ is no ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ nor is it better. It’s different, as are all of the surviving characters – some for better, some for worse. I think I mostly enjoyed having new words from Harper Lee – more so than from Jean Louise ‘Scout’ Finch, since we’re not in her head for this portion of the journey. I really did enjoy ‘Go Set a Watchman’ though; a book, I would argue, more about feminism than racism … it’s also about a different sort of ‘paradise lost’ than the journey away from childhood, but is instead about needing to hold long-held beliefs up to the light for scrutiny.<br/><br/>Thank you, Harper Lee – it was a privilege to read you for the first time again, and always.
Yup! Our  beloved Scout, now called, Jean Louise, is an artist living in New York City in the 1950s (twenty years after Mockingbird) and sleeping with a variety of lovers.<br/> When I discovered this—and it didn’t take that long into this really good novel titled Go Set a Watchman—I turned to the photograph of my beloved author (on the back of the dust jacket) and saw the twinkle in her face! “Honey, you did this, didn’t you? You go, girl!” is what I said. (Gay men like our straight women to be a bit slutty you know!)<br/> If I’d never read To Kill a Mockingbird and read this, I would write a five-star Amazon review for Watchman. However, since I’ve read the 1960 Pulitzer winner dozens of times, then, of course, I will writes about this 2015 first-time publication (nearly 60 years after it was accept by Lippincott with the need for much editing) within the context of what I experience in Mockingbird.<br/> This is proof positive that Truman Capote (Dill!)—Nelle Harper Lee’s Monroeville childhood playmate, wasn’t the phantom author. Not that I ever believed that since their writers’ voices are so unalike. Those who have grown to love Mockingbird in Watchman are treated to so many of the same characters, including the one we most love to dislike: Aunt Alexandra, the representation of “the” Southern woman.<br/> Twenty years later, she is living with Atticus—he’s in a new house—caring for her ailing brother. She hasn’t changed. At the end of a conversation with Jean Louise, our much loved Scout zaps Auntie: “’Auntie,’ she said cordially, “’why don’t you go pee in your hat?’”<br/> It’s that adverb cordially which is so brilliant. Try saying yourself. Hey, you might want to use it sometime.  I can’t wait to try it out myself.<br/><br/> Those of you who were unfortunate enough not to have been brought up—as was I—in Sunday church-going of a protestant with ministers who drone on (yes, I know about droning rabbis and cantors!) and choir members who can’t sing and organists who really should have stuck, say, with a recorder, then you may not giggle and gaffaw as I did as Jean Louise revisits the Methodist church (the Lees were all Methodists), sitting, of course, next to Aunt Alexandra. It is such wonderful parody—all about the hypocrisies that exist in churches, and especially so in the racist deep South.<br/> Of the young minister, a Mr. Stone, "Dr. Finch [this is Uncle Jack] called the [minister] the greatest talent for dullness he had ever seen in a man on the near side of fity. There was nothing whatever wrong with Mr. Stone, except that he possessed all the necessary qualifications for a certified public account: he did not like people, he was quick with numers, he had no sense of humor, and he was butt-headed."<br/> Pass the collection plate and sing the Doxology!<br/><br/> Okay, I’ll cut this short…. Just know that there’s no way anyone could be disappointed with the writing of this novel. Yes, you may not like Atticus in this as much as you adored him in what Oprah calls “our national novel.” But he is what he is: he is what the Southern white man was in the 1950s. But much nicer actually.
I have read more than one review of Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman. Where the reviewer will mention that the real tension begins on page 110.  That this book is a major disappointment. A draft. A first attempt.<br/><br/>However, I would like to mention that the tension begins on page 22. It can be heard in the sarcastic comment from Atticus to Jean Louise, “Then go back to New York and be uninhibited.” This is where the reader can sense the explicit tension between father for his daughter’s decision to leave the southern way of life in Maycomb.<br/><br/>The tension begins on page 36 between Aunt Alexandra (Atticus’s sister) and Jean Louise. When aunt makes clear that she has no desire that Jean Louise marry “that” Henry Clinton. Since, “Finches do not marry the children of rednecked white trash, which is exactly what Henry’s parents were when they were born and were all their lives.” This is where the meat of the book starts roasting. The book is a Finch family album, absent Jem. And he is pictured only in memories and story. The Finch family album in discussion leads the reader to see that the Finches are part of Southern aristocracy. No Yankee girl from the south, and no red neck can tell them what to do. The elder Finches are reacting from long held tradition in the south. This deeply effects Jean Louise. On page 46 her feelings about being back home were that she does not like the south for it’s, “Conservative resistance to change.” This is her aunt and dad. She does not like the conservative. And what is so amazing about this is that she would not like the conservative south today either.   Before the discovery of her father being a racist on page 110, the book is beautiful for its pondering the family before this discovery. What is white hatred of other whites? What is a knee jerk response from the usually cool and calm Atticus about Jean Louise’s transformation into a New Yorker with no southern inhibitions anymore? It’s a state of mind that hates change, hates others that are not like them. This book is as brilliant as Lee’s first. For it does not dangle a hero worship of dad before the reader as To Kill a Mockingbird did. It presents a family  grieving over the loss of Jem. And trying to fill that void left. It presents the dark holes of the soul that pride in ancestry and tradition cannot cloak over. And I have heard it said that, “Harper Lee has only one book in her.” I rebut that with, “False!”   Her ability to show the reader that Jean Louise matured into an independent woman free from the constraints of “Southerness” before it was cool to do so in the 60’s and 70’s, shows the Jean Louise Finch is character ahed of time. A lady who had good a conscience and stout of character for standing up for social justice demonstrates the forward mindedness of Harper Lee, in this a shelved and forgotten book. This review is not meant to say that this book is greater than To Kill a Mockingbird. A thorough reading and understanding of the adult Scout is what makes this book as good. It is sequel to Mockingbird for this reason that Jean Louise has matured into someone who loves rather than idolizes her family, her community, and that she is pleased with her ability to make decisions and that her life in New York is that—new. And new can scare those we thought we knew well.
There is much wisdom and shrewd reading among the early comments about Watchman.  I want to stress one point that has been made by others but not perhaps with sufficient emphasis: the importance of the shift from the first person Scout-voice of Mockingbird to the third person author-voice of Watchman.  I think that is why the two books fit together so beautifully and why the Atticus Finch we admired in Mockingbird is demonstrably the same person in Watchman.  The young Scout was uninterested in the social and political dimensions of segregation and bigotry in Maycomb.  She couldn't see -- although it is clear even in Mockingbird -- that her father accepted the mores of his town and worked within them.  We learn in Watchman that he did more than accept them and that is a shocking realization.  But Atticus Finch in the '30s was a segregationist and remained one in the '50s.  By then Scout (Jean Louise) was old enough and world-wise enough to put her father in the context he had always accepted, and it was shattering for her.  Readers who admired (and sometimes adored) Atticus in Mockingbird wold do well to re-read that book after reading this, to discover that the Atticus they so admired was one that they - like Scout - created by ignoring all the countervailing signs of his segregationist beliefs.<br/><br/>But in all other ways as well, the Atticus of Watchman and the Atticus of Mockingbird are the same man.  He encouraged his daughter to form her own opinions; he accepted her often vicious challenges to him and his belief system; he knew this day, at the end of Watchman, was coming.  Let me say, though, that the one character inconsistency that surprised and rattled me was Jean Louise's in the last conversation with her father.  It didn't make sense to me that she would have opposed the Supreme Court's decision and adopted basically a states-rights posture.  Perhaps some other reader can clarify this for me.
Because we as a society assumed To Kill a Mockingbird was a literary only child, the perfect child in the eyes of some, it's hard to accept Go Set a Watchman as its sibling, as the two offspring of Harper Lee's imagination are so different. Mockingbird is grand in scope at the beginning and personal at the end, while Watchman is the opposite. In Mockingbird, Scout speaks to us directly in first person, but in Watchman she is reduced to the third person. Most importantly, many will argue, is that Atticus Finch, the true hero of Mockingbird, has feet of clay in Watchman.<br/><br/>Once we set aside our love for Mockingbird and evaluate Watchman on its own merits, we see it is a very, very good book. There are some technical issues to be sure, particularly since no editor was supposedly allowed to touch the manuscript, but the story itself is very powerful. This is not the tale of a girl who idolized her perfect father, but one who realized her father was not the saint she once thought. And as her father fell from the heavens, her Uncle Jack offered consolation. "Our gods are remove from us, Jean Louise. They must never descend to human level."<br/><br/>The beauty of Watchman is the exact opposite of what makes Mockingbird such a great story. As children we are prone to elevate someone to the status of hero and we delight in being in the presence of this perfect person. As adults, the ability to see these people for who they really are is a sign of our maturity. Mockingbird may tell the tale of our childhood, Watchman shows us how important it is to grow up. It also suggests that our heroes, if they really are heroes, will help us mature even when it damages our view of them in the process.<br/><br/>So, for all those who are ready to cast stones because you don't like the truth Lee has to share in her long-lost first book, remember that if it's a sin to kill a Mockingbird, then it's also a sin to do the same to a Watchman.
I was terribly disappointed in this book in fact I couldn't finish it I re-read To Kill A Mockingbird before I launched into this one and just loved it loved it loved it but could not get into this no matter how hard I tried very disappointed
After reading this book, I understand, it had to wait it's turn. It could not have been released when To Kill A Mockingbird was, as we were not ready to understand. It is too bad Mr Peck is no longer with us to once more define Atticus Finch.
This novel seems like a sequel as it is set 20 years after "To Kill a Mockingbird" but it's actually an early draft of her first book and her editor convinced her to make a lot of changes to it, which led to her famous classic and for many years her only novel.  There is a lot of controversy about whether the author Harper Lee was able to give consent for this to be published and the portrayal of Atticus Finch.  However, I still liked that Jean Louise "Scout" Finch is a passionate and forward thinking woman who strongly believes in equality between the races.  I also liked the theme of disillusionment when discovering that your parents aren't as perfect as you believed.<br/><br/>I don't remember enough details about the first book to know how much of a departure this is.  One example I have read about involves rape charges against a black man; a few of the details are different between the two books.  I don't remember all of the details about Atticus Finch and whether the older version is believable, but I think it's realistic to show people who want change in society but prefer a more gradual and peaceful approach.  The first half of the book is kind of slow and is basically just about the Finch family.  Then the climax comes involving the Citizens’ Council and I think the controversy over Atticus' supposed racism was overblown.  I enjoyed the ending where the uncle and the father explained their positions.  The book has a lot of good ideas about states’ rights and equal rights compared to special rights and the 10th Amendment.  If students read this book I hope it gets them interested in learning about the Constitution and their natural rights.
I thought the book went back in time too often to tell the story of the characters when they were young. I didn't feel the characters were developed in the present time enough and there was too much "preaching" about right and wrong.
Very disappointing.  If I had not already known the characters from "To Kill a Mocking Bird", this book would not have even held my interest.  For anyone who loves "To Kill a Mocking Bird", I do not recommend you read this book.
This book is plain boring.  I dragged myself through 58 pages, then (admittedly) read the negative reviews, and decided not to waste my time any further.  Life is short, and there are too many good books to be read to waste my time on this one!
The manuscript should have stayed unpublished. The book doesn't flow well. Half way through there book I thought I'd missed something important and started over. No, I hadn't missed anything. The book is nowhere near the caliber of Mockingbird.
Apprehensive, that’s what I’ve been. Delighted, but skeptical. The publishing event of the decade, a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, a newly discovered Harper Lee novel. That’s pretty exciting, all right.  Almost unbelievable, given that Lee is hearing and sight impaired and in a nursing home, her sister Alice and her lawyer both having passed away, and her affairs resting in the hands of a new solicitor, one Tonya Carter, who brought this miraculously discovered manuscript to the attention of Harper Collins. I’m sure she only had Lee’s wishes at heart, don’t you think? Curiouser and curiouser, said Alice, but who am I to question the ethics of such a stellar publisher?  Fishy provenance, greed and bad reviews aside, I had to read it, if only to form my own opinion.<br/>So I did. While there are passages that are enjoyable and glimmers of brilliance here and there, it was a bit of a slog, sometimes confusing and ultimately, saddening. Such a cause celebre for what is ultimately a fraud. Shame on you, Harper Collins. Couldn’t someone on your staff have at least edited this a little, and to call this a “sequel”?  To make matters worse, the horrified politically and historically ignorant shrieks of “Atticus is a racist, our icon is tarnished beyond repair” have done nothing but increase your sales. Harper Lee doesn’t deserve this debacle, and if there is any justice, let us hope she is beyond understanding that it is her stellar legacy that is in danger of being tarnished by what looks like the greed of others.  Go Set A Watchman should have stayed in whatever dusty file drawer it was languishing in, a first draft that should have remained there.<br/>Let me be more specific. We meet Scout, now 26-year-old Jean Louise, coming home to Maycomb from New York for her annual visit to Atticus, some time in the 1950s. Given the politics in play, the time period is likely post 1954 and the Supreme Court’s Brown vs. Board of Education de-segregation ruling, but it’s never spelled out. We never find out what Jean Louise does for a living, but she seems to have been living in a bell jar when it comes to Southern problems, even though she supposedly comes home at least once a year. Her brother Jem has dropped dead of a heart attack two years before, and this event is given short shrift by Lee’s characters, except to suggest she come home to care for Atticus. Time is fuzzy, since we are told 18 years have passed, but ages don’t seem to add up, a fine point, but still. Aunt Alexandra’s grandson Francis is now her son instead, and Uncle Jack now lives in Maycomb as well as Henry Clinton, Jean Louise’s boyfriend, who is Atticus’s heir apparent in his law practice, an oddly patient man who sees his fiance only once a year.  On the second day of her visit, Jean Louise witnesses a town Council meeting, where Atticus introduces a racist speaker who rants about segregation, mongrelization and other unsavory topics. Although no one else ever speaks, Jean Louise assumes they are all rabid racists and goes into a tailspin, leading her to confront her Uncle Jack, then Henry and finally Atticus about their views. That’s the basics. In between, Jean Louise reminisces about her childhood, and in one of these flashbacks,  she, Jem and Dill playact about an evangelist’s sermon in what has to be the most boring 16 pages in the book. In another, a twelve year old Scout, uninformed about the birds and bees, is convinced she’s become pregnant from being kissed and decides to kill herself by jumping off the water tower 9 months later, the day before the baby’s born. This isn’t charming, it’s just preposterous. We never thought Scout was mentally deficient, but she would have had to be to make this nonsense believable or readable.<br/><br/>The magic of Mockingbird is gone, or perhaps hadn’t been developed yet, as we know Lee’s editor told her back then to re-write the book, concentrating on Scout’s younger days, which she did, producing the masterpiece we all know and love. The difference in the quality and style of the writing between the two books is almost enough to evoke the specter of the rumor that Lee’s friend Truman Capote was in fact a co-author of the finished Mockingbird, hotly disputed back in the day. The writing in Watchman is amateurish, clunky, and badly needs an editor. There are many issues, from character development to point of view problems, which could have been addressed, but were not, perhaps from a desire to preserve the original writing, in my opinion, a huge mistake. In what possible literary world would Atticus Finch say to his beloved daughter when she finished college, “it was high time she started shifting for herself and why didn’t she go to New York or somewhere” ? Or Uncle Jack, frustrated with Scout’s anger, backhand her in the face to the point of bloodying her nose?  Or Jean Louise herself “giggling” five minutes later over Jack’s whiskey drinking?  She may have deserved it, because this Scout, Jean Louise, isn’t an impulsive but clear-eyed child, but a woman who’s shrill, self-righteous and quite a pain in the ass. Still, in this world of Southern mores, no gentleman, particularly Uncle Jack, would ever strike a woman, especially his beloved niece, and she would scarcely be amused so soon afterwards.<br/>As for Atticus and every other white person in Maycomb now being a rabid racist, this is mostly hysterical hype which has been profitable for book sales. Apparently, people forgot this is fiction. In Watchman, Jean Louise is portrayed as near perfect, a Joan of Arc who’s always been “colorblind”, which is ridiculous. In Mockingbird, she’s who she is, a child of the segregated South, who says in regards to Tom Robinson’s treatment, “Well, Dill, after all he’s just a Negro.” Atticus is still exactly who he’s always been, a Southern gentleman of exceptional intelligence and kindness, raised with certain standards and beliefs, but now one trying to preserve the world he’s always known because he’s even more afraid of what may come. It was well meaning but wrong men just like him who unfortunately slowed the progress of civil rights but also didn’t promote the hatred of others like the Ku Klux Klan. Atticus himself explains to Scout he joined the Klan in his youth to find out who the men behind the masks were, as you should know your enemy. It was us, mainly through watching Gregory Peck personify him, who elevated Atticus to the godlike status he really didn’t deserve in the first place. He isn’t evil, and he also isn’t God.<br/><br/>To Kill a Mockingbird is a book I loved and cherished, like many others. To be able to write like Harper Lee is an aspiration many of us have held. I deeply resent what has occurred with the publication of Go Set A Watchman, from beginning to now. Lee’s representative and Harper Collins should be held accountable for this mess, and especially for tarnishing not Atticus or Scout, but Harper Lee’s legacy, and the reverence she has engendered in the literary community.  I cry foul, we deserve better.
I thought the book was okay, but Scout as a grown woman now, pretty much griped about everything.  And I mean everything.  I definitely would not read it again.  Borrow it from the library instead of purchasing it, save yourself some money.
I believe that the book could actually be interesting if it had been finished. It felt like a lot of words just thrown together.  And Scout became such an obnoxious person.  It felt like someone, not the author, wanted to make a lotof money
I did not enjoy this book as much as "To Kill a Mockingbird".  It is mostly a character study, with long, verbose passages of dialogue. Not much of a plot.  It's good if you like that sort of story, but I found it a little tedious.
So many of my friends raved about how wonderful this book was, so my expectations were very high.  I was terribly disappointed.  It might have been a better story if Ms. Lee had gone back and reworked it after the success of 'Mockingbird'.
Disappointment after all the hype!
Flabby verbose meandering nonsense
Excellent service incredible book!
This is a travesty and should have remained an unpublished draft; it only detracts from the author's brilliant TKAM. The destruction of the heroic and humane characters of a great novel have been reduced to the mundane and morally bereft.
An incredible book by a brilliant author. Atticus Finch is not a racist. He is a man striving to be politically correct in an environment he doesn't agree with. Like Mockingbird this book is timeless. As relevant today as the day she wrote it.
This book was the first attempt by Harper Lee to write about the world and characters of her later iconic book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it suffers from the pitfalls of first drafts by beginning writers: undeveloped characters, uneven story lines, and occasionally clunky writing. IMO, this book falls below the usual standard for publishing a serious novel. If it didn't have Harper Lee's name on it, I wonder if it would have been published at all.<br/><br/>Before release, this book has been controversial for a number of reasons, including the startling revelation that Atticus Finch is racist.  He and Jean Louise aka Scout have a showdown about their differing political views (it starts around page 236, if you want to get to the most interesting part of this book). I felt I was eavesdropping on a disagreement between two white Southerners, both advocates of states' rights, on the cusp of radical change in the South. If Atticus makes overtly racist comments by today's standards, Jean Louise is no paragon either. As I perceive it, neither of them believes Afro-Americans are equal to whites. Think about that.<br/><br/>Their conversation feels outdated, especially if you realize the Civil Rights Act was passed several years later in 1964. Both of them wonder if the world will end if Afro-Americans ever get their share of political and economic power. Jean Louise differs from her father by her willingness to do something and give Afro-Americans a chance. I said to myself, "Isn't this past?" --at least this debate is.<br/><br/>Another thorny problem with this book is the inconsistent characterization of Atticus Finch as compared to "Mockingbird." The racist side of Atticus Finch makes little sense to me in the context of "Mockingbird." In "Mockingbird," Atticus shows enough empathy, integrity, and courage to be the kind of person to question racism  and grow with the times. Yet in "Watchman," he's a reactionary. From that standpoint, how does a reader make sense of the stagnation and conservatism of Atticus Finch in "Watchman"? This book doesn't give you the answer, of course, because the character of Atticus Finch developed backwards from "Watchman," which was written first and set in the 1950s, to "Mockingbird," which was written afterwards and set in the 1930s. For readers, this can be a confusing and ridiculous evolution.<br/><br/>Which brings up another controversy surrounding this book: Was this book ever intended to be published by Harper Lee? I think not.<br/><br/>ADDED 8/14/15<br/><br/>I believe Watchman was written as a first draft of what later became Mockingbird. Afterwards Harper Lee worked with a fine editor, and matured as a writer and a person for the next 2 years. It looks to me like Ms Lee and her editor picked through Watchman for what they wanted to keep, then left Watchman behind to develop Mockingbird.<br/><br/>I reread Mockingbird this past week, and the differences between the two books are stunning. There were radical changes made in the characters and their relationships. The spirit and tone of Mockingbird are entirely different as well. More and more, Watchman looks like the effort of a beginning writer trying to "write what you know" (the advice commonly given to writers). That explains why Ms Lee has described a 1950s Southern small town accurately in Watchman, but never developed or resolved the issues she brings up.<br/><br/>Some positive reviewers say Watchman shows Southern racism of the 1930s "just as it was." Actually, Mockingbird shows racism far more powerfully than anything in Watchman. In Watchman, all you have is Jean-Louise's reactions and that showdown argument with Atticus. In Mockingbird, you can see (and hopefully feel) the poverty of the black church, where they cannot afford hymnbooks; the black neighborhood behind the town dump; the lynch mob before the jail; even the way black people at the trial immediately stood up and gave their seats to the white children.<br/><br/>I reread Mockingbird to find out if Atticus was really racist in that book. I wondered if I had missed something when I read the book decades ago. Atticus in Mockingbird isn't racist, by his words or actions, or by the opinions of the people who know him well (e.g., Judge Taylor, Miss Maudie). In fact, what I found heartening in Mockingbird is that other white people in the town were coming around in their attitudes about black people, finally recognizing that something was wrong.<br/><br/>I also noticed the scene in Mockingbird where Atticus backs off from enforcing Aunt Alexandra's dictates because Scout begins to cry. Atticus of Mockingbird would never have allowed Uncle Finch to whack Jean-Louise across the face, drawing blood, as happened in Watchman.<br/><br/>Fortunately, rereading Mockingbird washed the negativity and distortion of Watchman out of my head. I'll never go back to Watchman, unless it's to study the novel development of Watchman to Mockingbird (not the other way around).
So disappointing! How could Scout's uncle hit her? The uncle of Mockingbird would never have done so. I have read To Kill a Mockingbird over 20 times (to teach it to 9th graders). I do not know if I would ever read Go Set a Watchman again.
Harper Lee does not dissapoint. Comforting knowing other families grow up this way, idealizing a parent and then finding out they are not perfect, just doing the best they can, then as a child you best your parent. Wonderful message here .
A real let-down.  Very boring and racist.  Perhaps this was considered progressive in the 1950's South, but it feels like a huge waste of time now.  Obviously, Harper Lee's descendants were just trying to make a quick buck off her name.
I don't think the same person wrote the two books, *To Kill a Mockingbird* and *Go Set a Watchman.* If not, then there are a couple of possible scenarios:<br/><br/>1) Truman Capote ghostwrote *TKaM* for his friend, as a grand and glorious literary hoax among besties. Many of the passages bear his stylistic stamp. This "long-lost" MS (*GSaW*) may have been Lee's flawed first draft (and, oh, flawed it is, too many ways to enumerate) that Capote took one look at and said, "Honey, this ol' ugly toad can be a jewel if you let me fiddle with it a little."<br/><br/>2) Harper Lee did indeed write her one-hit wonder, *TKaM*, all by herself, in 1960, and somebody else (perhaps the very lawyer who "discovered" this MS, that was "missing"(??HOW???) for decades)---wrote it fairly recently. perhaps in cahoots with HarperCollins?<br/><br/>Whosoever wrote it, it's a thumpin' bad book, on its own two rickety legs. The characters (every one of them, from lowliest cameo to the central figures) are mere cartoons, cardboard characters, unlike their fully-fleshed-out, leap-off-the-page counterparts in *TKaM.*  And there are some howlingly dreadful sentences in the narrative, that (if Ms. Lee is indeed *in compos mentis*) she must be writhing to have to claim as her own:, to wit: "Every nerve in her body shrieked, then died." (p.111). Call it gut instinct, because there is no way for an ordinary reader to prove it, but I just don't think the same writer who could put tripe like this on paper could possibly have blossomed into the consummate stylist and storyteller of *TKaM,* scarcely half a decade later. The clumsy hack who pecked out *Go Set a Watchman* simply could not have been the same person who breathed shimmering life into the almost Arthurian Atticus, the ghostly, mostly invisible but achingly real "Boo" Radley, the wondrous, Puckish Dill, and even the supporting characters of wry Miss Maudie, tiresome, imperious Aunt Alexandra, and wise Calpurnia.<br/><br/>Something is rotten in the state of publishing. If I were writing a book about this whole suspicious turn of events in the literary world, I'd call it *To Smell a Rat."
Good for writing. GREAT for content.<br/>First:  Great for me because of the very personal connection.<br/>This book was about the era when I was a teenager who had left the "semi-South" for four months in the "deep South", then on to sunny Southern California.  I was eager to embrace my new world and the enlightened views I encountered.  Then...my first trip back to my "home town"--just like Scout, except that I was younger.  My Atticus was my older brother.  How could the big brother who I had always adored now appear so unreasonable, ignorant, bigoted, etc. etc???  I was crushed and returned to California feeling much as Scout felt.  I could never love him again.  It took me longer than a couple weeks vacation, but I too, had to come to terms with a human to love instead of a hero.<br/>Next:  Great for me because it gave all the arguments that were a part of the culture where I grew up.  Looking back, I can understand much of what good people were feeling, even when aligned with despicable people.  The story of the South has many things I'm sorry for, that I know were wrong.  Yet...I also know and love many of our traditions.  I think Harper did a good job of presenting the sentiments of the time.  And I liked where she left it.  For Scout to consider returning and being a part of the future changes.  Those changes did happen, and maybe are still in process.<br/>I especially recommend the book for those of us who dealt with these issues of the 50s and 60s, in the South or the "border states" even.  I also recommend the book for those who have dealt with fallen heroes in their personal lives.
What a disappointment. Not more than a First draft. It was easy to see why the manuscript was rejected initially. The publication of this novel was solely for someone's financial gain and Harper Lee's wishes should have been honored!
Joseph McBride GO SET A WATCHMAN is a fairly good, though uneven, book. It is about an adult young woman's disillusionment with her father and her town -- a rich theme. It captures the disturbing realities of the Jim Crow South. A character accuses her of having idealized her father to the point of thinking of him as God, which is what many readers of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD have done. This book is the corrective. Jean Louise's ambivalence toward her home, her family, the conventional man who wants to marry her, and her gender role are all conveyed strongly and movingly. There are some flaws in the book. Jean Louise's confrontation with her father, which is overly delayed, never is resolved in any satisfactory ways. The book just sort of stops. Her uncle slugs her, which is shocking and not dealt with adequately. Atticus never comes fully alive as a character in WATCHMAN; you have to rely on your prior knowledge of MOCKINGBIRD to sort of understand him, though the idealized portrait of him in MOCKINGBIRD starkly conflicts with this book's portrait. That conflict could be a good thing, but this book needed more work to deal with a matter of such complexity. Ironically, the childhood flashbacks, which the editor thought worthy of spinning off into another novel, are rather dull. The flashbacks to "Scout"'s adolescence are better, but the frame story is far more compelling. The distinctive Harper Lee voice is present and strong. Flannery O'Connor was right that MOCKINGBIRD is a children's book, though that's not a bad thing per se. YA books can be fine (see the works of Judy Blume). This is more a book for adults.
A little strange to read in this order after half a century.  Slow to start but the ending makes it worth while. Coming of age for a young woman and an old South.  Atticus a racist or an advocate of Tenth Amendment or all the above?
The worst book I've read in years
It should have stayed unpublished
Disappointing, uneven, unconvincing commentary on 1960's southern racial discrimination.  Upon reaching the end of this novel I immeadiately thought "That's it? Perhaps the publishers had a reason not to publish it  back then."
Vile writing by a self-loathing Southerner. Awful. Boring. Shame on this publisher for inflicting this immature, undeveloped, shrill "book" on unsuspecting readers. Don't buy it. Borrow from a library or you can have my copy.
Not so well well written as "To catch..."  I was not upset by the language or the use of colloquial words which described the scene at the time the book was written. This just didn't have the thrill of plot that I expected.
I can understand why Lee's publisher turned this book down. The dialogue was stilted, and the storyline was terrible. I do not understand how the same author could have written 2 books at the opposite ends of the quality spectrum.
I suppose my expectations were just too high. "To Kill a Mockingbird" had a huge impact on my 12 year old brain way back then. I did not care for Scout as a woman so I'm sure that colored my thinking about the entire book.
Go Set a Watchman was a fine novel, just not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  What the book really is, is a study of a young woman growing to understand that her father is not perfect.  That she still loves him, even with flaws.
Consider the world of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD about twenty years later. Jean Louise (Scout) is in her twenties; Atticus is in his early seventies; Jem has died; Calpurnia has retired.  GO SET A WATCHMAN is set during the beginning of the Civil Rights movement.<br/><br/>Jean Louise comes home to Alabama from New York City.  She learns a lot about her beloved father Atticus and isn’t happy about some of the things she learns about him.  Is Atticus really a bigoted anti-hero after all, or is he a product of his times?  As Jean Louise struggles with this question, readers must as well.<br/><br/>The characters are consistent and well-developed; I can easily imagine the adult Jean Louise as the little Scout in MOCKINGBIRD.  The style of WATCHMAN is, of course, similar to that of MOCKINGBIRD, but told through an older Jean Louise’s eyes.  Readers will need to hang on a bit with the narrative; it isn’t linear but has flashbacks to Jean Louise’s and Jem’s high school days – and mischief they found during those days.<br/>Though this novel definitely kept me engaged, I must hold at a very high four stars because when I realized that Atticus was in his seventies with Jean Louise in her twenties, I thought, “What? That’s an awfully late fatherhood!”  The reasons for Atticus’s late start toward marriage and parenthood are mentioned during the course of the novel, but I still feel that it would have been even better if Atticus hadn’t been nearly fifty by the time he fathered Jem and Jean Louise.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend (re) reading MOCKINGBIRD before reading WATCHMAN, and I see both as classics.
There is a reason this wasn't published when first written.  It does show the growth in her writing by the time she wrote Mockingbird.  Even in Watchman, she is much more effective writing about Scout as a child than as an adult.
I eagerly awaited this book's release because To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my all-time favorite reads - but it just didn't live up to my expectations. It was a good read, but I really expected more of a story from Harper Lee.
Author changed or killed main characters....didn't like it.  Was looking forward to the continuing saga of Scout and her family.  Put it on the shelf never to retrieve again.  Read "To Kill a Mockingbird" again instead.
Although I like Harper Lee's writing style, I did not find much of a plot to the story.  Lots of emotion, though, and well written emotion.  It's a decent read, but not the same calibre as To Kill A Mockingbird.  Worth reading.
I assume this is the worst rating I can give, or I would give a lower one.  What a waste of time; terrible story line; could have been edited into a 25 page short story; a marketing scam that I fell for.  You should be ashamed.
If you're buying the book thinking "To Kill a Mockingbird," save your money.  Slow and boring, it's more a travelogue of small-town south wrapped around a tedious plot. Gave up after struggling though half of the book.
In one word: LOUSY.<br/> OH, I know a slew of reviewers will acclaim it bc it is Harper Lee, and that is just what the publisher is hoping.  But, listen to one who hold an Ivy League degree in lit.  This book stinks!  I could be thoughtful and introspective and give you some cockamamie nuances-- but the fact is, it's not worth it.<br/> Had this book been published earlier, To Kill a Mockingbird would have been so less successful.  TKAM relies on the reader's faith in Atticus Finch... for 60 yrs, we have stood in awe of Atticus.  Sadly,  this plot line ruins that story, completely, and utterly.  That is surely why its publication was held off. TKAM could never have stood the test of time with this atrocious sequel.<br/>( BUT- hey,  now, with Ms.  Lee in her 90s, why not cash in on  name and 60-yr long reputation?  And cash in she is, look at the sales figures. )<br/>  GO SET A WATCHMAN should never have been published.  It is SO poorly written. There are times when Ms. Lee's focus is far off the mark, and plot segues left undeveloped.  The writing is atrocious, almost stream-of-conscience at some points.  I think this was for sure a first draft.  You've been warned.<br/>  And, as I I said, this story ruins TKAM.... the reader is left dashed and hopeless. Atticus Finch no longer worthy of our trust.  With this book, Ms. Lee KILLS an American hero.  Perhaps, if it were re-worked, better written, flushed out, it could have been something worthwhile.  Her idea is okay... but as it is. ... I  wish I could get my money back.<br/>PS:  I do not normally write reviews.
The story started well, but half way through it became preachy, boring and poorly written.  I can see why it was put to the side.  I finished it but really cared very little for the adult Scout.  I am sorry I spent the money.
It's impossible not to compare the quality of writing in this book with To Kill A Mockingbird.  Go Set A Watchman is an interesting story, but doesn't begin to come close to her first published book.  It was a disappointment.
Written before To Kill A Mockingbird, this book describes the characters we met in that book as they now are approx. 20 years later. To Kill A Mockingbird is my favourite book of all time - I have read it numerous times. There is one change in the history of Maycomb and Tom Robinson from what was told in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Because I consider it to be an important change, I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5.  Even though this story was written first,  the version in To Kill A Mockingbird is so important to both stories that I feel Harper Lee and/or the publisher should have made sure the two books were in sync on this fact.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the book is well written with excellent character development.  Some will not like it because of the disappointment in how it portrays some of the characters we came to know and love, but that is the point of the book - it is 20 years later in a very different social and political climate.  The story portrays life in a southern town in the late 1950's, just as TKAM portrayed life in the same town in the 1930's. Whether the reader likes it or not, the book describes the reality of the day.<br/><br/>The publisher was right in having Lee write and publish To Kill A Mockingbird first.  To properly understand and appreciate this book , one has to know what Scout's childhood and life was like  in Maycomb 20 years previously.  For this reason,, If you have never read or can't remember To Kill A Mockingbird, read it (or watch the movie which is very true to the book for the most part) BEFORE you read Go Set A Watchman.
I liked this book the first time I read it and I’ve read parts of it a second and third time.  It is the coming of age story of Scout who is Jean Louise.  She is 26 when she is shocked to discover that her father is not the perfect man she thought he was.  She is further shocked at the reason he takes the case of Calpurnia’s grandson who has run over and killed a white man.  Calpurnia is the Finch’s housekeeper and Jean Louise’s black stand-in mother since Jean Louise was two. It was Calpurnia who told her the things a young girl should know.<br/><br/>When Jean Louise went to see Calpurnia to tell her Atticus had taken her grandson’s case and to say she was sorry about her grandson and to offer to help if she could, Calpurnia received her with “haughty dignity” and asked “What are you all doing to us?”<br/><br/>Jean Louise tells her father what she thinks of him in a manner she thought would end the relationship but he infuriates her by saying, “As you please.”<br/><br/>It is her Uncle Jack who jolts her out of her hysteria and helps her understand that she is a bigot, “Not a big one, just an ordinary turnip - sized bigot.”  He tells her that prejudice and faith both begin where reason ends and “-it takes a certain kind of maturity to live in the South these days.”<br/><br/>There is humor in Scout’s tomboy behavior and teenage growing up years.  There  is a clear glimpse of life in a southern small town and the obliviousness of its inhabitants.<br/><br/>I hope someone finds a manuscript about Uncle Jack hidden away in Harper Lee’s files.
Disappointing.  Didn't finish it.  Thought I should own the book as I have been a follower of Harper Lee for years even though she had only published one book; I knew of her through my sorority affiliation and admired her.
Excellent insight into the thinking of Southerners in the 50's.  Even helps understand Conservative views today and perhaps why the South remains so Conservative.  I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it readily.
I don't think this is a book.  It's a draft.  A seemingly random set of ideas.  I'm afraid this will tarnish Mockingbird.  How can Atticus be the great hero of Mockingbird now that we know his true character from Watchman?
I enjoyed the book but when I finished it I had a lot of questions that were left unanswered.  Did  Jean Louise stay there--did she go back to New York-what about Henry?  As I said, I enjoyed the book but so my questions.
Very disappointing after re-reading To Kill A Mockingbird. Reeks of taking something that was partly finished and publishing it to make money based on the author's name and reputation. Regretted purchasing and reading it.
Not her Best Work.  I was disappointed.  The volume ties you To Kill a Mockingbird, historically  with Atticus's family, but it leaves you guessing and wanting  more.  You can see why, it was never released by the author
I still love Atticus.  He did something brave and did not complain.  I learn now it was not as easy of a choice as I thought it had been.  This man was defended because it was his right and he was innocent as any reader would surmise.  Atticus did not apparently see him as a man like himself but like a man not as good as himself.  His lopsided views are this:  live here-but not next door,  have children-but put them in another school,  have political views-but only a few of you can be political, and have freedom and power-but less than me and other whites.  I am upset with Atticus.  It makes my stomach hurt.  These views are by no means dead either.  I agree with the criticism that nothing really happens.  The plot is largely Jean Louise's thoughts.  I agree that I won't name my son Atticus.  I agree that it left disappointment where I wanted another day with a old friend.  One of the stars in my review is for the hot button topic discussions I have had, heard, and hope will happen.  People are suffering now and many don't see it because a set of manners have been slowly negotiated and adopted by people of all color to handle this topic.  It looks nice and equal.  Is it?  My other star is for the true to life struggle of a child of a single parent seeing them for the first time.  How wonderful it must have been to be raised by him.  How awful it must have been to see him old and bigoted.  Read if you will but if I were you I would wait for a yard sale or used book store.  It will be cheaper and no one will read it twice.
I loved it!  I also understand why Harper Lee thought it wouldn't sell at that time.  The title Go Set a Watchman was most appropriate because we all need to stay informed and know what others are thinking and planning.
Is there a spot for zero stars?
I'm not sure what I  expected, but this book satisfied me (a southern girl who went North).  I found it to be short, sweet and right on the mark. Don't listen to others.  Read it yourself and draw your own conclusions.
The publisher advertised Go Set a Watchman as a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. Indeed, Go Set a Watchman was actually a draft--a manuscript that eventually became To Kill a Mockingbird.  It was disingenuous at best.
Disappointing. Except for the times when there are childhood flashbacks. The writing is mediocre, the characters are not interesting, and there is no comparison with "To Kill a Mockingbird. It feels forced. Sorry.
"Go Set a Watchman" is good story telling in that grand Southern tradition. It is not "To Kill a Mockingbird," but it is like having a long visit with an old, dear friend. Not the same, but comforting.
A good read but not as good as the first book. I was not horrified by it as so many seemed to be. It seemed true to the times and the fact that perfection is not reality. In fact Scout comes off as the intolerant one.
After reading Go Set a Watchman, I reread To Kill  a Mockingbird.  In my opinion, publishing Watchman  was a triple malfeasance.  The biggest offence would appear to have been against Harper Lee, who steadfastly did not publish any part of  Watchman for over half a century.  How awful to violate her literary masterpiece at this time.<br/> The second injustice was to eviscerate the iconic characters of Mockingbird.  Through Mockingbird Harper Lee was speaking to her readers for empathy, using her writer's skills no differently than the Freedom Riders of that era.  In Mockingbird,  Atticus was immovable in his stance to protect and defend the law.  He repeatedly stated "put yourself in the other's shoes". His character was a moral beacon  that became greater than a fictional character; and it is unbelievable that that the new Atticus character  would evolve into a schemer against all that he had previously defended.<br/>There are places in Watchman where we get the nostalgic flavor  of Mockingbird; and in fact  there are a few paragraphs of lofty thinking, which are probably unused remnants of Mockingbird.  From those pieces it seems to this writer that someone padded and plagiarized the characters to develop an otherwise inconsequential melodrama.  The third fraud is on the public who spent money based on false expectations.<br/>I had preordered a Kindle Watchman for myself and a hardcopy for my daughter.  I returned the hardcopy.  Harper Publishing, what has happened to your standards?
Boring and tedious is the only way I can describe this novel. Basically, a southern-born 26 year old from New York named Jean-Louise visits her Alabama family once a year, and moans about racism. She goes on a few dates with a boy she knew from high school, a low-class white kid who became a lawyer thanks to the GI Bill and is now her father's protege. As for her father, he's a crabby old southern small-town lawyer who lives with his sister, who hasn't lived with her husband in decades.<br/><br/>There's no exciting dynamic to this book. She mentions lots of characters in flashbacks, but they're no in the story. Her brother Jem, the football star, is dead. Dill, a close childhood friend, now lives in Italy. Jean-Louise' life seems pretty dull. She doesn't talk about her life in NY either. If you're looking to see what happened to all those people that the author created in To Kill A Mockingbird, you will be disappointed. Boo Radley isn't mentioned, neither are the Ewells, the Cunninghams, or miss Maudy.<br/><br/>This book is what Harper Lee wrote first, and her editor advised her that it was a downer. She told the aspiring writer to focus on the childhood of the narrator, and beef up the undertone of racial prejudice that the protagonist complains so much about. The result is now a classic that sells by the truckload every year, and is read in school all over the USA. If it hadn't been for that editor advising the young Harper to scrap this novel, then Harper Lee would have been forgotten.
If Harper Lee had lead with this book, I don't think she'd be the icon she is today. To Kill a Mockingbird was so much better in every way. I kept hoping this book would get better, but the ending was anti-climactic.
I read this book only to compare it to "To Kill a Mockingbird," but found it boring, wordy, and lacking in the qualify and finesse as compared to Mockingbird. But I still felt I had to read it just to know...
With this book we can now add Harper Lee to the school prominent Southern authors. The recognition of a southern black community's  surpressed  status and the resulting response by the middle class whites is classic.
The end was very weak,  You could tell a young person wrote this with some serious issues in her life.  It was almost a "going of age ".  I would recommed  it to my reading friends, so we could talk about it.
***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS<br/><br/> Twenty-six year old Jean Louise Finch returns to Maycomb as the town is embroiled in the growing pains of the civil rights movement, only she doesn’t know it.  Scout was raised to be color-blind but ironically still sees the world, and her father, in black and white.  Atticus Finch is no longer the robust young man he was in To Kill a Mockingbird, but is now arthritic.<br/>Continuing to practice law with the help of his protege and Scout’s erstwhile boyfriend, Henry Clinton, Atticus survives.  He lives with his sister, Alexandra, but something else is different.  Scout learns that he’s become a member of the Maycomb City Council; the council that is trying to respond to the newly formed NAACP as well as to protect their southern heritage through segregation.<br/>Seeking the counsel of her Uncle Jack, who seems oddly prescient about our society, Scout wrestles with the questions:  Has Atticus changed?  Has Maycomb changed?  Or has Jean Louise changed?  It’s through these conversations that the reader comes to understand a bit more not just about Atticus, but the forces that combined to create him.<br/> Ms. Lee has written what is certain to become another classic as she probes the theme of the death of our perceptions of our parents.  The story line is not as well-defined as To Kill a Mockingbird as this book is more esoteric.  Whether you love, hate, or are indifferent toward Atticus is irrelevant, the fact is that these characters leap off these pages.
I must say I didn't enjoy this book as much as the famous To Kill a mocking Bird however at our book club discussion we really were of the opinion that if you read the original book then don't read Go set a watchman
This is a disheartening book which justifies the KKK, racism, class distinctions, and the status quo of Southern cities. If this had been Harper Lee's only book, no one would be naming their child "Atticus".
It's should be a crime what they did to Harper Lee. Don't read/purchase this book. It is crystal clear she was taken advantage of. There are word for word paragraphs in this and to Kill a Mocking Bird. It's a shame.
If this book had had an editor, it probably would have rated a fifth star.  It is not as compelling as to kill a mockingbird, but it is still one of the most thought provoking novels I have read in the recent past.
Go Set a Watchman was more hype than substance.  I was quite disappointed.  Appeared to be a story line about "Scout's" meandering through life.  Absolutely no comparison to "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Mediocre.  If I weren't already invested in the characters, I may not have finished it.  Some long and boring passages, some lively, entertaining ones.  I don't regret purchasing it, however, and am glad I read it.
Others before me here have given great synopses so I'm going to skip that part.  Suffice to say I understand why Harper Lee kept this one on the back burner and I think it was pure evilness that drove her lawyer to publish it.  My heart breaks for Ms. Lee and I can only hope her current illness keeps her from ever knowing the truth of what's been done.<br/><br/>Personally, and I know it's the elephant in the room, I have a hard time believing that Ms. Lee even wrote this one.  Perhaps she had an outline somewhere and someone else decided to fill in the blanks - I don't know.  Or maybe she wrote this and kept it as a learning experience.<br/><br/>Go Set A Watchman does not even come close to To Kill A Mockingbird.  It's not even in the same category. It meanders, it sputters, it bobs and weaves and never once does it touch down.  If you did not know the characters from TKAM you'd have no idea of what planet you'd landed on or why you were there.  This is one of the reasons I find it hard to believe that this was written first.  A first novel is where you normally develop your characters.  The characters in Watchman have no substance, no bones, no heart, no soul.  They are simply wooden puppets no one's ever met before and no one will ever want to meet again.<br/><br/>So heartbreaking that this saw the light of day.
This was supposed to be Harper Lee's first book.  But if I hadn't read To Kill A Mockingbird, I wouldn't have understood the previous relationship between Jean Louise (Scout) and Atticus.  I think that was essential to this story.  This conflict within Scout about her father really needed the reader to know of the relationship they had and the strong character/moral compass of Atticus .  Jean Louise came across as a self-centered child at times instead of the endearing, free spirited, tomboy  Scout that made everyone love her.  Jem and Dill were not characters in this book, although they were both mentioned.  Again, without having previously read TKAM, these references had no place in this story, since neither boy was given any depth in this story.  Calpurnia was also barely mentioned, and when she was, she was not the same loving housekeeper of the other story.  Then there was Hank, whom I don't remember from TKAM, but was treated as if the reader should know him.<br/>I didn't feel this had the humor or "personality" that TKAM had.  Only one or two moments in this book that I felt were equal to TKAM.<br/>There was a lot of narrative that felt almost like preaching.  There were a few passages in Watchman that were used almost directly in TKAM.  I can truly see why an editor told her to re-think this book and work on details.  I really think To Kill a Mockingbird has to be read first in order to appreciate this book at all.  Not as heartwarming as I had hoped it would be.
It was hard to believe this book was written first.  The fuss over Aticus being a racist is a reality of the times.  Scout is pretty brutal with her criticism and disappointment in her father.  I enjoyed the book.
Scout's reflections on her childhood are the most interesting parts of the book.<br/>It was an okay read but a poor relation to Harper Lee's masterpiece novel, 'To Kill A Mockingbird'.<br/>I expected a lot more.
It was a tedious read.  The story was a good one, but not a great one.  It lacked the "big bang" ending. It simply ended. I also thought the long conversations between characters was generally superficial.
This story all came together in the last chapters.  Very powerful writing and sophisticated for the time period.  Enjoyable reading that makes you ponder your own morals and beliefs. Worth a read and a discussion!
GSAW simply provides the reader with the author's perspective regarding the Civil Rights movement.  Atticus Finch believes in state's rights & resents outsiders like the ACLU & others, whom he sees, forcing the South to change.  He understands that change will come eventually but he is uncomfortable with its present pace.  Meanwhile, Alexandra continues to live in the glory of the South's past gentility.  Henry Clinton, uncomfortable as he might be, realizes that in order to survive professionally in this environment he has to go along to get along.  Jean Louise, after spending time in the North, returns to Maycomb & discovers, much to her dismay, that her childhood memories are being challenged by present day realities.  Finally, Dr. Jack Finch engages Jean Louise in a Socratic exchange to help her understand what is happening to Atticus & the South.  Dr. Finch, unlike a Southern gentleman, even strikes Jean Louise in an effort to knock some sense into her.  In the end, Jean Louise understands that by returning home she could become a part of the change that the South will eventually experience.<br/><br/>GSAW provides a view of a Southern family's struggle to reconcile Scout's youthful & innocent anecdotal past with the present day reality of the Civil Rights movement.  Critics & other readers may be disappointed with Lee's effort.  For this reader, Harper Lee makes her point but for others who are expecting a reprise of TKAMB's impact, they have been & will be disappointed.
The main character, Jean Louise Finch ('Scout' in the second book, daughter of Atticus Finch), was not fully created as a three-dimensional person in this story. In this story she is 26 and has spent the past 5 years in New York working on a career (that is never described, and she never has any thoughts of romance in the big city, nor memories of interactions with girlfriends, nor accomplishments with her career).  She has been gone from her home town for 5 years and picks up with her old beau as if there was no absence.  She has a reunion with her old school girlfriends in Maycomb, Alabama, and there is no reminiscing or gossip of people from her high school years. It gave me the feeling that she was a two-dimensional character dropped into a scene.<br/><br/>Jean Louise is 'color blind' (in her words) and only sees 'people', not 'white or colored'.  When she discovers that her father and family are bigots, she is outraged. Personally, I thought she would be sadly disappointed at that point and the story would illustrate that one can never truly go home again.  But the author took another turn and had Jean Louise become a petulant child angry at her father for not being the high-minded person she thought he was. Her uncle then proceeds to explain her that bigotry in the South is justified through a convoluted logic that is difficult for anyone in the 21st century to follow.<br/><br/>This story was not published 50 years ago for a reason. I could never recommend it.
This book was very hard to follow because it was very scattered and i could never understand where it was going.  Even the end left me with "and that's it?" type of feeling.  I do not recommend buying it.
This book is bound, in time, to be celebrated as the powerful “pre-written sequel” that it is. Amazing that she spawned TKaM from only 2 or 3 paragraphs in GSaW!<br/><br/>Jean Louise is as quick-to-judge as she was as a child: ears closed, mind made up. Her idealism and values form the backbone of the book, for sure. But she lacks wisdom, perspective, and a willingness to listen (like many 26 year olds).<br/><br/>Don't get the vapors worrying about Atticus: many reviewers have missed Lee's faithfulness to Atticus' personal character because they seem to be caught up in the surface dialogue. I would have failed 9th grade lit if my character analysis in TKaM had been as shallow as some professional reviewers' are of Atticus in GSaW.<br/><br/>The timing of the release is another reason the book is powerful: the topic of racism serves as a placeholder for many of today’s hot topics like gay marriage, the enforcement of federal immigration law and federal marijuana statutes, sanctuary cities, and The Affordable Care Act. This is a book that provokes thinking on our federalist system of laws, who gets to decide issues of great legal and moral importance, and what “liberty” means.<br/><br/>There is a lot of disagreement between Washington and states outside Washington. We probably see Atticus through the same prism we see these issues through. There are earnest, decent people on both sides of these incredibly complex issues. Are you listening? Or are you like Scout?
The value of this story is seeing how it evolved into Mockingbird.  The Atticus of Watchman vs. The Atticus of Mockingbird--- can he be one and the same?<br/><br/>I wonder which story is more autobiographical?
This was the most boring book I think I have ever read.  I am 3/4 through it and do not think I can stand to finish it. I can see why it was never published before.  Too much hipe for such a disappointing book.
Wow, I wouldn't say what a disappointment, but what a difference from TKAM.  always enjoyed TKAM it was an adventure captivating, found myself skimming over Watchman, grasping key parts and waiting for the end.
There are a number of things that need to be said to start with:<br/>1.  This is possibly a first draft, that being said, there is quality there.  Also it was unmistakably written by Harper Lee.<br/>2.  Time period.  Mockingbird is set in the 1930's.  Watchman is set in the middle 1950's.  Two very different time periods are covered in both books.<br/>3.  Voice:  Mockingbird is written in the first person, a child.  Watchman is written in the third person.  This is important because the viewpoint of a child is much different than an adult uninfluenced third person.<br/><br/>With these taken into consideration let’s consider Atticus Finch's attitude from Mockingbird to Watchman.  My contention is there is no change just the point of view from a very young girl to an adult.  In the first book Scout asked about the KKK and Finch described it as a political organization.<br/>In the second book Jean Louise in a discussion with her uncle stated the reason Atticus was a member of that group was to know the local people that participated in that infamous group.<br/><br/>I think the highlight in the book was during Jean Louise conversation with her uncle, when he has her define a bigot and he proceeds to prove to her that she not her father was guilty of that and proceeds to prove it by explaining Atticus's actions.<br/><br/>Not as good a book as Mockingbird but an enlightening read.  I recommend it, but re-read Mockingbird first with a very critical eye.
It's definitely not as good as Mockingbird but does have several good parts. It will probably not be one of the top books other than in sales. It really makes me wonder who helped Harper Lee write Mockingbird.
I loved To Kill A Mockingbird growing up but found Go Set A Watchman disappointing.  It was not what I thought it would be and really was upsetting to a point.  Just didn't have the spunk that Mockingbird had.
I did not care for this book at all. Something just seems odd that this book comes out now. I would probably give it about  6 out of 10. Sorry that I purchased this book. Perhaps my expectations were too high.
Should never have been published without editorial assistance,  Her value as a world class writer has been ruin. Sometimes it's best to leave things alone.  In this case, that would have been a wise decision.
I admit that I was apprehensive about this book, mainly due to the fact that the publicity surrounding it in the past days has not been positive. To Kill a Mockingbird has always been my favorite and I wasn’t ready to have the characters I loved so dearly shattered. I made the firm resolution before I started reading that I would not be influenced by the reviewers, I would read this as objectively as possible.<br/>I accept what it is and read it with that in mind. It might change your view on TKAM but that is not a bad thing. I was wondering what would've happened if this book was published in 1960 and not Mockingbird. I think it would've a huge impact on American literacy and on racial issues, civil rights movements just as it happened with Mockingbird. I enjoyed discovering these characters again, the town and the history. Trying to stay spoiler-free here, but that dialogue between Scout and Atticus at the end, I'm sure that happened a lot in the South back then, and I'm sure it still happens, today.<br/>I enjoyed this as much as Mockingbird, in some ways more so. From a literary standpoint, this isn’t in the same category as her first novel, which was a masterpiece. But it is as well written and Lee’s humor and descriptive talent shines through at various points throughout the novel. I just thought someone really shouldn’t give one star for a book just because you read a few articles about the controversy around its publication.
I enjoyed every moment that I spent reading this book.It was truly of that time period,and hard to believe that it was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird". So many loose ends were tied up for me.
Like many of my generation, I read "To Kill A Mockingbird," in junior high English class. Atticus Finch was the father I wished I'd had, rational, compassionate, well-educated, and non-violent. I, of course, own the movie and have watched it several times in addition to periodically doing something I never do -- re-read a book.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't expect "Go Set a Watchman" to live up to its predecessor.  That would be a Herculean task.  On the other hand, I had to read the book for myself.<br/><br/>Jean Louise (aka Scout) is twenty-six now. She's gone to college and gotten herself a job in New York City.  When she returns for a two-week summer vacation after the Brown v. Board of Education decision by the Supreme Court, she discovers a much different man than she (and this reader) believed her father to be.<br/><br/>Can she -- and those of us who have seen Atticus Finch as a hero and father figure resolve our "childhood" images of the man with those we see now as adults?  That's the big question here.  What happens when we grow up and we discover that our childhood heroes have feet of clay?  The book addresses the relationship of a maturing child with that of an aging father.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" is a hard read.  If you don't want your images tarnished, don't read it.  On the other hand, if you want to see how "Scout" grows up, read it for her.<br/><br/>R. Kyle, November 2015
To Kill a Mockingbird Bird is one of my favourite books and I was unsure about reading Go Set a Watchman. And as it turned out It was a very disappointing read...hard to believe it was from the same author.
Found the first part of the book very boring and the second part somewhat less boring.<br/>Do not see what all of the talk is about Atticus being a racist.  To Kill a Mockingbird is<br/>infinitely better.
beautifully written. I've always enjoyed the way Harper Lee wrote. I especially like how she captured the very real issues people face even today; and showed that life is complex, there are no easy answers.
This was meant to be a draft.
When you read this, evaluate the story yourself. I was mislead by some of the reviews I read first. Be sure you read the last chapters very carefully. Things are not always what they appear to be at first.
I had to read this because I so loved Mockingbird and because it was MY suggestion for book club long before all the hoopla started. Sadly, I wish I had suggested we re-read Mockingbird. There is a reason that this book was first rejected by the publisher and while it's not horrible, it is a great disappointment when compared to Mockingbird. So, if you are going to read it, don't compare it to Mockingbird (good luck with that). The writing is not great and it begs the question of why this was published now, when Harper Lee is aging and in questionable health. As for the content of the book, if you have read Mockingbird and idolized Atticus for one second of your literary life, you will feel like you have been lied to by Honest Abe Lincoln himself. Because of the publicity that began madly swirling around this book just after its publication, it would have been impossible to escape knowledge of the crushing blow of Scout's realization about her father's way of dealing with the Civil Rights Movement. Maybe this is considered good writing to catch the reader so appallingly unaware? If so, it's the only positive thing that I can think of to say as there is no real character development to speak of, no dialogue worthy of mention and in my case, no feeling of satisfaction when the reading was done.<br/>My hope is that Harper Lee actually wanted this book published and that it was not published for the benefit of her caregivers.
I found Scout's discussions with Atticus and her uncle to be laborious.  I disliked the ending leaving Scout's resolution to her life up in the air. All in all I wish this book had remained unpublished.
There's no way that this is exclusively Harper Lee's writing. Significant tonal shifts, with entire passages feeling like they were written in 2012. Full disclosure, I haven't even been able to finish it.
This book is half the book as mockingbird. Loved the same characters but was more difficult to interpret their thoughts. One chapter above all stands out. The scene of Jean Louise and Atticus falling out.
Considering this was a first novel, I thought it was done very well.  You did have to keep reminding yourself when this book was the written and climate of the country, in particular, the south on things like segregation, integration, and the NAACP.  This book was written before my birth, and although I grew up not in the South, but northern, MD, the climate when I was a child, though not quite as severe, the basic attitudes among most Anglo Saxons was:  Negroes are fine, just so they knew their place.  It would be difficult for a child born in the 90s or the 21st century to understand this book.  When I was growing up in the early 60s, MLK was considered among my mother and her friends not as a hero, but as a 'trouble making n*****.'  To Kill a Mockingbird was about a southerner's fight against the status quo.  Watchman is about a young hero finally having to realize that her father is just that, part of the status quo.  I found the book interesting and it flowed smoothly.  However, I am glad Harper Lee's publisher saw that this particular book didn't really 'grab' the reader.  Although this was a good book, because TKAM was so controversial and time relevant, it was a great book.  As I recall, the movie was done in the 60s and I believe set in that time, the actual book took place in 1935, so Lee had to do a lot of editing to come up the timeless classic, To Kill a Mockingbird.  Both were great reads.
Good but not as intimidating, tense, moral as first.  The surprise disclosed in this book has disappointed many PC people, but it is real and exists and you don't change it with flag ceremonies.  In my way of thinking, the books should have been written vice versa,  that is, Mockingbird being the second book.  It makes the consciousness and fortitude even more honorable and significant.  I have difficulty with Scout in this book who is surprised by the temperament and community mores... you do not live in a home with educated, talkative people and not know basic traits as those examined here.<br/><br/>Scout is a little spoiled and uppity herself and should recognized the raising she received was enough to create her own character, so that she could walk away from the poison environment which was her father*s home all his life.  One generation is now cleanse, education and home raising succeeds in creating a better person in the next generation which is really all one can expect realistically.  To hell with all the adults and juvenile delinquents, they are lost and a loss to throw money at.... educate and create teachers, who can make a change is a child*s life, educate so the child can read about life outside the town limits.  Educate a child in such a way as to create knowledge, but also create curiosity with an open mind.<br/><br/>But the book doesn't go there, lol... sorry for the diversion.<br/><br/>Enjoy.
Definitely not up to "To Kill a Mockingbird" standards.  I am in a book club and we read this book for our last meeting and we all had the same opinion about the book.  I wouldn't recommend it.
The story made me laugh, cry and want to continue turning pages. I still love Scout. I cared for the characters and the outcome. Wonderful insights into human nature. What more could I ask from a book?
The book was OK. It was slow moving for me and too much swearing. It was like she just put the cuss words in her writing to take up space. To Kill a Mockingbird was so much better than Go Set a Watchman.
Critics have commented negatively about the ending but I felt it showed the psychology of "keeping your friends close and your enemies closer." but maybe I'm pollyannish about Atticus' character.
The greatest value of this novel is it disabuses readers of the notion that "Mockingbird" was a good book in the first place.<br/>Beyond the awkward writing, nonexistent plot, paper thin characters, and long preachy speeches in lieu of dialogue there is a profound moral weakness at the center of this book. It is an apologetic for white supremacist attitudes, it entertains the notion that the fruits of bigoted segregation are a reasoned position of thoughtful men whose paternalism is understandable in the misunderstood context of southern identity. it invests the casual racism of Atticus Finch with an undeserved sense of decency because his motivations are somehow pure. What it reveals most of all is that Mockingbird is a novel meant to assuage white liberals of any complicity in the social and economic system that intentionally deprived fellow citizens of their rights and opportunities simply on the basis of their skin color.<br/>About five years ago Malcolm Gladwell did a pretty fair takedown of Atticus in a reappraisal he wrote for the New Yorker magazine. Read in the context of this book one has to wonder how this character ever acquired his status in the American imagination.<br/>But content and ideology aside this is just a pretty weak novel that a knowledgable editor rightly rejected almost 60 years ago. It would have been better if it had remained unpublished.
Poor Harper Lee.  Her one masterpiece, probably read by every high school student in America, not only had a fabulous plot, but also exquisite writing,  Even at age 59, I can remember the author's description of the sweltering Alabama heat that I read at age 17.  Unfortunately, Harper Lee was either tricked or pressured into publishing the mediocre novel "Go Set A Watchman" which will forevwer downgrade her in public opinion as a good writer by numerous notches, but also brand her in her old age as a racist. Many have heard how the description of Scout Finch's father changes from hero for racial justice for racist in "Watchman", but the author joins him as well. She relentlessly describes the black race as inferior and childlike and just not quite at the supposed esteemed "white level."  Unfortunately, the esteemed "white level" is so boring and provincial that you wonder how any human being could survive the boredom of living in the tiny Alabama town depicted in both novels.  We have tee totalling Aunt Alexandra, who still wears a corset and worries, like most provincial small town inhabitants, what the neighbors think.  Then there is boring Uncle Jack, still fighting the Civil War.  To top it all off is the new racist version of the narrator's father who the author manages to portray sympathetically in his disgusting bigotry.
This is a first draft. Had the author and an editor put in some time in expanding as needed and paring down as needed, it could have been a fantastic book. Sad that a fantastic story was so poorly done.
It was written during a different era in southern history and in my opinion was reflective of that period.  It probably would have been a better read had it had more editing for sentence structure, etc.
Interesting read. Spent time going between Watchman and Mockingbird comparing and contrasting the stories.<br/>Loved Dr. Finch's explanation to Jean Louise about the connection between her and Atticus.
I LOVED 'To kill a mockingbird'. I rate it as one of my Best Novels ever. Harper Lee managed to wrap a captivating story around big, human, real-life issues in an empathetic and intelligent manner. It made me think; delight in the way she'd packaged the words; and come out at the other end different, moved, shifted. As a result, I couldn't wait for Go Set a Watchman. I pre-ordered it, that's how excited I was.<br/><br/>My anticipation soon turned to dismay as I started reading. In fact, I stopped a quarter of the way through. I'm sure that the academics and 'experts' will be rolling their eyes at this stage - because clearly I'm not capable of appreciating the literary genius she is. But my take is that there's a reason her editor, way back then, advised her to do a second novel (which was published first). The editor must have realised her potential, while understanding that her writing and packaging still needed a lot of polishing and crafting.<br/><br/>Many authors have astounding first novels. Only to disappoint with the second or third. I believe Harper Lee was destined to have a ground-breaking second novel.<br/><br/>'Go set a watchman' isn't in the same league as TKaMB. And that the reason it was never published while Harper Lee was alive is because she knew this. And I, personally, am sad that her legacy has been sullied. To me, it feels like commercially-driven greed from third parties.
A fine first-draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, but not much else. Interesting to English majors and people who want to see another side of Harper Lee's writing, but I wouldn't recommend it to most folks.
I bought this the day it came out and forced myself to read half of it. Got so tired of reading about childhood games that I put it down and never picked it back up. I don't know, maybe got a bad copy.
Worth reading.....I see why lee"s editor told her to write about scout"s childhood.....the account of Scout, Jem and Dill and the church revival, the baptism and the holy ghost was really good!
The audio book, as performed by Reese Witherspoon, is well done. (I fear this is a setup for a movie version.) My review goes downhill from here. The initial chapters are pure Lee. Snappy, resiliant and accessible character sketches. Time and place, well drawn. But oh, my, from there? The book repeats the same themes ad nauseum. Scout doesn't fit in, we get that. The town is tradition-bound. OK, twice is enough so why a constant? Her Aunt disaproves of her, over and over and over. She is and isn't interested in Hank but feels marriage to him is expected so she considers/unconsiders, constantly. His is the least compelling character sketch, yet he is the springboard for much of the story. So many flashbacks we keep hoping for a punch line. One never appears. And then we get to the diatribes, lectures, inappropriate intellectualisms from her uncle (which Lee would never have writen) and alas, errors in the timeline. Harper Lee would not have used the term "Blacks" at the supposed time of this novel's creation. My opinion? The bare bones of a story was found and puffed out by a lesser writer for the express purposes of leveraging TKMB for scads of money for those who publish and promote. Ms. Lee, recluse that she is, could not possibly want the attention she so studiously avoided all her life. I think this book is a hoax, and except for the first few chapters, is poorly written and provides us with nothing other than controversy. There was no story telling here.
I didn't finish reading it, it was so boring.  I guess having read To Kill A Mockingbird so many times and it never got boring....I was expecting something just as good.  But "Watchman" isn't!
I'm not sure what the author was trying to accomplish. Many times the characters appeared to be delivering random and rambling speeches instead of conversation.  The book had a rough draft feel to it.
this is overhyped and tremendously disappointing.  how this was supposed to be prequel' to To Kill a Mockingbird' is beyond me.  there seems to be no connection between the characters, even over time.
It's interesting to read Harper Lee's original take on Scout, Atticus, et al. Can't say I was any the less taken with Atticus' character than in the original published version of To Kill A Mockingbird
I really wish this had never been published.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" is my favorite book of all time and I this just destroyed much of the good feelings that I had from that wonderful story.
I completely agree with "Vanessa"'s review of GSAW. She worded my feelings, opinion, and thoughts exactly; I could have never expressed in words what she did; kudos to Vanessa and her review!
It's hard to live up to a literary legend, but this book does a really good job of holding its own. I really enjoyed it, and am not disappointed with the way things turned out in the end. Read it!
3.5 stars<br/>I don't think I would have read this if my book club hadn't selected it, since I'm not convinced Harper Lee wanted it published. That being said, I'll approach the review from two angles.<br/><br/>First, the writing itself. Apparently this is a first draft. That would explain the lack of flow at times, the inconsistent structure, and the rambling flashbacks. I would have liked more active scenes with Jean Louise and her father. Plus, I didn't feel Atticus's character was developed much at all. But again, with more revision, I suspect these things would have been addressed.<br/><br/>As for the thematic elements, the premise centers around the The Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision and the NCAAP's involvement in Maycomb, Alabama. It's no spoiler we learn Atticus is racist. But I finished the book thinking the whole lot was prejudiced. Jean Louise was just more polite and less overt with hers than her father and the rest of the community was. Not to mention the classism. But it was written mid-century, and I guess its conclusion has to be taken as such. But I thought the issue of learning her father--a man she'd idolized--was not who she thought he was, was well explored.<br/><br/>It was an okay read. But were I new to both books, I'd recommend reading To Kill A Mockingbird first. Go Set a Watchman risks tainting one's view of Mockingbird otherwise.
This is a book that should have been published 50 years ago.  Instead, apparently, the publisher’s minions chose to extract a feel-good story about a selfless and honorable southern lawyer.  It made a good novel and movie and a lot of money.  But the most powerful aspect of this story was not told until now, the tale of how even an honorable man can be persuaded, maybe coerced, into becoming a stereotypical white supremacist.  Maybe the publication of this book in the early 1960s would have alerted more people to the coming Second Southern Rebellion and its sources of power.  Because the Klan was never the power behind this rebellion; it was the White Citizens Councils, composed of men like Atticus Finch who only wanted to keep their way of life, controlled by those prominent white men.  The echoes of their voices resonate today, usually minus the N-word, in the speeches of groups like the Tea Party.  Plus ca change, plus c’est la meme chose.<br/>Although I thought this was a novel with a very powerful message, I was disappointed with the ambiguity at the end.  Like the character Scout, I left the Deep South after college before the development of the Second Rebellion, but I could never accept what I would have to have become to go back and be comfortable.  Maybe she didn’t either.  I just wish Watchman had been published earlier and there had been a third novel.
I enjoyed this book in spite of the controversy surrounding it.  I found it interesting to see how Harper Lee transitioned this book into To Kill A Mockingbird.  It was nice to visit Maycomb again.
In comparison to Harper Lee's masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman is disappointing. However, the novel has some thought-provoking turns and some character development that deserves mention. While Atticus appears to be less than perfect in this work and thus a bit more human, his silent acceptance of the bigotry of fellow Maycombians is hard to swallow, even though he couches it in terms of "reality" and "practicality." It's hard to believe that the heroic Atticus Finch of Mockingbird would tolerate such talk. His vehement opposition to the NAACP, even if he genuinely believed that their approach and methods were too radical and progressive for the American Negro, seems out of character; on the other hand, it does show his profound thought and thorough determination to see the whole picture and walk in someone else's shoes - a major theme in Mockingbird. Scout's character is understandable in her hotheadedness and ranting, but her rants become wearisome. The plot with her boyfriend is more a distraction than anything. Aunt Alexandra is a believable, human character as is Uncle Jack, and perhaps the best relationship in this book is the one between Uncle Jack and Scout. Overall, the book is worth reading, but it misses the masterful artistry, the purposeful, sophisticated language, and the suspense of Mockingbird.
Harper Lee's editor did a wonderful job for "To Kill A Mockingbird."  This earlier piece is interesting from a biographical perspective on Harper Lee but not nearly as rich as the classic.
The book starts slowly and for awhile you don't know where Lee is going with this- but she is such a good writer you don't care!  Got some unexpected belly-laughs out of this book also.  Loved it.
Yes, I know this was a draft and not a sequel. Yes, the writing isn't impeccable, but there were several parts of the book that were powerful and emotional. The movie version of To Kill a Mockingbird was incredible and brought the characters to life. Envisioning those depictions from the movie while reading the book made it even more powerful. If you weren't familiar with the characters before reading this book it may have been a two star book. While I too became disillusioned with Atticus, I also realized that I had depicted him as the perfect moral compass from Mockingbird. The book does an excellent job of casting that aside, but it doesn't make Atticus bad. It makes him human. While ignorant and misguided, Atticus still has the same good heart as his treatment of people demonstrates. His intentions are well intended, regardless of how misguided. The book also resonates of the same issues that are hot buttons now such as race and bigotry, but also the power of the Federal Government, the Supreme Courts rulings and the constitution, the failure of the legislature, and individuals lack of knowledge of history and the founding of our country. It also discusses the need for understanding and the bigotry of both sides of an argument when there is only shouting and no listening. Scout found her conscience (watchman) in the end as we all should.
The novel is fine until the end. I enjoyed re-visting Jean Louise, my favorite literary character. SPOILER: But the end isn't just bad; it's offensive. Jean Louise's uncle slaps her hard, twice, enough to cause swelling and bleeding. And yet, we are to believe that he "slapped some sense into her," because hitting a woman in her twenties causes her to have an epiphany? The Scout I know would have clocked that patronizing old man, as he deserves. I was really rooting for her in the end, and then she caved, totally. And we're supposed to believe it's because she realizes her father isn't perfect? Right. Go set a watchman, indeed. Scout Finch, as any close reading of Mockingbird will tell you, stands as a character who champions women's rights where gender equality is concerned; she is a young woman who would never stand for abuse from a male; she is physically strong and mentally alert, always. And yet this novel ends with her being slapped hard, twice, and then thanking the man who slapped her because that violence made her come to her senses. I suppose Ms. Lee wrote this in a time in history when plot devices like this one were palatable, even convincing. That's the only explanation I can feebly offer. And I really liked the novel up until then. And the end bothers me so damn much that it ruins my enjoyment of the novel entirely.
I guess I am a stereotypical TKAM fan and hoped for more of the same. This fell flat for me. And does not feel finished. Characters were not improved upon, IMO, though I guess that was the point.
Loved this book. As far as what people say regarding the skill of writing, I felt like her writing, while still sounding like Harper Lee, was more elementary in the beginning of the book. However, by the midpoint of the book, I felt like she had found the voice we all came to love in "Mockingbird".  As for the story... This did not change my views of Attacus at all. To me, Mockingbird had Attacus pictured in a light not far from hero-worship. It was breathtaking to see he had flaws in this second, and then when you learned how he didn't allow his viewpoints on race or other stereotypes to cloud his fight for justice or his belief that everyone deserved their due, it brought his character full circle. For a man of that time, even believing people different from you deserved justice could be considered forward thinking. Also, I don't think I have ever read a book that so perfectly details the story of a young woman realizing her father had faults. As a "dad's girl", this was a turning point when the bar you have set for yourself and your future partner has been put so high and you realize your meter for it all is not as perfect as you might think. And the first real, soul deep conflict you have with that parental unit where you cannot find common ground and learn to love someone despite that?  That is real life and a work of art put onto paper.
This book is an unreadable mess. The mockingbird was lovely but this is an unedited jumble of thoughts. I see where she was headed but this is just unreadable and should not have been published.
This book was written before To Kill a Mockingbird. There is a reason it was not published before. It is too bad the Author's family did not understand that. I guess they saw it as a money tree.
This book wasn't nearly as compelling as TKAM. Though I enjoyed Jean Louise's recollections of her childhood and teen years. If you are a big fan of TKAM, then you kind of HAVE to read this one.
While I did not love the book, it does give one pause and food for thought regarding how we see things as a child vs how things really are and how we see things after we are into our adult life.
Overall, you see some brilliance shining through from "To Kill a Mockingbird." However, there are a lot of rants that remind me of Linus from Peanuts explaining the meaning of Christmas.
My favorite book of all time has been To Kill a Mockingbird.  So when I heard that Harper Lee wrote a second novel with the same characters that takes place twenty years later I was excited and couldn't wait. Wait I did, and disappointed I was. First, I love the character of Scout (Jean Louise) in both books.  She is still as spunky as she ever was in To Kill a Mockingbird, but twenty years older.  The new character of Uncle Jack - he's like your old cranky grandpa that spills out one-liners - he made me laugh whenever he showed up in the book.  But the character of Atticus is not the same from the Mockingbird, and readers from the original book will find the character implausible.  How can a character who taught his children about civil rights and respecting others differences now be a bigot and racist?  It would actually be more plausible for Scout to be a racist because she is in her early 20s and because racism and bigotry is a learned behavior.  For someone like Atticus who has always defended blacks and others until his 50s, and then all of a sudden does not want them sitting at the lunch counter with him or believes that they are somehow sub human, well this is just not realistic or believable.  I don't know who wrote this book, but it doesn't sound like the author that wrote To Kill a Mockingbird.
I was very disappointed with this book. I had reread To Kill A Mockingbird so I would be all set to enjoy the next book. The writing is poor the plot boring ....don't waste your time or money!!
Probably shouldn't have been published. It wasn't a sequel. This was the first effort to write 'Mockingbird' and was properly scuttled. Not a bad read, actually, but certainly not a great book.
Perhaps I expected too much. I read "To Kill A Mockingbird" when I was in grammar school. I fell in love with Scout's story.Every line, every character, every inspiring phrase. I felt the heat of the Alabama summer, I empathized with Boo, had a crush on Jem, adored Atticus. I was Scout. I was sick and outraged over the Robinson trial and everything before and after.I hated for the book to end. So much so that I re-read it every year. Had to buy a new copy because my pages came loose from the binding.<br/><br/>I pre-ordered this book and couldn't wait to open it. I had heard Atticus turns out to be racist so I was prepared for that disappointment. But I have a hard time believing this was written by the same woman. What's more I can't believe she released it or that her publisher let her. The story is told in the third person so there is no intimacy to draw the reader in. The writing is childish, the story line is weak, the characters are dull. Calpurnia and Jeb are mentioned just in passing and barely, at that. I didn't like the remaining characters, including Scout, and didn't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>Ms. Lee wrote the perfect novel, tome, her first time out. A lifetime later, school kids are still reading and learning from it. It is a beloved American novel.Why would she want to tarnish her legacy with this trash?<br/>.
I just finished reading Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman.  Several friends told me they weren’t going to read it, for fear of destroying their love for Atticus Finch and To Kill a Mockingbird. I enjoyed reading it as a good early draft of a first novel by a promising young writer. But there is more to it than that. The two books taken together draw a starker and more intimate picture of the Southerner’s “heart in conflict with itself” (William Faulkner) than either book does alone.<br/> I grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, 100 miles north of and ten years later than Nelle Harper Lee did in Monroeville, AL.  Both Atticus#1 (Mockingbird) and Atticus#2 (Watchman) strike me as completely realistic.  I have known only a few men like Atticus#1. I knew many like Atticus#2. Some of those clung to their racism word for word. Others stayed and moderated their attitudes over the years.<br/>  As leading men, the two characters are too different for me to imagine them as the same person. I can only imagine the amount of hard labor it took the young writer to transform Atticus#2 into Atticus#1 and turn the draft she sent to her publishers in 1957 into the masterpiece published two years later. I can easily imagine why the writer Harper Lee didn’t want the hassle of defending herself against the charge that she had created one man who wasn’t as good as another.
Being a fan of Harper Lee, this one is a complete disappointment. I am not even sure that it is the same author given the sublime writing that she exhibited in "To Kill A Mockingbird".
I thoroughly enjoyed " to kill a mockingbird" 50 years ago. Harper Lee's publisher should have followed her original instinct and filed the manuscript. Too much flaky analysis. Boring.
Just could not get into it.
This book was a disappointment after all the publicity it received. It was a bit plodding and pointless, no where as good as TO KILL SA MOCKING BIRD.  My three star rating is rather generous.
Hated it. Had recently reread To Kill A Mockingbird in anticipation of Go Set A Watchman.<br/><br/>If this piece of work had been "lost for many years" - it should have stayed gone.
If ever a book needed a good editor, this is it.  The subject matter is interesting and emotionally complex, but the writing is wordy and rambling.  The book should have remained unpublished.
I could not get through it. It was boring and just not a good read, I could not even determine if there was even a plot or purpose to this book. I spent money on this and is was not worth it.
This should never have been published. It's awful and makes me question the author's literary talent.  This really seems to be a cynical money grab  by her advisors and the publisher.
Pre-ordered Kindle version at first announcement, misunderstanding this to be a sequel to TKAM, best book ever.  BIG mistake.  Waste of my time and money.  Too bad to publish then...and now.
It seems as though the author didn't have a chance to polish her or have someone do it for her before having it printed. It just didn't seem to flow like "To Kill a Mockingbird" did.
I really cannot believe that this was written by the actual author of To Kill a Mockingbird.  Another reviewer said that it is at best a very rough draft and I have to agree completely.
Had heard many misgivings about the book because of things revealed about Atticus Finch. They were totally unfounded. It was a wonderful book! Glad I read it in spite of the neg reviews....
I was very disappointed in the story. I plodded throught the book in order to be able to discuss it with others. The ending left me hanging, thinking it could have been written differently.
If you are looking for a story on the scale of To kill a mockingbird this is not it. At best it yields some insight into scout atticus and uncle Jack.  I expected much and it came up short.
Wish they would have left well enough alone with To Kill a Mockingbird.  I liked remembering the characters as they were.  Who needs to think of Atticus beng a racist that many years later?
Very disappointing read. I had high expectations after reading To Kill a Mockingbird. The novel was well written but the narrative left a lot to be desired and did not capture my interest.
Harper Lee's legacy is compromised by this mediocre book. She would've done better to leave it unpublished, in my opinion.  Atticus Finch is iconic, and now he's a damaged icon.  Not good!
First, no comparison to Kill a Mockingbird, which was awonderful, read.  I felt this was somewhat disjointed, moving from one issue to another and rather slow reading.  Wouldn't recommend.
I found this a hard book to read and confusing. Some of it was great. Nearly gave up half way through but needed to finish for my own satisfaction. Very long and complicated conversations.
I loved hearing Lee's voice again.  She attempts to explain the complexity of the Southerners' reaction to the supreme court decision.  I think she set herself a difficult yet worthy task.
Scout, like readers of TKAM, viewed Atticus as a paragon, reason in an unreasonable world, a God, infallible.  In this story, she, and we discover that God does not live in her house.
Our book club got drawn in by the hype!  No one liked it.  Most reread TKAM and still loved it but this was, in our opinion,  just a way to try to make money on the rep of the first book!
This was a tedious read. I felt as though I was trapped in a meeting and the speaker was droning on. After three weeks, I gave up. It was boring, laborious and very much a disappointment.
Not a strong plot and certainly not close to Mockingbkrd. I was relieved that Atticus was not as horrible as the press lead us to believe. A nice and honest glimpse into a time and place.
My expectations for," Go Set A Watchman," were very high. I did not expect to read another Pulitzer Prize winner, but I did expect to read something that was very worthy of this author.  I was sadly disappointed.  Had this book been Harper Lee's first publication rather than, "To Kill A Mockingbird," the public would have never heard of this author.  Atticus Finch would have never been an exemplar to civil rights activists.  Jean Louise, better known in the first book as Scout, capitulated much too easily to the bigoted mores of the old South.  I would have liked her character much better had she not understood her father, had her Uncle Jack not been able to make her understand why folks in Maycomb acted as they acted.  I found her relationship with Hank false and shallow, just not believable enough. At times, the flashbacks to her childhood were distracting to the flow of the book, if not disconnected.  Harper Lee's legacy would have been better served had this book never been published.  This publication may have served to satisfy the curiosity of the public, but tarnished the author's legacy.  "To Kill A  Mockingbird," will still stand as a great American classic, but Harper Lee's mystique as one of the greatest American authors will not stand.
I was hesitant to read this-but glad I did.  I of course read this in HS, but re-read when I heard this was coming out under so much controversy.  I of course didn't want to believe in a world where Atticus could in any way resemble a racist.  However, if art reflects life-this book does it.  So many of our "heroes" of late have fallen.  Atticus was almost too perfect at times in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>I don't believe this story in anyway takes away from the first, but there are some similarities, of course.  You still very much see aspects of "Scout" in the headstrong  Jean Louise, and the ever critical eye of Aunt Alexandra.  I loved the the development of other characters that got short shrift in the first story, such as Scout's uncle.  However to view it as a sequel would be incorrect.  This book is just another way to tell the story of institutional racism of the South at that time.  If that is not made obvious by the mention of Tom's acquittal I don't know what is.  I have to say I'm glad Harper Lee's editor encouraged her to write Mockingbird first, but Watchman has a lot of valid points worth reading.<br/><br/>Overall-I think you can still think you can learn from this Atticus without it taking away from the lessons the first one taught us.
I felt mixed about reading this at all because of the story behind its publication, and the fact that for decades Ms. Lee did not want it published. For those reasons, I read it not as a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, but as a rough draft. So this review stems from that history. I'm glad I read it with that mindset, or I might not have finished it at all. For me, this was simply not a well-written book. It has none of the wholeness, the liquidity of writing or the depth of TKAM. But then again, it shouldn't, since it (for decades) ended up just being the rough draft to her masterpiece. The reason to buy this book and to read it is simply this: The flashback scenes are worth the price of admission, so to speak. The minute Lee starts to recount Scout's past, the story flies and you can see the promise in her writing. I had no issues with the idea that Atticus' character in this book struggled with racism. I can't help but think that if she had truly written a sequel (after writing TKAM) or if she had just rewritten and edited this, it may have touched these same topics, but the handling of them would have been far more eloquent and complete. As it stands, I can see why those who were looking out for Harper Lee's best interests felt it best not to publish it.
They didn't publish it the first time and it shouldn't have been published now; well not without much editing. I found the switching between 3rd person and 1st person very distracting.
Four reactions to Harper Lee's novel Go Set a Watchman:<br/><br/>1. I couldn't help but connect reader disillusionment with Atticus' interior life in Watchman with this summer's national disillusionment over race-motivated violence.<br/><br/>2.  Late in Watchman Atticus and Scout discuss Brown v. Board of Education (not by name) as both catalyst and rationale for Southern White racism.  Again, couldn't help but connect this element of the novel to this summer's Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage.  Listening to some Republican backlash to this summer's decision has to be similar to Jean Louise's sitting in the balcony of the Maycomb Courthouse and listening to the Citizen Council hate speech.<br/><br/>3.  Still debating Harper Lee's narrative choices in Watchman. I loved the straightforward narrative, seasoned with flashbacks, in the novel's first third.  I found the dialogue-interior monologue riffs initially troublesome and the "look what I found among dad's Sunday papers" an awkward, easy-out for a storyteller.<br/><br/>4. Uncle Jack, for the most part an unnecessary character, gives up one of the novel's most insightful observations - "The time your friends need you is when they're wrong." Friendship as watchman!  ﻿
The book is actually a coming of age story that is both about a woman and the south. All the hype is to cause interest for people to read the book. Atticus is still a hero to me.
It takes a number of chapters to really "get into the novel".  One will see a different view of Atticus Finch and Scout (Jean Louise).  One should also keep in mind that the character of ATTICUS was created by Harper Lee in To Kill A Mockingbird and Go Set A Watchman.  It should also be noted that both novels take place in the 1930's and 1950's general time period in the South.  A good deal of the PRE-publication (of this 2nd book) comments seemed to be made by people in the media who had NOT read the book before making some foolish comments about the 2nd novel.<br/><br/>It is true, you will see a different view of the entire FINCH family.  One thinks of ATTICUS FINCH by the portrayal of Gregory Peck in to Kill A Mockingbird.  It would make NO sense to try to make a new movie about to Kill A Mockingbird.  The version of the movie with Gregory Peck and the book are EXCELLENT as is.  As far as a movie being made about the book Go Set a Watchman, it would be VERY HARD to replace Gregory Peck's character.<br/><br/>The question comes up--Should this 2nd book have been published?  At this time, I do not have an answer to that question.<br/><br/>Should individuals READ this book?  100% YES--That will allow individuals to make their own opinion about the book well informed.
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books, and I think Harper Lee is a VERY cool Lady..<br/>The Media ripped into this book before it was on the shelves and I decided I had to read it for myself.. I DON'T think ANYONE in the media read it at all..<br/>FIRST.. Consider she wrote it in the 1950's.. what was happening in that time?<br/>SECOND.. (without ruining it for anyone who wants to read it) It's NOT about Atticus being a, Sheet wearing, Crosses Burning, Dragging people out of their homes kind of book. He is STILL the Atticus Finch of old, STILL willing to help ALL innocent people from wrong, no matter WHAT color..<br/>YES.. he is a different man then we thought, (and admit it, when you think of Atticus, you think Gregory Peck <3 DROOL :)  ) ...  BUT.. "The Maycomb County Council"NOT KKK (yes its kind of the same thing) is tying to protect the Old Southern Ways, and worried about the NAACP trying to FORCE the rights of people who at the TIME.. did NOT have the education to DO all that the NAACP was trying to get for them.. It makes PERFECT sense as you read the book..<br/>THIRD.. Its also about Jean Louise (Scout) coming into her own..<br/>IT was a VERY good book.. I REALLY liked it.. So glad I read it...
I have just finished reading Harper Lee’s books “To Kill a Mockingbird” and “Go Set A Watchman.”  I found reading them one after the other fascinating.  I have a theory about the controversy about their origins and publication.<br/>  The original manuscript for ‘Mockingbird’ was acquired by the publisher Lippincott in 1957.  I don’t know how long it took Ms Lee to write the book, but in 1954 and 1955 the Supreme Court passed two important civil rights rulings about desegregation and the NAACP was active in both of them.  Emotions were running high in the South.  I think Ms Lee was writing about what was actually happening in her area, perhaps describing it in more vivid detail than the publisher would like.<br/>  I theorize that the publisher asked Ms Lee to use the flashbacks to 20 years earlier as the basis of her book, rather than setting it in the present day, because as written it might be controversial, perhaps a bit too close to the truth.<br/>  I found ‘Watchman’ a lovely book and disagree with reviewers who say it ends unresolved.  I think Jean Louise very clearly sees what she needs to do and how she will be living her life.<br/>  I encourage you to read both books, reading ‘Mockingbird’ first.
** spoiler alert ** I don't think I have words for how awful this book was. My expectations were low as I knew this was a book that was rejected by publishers when it was first written, but what I cannot understand is why anyone would publish it now. This book managed to not only be terrible on its own, but to absolutely destroy what made To Kill A Mockingbird so wonderful.<br/><br/>The book on its own, pretending I don't know the characters already, is boring. Nothing really happens in the book. There are a few little anecdotes from childhood that I enjoyed but the rest was boring.<br/><br/>The climax is an argument between Jean Louise (Scout) and Atticus about basically how racist he is. I literally cried during this argument but not because of what was actually said but because I literally felt betrayed. This is not the same character. Atticus Finch would never have become this stupid man. I've always thought of Atticus Finch as a moral compass and a man to be looked up to. This book attempts to destroy that. I honestly wish I hadn't read it.
For everyone freaking out over this book, please remember one thing:  this was Lee's FIRST draft of what became the "Mockingbird" story, as submitted to her editors.<br/><br/>This is not a new book, folks, nor is it a sequel.  This is prime way to see the writing and editing process at work.  It took Lee two years to re-work "Watchman" into "Mockingbird."  As the reader can see, "Mockingbird" is the superior story, thanks to that reworking and reediting and rewriting process.<br/><br/>This shows the importance of that process.  I plan on introducing it that way to my students when I return to school in the fall:  "Watchman" as the rough draft, "Mockingbird" as the final draft (this is especially important as so many students feel that their first draft is "good enough"; this shows it often isn't).<br/><br/>IT IS a misrepresentation to say this is a new book by Lee.  It isn't new, and that part bothers me.  I wish the powers that be would've advertised this as the first draft of "Mockingbird," and then let the readers realize how much the story changed shape during the editing process.  But, I guess there's no way to make money that way.  And that's a darn shame.
It is hard to evaluate this book now, after reading "To Kill a Mockingbird."  I can understand why Harper Lee's editor suggested that she "move the story" earlier to when Scout was a child.  The character of Jem appears in the story as a "ghost" since he apparently had died before this novel begins.  So that whole dynamic between Scout & Jem is gone (except where the reader who has read "To Kill a Mockingbird" fills in the blanks).  Atticus certainly embodies the racial attitudes of the day; he is an apologist for those people who are fighting the Supreme Court rulings on integration.  Yet he is Jean Louise's (how she is most identified in the story) idolized father.  She has a hard time integrating the father who seemed to her to be so liberal and the father who is really no different from the average Southerner who wants to "hold onto" the ways things were.  This is an interesting dilemma but one that could have been presented in a more nuanced way.  By moving the novel back (i.e., "In To Kill a Mockingbird") Harper Lee only has to deal with the idolized father. In some way, this is a simpler, less nuanced statement about what was happening in the South at the time yet "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a tighter book.
A little disappointed....I guess I expected more because of Lee's first novel....also disappointed because the author seems to be rationalizing the treatment of the black community.
This is certainly not the book I expected after reading reviews. Lee has captured well a moment and its accompanying attitudes in an historical moment in Southern history.
This should not have been published as a novel for the very simple reason that it isn't a finished novel ready for publication. It reads for exactly what it is: a rough first draft by an inexperienced and not formally trained young adult writer, that was shelved for decades, then edited or rewritten (probably recently and certainly not by Lee) just enough to have some of the rough edges smoothed off and presented as some sort of companion volume to To Kill a Mockingbird. It is neither fish nor foul. Some of the writing is competent and descriptive but most is awkward, forced and unfocused. There is no narrative drive and the effect is toneless. There is no insight, tension, pathos or humor. The basic lesson of an immature and naïve adult being forced to accept her father as flawed is not demonstrated in a literary manner. There is no plot suitable to a novel. A few of the chapters might have made excellent short stories if developed properly. Normally, early and undeveloped writing by a famous author is considered juvenilia & can be found among the author's papers in a university library. This piece of writing should not have been for sale to the general public.
I enjoyed the book and found it to be very well written, however, I found the end to be disappointing.  Atticus Finch had feet of clay and unfortunately was as much a bigot as so many people we still see in this world.  His view of the "negro" people as being childlike and needing to be taught how to live in a "white world" is a true expression of how so many people still think of the different races.  As a white woman I can honestly say "white is right" is a lie.  What I found so sad was that in the end, Scout a true defender of all are equal, is persuaded to understand her entire family's bigotry.  Not agree but understand.  What I also found so sad, is a 150 years have passed since the Civil War and we have come so far in the struggle toward equality.  This can be seen by the fact that there is even a discussion as to whether the confederate flag should be flown before state, federal and capitol buildings.  A DISCUSSION...the only discussion should be whether to burn I or just throw it in the trash where it belongs.  I hope that those of you who hold dear to your belief that because you wake up white, you are a better person that your black neighbor, reads this book and takes a hard look at themselves.
Read TKAM for the first time immediately before reading GSAW.  I was ready to name my next child Atticus and, as a lawyer, was thrilled to have a moral portrayal of the profession.<br/><br/>Then I read GSAW.  The now 26-year-old just couldn't stop interrupting dialogue.  Her character was less mature than her younger Scout, which i founder disappointing for a female heroin portrayal. Here she is trying to find out why, but instead of listening, screams, cries, and just goes off on these rants, running away every chance she gets.<br/><br/>The characters are unrefined and Atticus, well it was interesting seeing his reasoning for his views, but it did not make sense as an evolution of his character when juxtaposed to his younger TKAM self.  I don't agree with the other reviewers that he was always this way.  The only similarities were his deductive reasoning skills.<br/><br/>I'm glad I read it because once I came to terms that this was just the first draft of the "polished gem" TKAM became, it was more of an historical read of how important editors are and how easy it is for people take advantage of situations.  This read made me deeply appreciate Lee's invisible hand and better understand Lee's reluctance to continue interviews or publish other books.
Truly horrible. Can't understand what's being said. Is Attitus a true goat or just acting like one to disguise his true, nobel intention? Who the heck knows. Such a disappointment.
This book was worth reading.  I enjoyed knowing the characters in advance from To Kill a Mockingbird.  I'm not sure that I would have enjoyed it as much had I read it in isolation.
No, I'm not comparing it to Lee's Mockingbird because (dum dum dum) I'm not a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird to begin with. I consider TKAM to be, at best, the 9th best Pulitzer Prize winner I've read (out of 11) and that's only because I've had the misfortune to discover John Updike (Screw you, Harry Angstrom, you man-child, immature, womanizing sociopath!). My dislike of the book everyone else likes aside, Watchman doesn't have a rhyme or reason to its existence seemingly outside of the money concerns of the estate of Harper Lee. I have little doubt that, had Lee remained in full control of her functions, this book would have remained in a box in her attic collecting dust where it belongs. As for the actual quality, the dialog is dated, the characters are mostly shallow, various twists feel forced and, if you somehow were never forced to read Mockingbird in school, you will have no idea what Scout is talking about for over 75% of the book. If you liked Mockingbird, keep your happy opinions of it and avoid. If you disliked it as little more than required reading with small doses of redeeming value like me, read it so you can rest comfortably in the idea that Lee really did only have one good book in her head all these years.
Please set aside the less than polished writing, the change in narrative, and the conspiracy theories regarding the delayed publishing.  This is a superb book about a man's understanding of what it takes to change society.  No government can dictate to people's hearts and minds; change in society must happen from within, one person and /or child at a time.  Understanding that, Atticus deliberately allowed Scout to be raised outside the normal restrictions of Southern society, 'born color blind,'  and then shaped her life, albeit from a distance, to make her strong enough to become the agent of change.  In the last part of the book, Atticus tests Scout, to see if she could hold true to what is right even against her love and near idol worship of her father.  Many people have interpreted this scene as Atticus being a segregationist, but I think we need to look a bit deeper.  Atticus wanted Scout to know his activities, knew that she would watch him from the balcony...that was her habit.  Atticus never became passionately angry, never lost reason. The phrase 'Prejudice and faith begin where reason ends' is used in this book.  The clues are there....
This was ultimately a let down. I was really hoping for something similar to Harper Lee's previous book, To Kill a Mockingbird, but this novel didn't reach my lowest expectations. Taking place about two decades after To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman involves a twenty-six year old Scout, and a much older, much more feeble Atticus.<br/>  While the writing was spot on, the plot was less than satisfying, and the climax did not reach its potential. When I reached the end of the book, I couldn't believe that I had finished it because so little happened. The most exciting thing happened to be a fight between Atticus and Scout, and while I found this interesting, it was far from a refreshing climax. The book was not all bad by any means. As I mentioned earlier, the writing was spot on, and many of the questions answered near the end were completely unpredictable. However, I believe that Lee was attempting to revolve the novel around adulthood, just as To Kill a Mockingbird revolved around adolescence, and if that was the case, then it left much to the imagination.<br/>  All in all, it was not a bad read. But if you want to keep your high opinions and appraisals on To Kill a Mockingbird (if you liked it), then I would recommend not reading this one.
Definitely worth reading as a companion novel to her masterpiece. It did not taint my opinion of To Kill a Mockingbird in the least. In fact, it made me appreciate it even more.
After all of the pre-release hype, this book was a big disappointment.<br/>It is little wonder that the original manuscript was rejected by the publisher fifty years ago.
Considering the greatness of "To Kill a Mockingbird," this novel was very disappointing, though it shows flashes of the engaging writing style and captivating storytelling associated with the other book.  I say "other" rather than "earlier," because this book seems to be a first draft that editors rejected, seeing the germ of a fine novel before sending Harper Lee back to the drawing board to produce the landmark novel we all love.  In the lives of the "Mockingbird" characters who reappear in "Watchman"--mainly Scout (Jean Louise) and Atticus--this book is about 12 years later, but I found this second encounter with them less than satisfying.  While caught at a more mature time of her life, after she's left Maycomb for New York, Jean Louise entirely lacks the childlike charm of Scout.  Atticus has morphed into much less virtuous man, slowed by age and disease, but it's hard to see how he could have shown the courage of the attorney who stood up to a town's ridicule and threats to defend Tom Robinson. On the other hand, I found one of the new characters (or at least a character I don't remember from "Mockingbird"), that is Jean Louise's boyfriend Hank, to be quite interesting and refreshing.
A very slow boring book.
This isn't the masterpiece "To Kill a Mockingbird" is but anyone who loves that book (and taught it for over 20 years, which I did) must read it for its insights into a writer's process. An NPR review said it reads like a sequel, not as an early draft; it leans heavily on your knowledge of characters and developments from the book we know and love. Some of Jean Louise's yelling scene with her father make you wince because they sound so adolescent in tone. She, too, is a bigot, not just the kind her Uncle Jack points out but the kind we recognize: she concedes points to Atticus that a truly color blind person would not. Scene with Calpurnia at her home is touching, realistic. Several times, Lee presents a party scene's dialogue in overlapping snippets (especially the Coffee Aunt Alexandra throws for her homecoming). Her technique with this type of dialogue is very clever and entertaining. Am grateful an editor helped her craft the better version with its exquisite prose and structure but am very disappointed that this book's honesty is absent from TKM. Interestingly, in the small reference to rape trial in this one, the defendant was ACQUITTED so in that one detail, at least, TKM presented the more dismal and realistic outcome.
I was disappointed in this book & I have difficulty accepting that this book & To Kill A Mockingbird were actually written by the same person.  Maybe I just need to re-read it.
A response to Harper Lee's "Go Set a Watchman" novel.<br/>I hear mixed comments about the book, and I am 1/3 through the book which was just released this week...and I find it delightful. Comparing it to "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a bit like comparing your children to each other. You can make observation, but to judge one against the other is a mistake and unfortunate.<br/>What I''m moved by is Harper Lee's wit and charm and her ability to capture a time and place yet make it universal. The plot moves slowly as we watch Jean Louise (Scout at 26) grow into awareness and expression. It's clearly a blessing to have it born now.<br/>Okay, I have finished reading Harper Lee's "Go Set a Watchman" and I won't spoil it for you, but I will say as easy and smooth as the first half is, the last third is as challenging. I think she takes on a huge subject in addressing the nature of bigotry in the South, but anywhere...including the human mind and heart. I stick by my refusal to compare it to her other child, "To Kill a Mockingbird," and I'm amazed at how she went from one to the other. I hope you'll read it. You'll eventually understand the title and the need for courage and kindness.
An accurate recapping of racial attitudes in Alabama in the fifties and sixties, a realistic and believable setting, good characters, but overall a ho-hum coming of age story.
It was clearly the story from which To Kill a Mockingbird sprang, however, it was poorly edited and should never have been published.  Seems like money was the motivator here.
Disappointing book.  The editor clearly made the right decision when he told Harper Lee to redo the book.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a marvelous book.  This one is far from it.
Trying to adjust to the changing times watered down the effect of Scout years ago. The personal story of Scout was more poignant and inspiring than reality in the world today.
I understand this book better after having read the New York Times review. Essentially, Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill a Mockingbird as it was rejected by the publisher. Harper Lee wrote To Kill a Mockingbird at the suggestion of the publisher to build Scout's childhood story. I think Harper Lee must have forgotten to reread Go Set a Watchman before allowing it to be published. It is infuriating to me for the second book in a series to get the most important plot sequence of the first novel wrong. How could there possibly be inconsistencies between her own books? As far as the characters' development into older persons is concerned, I am not going to argue with an author about her own characters but I will be a much happier person if I remember Scout, Atticus Finch, Jem, and Calpurnia as they were.<br/>Did I like it as a single entity, without considering that To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite novels of all time? No. The pace was slow, I was bored with most of it, and the conflict was so minimal it could be considered arbitrary. A young woman with daddy issues is not interesting. Scout with daddy issues is heartbreaking.
Very disappointing. Would have given it zero stars if that had been an option. Poorly written. Story line weak, drawn out, overdramatic. All in all a very disappointing read.
To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite novel.  So glad it was published before Watchman or I probably would have never read it.  This latest offering was so very disappointing.
So obvious a sequel , or prequel,  or whatever it is.  Publisher saw a money maker.  To Kill a Mockingbird is brilliant; it doesn't need a dangling modifier.
This book was misrepresented in its initial marketing...it is not a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird but, rather, a first draft....disappointing.  Harper Lee deserves better.
To Kill a Mockingbird has always been one of my favorite books.  When I finished Watchman last night, I felt it was another appropriate "coming of age" book, just as Mockingbird was.  Scout (and many of us, I might add) idealized Atticus and the values he espoused in Mockingbird.  With the help of Uncle Jack, Scout now sees her father for the human being he is - cautiously working and feeling his way through the racial issues of that era, examining both the good AND the bad.  Would we really have had Atticus be any other way???<br/><br/>Also, Scout's feistiness is still evident as she works through her relationship with Henry, who is Atticus' law partner; I found the dialogue between the two amusing.  And, Aunt Alexandra is still very much in evidence, trying to mold Scout into more of a ladylike person.  Adding to the charm of this book, Scout recalls certain memories of Jem, Dill and their play activities (Dill suggests holding a mock Revival meeting, and both Scout and Dill get "baptized" in the neighbor's fish pond).<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to All.  If you haven't read Mockingbird, then do so, and compare the two.  Both are good reads.
I wasn't very impressed.
The book is really slow moving...almost puts you to sleep in the first half of the book.  The end of the book picks up a little but not much.  The book was way over hyped.
This book was not worthy of being published.  There was a good reason it was rejected when Harper lee originally submitted it.  It should have never come out of the vault.
It took so long for this book to get to a plot, I was wondering if it had one.<br/>I did enjoy the characters. I think it should be looked at as a character study novel.
I have taught To Kill a Mockingbird for years, so this was a must read. It is definitely a "coming of age" story for the character of Scout. I would recommend it!
Was extremely disappointed in this book.  Way too much hype for the book.  Was a waste of time. It was so boring I couldn't even finish the book which was a first for me.
would not recommend to anyone who still holds "To Kill a Mockingbird" as the gold standard.  Never thought Scout could grow up to be such an uninteresting person.
Not quite sure how I felt about this book.  To Kill a Mockingbird has always been one of my favorites.  I think it was a good thing that it was published before this one.
With all the hype surrounding this book, it was really a letdown. It doesn't even seem to be written by the same author as To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>I won't write a spoiler, but I will say that it's poorly executed and sadly, poorly edited. There are a lot of errors that were left behind, certainly a slap in the face to Ms. Lee. Perhaps the rush to get the book out is the reason for the haphazard editing and proofreading. Some of the characters are poorly developed and sometimes the story drags.<br/><br/>All the book did was leave me questioning how someone who wrote such a literary classic as To Kill a Mockingbird could even remotely be the author of Go Set a Watchman. The books have different literary voices. One would think the writing style would be the same or at least similar. I'm sure Watchman will re-spark the rumors that Truman Capote actually wrote, or heavily edited, To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>I hope someone edits and proofs this book out of respect for Harper Lee. Watchman certainly will overshadow the reputation she earned for Mockingbird.
My husband and I both eagerly read this new book.  We were both very disappointed and have come to doubt that Harper Lee actually completed this book...if she even had a hand in it.  The first half is a nostalgic look at going home where we got to see Atticus and Scout once again in their home town with Scout as a grown woman.  The characters hold together for this part of the book even if the narrative is a bit slow.  Sadly the whole book then proceeds off of a cliff where characters lose their identity and the narrative is reduced to a pedantic monologue from a disillusioned Scout.  Aside from the lack of believability of this part of the book, the opinions expressed don't seem to really fit small town southern life either but ring more as an outsider's view of what it appears to be like in the south.  In short, this is a disappointing read and makes one feel as though the publisher has tried to pull a fast one.  My suggestion is don't even bother to read it.  Let Atticus and Scout remain in the past forever where we can admire their character and appreciate extraordianary prose of the real Harper Lee.
Started out well but seemed to drag on and on when she was talking with her uncle and father as she was attempting to sort out her feelings...and then...basically ended.
First off: This is NOT TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD!  Second: If anyone has been following the pre release of GO SET A WATCHMAN you know that this book should have NEVER been published. And third: DO NOT criticize this book before you read it!<br/><br/>GO SET A WATCHMAN takes the people of Maycomb county and jumps them right into the middle of the civil rights era. Scout now a woman out on her own living in New York comes home for a visit.  Here she encounters Atticus & dozens of familiar faces & lives, all of them trying to deal with time, life and the Supreme Court decision on civil rights.  When reading GO SET A WATCHMAN, try to remember the atmosphere of the South after the courts decision.  Maycomb is no different and Scout is thrust into the middle of it.  She still sees Maycomb and Atticus and the residents as she did when she was younger when she ran the streets with Jem & Dill playing and getting into trouble.  That's her first mistake.  Like I said before, dont criticize it before you read it.  I was crying towards the end.  Its not TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD & it never will be, but I think as a first book of Harper Lee's it was a good read.
First, to be written in the mid 1950's, it's a courageous work. For a Southerner to feel as strongly in support of integration and racial harmony, is no small thing. Carson McCullers's "Clock Without Hands," 1953, is another brave book, written by a Columbus, GA. native. So I applaud Harper Lee!<br/> I understand that "To Kill a Mockingbird," went through the usual process, 2 1/2 years of back and forth between editor and author, rewriting, and restructuring, and so forth. I don't believe "Go Set a Watchman," did. As told, when the editor read it, he/she suggested going back twenty years to Scout's childhood, with Jem still alive, and little Truman Capote a neighbor. And so there came a masterpiece.<br/><br/>"God Set a Watchman is not a masterpiece. It is appealing to fans of Mockingbird, to compare the beloved characters ---after 20 years, but there are too many very long argumentative discourses from Jean Louise. At times I became confused and frustrated, not sure what the author was trying to do.<br/><br/>I appreciate Harper Lee's very progressive views of the 1950's, and her courage in writing this book. Read it and let me know what you think.......
I did not like the language she used and was very disappointed.  To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my favorite books and there is no comparison between these books.
I really enjoy the writing, and could see great insights into the characters portrayed in the book.  There were also very interesting racial issue described eloquently.
Struggled to finish this book.  Atticus was totally unlikeable as was his demented brother and racist sister. Too much rambling.  Save money and borrow this book
Since "To Kill a Mockingbird" is probably my favorite book - ever - I really, really wanted to like this one. Like many of my generation, I numbered Atticus Finch among my greatest heroes, and I never would have dreamed of applying the word "racist" to such an individual. Ms. Lee, in this work, tries to explain a mindset that afflicted the South during the great unrest before and after desegregation. For those who shared that mindset, maybe she succeeds, but for those who didn't - and that includes me despite the fact that I was a southern girl in her early teens during those years - she falls very short. I wish the outpouring of prejudice that infects the story didn't leave me feeling soiled and betrayed. But it does. While the notion that the civil war was fought over far more than the issue of slavery is genuine - an idea that is anathema to much current thinking - the casual acceptance of the classification of an entire race as innately inferior is just revolting. The writing may still be compelling, and Scout may still keep her place in my affections, but the legacy of the writer is - sadly - forever tainted.
Book is  quite a disappointment. It reads like a teenage novel in many sections. We are really left with no outcome and with a stupid arguement for the 10th amendment
I'll bet Lee's attorney and publisher are laughing at me for expecting this to match the quality of Lee's final draft. Deadly plot and uninteresting characterization.
Did not live up to the hype but did getbetter toward the end of the book. Still wonder why not released sooner. To Kill A Mockingbird was better and I knew the story.
It was a good book of it's own accord but failed to produce the characters and story line of it's predecessor, To Kill A Mocking Bird.  I was not drawn into the characters or the town of Maycomb like I had been while reading, To Kill a Mocking bird.  It is unfair to judge this book by the success of Mockingbird but most of the readers were familiar with Scout and her family from the book prior to reading Go Set a Watchman.  I was captivated by Uncle Jack and his unique character as well as perspective on Jean Louise's situation.  I would recommend reading this with an open mind and realize that years away from a time and place can change your thoughts and emotions.  Sometimes our heroes cannot live up to what we have built in our minds.  If Harper Lee were still writing I would like to see where she takes Scout after her visit to Maycomb.  Does she return to New York, does she marry and have children?  What becomes of the Finches in Maycomb?  Again, it is a good book but not stellar like Mockingbird.  I am anxious to see it this novel is thrust into the American education system to make a comparison of showing that one success does not necessarily breed another.
I read this book by Harper Lee because it was the pick of one in my book club. It was ok and an easy read but nothing like the impact given by To Kill A Mockingbird!
Atticus is unchanged. Scout is weird and suspicious. Uncle is trying to hp. Book is not well written nor well edited. Still wondering who was behind its publication.
This book lived up to it's promise.  I found myself mesmerized by the conflicts of Scout.  Not quite as good as To Kill A Mockingbird, but still well worth the read.
Despite the controversy of this book, I found it true to character of 'Mockingbird' and the people as charming as ever and true to form.  I believe it to be true  to the time period and gives some history of the Southern U.S, as well, and that Atticus did what he believed the best way to address the issue of equality in the South.  I think it is as much a book about a young women coming into her own self (as well) as we watch our parents fall off the pedestal we put them on as children and learn to love them as adults. It shows how our childhood relationships with others from our past change too.<br/>With current times as they are, I see a close relationship to how things were and how history tends to repeat.  All that said, I would suggest that if you haven't read 'Mockingbird' read it first, because it is our childhood that is the greatest influence to our present self.  Understanding the characters in their early years will help to understand how they become who they are in 'Watchman.'<br/>Enjoy the read and keep in mind what time period you are reading about.
After hearing all the press on how Atticas was a bigot, I chose not to read this book. I totally love  To Kill a Mockingbird and I just didn't want it ruined for me
If it is true that this book was written prior to "To Kill a Mockingbird", Lee's second book was definitely better than her first. I feel as if she tried to put too much into this novel - tackling both Brown v The Board of Education and also Jean Louise's realization that her Dad was less than perfect and then her learning to reckon with his complexities. There were many things to improve on:<br/> - The cadence of the story was something akin to riding a roller coaster, with the tempo going drastically from one speed to another and then back again.<br/> - What was the point of introducing Jem into the story if he didn't really have any role?<br/> - It felt as if the story came to a screeching halt with nothing really resolved<br/>Lee does best when she's using her considerable story-telling skills to help describe her characters, the politics of the time, lessons to be learned, etc...  I enjoyed learning about Scout as a grown up and was not disappointed in her character development. I knew exactly what was meant when Calpurnia was described as using her "Sunday manners".<br/>I'm glad I read it, but I won't recommend it to my mother.
While this book certainly doesn't need any more reviews than it already has, I'm adding my two cents anyway, mostly so I can remember what I thought of the book.<br/><br/>I'm a big To Kill a Mockingbird fan, and it left a huge impression on my when I first read it as a teen.  I knew from the advance hype that this book wasn't going to live up to TkaM standards, but I still had hope.<br/><br/>No, this one didn't work for me.  Yes, I was disappointed that some of the characters I loved turned out to be racists, but that alone is not the reason for my disappointment.<br/><br/>To me, this read more like a bit longer novella than a novel.  There was not a lot of depth to it.  Towards the end, it sounded too preachy.  The characters that were so rich in TKaM were rather flat here.  There wasn't much of a plot.<br/><br/>I listened to the audio edition narrated by Reese Witherspoon.  Her reading was good, not quite as good as I expected but good.  However, the music between sections was just annoying.<br/><br/>I still love To Kill a Mockingbird, and because Go Set a Watchman is easily forgettable, I don't think it will color my opinion in the long run.
Glad this was not published first.  Writing style erratic in my opinion, jumping from first to third person and back.  Came very close to not completing this book.
I feel like I went through the same process as Jean Louise while reading this book. It's release is actually very timely and relevant in regards to current events.
I was expecting another to " To Kill a Mockingbird", but it was not that powerful a book.  Still had some of the dialog, but not quite as good and moving.
You have to remember it is her first book.  Interesting read, had to read it to see what the hype was.  It was hard to complete because it was jumping everywhere.
This was a powerful and excellent read. I would recommend it to anyone. I've gone back to re read To Kill a Mockingbird to refresh my memory of the earlier story.
It was a disappointment after reading the excellent "to kill a mockingbird ". Did not like the racism. Only chapters about young Scout were worth reading.
My expectations may have been too high for this book. I was disappointed. Definitely lacked the character development and description of the first book published.
To start off this review the book is not bad and I in no way have any problem with the tearing down, or at least tarnishing of the literary saint that was Atticus. My problem is the ridiculous way that we are supposed to accept that he is not the deified southern gentleman we all, including Scout, grew up with but still act like he deserves to be treated with the kid gloves and veneration he had before this book. The end of the book seemed to be where the resolution was supposed to start. It seemed she was trying to make the story a personal family struggle tale embedded in the overall arch of the social/racist context of the south in the sixties. However the secondary larger story took too much of the focus. So when Lee ended with Scout accepting that her father is in no way the man she thought he was and that her entire set of values is based on a man with a world view she sees as completely skewed it is ridiculous that it only takes her one day, one conversation with her uncle and absolutely no action to accept this, forgive him, and accept that he is who he is seems completely ridiculous. This from a huge fan of to kill a mockingbird.
The book seemed rushed and not fully thought out. There is no real plot to the story if you can even call it that. No where near as good as To Kill A Mockingbird
I could not wait to get through it and would have trashed it if I had not liked To Kill a Mockingbird.  Disappointing and it should not have been published, imo.
I thought this was a major disappointment.  I would prefer to have not read it so I could continue remembering my previous impressions of Atticus, Scout and Jem.
A big letdown after so enjoying To Kill A Mockingbird. Offensively racist. Best left unpunished. Somewhat tedious and not worth the time it took to read.
A terrible book, waste of time.  I was expecting a very good book because of her first book ....  had MAKE myself finish it and was relieved when I finished it.
I was very disappointed. This in no way is the wonderful book that To Kill A mockingbird was. If you are curious, read it. Otherwise don't bother.
Not a very well developed plot. Very hard to follow at times, especially towards the end. Still not sure about the ending itself. Not a book I would recommend.
Can't really recommend you read this, it was too bland to have any real feelings about.<br/><br/>What a disappointment, TKAM is one of my all time favorites.
I really hate to rate this book because I have loved To Kill a Mockingbird" for years.  Lost interest about a fourth of the way through the book - a shame.
Scout and Atticus are still my two favorite literary characters even after reading this book. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because Mockingbird is still the best of them all.<br/><br/>Atticus is an above average citizen who would do whatever he could to protect any person of any race. He briefly joined the KKK for the simple reason he wanted to know who to watch in Maycomb especially since they are cowards that hide behind pillow cases.<br/><br/>I think the book does a good job of depicting how high a pedestal Scout had put her single father as a child, but as an adult her eyes are open to his imperfections, which still aren't much for the place and era they lived.<br/><br/>I liked learning a little bit more about her mother and Jem for that matter.<br/><br/>The critics of the book are basically Scout and having their eyes opened to imperfections in a character that couldn't possibly be as perfect he was depicted in the first book through a child's eyes.<br/><br/>I loved this book, even without the suspense and danger that was in the first book.<br/><br/>I will say this, I miss you Boo!
This is a very boring read, poorly written and the decision many years ago not to publish it was the right one. I am very sorry I read it.
I heard this book received negative reviews,but being a mockingbird fan I had to read it for myself. I was not disappointed!Harper Lee is a marvelous novelist
I was looking forward to reading this book.  However it was a disappointment.  The author was correct in publishing To Kill A Mockingbird instead of this one!
A story that can be told through all times.<br/>Not only will I recommend it to all my family & friends but I hope it is included in all our schools reading.
Charming in the old southern culturalisms, informative on that period of civil rights, witty with the grown up Scout and deep in her relationship with Atticus
Didn't even finish it.
Don't waste your time.
Boo. Oh wait, that's the better one.. Let's see: Atticus is racist. Jem is dead lol. Scout is annoying. Alexandra is the worst. The politics are terrible. I don't care about Henry. I'm glad Scout got punched. That was worth the 2 stars. She should've killed herself when she was 11--the end. Short stories are awesome. Maybe if there's a 3rd version. Haha<br/>Wait, hold on, I didn't realize Tom Robinson was acquitted. That's awesome! And the white girl was only 14, wait, that's gross. Atticus defended that? Why? Oh, great, a technicality. Not the grounds of innocence. Dude should've been locked up by our standards. But we're supposed to believe that even though she lied on the stand, I assume, they didn't think to add in the statutory charge. What the hell. I'm flabbergasted that a racist society would stand for this. Atticus should've been chased out of town for defending an actual rapist and winning. Jesus, what a crock.
Disappointing if looking for the caliber of to kill a mockingbird...overall though, a good story but took longer to get through than I would have anticipated
All over the place. This book was disappointing. As so as there was any movement in  the book, it was over! Author was very tangential and dry. A sad sequel.
It's worth reading.  Don't let anyone tell you it's not.  Harper Lee knows how to write and to use language and humor, and she does it here too.<br/><br/>Some of the words are archaic and not used anymore, but the book is filled with plenty of humor.<br/>The book is a quick read.  Even if you savor it, it won't take more than an afternoon or two.  It's not long.<br/>The question of bigotry doesn't come up until around pg. 100 more than a 1/3 into the book.  It's discussed in a complex way.<br/>Yes, things in life aren't clear cut, and yes, with today being the 1 yr. anniversary of Eric Garner being taken down like an elephant being hunted for ivory in the jungle, the book is VERY relevant.<br/><br/>Yes, Scout has advantages that she can't imagine being without.....And yes, I think some of what her Uncle Jack tells her is hogwash...<br/>I read the 1st book in high school.  This 2nd book is for a mature reader.  An advanced high school student or older.  They may need a frame of reference from older adults who lived through the 40's, 50's and 60's.
It is definitely different from To Kill a Mockingbird, but I really enjoyed it.  Lee has a wonderful way of developing interesting characters with unique, colorful, and witty prose. I enjoyed getting to know (or re-know) the characters in the first half of the book.  The second half shifts focus to strains in race relations in the emerging civil rights-era South.  The issues are much more nuanced in Watchman (the role of the Supreme Court, ACLU and NAACP  in the legal and legislative process; the societal friction caused by an increasingly active, rights-seeking black population) than the earlier-set Mockingbird (lynchings, racially biased legal system, etc.).  However, still very thought provoking.  It really struck me how similar Harper Lee's examination of white and black feelings on race relations were to feelings today about events in Ferguson/Baltimore/Charleston.  I will say that in some places, the writing had the feel of a draft that needed some further editing, but that did not detract too much (in my opinion) from the wonderful character development and thought provoking look at race relations.
Terrible book: writing, story, character realization.  Sorry I spent money on it--read the first few chapters and gave u.  It doesn't even deserve one star.
It is no To Kill a Mockingbird but I felt it was worth reading. It starts out very slow but picks up as the story is told. It is probably a very true story.
Well, Scout's grown up now, and her point of view is that of a young twenty-something who is in that idealistic stage of life, when everything is black and white.  Atticus is still Atticus, but is a "plant" trying to find out what a group of his neighbors are up to. And Scout will have none of it. While not the beloved To Kill a Mockingbird of the award winning novel and Hollywood movie, it offers an inside look at what many good people in the South of the 40's and 50's were faced with when trying to maintain a career while trying to also follow their conscience, appearing to align with "the enemy" while just trying to figure out their plan. Scout espouses some fairly prejudicial points of view in that she makes her decisions without all the facts. So much truth lies in the shadows.<br/><br/> Scout's idealistic views of her father and a few  long time friends are shattered.  A great read, another slant on a southern town while racial tensions are bubbling to the surface.<br/><br/>I still love Scout and I still love Atticus. Even now that I know how human they both really are.
Some cute flashback sections of Scout as a kid, but ultimately a surprising defense of the unfortunate "separate but equal" Supreme Court decision.
Whoever decided to publish this manuscript should have left well enough alone and not diminished To Kill a Mockingbird--shame on you!
It was about as I expected: a rough draft that needed major editing.  However, I am glad I read it, and it doesn't detract from Mockingbird or Harper Lee.
I enjoyed the first half much better than the second half, but that is just a personal preference. Excellent writing. Worth the read and worth waiting for
the author was correct to leave this unpublished and go forth only with her second attempt at a novel, To Kill A Mockingbird.
There wasn't much of a plot, the characters were not developed, and the theme of racism was vague and is ambiguous. And whatever happened to Boo Radley??
The storyline and writing are superb, as expected. I prefer this one, Go Set a Watchman, to To Kill A Mockingbird. I'm not one of those TKAM fans now pearl clutching and getting the vapors over Atticus Finch coming more into focus as a real human and less of a fictional civil rights Zelig blank slate anyone could make presumptions about. (Which, in my humble opinion, was always more of a halo effect from Gregory Peck and his movie portrayal. It's likely had any other actor played Atticus, there would not have been such cottage industry of genuflection over a simple book about a girl coming of age and learning her father is mere mortal.)<br/><br/>However, I am disappointed in the quality of the actual book. It is a cheap book club version, with rough, poor quality paper and sides that are rough cut, prototypical of a low quality run intended to only garner money for the publisher. Thus, it's not a keeper for my bookshelf, and I'll donate it to a school or public library.
Like most, I was apprehensive about reading a book which might denigrate my childhood "dream father".  Reading Watchman was a revelation.  I like Mockingbird no less, but realize now that it is really a story for children.....Mockingbird engenders good citizenship and high ideals.  These are qualities we SHOULD encourage.  Watchman is a book for all adults who will remember well the moment they realized that their idolized parent had clay feet.  In Jean's case, the only thing that bothered me was that she kept the blinders on as long as she did.  Her father and possible fiance were dreadful monstrosities in her visit home, but it is hard to believe that her father's weak character was not evident to her long before this particular visit.  Jean/Harperr's realization that the world she chose was a better place than the one she was born to is another affirmation to all adults who have chosen a path different than their birthplace and have chosen to create their "families" with people who share similar ethics and moral compasses - regardless of a lack of common dna.
some of the pages were either not in order or missing.  some of the conversations in the book were not clear.  from all the hype, maybe I expected more.
Not nearly as compelling as To Kill  Mockingbird. Interesting to see Scout as a young woman, but not enough conflict in the story to make it worthwhile.
I didn't love this book, it had it moments but I think it was because I saw glimpses of To kill a Mocking Bird, Not sorry I read it, but didn't love it.
So inspirational and thought-provoking. Released at the perfect time and in the right order. My love of Atticus is intact. Put my big girl pants on too.
I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this book.  All the reviews and information released before the publication date had me hesitating.  Then my husband thought I would like to read it so he bought it for me as a gift.<br/><br/>My hesitations were well founded.  It's just not well-written.  The pace of the novel is so slow that it is almost glacial.  The story will move along very slowly and then the main characters will spend a number of pages going over events from the past.  It doesn't seem to want to move along.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe the same person who wrote TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD wrote this book (even it was a first draft or whatever).  Part of me wishes that her editor had done a lot of work on this book.<br/><br/>This book does not make me think less of the characters since they just seem so remote from the original characters...almost no connection at all.<br/><br/>So, in a word, it was disappointing.  But, I guess it wasn't surprising since so much had been revealed about the book ahead of time.
The novel seemed lacking in depth. If I had not read, To Kill a Mockingbird, I otherwise could not have felt engaged with the characters in this novel.
It's hard to believe this was written by the author of To Kill a Mockingbird. Sadly, except for two or three brief segments, this is not worth reading.
I went in with high expectations and it did not do it for me. Exploration of 'Scout's' views on life was too long winded and robbed from the storyline.
Not as good as her other book which is one of my favorites.Don't know what I expected, but definitely was not Harper Lee at her best.Very disappointed.
As an eleven year old, To Kill a Mockingbird supplied me with everything I had ever wanted in a story-adventure, a narrator I adored, a setting I could envision, and the sense of wonder at the world. When I learned of Go Set a Watchman, eleven year old me screamed in utter joy. Scout Finch has remained one of my favorite literary heroines, and I was thrilled at the chance to see her as an adult. I was not disappointed. She was everything I imagined she would be-just as feisty, just as uncouth at times, and still fighting against conforming to all the norms a stringent society would box her into if possible.<br/> I read Go Set a Watchman for Scout, and read it knowing this was Harper Lee’s first attempt at writing with this character. I did not compare the story, I did not dissect it, I simply enjoyed her first effort with Scout Finch. For me, it was a history lesson in To Kill a Mockingbird-I now know its origin, and I know the first kernel Harper Lee spun in her palm to create a book and character I love.
For my taste not well written -- immature ,character dialog often not believable, jerky<br/>in connecting all parts. Too bad it was " found".
Got the book for my Mother In-Law and she was very happy with the book and the service and time it took to receive thanks for a pleasurable expeirence
Very disappointed. Can't believe Harper Lee wrote this book and To Kill A a Mockingbird. Going to re-read Mockingbird to feel better. So disappointed.
Cumbersome, didactic.  Jean Louise (Scout) cannot find where she believes.  Words are put in Atticus's mouth that are not his.  Wish I hadn't read it.
There's been a lot of controversy surrounding the publication of GO SET A WATCHMAN, which has been universally recognized as the first draft of what would eventually become Harper Lee's magnificent TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. WATCHMAN, written several years before MOCKINGBIRD, tells the story of 26-year-old Jean Louise Finch who returns to her childhood home of Maycomb, Alabama to visit her 72-year-old father, Atticus Finch. At first, the visit is bathed in the patina of memories and nostalgia - Jean Louise remembers the smells, the sounds, and the people she grew up with, and she resents the changes that have taken place (Atticus has left the house where Jean Louise was born and built himself a new place that doesn't quite feel the same). The first third of the novel is slow-paced and wistful, with Jean Louise flirting with childhood friend and maybe-fiancé, Hank Clinton, now her father's law partner. She spars with her Aunt Alexandra (who berates her for wearing "slacks" in town) and h... Read more
I read Harper Lee’s novel, Go Set a Watchman, on the day of its release. Given all the publicity about this book, I was curious and wanted to read for myself whether it was as finely written as To Kill a Mockingbird. It is not. I found myself thinking often as I read the narrative that the text lacked the benefits that come from the expert work of a talented editor. While there are some interesting themes of blindness, paternalism and maturity, none of them satisfied me. The prose was didactic, and the dialogue weak. While the reprised characters in this novel are more complex than in the earlier novel, they are also more ordinary and less heroic. A wise editor would have steered the author toward finer prose, improved dialogue, and a better plot. Perhaps that’s exactly what happened decades ago. Sate your curiosity if you wish, but there are many finer books to read, and I can’t recommend this one.<br/><br/>Rating: Two-star (I didn’t like it)
This is genius.  It is deeply relevant today, and my only regret is it was not published when it was written. The world would have been better for this book being everywhere, earlier. However, I fully believe the world was not ready for it then.<br/><br/>This book does something unexpectedly competent. It draws a clear line between the integrity of a human, and the integrity of a human's beliefs. The typical clarity of Lee's language and form supports the clarity of the account she relates of Scout's homecoming and rediscovery of her home through adult eyes. It is a testament to how much better the world is that this book is controversial in today's American climate of rediscovered instutionalized racism. <spoiler> I hate to use the hackneyed word "visceral" but this book's horror and disgust read like the naked lunch of innocence, only someone who has experienced betrayal can dissect the experience so clearly and transmit it as effectively as Lee does. So grateful for this book.
Disappointed in the story.  So different from "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Maybe I better go back and reread it and maybe I would enjoy it more.
most boring book i ever read. didn't even care that Atticus was portrayed as a racist. the only good thing was when scout talked about being a child.
I know the hoopla about Atticus being a segregationist caused a lot of people to refuse to read this book. It's a shame they didn't give it a chance.  It stands to reason he would have had those leanings, as he was still a product of his time and community.  Without his flaws coming to light, Scout would not have been able to represent the opposite viewpoints, and she would not have been able to grow from under her father's shadow.  Atticus in Mockingbird was an ideal superhero.  Atticus in Watchman was a normal, flawed human, which allowed Scout, formally the worshipful student, to become the teacher.  All heroes must fall so another may rise up who is equipped to deal with the always changing world.  It takes generations to affect social change, and I think Harper Lee knew that when she wrote this.  Whether the story resonates because of social change or because of the child coming into her own, this was a great story with a great message.
Pre-ordered cause couldn't wait for it to come out.  Read it in one night.  No surprises since I have been reading the reviews, but loved this book.
Loved it from beginning to end! Never a slow moment...could have read it cover to cover in one sitting. Thank you Miss Harper. Glad to have met you.
Most interesting as a literary artifact. None of the characters were likeable. Many metaphors were heavy-handed (Scout wore black, white, and grey.)
It was fascinating to read this and consider it the precursor to "To Kill a Mockingbird". What a difference an editor's suggestion can make.
Loved this book. I read Mockingbird again just before I received Watchman. I love them both and put them on my "Excellent" read again shelf.
As fine a book as To Kill A Mockingbird.  I have wished for another Harper Lee book many times since first reading ...Mockingbird, and this is as beautiful a message and as necessary a one as I could have hoped for.  Some parts actually brought me back my own father who was Mockingbird's Atticus to me. And I suspect still remains as such in my memory. But I was able to make the break before he left us just as Scout does in Watchman.  Neither of us has that beloved Watchman in our lives anymore and the world will never be as lovely and simple and black and white again.  But we wouldn't have it any other way.  This book is about courage and subtlety, about being young and expressing those things fully, thinking you would be letting yourself down to do otherwise.  And it is about aging and how the expression of your beliefs has more of a purpose than satisfying your own ego. It is about separating and evolving of parent and child, both symbolically and literally.  Definitely worth the read.
If you love "To Kill A Mockingbird" do not read this.  There was a reason Harper Lee choice not to publish this.  Wish I had never read it.
Oh, poor Harper Lee. Much better to be remembered for the exquisite and nuanced "Mockingbird" and not this dug-up manuscript published when the author is frail and not capable of standing up to the people who are supposed to look out for her best interests and not their own. The last third of this book consists almost entirely of characters speaking in great block paragraphs about their points of view on issues related to race--a very cheap and unrealistic way of addressing characters and issues. It reminded me of reading "The Jungle" and reaching the end, where the whole story turns into a long and dreary lecture. The best parts of this book are the ones in which Jean Louise recalls episodes from her childhood. You can then see why her original editor is said to have told Lee to go back and write a different book from this character's POV. I felt that this book added nothing to one's understanding of "Mockingbird" or of Atticus or even of Scout/Jean Louise.
This book was written before ""To Kill a Mockingbird", but was set at a later time, when Atticus was elderly and crippled with arthritis, and Jean Louise (Scout) was a grown woman.<br/>After "To Kill a Mockingbird", I expected greater things of this book than I encountered. I believe it is a product of its time (and therefore not timeless), in that it was a rather naïve attempt to be "nice" to the Blacks while regarding them as "children" who are incapable of holding positions of power in ruling bodies.<br/>Atticus remains a staunch defender of justice, but unlike Scout, he is not colour blind.<br/>Dr Finch, brother of Atticus, and Aunt Alexandra, their sister, feature strongly, with varying degrees of eccentricity, which Scout finds both amusing and annoying. But it is through Dr Finch's ramblings that Atticus's behavior is explained to Scout - which I thought was a rather cumbersome method of getting the point across.<br/>All in all, I give it three stars. Worth reading? To satisfy curiosity maybe.
I will admit TKAM is not my most beloved book ever. Maybe it is because my heritage is as deep south as Jean Louise's, I never really bought off on the St. Atticus theory.<br/><br/>While Go Set a Watchman is far more aligned with a standard coming of age story than a supplement to TKAM, it stands out on its own merits. The writing is more scattered and themes far more obfuscated than the great work. I can see this as the fledgling novel that preceded the classic. Controversy or not, Go Set a Watchman is a contribution to southern literature. It would have been a shame if it had never been read.<br/><br/>As for Atticus, he seems to be more what I thought he should have been before. His opinions were no more new to me than the sun rising in the east.  These were the opinions of the deep South that I had always known, despite the fact that I, too, was born color blind. Now Atticus seems real to me. Flawed, perhaps, but still wise enough to let go of Scout and embrace Jean Louise.
So sad for Harper Lee that this book was ever published. To Kill A Mockingbird was my all time favorite book until, "The Kite Runner," was published. It is still very important to me and this book was a big YAWN. I'm so disappointed in "Scout" as an adult...or should I say "grown bodied child"?  She is self absorbed and obnoxious. Her beliefs about racial injustice has more to do with her childish need to remain a child with all of her pretense of social responsibility reflected in the fact that her old nanny LIVED the life...and she never realized the difference. She wants her lovable nanny back. Apparently she learned nothing at college. This is not a good read to provide insight into racial injustice or the fact that she finally comes to terms with the fact that her father is not perfect. Instead of reading this book, read TKAM again! That book illuminates the true talent of Harper Lee as a writer.
Really disappointing although that was almost inevitable. The richness of language was missing and almost immature in its execution. The literary heroics of Atticus is completely compromised in this narrative. The veiled attempt to justify his racist perspective with a desire to understand the ideology of the confederate south missed the authenticity mark.<br/><br/>Scout, despite her advanced years, was more immature here than in Mockingbird if that is possible. Perhaps  her confused persona reflects feminism of the time. She just seems lost, not something To be expected from any child of Atticus.<br/><br/>Where was Calpurnia? Her presence is a balancing force was missed.<br/><br/>Primarily though, the layered complication of family growth in the midst of racial tension and complicated times is altogether lost amidst the whiny nature of the protagonist<br/><br/>Glad to have read it but this is time I will never get back. Could have been cleaning the lint from the dryer...
Disappointing after all the hoopla - just didn't grab me at all - Scout just seemed like a pain in the neck & the others didn't seem real.  sorry!
I was very disappointed in this.  I did not think the story line flowed well & there were inconsistencies when referring to incidents in 1st book.
I was disappointed.  It lack the cannot wait to see what is on the next page.  What can Scout get into next?  There was none of that in this book.
The Watchman book read, to me, as though Harper Lee was describing herself.  In fact, I'm going to go as far as saying that maybe the reason she never wrote another book other than these two about Jean Louise is because she finally came to terms with who she is and what her Maycomb/NY world views were.  I prefer the Mockingbird book over the Watchman book - the Mockingbird book obviously had more effort and editorial assistance involved, where the Watchman book was merely a good first draft, and I would have asked for exposition of all sorts of unresolved issues remaining in the book. I get that Atticus' and the southern community's thinking about the descendants of slaves reflected their 1950's sensibilities and times, although you could see that Harper put more thought and analysis into these issues in Mockingbird.  Also, Atticus is more fully fleshed out in Mockingbird but he is left barely one-dimensional in the Watchman book.  For me, the two books didn't fit together as well because the Watchman book wasn't properly written.
I absolutely loved To Kill A Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman did not disappoint, although a bit darker in the middle.  Loved this book.
I thought the book very insightful as to Southern thinking when the book was first written.  Taking that into account I enjoyed reading the book.
This book is a complete scam.  Poorly written, slow plot and hard to finish.  The publishers pulled the wool over our eyes on this book.
The author's writing is between good and okay. Mainly because compared to To Kill a Mockingbird, it has a long way to go. But since is supposed to be the first novel, that's understandable.<br/><br/>A decent read.... quite different from To Kill a Mockingbird. It misses the charm of Scout's first person narrative and takes place years later. It recounts Jean Louise (grown-up Scout)'s return trip to Maycomb County after having lived in New York. She's basically disappointed in the direction that race relations have taken and especially disappointed in her perceived father's outlook. I guess the bottom line is, things are complicated.<br/><br/>There are inklings of the wonderful narration and point of view in To Kill a Mockingbird, and it's interesting to see reality set in as Scout is now a grown up. Her hero turns out to have clay on his feet and she has to come to grips with it.<br/><br/>All in all, To Kill a Mockingbird is still one of my all time favorite books, and I'm not sorry I read this one either
This book just didn't appeal to me but I'm unable to explain why.  The only good part was Jean Louise blowing her top at Henry and her family.
It reads like a term paper that written the night before it was due.  For fans of To Kill a Mockingbird, this is nothing but a disappointment.
I enjoyed the book until Scout's ending. Atticus was a disappointment as well. Another state's rights book trying to cover up racism.
We all grow up. When we were children our parents, teachers and others were like gods. As we age we find their faults. We disagree with them. They are no longer the towering figures we saw as children. They are human beings. Such it is for Scout and for all of us.<br/>As our daily news reports disagreements over historical flags and their meanings, I think this book is very timely (regardless of it's mysterious publication tale).<br/>Some minor complaints - the last quarter of the book has much speechifying. Some motivations are muddled. But the voice is still of Harper Lee. There is much humor and the recollections of youth are magnificent. Does it hold a candle to "Mockingbird"? Well, of course not. "Mockingbird" may be the greatest piece of American fiction. This is still a worthy work. I have many books by great authors. Are all great? No, but each is a piece of a body of work. It is just great to hear her voice again.
This should encourage many new writers to push ahead when the first effort doesn't make the grade!  Out of this came a novel of rare quality!
Now I understand why Harper Lee did not publish this book years ago. It was not well structured , seemed to end abruptly, very disappointing.
Not what I expected from Harper Lee. To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book. The writing was rough in this book. Definitely wasn't edited.
I keep waiting for something to happen and it never did. Just character exploration. I was disappointed having enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird.
This book was ok.  I would not say it was intriguing.  Perhaps I just expected too much.  I just did not enjoy it like I thought that I would
Don't let those who take an excerpt out of context tell you about this novel. I enjoyed it and it did not ruin the original character for me.
Nothing happens in this book other than scout learns her father has racist views. Such a disappointment and waste of time. Hated it!
As much as people focus on the apparent change in Atticus, the whole story is much more complex, and the book is well worth reading.
I read 'To kill a Mockingbird' as a set book in school and like most people, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was beautifully written and and it held your attention keenly. You could almost imagine yourself in those times. Many of us became attorneys thanks to the characters like Atticus Finch. So, I succumbed to the hype and pre-ordered 'Go set a Watchman'. It is a decent read. I was engaged and I wanted to find out how it would end. It isn't however on par with 'To kill a Mockingbird'. You can almost tell that this was a first draft of sorts and that an editor would have asked the author to develop certain bits more. I didn't experience the nervousness I felt with 'To kill a Mockingbird' where I couldn't wait to read further and I was afraid that things weren't going to turn out right. All of that said, I still enjoyed 'Go set a Watchman' and I would recommend it if you're a Harper Lee fan, like I still am. I'm off to get a Kindle copy of 'To kill a Mockingbird' so that I can read and enjoy it again.
There are currently 903 reviews of Harper Lee’s ‘Go Set a Watchman’ on Amazon UK and 7,622 on Amazon US. This level of interest is clearly generated by widespread appreciation of ‘To Kill a Mocking Bird’. It’s evidence that name recognition far exceeds content in determining a book’s appeal.<br/><br/>Compared to ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ this book is flat and dreary. Its main, and very valid, theme of southern compromised racial attitudes only appears after page 100, and is treated in a very thin account of Atticus’s presence at a meeting Jean Louise deems racist.<br/><br/>Her subsequent rant at her uncle, at Hank, and at the beloved Atticus himself does portray the well-known phenomenon of self-righteous indignation in denunciation of others’ moral failures, and the muted response of those dealing with moral compromise. But this is the only notable section of the book – the rest isn’t worth the read. Publication may have achieved commercial gain, but hasn’t delivered any literary contribution.
At first I had a difficult time getting into the book.  it seemed to start out as an innocuous love story between Scout and her hometown sweetheart. Scout is living in New York, and having a difficult time adjusting to small town, Alabama when she returns for a visit.  However the book makes a remarkable jump as she discovers secrets about her beloved father and boyfriend.  Scout's eyes are opened to what is occurring in the South during this time, and realizes her father and boyfriend are an integral part of the system designed to maintain the status quo between African Americans and whites.  The arguments and discussions between Scout, Atticus, and her uncle present an "explanation" of why the characters think and behave the way they do.  Being from the south, and now a senior citizen, I began to finally get into the mind of how Atticus and people of his persuasion saw things.  It is not acceptable to my way of thinking, but having words put to thoughts was helpful to my understanding.
I believe there was a good reason that this was published so many years after her first book. I'd  say skip this one and reread Mockingbird.
I only read the first two chapters and the first page of the 3rd chapter.  I am a huge To Kill A Mockingbird fan. This was a disappointment.
I really enjoyed the character development and the suspense  over Jems demise.<br/>Not what I expected but would recommend as a quick read.
It was a bit odd to read a continuation of a story you loved so well, and at the same time knowing that this contonuation was actually written first.  So, the wonderful To Kill A Mockingbird was conceived after the characters had aged twenty years or so.  To me, Go Set a Watchman was disappointing.  The bar was set so high by To Kill a Mockingbird that a letdown was not surprising.  I did enjoy the book, but I don't feel that it is gre a t.  I wasn't very disappointed, as many were,  in the imperfections in an older  Addicus Finch.  It was just that no one had really gone through a great change except Scout, who moved to New York, saw  a different way of life and was  disillusioned about life in her hometown, her father, and others she had grown up with.  Only she had changed. I am glad Gregory Peck didn't live to learn how Addicus "turned out". I suppose without "Watchman there never would have been a To Kill a Mockingbird, so thank goodness for Harper Lee and Go Set a Watchman!!
If you're expecting a novel as riveting as To Kill a Mockingbird, be prepared to be disappointed.  That being said, Go Set a Watchman stands as a good read in its own right.  The reader, through Scout's eyes, explores the nearly unbelievable apparent shift in Atticus' attitude from defender-no-matter-what of Tom Robinson in TKaM to a man who stands against the civil rights movement in the new novel.  We do learn a lot more about Scout, Uncle Jack, Aunt Alexandra, and indeed, Atticus in this novel. It's worth taking the time to find out how these characters changed or remained static.<br/>  Since this novel was written before TKaM (even though it's a sequel), and since it was never revised by an editor, there are a few inconsistencies when comparing the facts in the two novels, where things are mentioned in Go Set a Watchman, that never actually occur in TKaM.  But, these are small potatoes.<br/>  Overall, any TKaM enthusiast should complete his/her experience by reading Go Set a Watchman.
I do not think Watchman should have been published. The attitudes of even its most progressive characters are offensive by today's standards, and it shatters the image of one of the most beloved characters in American literature.<br/><br/>If people were to approach the book with clinical curiosity, with the goal of learning about the evolution of an American classic, then perhaps the legacy of Mockingbird would be safe. But Watchman will be mistakenly seen as a modern-day sequel to Mockingbird rather than as a sixty-year-old first draft of Mockingbird.<br/><br/>So, if you have any fondness for Mockingbird, do yourself a favor and don't risk its place in your heart.
I was disappointed in this book. It was initially kind of entertaining, but ultimately I found it really boring and unnecessarily strident.
The characters were rich and the writing was well done. I had heard mixed reviews and was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the book.
I didn't enjoy it. It got a bit interesting about halfway through but then it faded.  Scout made me angry too with her self-righteous ways.
I'm conflicted on my opinion of this book--As I loved To Kill A Mockingbird, but I don't think that this book should have been published. The conflicting reports of the possible elder abuse of Harper Lee made me not want to read this. My thoughts on this boil down to that if certain reports are to be believed, this is a first draft of TKAM, and Harper Lee decided to scrap this version of the characters and re-write to the book we all knew and loved. Whether it was her publisher, Truman Capote, or Lee herself, the most interesting parts of the book are Jean Louise's flashbacks to her childhood, and I can see why those parts were at one point taken out and fleshed out to a full novel. I was not really interested in her romantic life, conflicts of her vision of her much loved father, Atticus Finch, or her griping of her aunt. My takeaway is that this is a standalone piece and does not affect my views of the characters of TKAM.
This is a terrific read. I do think people misunderstood "Mockingbird" and that has caused some controversy about that book and this. Harper Lee finally makes that clear toward the very end of the book. Atticus Finch is the same man in both books, but in "Mockingbird" we saw Atticus the defense attorney, the man who is in love with the law. In "Watchman" we see the Atticus who was born and raised in the deep South in racist traditions that exist today (as we see in daily news reports). I see no contradiction between the two representations of the man. I was shocked at the way Scout rages at her father when she becomes aware of his concerns about the Civil Rights Movement. No daughter of the South I ever knew would even think to speak to her father in such a way. But it is necessary to the story so that at the end we all can learn a valuable lesson about those times and gain some understanding of the massive social change in the South that continues to this day.
If you read this book based on it's own merits, not as a comparison, it is clear why the publisher originally did not what to publish it.  A lot of time that should have been spent on evolving the story, is instead spent proselytizing. Also, while I understand that the "N" word was used more openly during that time period, blacks were also referred to, more respectfully, as coloreds. I am not black, but still find the continuos use of this word in the book offensive. The story itself was not enough to capture my interest.<br/><br/>If you choose to read it as a comparison to "To Kill a Mockingbird", it shows how a writer can grow. It was also enjoyable to get to spend more time with Scout, and Atticus. I really enjoyed those characters in TKAM. If the publisher had chosen to edit and tweak GSAW, to fit in with TKAM, it could have been an excellent book. I really loved TKAM, I don't if it could have ever stood up to it. I still would have read GSAW, having read TKAM.
After reading this book, I understand why Harper Lee never wanted this book published.  I think people wore her down until she agreed.  I feel like they used her just to make money.  Those that hounded her to get it published knew the author's name would make it an excellent seller, a money maker.  It's not that I thought it wasn't a good book to read but it wasn't the same quality that "To Kill A Mockingbird" was, imo.<br/><br/>I agree with others, if this had been published before her other book, it wouldn't have done anything for me.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars but I did give it 3 stars.  A lot of people didn't like the way Atticus Finch was portrayed but I look at it in a different way.  Things were a certain way in the past and we can look at things today and see how far we have come and also see how far we have yet to go.  People evolve, what they didn't consider as unacceptable at that time, they now look upon those things, that transpired,  as no longer acceptable.
I can understand why this novel was not published earlier. It's very clear to the reader, that it just didn't have the power to captivate. The characters were not very likeable. They didn't have the power to draw you in,  & make you become attached to them. For the most part, they all appeared to be a little eccentric. I didn't lose my opinion of Atticus. He did what needed to be done.  Atticus Finch was a good man. He was not perfect, like all of us. The editor did the right thing by making her focus on her childhood years in, To Kill A Mockingbird. We were all touched by the innocence of youth. Go Set A Watchman, lacked appeal. I will forever love, Mockingbird, and be thankful that, Watchman, wasn't published until now. Harper Lee needed the practice.
She's a great writer but it's impossible to come close to one of the greatest novels of our time. I'm glad I read it but was disappointed.
I was not excited by this book. Unless I missed something reading it I found it very boring and following the main idea of the book  Sorry
I know other reviewers have not given this book a good review and I feel that isn't fair. First off if you're expecting another "To Kill a Mockingbird" you're going to be disappointed, no book will ever compare to Harper Lee's first story. The book was more of a coming of age story for Scout, and is more about the time in your life when you realize how parents are different from you. I personally connected to Scout in this story more than I did with the first book. The historical issues that come up in the book are also interesting, because it shows different viewpoints of those issues from people in that period of time. Atticus does have some surprising opinions, but don't be swayed by the news stories that claim he is full blown racist, that was blown out of proportion before the book was even released. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and think it provides some new sides to my favorite literary characters.
Disappointed...the political views were consistent with the time period but needed to be projected onto characters with more explanation.
It is very confusing, the book seems like Harper Lee's notes printed. There is no way a great novel like TKAM can even be related to that
The author who wrote To Kill A Mockingbird could not have written this book. Both the voice and the syntax are vastly different.
Not worth the wait.
Were it not for the story that was spun out of this raw material, I don't think this read would get much notice. The writing is amateurish, and understandably, it is the blueprint of which a better story was made. Thank the Divine forces for that..because TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great story and all told from the innocence of a child is a far more effective way to outlay the environment of racial hostility that was the American South. With that said, this is a curiosity piece and bound to make millions. I only question the way this "lost" manuscript came into being so many decades later, but only a few years after Alice Lee (Nelle's older, lawyer sister) passed away and no longer held the keys to everything Nelle intended to keep private.<br/>Ultimately, this is a passable read that simply has our collective curiosity, and the publisher knew it would $cash in--and it has!
I didn't enjoy this read and the ending was very abrupt and unsatisfing. I think I'll forget about this and focus on the first.
Had to read this, of course, but the publishers were right to turn Ms. Lee down way back when she first wrote the book.  It's very dull.
Actually, I was disappointed in it. I finished it, but some oft friends said they didn't like<br/>It and didn't even finish reading it!
Not what I expected having waited so long for a Harper Lee publication.  Odd that it was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Well written but very disheartening to have my view of Atticus tarnished. As a Southern woman, I could relate to Scout's moral dilemmas.
You must read this just for its historical importance. An easy and predictable read. But only because time and history has overtaken it.
Was excited to read this as To Kill a Mockingbird is my all time favorite book. Was very disappionted, and didn't even finish the book.
I find it hard to believe Harper Lee wrote this very underwhelming novel unless she didn't write To Kill a Mockingbird either, that is.
Wouldn't recommend, it will ruin To Kill a Mockingbird for you if you are a lover of the novel.  Be prepared for stong racial language.
Struggled to get through this but I did finish it.  Would not recommend because it is too confusing.  Hard book to keep my interest in.
I enjoyed the humor but also the insight into changing attitudes in the South in the 50's.  It is certainly a timely publication today!
While Scout has matured, I find her naive of the world around her. On the other hand, I like Atticus even more than after TKAM. I always thought he was intelligent and kind. After reading this story, I find him even more than intelligent and kind. His depth of understanding of racial, social, political, and familial issues exceeds most people of his time and generation. Henry was a nice surprise. He evolved into quite a good man.<br/><br/>I think Ms. Lee accurately portrayed a southern family regarding community relationships and the issue of bigotry for one family in their social caste.<br/><br/>Now, I will go back and reread both books and then review the movie. Bravo, Harper Lee!<br/><br/>Best Wishes,<br/>S. K. Moore
Shows a beloved and revered hero, Atticus FInch, as a complex, flawed human who reacts in human, complex and ultimately disappointing ways to a quickly changing culture. Atticus is a product of punishing post Civil War Reconstruction poverty and racism. A grownup Scout(Jean Louise) who grew up idolizing her crusading lawyer father, is disappointed by his acceptance of structural prejudice and racism in a small Southern town during a time of revolutionary Civil Rights changes. Those whose experience of those years lie outside the deep South fail to forgive Atticus for wanting justice equality under the law and a civilized, naturally evolving improvement in race relations rather than the disruptive, federal interventions which resulted in violence, and a permanent racial divide, instead of evolution and uplifting of all the poor and disenfranchised of all races in the deep South, post Civil War.
I tried to like this novel. Really, I did. However, by the end I felt cheated.<br/><br/>I am going to keep this short because I don't want to give myself a bigger headache.<br/><br/>-Why did I have to wait until chapter 17 to hear Atticus's Confederate voice?<br/>-He defended Tom Robinson because he loves the law and had to bring order to disorder.<br/>-Scout, the moral compass of the novel, had her fair, liberal voice smacked out of her by Uncle Jack. ("The Second Sex" anyone?)<br/>-She returned to Maycomb to find her true self, and bifurcate it from her father's shadow.<br/>-First, she let Atticus have it, then they drive off into the sunset.<br/><br/>"Titus Andronicus" is despised by many Bard purists, but it has an adhesive that holds it together. Unfortunately, "Watchman" seems to be held together with tape.<br/><br/>What happened to this novel? (Sigh)
I loved re-visiting a grown-up Jean Louise aka "Scout" and her father, Atticus Finch. It was hard for her, as it was to those who loved "To Kill A Mockingbird" to see Atticus take a stance that seemed incongruent with the man and father she'd/we'd loved. But I'm old enough to remember the Supreme Court decision and the times in which it occurred--to say nothing of the rhetoric and feelings throughout the South when faced with de-segregation. My 8th grade class was discussing it (West Texas), and I finally used the argument, "Would you want to be treated the way the Negroes of this town are treated?" Another student (also a girl) used a legal argument, i.e. "A Supreme Court decision says segregation's illegal and that's that." The teacher commented on our different styles, i.e. emotional vs legal, and looking back, I see that it's been a fundamental principle of my life. I think subsequent events would've disgusted Atticus.
Tedious.  The author used this book to rant.  As I read the book, I endured Harper Lee lecturing the reader on the evils of prejudice.
Not at all what I expected. I guess after all the hype I was looking for more about the previous characters and what happened to them.
This book should never have been published.  It does not stand up to the legacy of Mockingbird, and clearly, the editing was lacking.
Loved the "historical" descriptions.  Need to read again type of book and I will, no doubt about it.  Found  I was totally engrossed.
Disappointed in the ending. Interesting story for the most part.<br/>But disturbing after enjoying "To Kill a Mockingbird" .
Not at all what I expected but much, much to ponder.<br/><br/>Please, go find another.  I need more . . .
Good book, but not a great one.  It was a foregone conclusion that this book would probably not live up to it's earlier classic cousin.  That said, it is well written but in my opinion suffers from no real story.  It seems to be just a bit of icing on top of a cake that didn't need it.  Worth checking out but not a masterpiece.  There is still some doubt as to whether the author even wanted it released. At this date it is a moot point but consider how much money was to be made with this work and why did Miss Lee not release it earlier?  Also consider that it was only released after the death of the authors sister and "advisor" and Miss Lees affairs being channelled through new hands.  Despite all this suspicious activity, it is not a bad book.  Incidentally, despite what you may have heard in the media, Atticus Finch does not reveal himself as a racist, but more honestly as a man of his times-much better educated than most of his peers.
The first few chapters were not well written - all "tell" and no "show." Then the writing improved tremendously.<br/>To appreciate this book (like TKAM) you must take it for what it is: a story of coming of age. Too many people get confused and think it's about civil rights or racial justice. Those are extremely important, but not in the way many think.<br/>My own life parallels this book as I came of age in the South and tried to reconcile my beliefs about justice taught me by parents, teachers, etc. and finding them grossly violated by society when it came to the treatment of Black people. That's a very difficult and fundamental thing to process.<br/>Seeing this book as an allegory of coming of age and the often terrible discrepancies between ideals and reality makes it a powerful and insightful book. Don't be confused by the racist dialog and sentiments. Fact is, they're the same ones I heard and said when I came of age.
Worst book I've read all year & I read two or three books a week!  No substance.  Harper Lee must have needed the money - for shame!
Was interested to see HL's first work.  Interesting to see how this book became TKAM.  Good read, but nothing in comparison to TKAM.
It's a giddy pleasure to have this book six decades later. Our whole family is reading it and getting into the discussion. What fun!
Prior to reading Watchman, I had heard of the surprise and disappointment of others in regards to Atticus and was unnerved as Atticus was just like my father when I was young, just as much as Atticus was like my father in Watchman as I grew older too. In Go Set A Watchman, I saw my own family's growth and my own with understanding racism. I was born in 1960, lived in the south and was taught never to take advantage of those less fortunate, to judge a person by their morale character not their color, belief or money. And yet I too found racism in those that gave me those morales. Could it be that the destruction of racism itself evolves? While To Kill A Mocking Bird awoke people to injustice and racism in the world, I believe that Watchman is a more personal story and can awake the reader to take a look at one own self and realize that we are still evolving with this issue.
No second novel ever had more to live up to than "Go Set A Watchman." Especially as "To Kill A Mockingbird" is the great American novel up to this point. Ultimately, "Watchman" had to disappoint and one senses Miss Lee would have done better to venture further out from "To Kill A Mockingbird."  Reading this book, one feels as if upon an airplane speeding upon a runway without ever taking off.  While Miss Lee's skill with words remains, sadly, "Go Set A Watchman" lacks its predecessor's charms and compelling narrative.  While maintaining Scout's point of view, she is grown now, not as interesting and what she observes is nowhere near as interesting as "To Kill A Mockingbird."  While I disagree with any notion Miss Lee has destroyed Atticus Finch's integrity, she has made him boring along with the rest of the novel that feels, in the end, as it did in the beginning: As if it never had a chance.
Terrible book- do not waste your time or money.  Harper Collins pulled a major deception on the American people- all of us thinking we were about to read another 'Mockingbird' masterpiece.  In reality this book is an amateurish rant by Lee about her views on the South she that was her home.  You don't even like Jean Louise at all- naive, arrogant, condescending, immature, flighty and easily persuaded off her principles- if they can be called principles at all.  I read to the end- painfully- just to see if there was a redeeming moment somewhere.  Not.  Terrible book.  Makes one wonder if the same author wrote Mockingbird.  Harper Collins did not do Harper Lee any favors by publishing- it should have stayed in the safe deposit box it was recovered from.
The first 3/4 of the book was very enjoyable: light tone, sometimes humorous, masterfully written.  I was so baffled by the last quarter that I reread that portion of the book.  I believe that it is an apology for the attitudes toward and treatment of black people by white people in the South during the time in which the book was set.  It seems that EITHER Harper Lee set out to have the book end that way and couldn't figure out how to get there from the quaint and appealing presentation of the early 3/4 and so tagged on the ending; OR that after writing the first 3/4, she wanted the book to have some larger purpose and tagged on the ending.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" is my all-time favorite novel.  It was my regard for Mockingbird that drove me to reread the last quarter of Watchman.  If I had known before reading Watchman that there would be this disjunction between the first and last parts, I probably would have read it anyway.
So Atticus ain't perfect, get over it.  I loved the book, but I understand why Lee's publisher suggested revisions.... revisions that would lead to an American classic.  However, I am grateful that the book was published.  It is like a tree.  It provides shade for so may different issues.  The book demonstrates the importance when writing to never marrying your first draft.  It provides a look, a deep look, at the realities of what Lee calls the Second Reconstruction and how the average southerner looked at the civil rights rulings of the 50's and 60's.  It explains so much about the culture of states rights and the power it had prior to the Civil War and still holds today, and finally, it provides the dangers of lionizing people who cannot quite stand on the pedestal we place them on.  It is a rich read and worth the time to help understand our neighbors who believe in a very limited government.  Go for it!<br/><br/>Frank Champine
It makes me think that her Editor was a MAJOR player in "To Kill a Mockingbird" being the classic novel that it was and is.
Very disappointing.  To Kill A mockingbird was far and away the better book.  I will read it again to override Watchman in my mind.
In a word....WOW !!  Beautifully written.  Makes you think.  A book I will re-read to fully appreciate the thought provoking ideas.
I especially appreciated the book in the context of the original Mockingbird, plus that of the biography The Mockingbird Next Door.
Can see why this book was originally not published.  It is a little preachy and needed another round of editing but glad I read it.
I am glad I read "Go, Set A Watchman". I found Lee's literary references very "Harper Lee". and with our background of respect for  the beloved"To Kill A Mockingbird", the biographical southern story was believable.(No comparison in the two novels..TKAM is superior.) Jean Louise was the "Christ" figure--in spite of her blasted cigarettes. She was the strong female liberator, progressive fighter for equal rights that Atticus became in the second novel. I hated the page with stereotypical comments about blacks--had trouble reading that page. And the fact that Atticus had some wishy-washy actions about "change"  was not as bad as the  fundamentalist, conservative politicians today, taking away voting rights and trying to keep minorities held back. The need for more positive change in race relations and treatment of minorities in the south (and U.S.) makes the book accurate then and relevant now.
I remember traveling back to a family home as a young adult and being amazed that the very tall tree wasn't as tall as I remember it, and at another time hearing shocking and perhaps scandalous information about a family member who was a prominent part of my childhood.  It was hard to accept and I found myself going through, perhaps, a grieving process.  GSaW portrayed Scout in just that circumstance of having to deal with some of life's realities. It is clear how TKaM came from GSaW and would be interesting to see the stories together in the mind of Harper Lee.  There are portions that are exquisitely written, and I'm glad it has been published. A must read for all TKaM fans. Be ready to be taken right along with Scout through a coming of age and realization of things as they are.  The last three chapters stand up beautifully and need to be read very carefully.
Boring book. Struggling to finish it. Have skimmed the last few chapters. Only a best seller because it was written by Harper Lee.
This book provokes a lot of feelings. Very much a truthful  depiction of the time period. Changes your views about each character.
Can understand why her "Mockingbird" publisher/editor told her to rewrite this story.  Should not have been published now.
"Mockingbird" is one of my all time favorite novels, so this was a little disappointing. It's a quick read and points you in the direction of where the characters are heading, but doesn't really get you there. It's really just a peek into what happens when Scout goes home as an adult and finds that things are not really the way she thought they were. Since Harper Lee is past the point where she is writing or even speaking publicly, we won't find out where she intended things to go, or if she ever had those intentions. I finished it in two readings, feeling vaguely unsettled and ultimately disappointed. On the upside, the characters of Scout and Alexandra were satisfying and so were Calpurnia and Scout's Uncle Jack. Lee did understand the basic contradiction of thinking you're not a racist even as you believe that people are automatically inferior based on their skin color, but I so wish she had gone further with it.
Should never have been released.  A weak 1st draft.  I don't think she really wanted it published after all these years.
It was very difficult for me to get interested and it certainly didn't hold my attention. The characters were not well developed.
This is not at all like her previous book. It makes me wonder if she even wrote the two. Obviously, I do not recommend this book.
As it often happens, the book does not come close to  her previous "To Kill A Mockingbird". It was a real disappointment!
I was disappointed and regretted paying as much as I did for this book. It wasn't worth the price, especially the Kindle edition.
I had a hard time staying interested.  There just wasn't much substance to this book.  The ending was very anticlimactic as well.
Too much of the "plot" was revealed beforehand to make it truly a surprise, but that didn't detract from the appeal. The writing was bumpy in parts, and I found some parts particularly disjointed, for example when Jean Louise is describing the scene in the courthouse. But as far as debunking the myth of the Great American Hero that was Atticus, I still found him an appealing character. Nothing can change the fact that he defended the law, and felt that all people had the right to equality under that law, regardless off his personal feelings or prejudices. Even in "Mockingbird" the townsmen were against him because while he may have been appointed by the court to defend Tom, he actually planned to DEFEND him. If anything, I found Uncle Jack to be annoying. Jean Louise was not the only one who found him difficult to understand at times.
Was disappointed after  To Kill A Mockingbird.  Suggest borrowing this one from a  Public Library not paying $$ for it.
I must admit that I read this book because of the hype, the fact that it was a "prequel" to To Kill A Mockingbird. It was mostly out of protest. Too many people I knew proclaimed they wouldn't read it because it trashed an icon of American literature, Atticus Finch. I didn't see that in the book. It's true that aspects of Atticus's life are revealed that are unpleasant, but he was very much a product of his time and environment. What I did discover was that this book is greatly inferior to the work published earlier, and it is no surprise that Harper Lee's editor told her to take it back and rework it extensively. The novel that became an American classic is vastly superior. Too much has been written about the discovery that Jean Louise (Scout) makes concerning her father for it to come as a surprise, but it was little more than the realization that parents are human beings with flaws as well as strengths.
I was disappointed, the book was no where near the quality of To Kill a Mocking Bird.  I can see why it wasn't published before.
Though this is touted as being the early version of To Kill a Mockingbird, it's far from the compelling read that Mockingbird is
I was disappointed. Her writing style is there, but in my estimation, the story is nowhere near "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Virtually unreadable.  It's only interesting because you can see the parts she pulled out as the basis of To Kill a Mockingbird.
I would not recommend the book.  It was a slow read and I was anxious to finish it so I could move on to more interesting works.
Not a fan of this book even though To Kill A Mockingbird was one of my most favorite books of all-time. Did not enjoy it at all.
I view GSAW as a warm-up for the book Harper Lee really wanted to write. As I read it, I felt she was in the process of discovering the deeper story. Perhaps because I was a young girl who hung on my father's every word and deed, I loved Scout's innocence in TKAM. That was her reality as a child. Now the reader can see her initial attempt at telling her story in GSAW, and I think it has merit. However, it is more preachy in the sense of flat out telling the reader what her "crossing" into a more mature understanding of her father meant for her. It's not always an easy journey, and I think that's where HL was when writing her first book. I don't mind that it's not as beautifully written as TKAM. I enjoyed watching her evolution as a writer and a person. I also think it reflects the period well and shows the idealism of many young adults.
I began this book with an open mind, knowing beforehand what it was going to be....BUT, by the time I was finished with this book, I was so aggravated that I had paid good money for it.  I still expected for there to be some hint of TKAM within the pages, or some recognizable writing style of H. Lee, but neither was to be found.  I did not recognize this author at all and am keeping the book, because I thoroughly believe that someday it will come out, that this whole book was some sort of HOAX.  There was no depth of story, nothing in character, it was flat and boring and made absolutely no sense in writing style.  I hated everything about this book, and feel gypped.
Broke my heart. Damaged my view of Atticus Finch. Had to immediately reread To Kill a Mockingbird afterwards.
I was disappointed, but maybe my expectations were too high.  I was, quite frankly, bored and didn't bother finishing the book.
Thought it was slow in the middle. The ending was very weak. Would not recommend. This book is riding on To Kill A Mockingbird.
Very simple story. Only relevant because it was written by Harper Lee.  Otherwise, not worth spending money to read this novel.
There is a very good reason this book went unpublished for 50+ years. There is nothing positive to say about Go Set a Watchman.
Harper Lee is a great American writer and I can see why she did not want this one released.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" was her masterpiece.  Her writing was more pronounced by then, it captured our imagination and drew us in with the characters.  "Go Set A Watchman" was okay but did not have the same imagery that led you to believe you were walking the same streets as the characters.  While it did not have the same depth, it was bit unsettling for me to understand that the Atticus (and others) were not really heroes as it seemed in "To Kill A Mockingbird".  For an adult who read this book during her childhood, it was sad and I may have to re-read "To Kill A Mockingbird" to realize the nuances I missed.  Harper Lee surely had foreshadowing linked to this first novel.  Bottomline, my opinion is that her stylistic writing was more developed with "To Kill A Mockingbird".
So you read Mockingbird in school or as a youth, and it changed you're perspective on things.<br/>How we judge one another.<br/>Injustices in our judicial system.<br/>The meaning of right and wrong, and how things that seem black and white are really grey.<br/>We owe this all to the great man called Atticus Finch.<br/>Mockingbird was such a great modern novel. A novel that resinates with you to this day. A novel that is in you're top 10 list. Written by an author that won a Pulitzer Prize!!<br/>Okay.<br/>Go set a Watchman is nothing like this.<br/>I wasn't expecting Mockingbird 2.0.<br/>I was just expecting a good story. I didn't get that at all.<br/>I won't go into details. You're not going to listen to me anyway.<br/>So read it .<br/>I suggest you get a copy at the library or a friend for free.<br/>Let me know what you think.<br/>I gave this 2 stars because Harper Lee earned a free pass.
As opposed to another reviewer, I can reject this.  Aside from any ethical issues, it's just not very good.  I couldn't become interested in any of the characters, I wasn't pulled forward by any semblance of a plot.  I can see why an editor saw promise in some of the writing and went on to help Harper Lee create TKAM.  Harper Lee can turn a phrase very well.  But clever writing is not enough incentive to finish a novel that has nothing going for it except notoriety.  If I want to experience bigots and narrow-minded people, I can do that in everyday life.  When I read, I want the experience to be bigger than life--to be what life could be, ideally.  Not goody-goody syrupy writing, but good people doing right under hard circumstances.  There was nothing to redeem this book--no moral, no entertainment.  I guess, just profit for someone.
This was a book club pick and I was not at all looking forward to it because of all the negative reviews. I hadn't read To Kill a Mockingbird since high school, so I decided to read that first before tackling Watchmen.  Loved, loved, loved Mockingbird...such fantastic writing.  I had forgotten so much of the storyline that it was fun to rediscover it.  Then I read Watchmen right after.  While the writing wasn't nearly as good, I still found the content compelling and timely given the recent Black Lives Matter movement. I often got lost in the references from that time, but I still found the writing interesting.  I specifically loved the moment she confronted Atticus and he fell from the pedestal.  It was inevitable, as it is for most children whose parent(s) are amazing, and I found the writing in this section quite moving. I would recommend it, maybe not highly, but I still think it's worth the read.
It was something like catching up with old friends you haven't seen in years:  good to see them, hear their voices again, and learn what they've been up to, but somewhat disconcerting to realize your idealized memories of them are not the reality of how they are and to learn some of the difficulties and disappointments they've experienced. I think the book could have used a bit of editing, for example to align the mention of the trial which was one of the main events of TKAM to fit with the outcome in the previous novel, in this one it says Atticus's client, the defendant, was acquitted. I'm glad it's been released but can understand the disappointment some people have expressed with it. I recommend that TKAM fans read it with an open mind, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who doesn't already love the characters, as if you are just meeting them they don't make such a good first impression.
I do not understand the tepid reviews for this novel.  Is it that they can't put aside TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD?  OK, it's not a masterpiece, but our reading group is enjoying it without qualification.  I am enjoying the insights about the characters we know and love from MOCKINGBIRD. I am enjoying finding out the fate of some characters and the descriptions of the deep south traditions and mentality about race. As a baby in Southern Oklahoma in the 1940s, I was cared for by a black mammy...and didn't know that until I was an adult, asking my beloved grandmother about those years. Her response was "that was just the way things were, but she was a member of our family, nonetheless." My kin had no racism in them, but like Atticus, they were who they were at that time and place and still deeply religious and all the rest. So don't let any so-so reviews keep you from enjoying this jewel of a novel.
Both Ms. Lee's books are mirrors of the time they represent 1935 and 1955 and should be read with that in mind.  If Ms. Lee's editor, after reading her manuscript of Go Set A Watchman, her first novel, hadn't suggested Ms. Lee write a book about life from young Scout's viewpoint, we may have never experienced To Kill A Mockingbird.  The serendipity of the Watchman manuscript being found is a miracle. I loved Go Set A Watchman as I always wondered the rest of the story.  If you haven't read To Kill A  Mockingbird you need to read it first.  If you've read it but not recently you should re-read it before reading Go Set A Watchman.  I hadn't read it since the 60's and found I'd forgotten a lot of it and was happily reintroduced to all the characters. Both books are life in prose and I feel Go Set A Watchman will become as well loved as To Kill A Mockingbird.  I only wish Ms. Lee had written more books. For those who have mentioned Ms. Lee's writing is lot like Truman Capote's may not know they grew up together as sometime neighbors, possibly the Dill character, and she helped him do research for In Cold Blood.  They were friends and experienced the same time in the same South so it's understandable they would reflect the same insights.
I wonder if I would have enjoyed reading this as much if I had never known TKAM. GSAW is certainly not as polished a novel as TKAM and one appreciates the role of Lee's adept editor. However, for all its flaws, and there are certainly those, it merits five stars. Read it to acquire a better understanding of Lee's background and worldview. As far as the character of Atticus is concerned and his fall from grace in GSAW, I am reminded of the words of Bertolt Brecht:" Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes." The ending of the novel brings to mind Flannery O'Connor's " Everything That Rises Must Converge." Scout must confront her own hypocrisy and woundedness as part of her evolution. Yes, do read it. If you expect a masterpiece, you will be disappointed, but I walked away with an even greater love for Lee and TKAM.
Very disappointing. But I am still remembering the one work and there apparently will be no other. Too bad. A one shot wonder.
I found it very slow and boring....... almost juvenile !!!<br/> Waste of my time and money  considering all the major  hype .
Mainly because I wasn't as bothered by it as I thought I would be. However, there weren't really characters I was rooting for.
Everyone seems to be upset by the fact that Atticus Finch is a "racist".  This book clearly describes all whites in the south (and north, from my point of view), as racist--at the very least--unaware that they are living in a society based on white supremacy and that each and every one of us who is white benefits from white privilege.  I'm not sure what Ms. Lee was trying to express, but that is what I got from the book.  The book is well-written, does a good job of describing not only racial but class differences in American culture.  It is not the great book that "Mockingbird" is.  The book is uncomfortable because it makes one look at one's culture from a different perspective.  I think this may be what all the "fuss"  is about.  It's easier to talk about the fact that Atticus Finch is not who we thought he was than it is to discuss white supremacy and white privilege.
The long awaited first book written by Harper Lee was somewhat disappointing to me.It's the story of Scout all grown up in the 50's who comes home for her annual two week visit from New York. She expects to have the relations between the whites and the Negros healed, all living in harmony and treated as equals. She finds that this has not happened and becomes enraged. The last half of the book is detailing Scout's rage towards everyone, including her father, Atticus. Scout has become a troubled soul, hating Maycomb County and most everyone in it.<br/><br/>Harper Lee's "Go Set a Watchman" is not the insightful and inspiring book as was her Pulitzer winning novel "To Kill a Mocking Bird". I know Ms. Lee meant to make a statement about the race conditions in the South at that time. Her statement came through loud and clear but still, "Go Set a Watchman" was a hard read.
Can't recommend the book, clearly an author's first attempt at writing. My husband and I had to force ourselves to finish it.
Disappointing. Feels as if it had been written by 'committee'. Re-read 'Mockingbird''; it's best she be remembered  for that.
Disturbing and disappointing... leaves a foul taste re: race relations. The fact it was written 50 years ago notwithstanding.
I am going to go with the belief that this was the first writing of a novice author. It lacks the polish of a work that would normally have been published. It felt to me as if Harper Lee had just arrived in New York and just sat down at the typewriter and started typing. She struggled to form the story as it does seem a bit ragged and disjointed at times. Once you have read it, I think the only thing you can really do is see it as the rough draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. I can't connect this story as a logical next step beyond TKAM, it is better for me to view it as a study how an author begins to write a truly great novel. If you approach it from that angle, I think you can still maintain your love and respect for one of America's greatest novels without losing any respect for the characters.<br/><br/>Avoid it if you wish to be a TKAM purist, read it if you like to make up your own mind.
I enjoyed it. Just dont try to compare to the quality of To kill a mockingbird, just read it as a book of it's own.
This is a terrible book and badly written.<br/><br/>While the "Mockingbird" story may have been teased out of this material, that book still took nearly three years to get right. "Watchman" appears a rough draft and a poor one at that. What a horrible disservice to Lee and her reputation.<br/><br/>One can imagine the 88-year old in a nursing home being relentlessly set upon by greedy heirs and publishers to release this draft and once again milk the old cash cow.<br/><br/>Once has to ask, was this book edited?  Why if Mockingbird took two years of hard work by an editor were these notes dumped on us?<br/><br/>I suppose one needs to read it but the real story here is greed.
If you haven't read To kill a Mockingbird" you might be a little bit lost with this book. If you are thinking Go Set a Watchman is the sequel to such a great book it is not. This is more like the unedited and unfinished first draft to the famous To kill a Mockingbird book.  I was expecting this book to be  a little bit more of a follow up to the classic and I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn't. I did like that I got some different perspectives of certain characters and that it tells of a time when our nation was going through changes. While it might bother some people when they read this book it does tell of a time when things where way different and people thought differently. The ending seemed a little bit odd but again I found it to be more of a rough draft of the great book we all know. I received this book free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
Harper Lee wrote this before "To Kill a Mockingbird," but it is an ideal sequel to that Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Set in the 1950s with a 26-year-old Scout, known as Jean Louise now that she's grown up, narrating the story, it is a surprising, perhaps shocking, turn of events when she realizes that Atticus is a racist.<br/><br/>And while the book contains harsh and stunning racist diatribes that I found difficult to read, I viewed it as a historical work that honestly portrayed race relations in the Deep South in the mid-20th century. Harper Lee is an extraordinary writer with a gift for telling stories that send the reader tumbling back in time.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" doesn't work by itself. Read only this book, and it is virtually meaningless. My advice: Treat yourself. Read "To Kill a Mockingbird" and follow it with "Go Set a Watchman."
Waste of money. Wish I had known it was a rough draft of the book before I spent money on the book. Hated the book
This is a very interesting book for a number of reasons. First, it tells us about Scout as an adult revisiting her childhood home. The adult Scout has her memories jolted by reality. Even Atticus is not the paragon of virtue that she remembered. However, we do not find out anything about her life in New York City<br/><br/>Secondly, the change in Atticus and his attitude toward blacks in the opposite of what Scout remembers. She cannot reconcile the dichotomy. We, as readers, can see the difference between ideals and life in a small southern town.<br/><br/>Thirdly, we need to remember that this book was written before To Kill a Mockingbird and had been rejected by publishers. It was raw, unedited writing that did not have the benefit of a good editor.<br/><br/>It is still a good read and very thought-provoking. I'm sure it will provide good fodder for book clubs across the US
very disappointed
Bored me to tears
Rent.  Don't buy.
very disappointed
I was disappointed with this book. It seemed more so a rough draft of a novel than a completed work. I had such high hopes.
First of all, it was great to have Amazon ship this book to me the day of its release!  What a convenience!  Now to the review. I'll be short and sweet.  I'm not a literary scholar, so I won't talk about whether I thought the book was written correctly or not.  My opinion is from a 'was it a good story' point of view. I intentionally did not read reviews and synopses of the book because I didn't want to be influenced or have expectations.  I'm not one to sit and read all the time and I read this in a matter of days. This book did not disappoint me. I enjoyed catching up with the characters from To Kill A Mockingbird and I found this to be a compelling read. I personally think if you enjoyed Mockingbird, you will enjoy this. I highly recommend it!!
I was very disappointed in this book.  It definitely did not live up to it's pre-release hype.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with a book from civil rights era icon Harper Lee.  I feel, as others have said, that Atticus Finch is depicted as a bigot in this book and this may be resolved in Harper Lee's mind but not mine.  Phrases such as "they aren't able to take care of themselves" and "the Supreme Court imposed it's will on us" are used frequently and it is offensive.  I am very disappointed that the author of this book may not be who I thought she was.  As someone who grew up in the civil rights era south I am so very disappointed in this book and what it says.
Read the first couple pages and returned it to Amazon. This is an inferior first draft of TKAM, and was marketed only to line the publisher's pockets. Its provenance is suspect what with Ms. Lee's current lawyer conveniently "finding it," after the death of Alice Lee. How does that happen? What struck me most about the book in the first few paragraphs was the use of the 3rd person, and how, after re-reading the first page to TKAM to compare, I felt that there was no authentic voice in Watchman. I did not want to read further. I feel that Harper Lee would not have wanted this published, but somehow got talked into it by people who have only their own interests at heart.
An uneven story with well written flash backs.  It is a novel with a beginning and a middle but a non conclusion.
I don't know about this book. So many questions. Wish we knew Lee's true intentions here and not her publisher's.
As a devotee of To Kill A Mockingbird, I was of course profoundly interested in reading the work which started it all. Despite somewhat critical pre-publication reviews, it is an interesting, worthwhile read in its own right, with a particularly insightful consideration of the situation prevalent in the Deep South as regards race relations. Atticus Finch is anybody -- me, you, or a southerner born and bred in a culture and climate which we as a nation have tried to eradicate, not entirely successfully.<br/><br/>In another vein, it is fascinating to see how Harper Lee re-wrote her story to place it in the milieu of the young Scout Finch, adding detail and changing focus but maintaining the honesty of growing up southern in the 1930's. Scout Finch, meet Huckleberry Finn -- both of you were ahead of your time.
A sham--I think I should get a refund! Guess someone needed money and you went along with it.
I waited since its release to get a copy of this audio book from my local library. I wasn't aware that Reese Witherspoon was the narrator, which wasn't a bad thing considering I like her as an actress. So, I started listening to it and the narration was so bad that I couldn't even get into it. She never really changes her voice, pitch, accent, or anything to separate one character from the next. You can't tell who is talking an any given moment. This really surprised me since she is an actress. I just didn't like it and think that Reese should stick to the screen. As far as the two star rating, I didn't know what else to give it because I couldn't rate the narrator, so the two stars is for the narration and not the book itself. Anyway, I guess I will have to get the book and read it myself and then rate it.
this book is such a disappointment,I had to stop reading it. It made me so angry. Harper Lee idologized her father and this alleged "prequel" presents him in a clumsy,oafish way. The original Mockingbird was written with such delicacy and brilliant observation as to time, place and mood .This book has none of that delicacy.It's like comparing Joan Didion or Joyce Carol Oates to a Harlequin romance author. I am so angry and disappointed by this book,but in this day and age,it doesn't surprise me that the people behind this have managed to publish this piece of crap and have managed to take advantage of and associate this book with Harper Lee. Shame on you all!
What an incredible disappointment! I just knew I shouldn't read this book. After all, if the author had 55 years to submit it to her publisher and decided not to, that decision should have been respected. Now the poor woman is 89 years old and her unassailable legacy has been tainted. Not by the dated subject matter, which has received so much press, but by its lack of charm, it's uninspired language and weak story. It's hard to believe that it's the same author who wrote "To Kill A Mockingbird".<br/>  I'd suggest to that anyone who is thinking of reading this book to simply re read Miss Lee's  brilliant first book which is everything you're looking for in a book. There are much better books out there to spend your money on!
I was looking forward to reading this, but I see now there is a reason it was not published years ago.
I can't believe that Harper Lee wrote this book. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird. I did not like this book at all.
Was hesitant to read this after the beloved 'To Kill A Mockingbird' - but was not disappointed.  Very good book.
This book was kind of a mixed bag for me.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books ever...so I had high hopes for this one by Harper Lee.  I felt like nearly 90% of the book is Jeanne Louise describing southernisms, and mostly in a derogatory way...as if she's looking down her nose at those folks she's surrounded by, when she goes home to Alabama.  She's even angry and upset at her father...Atticus, our beloved Atticus, for what she perceives as his racist views.  And indeed...they are racist views...and she never really resolves things except to just love her family anyway, cause it's the right thing to do...or something like that.<br/><br/>A whole book of Scout not liking anyone anymore.  Pretty disappointing really.
Characters not developed well.  Dialog and relationships confusing and implausible between Scout and her uncle.
First half was very good even without a plot.  Once the plot was established the remainder was a difficult read
Reeeeally disappointed! Read like a first draft, and didn't even come close to "To Kill A Mockingbird."
If the author were mentally competent, she would never have given consent to publish this crude, unedited draft.  Knowing that she has been exploited by Harper Collins and by her lawyer/guardian makes me sick.  The only thing that helps:  hopefully Ms. Lee is unaware of exactly what was published.  I would like her to end her life only knowing that To Kill a Mockingbird has been an inspiration to millions.  The one good thing about Go Set a Watchman is it will encourage people to reread To Kill a Mockingbird, or read it for the first time.
After all the brouhaha about the publishing of this book I approached it with somewhat lowered expectations; which I find is sometimes a good thing because it allowed me to be pleasantly surprised and actually enjoy the novel.  I was pleased that additional "fond" childhood memories were added in this book, as well as the excellent setting of the "revolution" which overtook the South and the nation during the time period.  Atticus was not vilified but rather revealed to be a complex human being in the cultural and political setting of the day, and the same should be said of all the other characters in the book including Scout who, though she may have felt she was, was no more enlightened than anyone else.
Like many others, I was disappointed in this "newly discovered" novel by Harper Lee. Yes, beloved Atticus is revealed to be a racist, and that's very difficult to accept, but the novel is also poorly plotted and filled with unnatural dialogue and dead patches. I was interested in the parts that gave me additional information about favorite characters and Maycomb County, but I think there's a good reason this novel stayed buried for so long. In the middle of the novel, there is a chapter about a coffee that Jean Louise's aunt throws for her, and that scene included some interesting narrative devices, including some stream of consciousness writing that was pretty interesting. That was the best chapter, I thought.
I tried to go into this book without any preconceived notions, which is probably impossible.  I loved To Kill a Mockingbird, and I wanted to like this book.  It started out very promising, loved the stories of Scouts childhood, and the interactions with her aunt, but there were some long moments of tedium.  The parts that I liked, I really liked.  I cannot use the word "hate" like I have seen in some critiques, simply because I think that is a terrible word to use when it comes to any book.  It's a word that should be saved for talking about things like politics or gum snapping.  I would say not to avoid reading this because of some protest you feel is necessary against the publisher, etc etc.  you owe it to yourself to come to your own conclusions.  So enjoy!  Or don't.
I was actually bored with it.  Not nearly as good as To Kill A Mockingbird.  I really expected so much more.
"Scout" came to life again as Harper Lee describes this rich-in-the-south- character.<br/>Loved it.
It was beautifully written and it taught me to be thoughtfully tolerate of the other person's point of view.
I see why she didn't want it published after To Kill A Mockingbird.  We need Atticus as he was in that book.
I can see why it came out reluctantly now.  I am glad she wrote Mockingbird after, it developed much better.
Let me start out by stating that I LOVE To Kill a Mockingbird; it is one of my all-time favorite books.  I cannot say that about Watchman.  My biggest complaint is the claim (by the publisher? by Amazon? by both?) that it "serves as (Mockingbird's) essential companion, adding depth, context, and new meaning to an American classic."  I found it in no way related to Mockingbird.  In fact, I had to consciously block all mental reference to Mockingbird while I read.  The names and places may be the same . . . but any relation ends there.  I seriously doubt that Harper Lee wanted this manuscript published, and I find that very sad.
Interesting as an artifact, and certainly as a sort of "first attempt" at writing _To Kill a Mockingbird_.  However, the prose is frequently clunky and awkward, and aside from a few choice sections about her life as a child, largely unreadable.  Denials and statements by the publisher to the contrary, this reads more like a statement about this summer's Supreme Court decision(s) than anything else--the timing is just too suspicious to be crying "State's Rights!" and not expect readers to make the connection. Of course, that may be the point behind the novel, and that's fine, but I generally don't read books to be preached at by EITHER side of any political issue.  My advice is to take a pass on this book, unless it's been assigned by your teacher, of course.
Well... a disappointment on the whole.  Has none of the magic, mystique, charm, or evocative quality that's made TKAM the most cherished novel in American literature.  Pedantic, pedestrian, pretty much dead on arrival.  I cannot believe Harper would have sanctioned its release were she younger and in full possession of her faculties.  Consequently, I chalk it up as a victory for the greed of contemporary book publishing.  Then again, I bought it, so there's my contribution to their rapacious scheme.  Wish I hadn't.
It was definitely the right choice to not publish this & ask her to write what became To Kill  Mockingbird.
I know writing styles come and go, but the way the POV changes with no warning and for only a few sentences here and there makes this hard to read. Nothing really happens -- as a set up, I don't know why Jean Louise came home, and it's difficult to tell which of the rambling childhood memories are in the past and which is the current events. (I blame the publisher for this -- for goodness sake, at least give us a font change for flashbacks.) None of the childhood stories seem to have a point, either.<br/><br/>The now-dated writing approach made this a DNF for me.
It's hard to believe Harper Lee wrote this book.  I dislike it so much I cannot get past page ten.  The characters are very one-dimensional.  Scout and Atticus are unrecognizable.  So far in the book Scout is stringing along a guy and all that is talked about beside that is Atticus' physical pain.  Aunt Alexandra is the only character I like so far.  This is surprising considering how much I disliked her in To kill a Mockingbird.  If Harper Lee did indeed write this book, she should have kept the characters true to their personalities and written the book from the perspective of Scout, as she did in To kill a Mockingbird.  If she had done that, I would have been able to get through this book.
I think this book must be read as a sort of 'prequel' to To Kill a Mockingbird.  There are many passages that give insight to the main story of TKAM, by giving more history.  The book also needs to be read as a ' draft  novel' from which TKAM emerged, likely with a good editor's help.  There is, lastly, in my opinion, value in reading it as a sequel.  The complexities of segregation are laid out in stark terms; the underlying hatred between the races, the crippling effect of a poor education and little opportunity for black Americans.  The small mindedness of people (in any era) is also well illustrated and described.  All of these themes produced some sentences that reduced me to tears.<br/><br/>A really good read.  Try to keep an eye on your expectations, though.
Very disappointing. Scout initially gets her head out of the social metaphysics of the "South" as an archetype. However, when she comes home for a vacation, she allows herself to be seduced back into the social metaphysics of a small southern town with all of its crushing social stratification and parochial ideas. She gives up her career in New York for what? A chance to "save" Macombe because it needs her? Gosh, Uncle Jim, quoting his Victorian lines and portraying an elitist understanding of the world, really over-powers Scout's resistance to be sucked back into that maelstrom of conformity and all its social pressures. Why the heck did she go to New York in the first place if she was going to subvert her independence for the cloisters of Macombe?
I was told I would be disappointed, and I was.  The story was just not a full story.  The ending was weak.
Hard to put down in the middle. Good points of view regarding segregation. I didn't understand the ending.
Not a good book. I made it less than halfway through before I tossed it. I'm sorry I bought it.
All those who complained that Atticus was not the same character obviously hadn't read the book. Scout now 26 comes home to Alabama after living in New York for several years. She confronts the adults of her childhood as an adult herself. Her notions of what is and what was in her childhood are challenged. But Harper Lee blends past and present in a magical way with charming images and colorful characters and the most beautiful turn of phrase. Lots of new and very funny adventures reminisced about Jem and Dill. The one about the "revival" is my favorite. Lovely to meet everyone again. Don't be afraid to read this book. It will warm you heart. Oh how I wish Harper Lee had written more!
This book did not meet up to the expectations I had.  In fact at times I ws going to just quit reading it
76 pages in and this book sucks. Reading it with my book club and we all hate it and want our money back.
Watchman brought back a lot of memories and a store house of feelings. The writing is not the same quality as Mockingbird but Harper Lee did a great job of taking me back to a time when I was experiencing the racial cultural lag and I simply could not understand how people could be so prejudice.  Lee, through Scout, tapped those feelings  and remembrances of conversations that caused me anger and frustration and the immaturity which only allowed me to see the obvious without understanding. Really, it reminded me  that the struggle continues and, yet, it confirmed that while we have a way to go; we have begun and progressed in that journey. I appreciate this book and will keep it in my library to go back and read those things I could not help but underline.
Go Set A Watchman cannot be compared to Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, To Kill A Mockingbird.  Very few novels have the impact of that first novel of hers.  However, taken on its own, I found Watchman to be enlivened and enjoyable reading.  I liked the depiction of the characters and the clarification of their feelings and actions to be well written and interesting.  The idea that we are all human, with the entirety of our flaws, and not to be confused with childhood memories of parents and elders as some kind of infallible personalities, whom we set up on a pedestal.  Truly growing up shows us that no person is without his or her own prejudices and human frailties.  I enjoyed the book and it is far and beyond the quality of today' bestsellers.
I just finished the Kindle version.  Lots of other reviews go into the plot more than I intend to.  My observations are that, like another reviewer said, this book would have very little meaning if you were not familiar with the characters from exposure to "Mockingbird".  It would be much weaker as a 'stand-alone' novel.  As it is, and in the light of the other work, I found it quite interesting.  The character development, knowing what one knows from the other book, is easy to grasp.  The 'flashbacks' fill in some gaps and tie it to "Mockingbird" quite well.  Some of it was quite humorous...Dr. Finch referring to whiskey as "missionary vanilla" made me chuckle.  I found it to be a rather quick read.  Well worth my time and my wait.
I really wanted to enjoy this book but I didn't. There are so many holes, so much missing information I couldn't even feel sorry for this one-dimensional, watered down version of Jean Louise Finch. The entire novel starts (and ends) when she gets off the train from NewYork. Evidently she never had a significant friendship or did anything worth mentioning outside of Maycomb. County because Harper Lee makes no effort to fill in the blanks. This young woman is whats left of Scout with all the juice squeezed  out of her. I didn't find Atticus's views on race as startling as the fact that Jean Louise Finch would accept a smack in the mouth like a sweet little southern belle. Bullocks.
This book was very tedious and quite unrelated to To Kill A Mockingbird.  It was an effort to finish it.
A good read that doesn't deserve all the PC negative thoughts. Different times. Different circumstances.
It took a long time getting to the point. And I think a lot of people will miss the point of the ending.
As a lifelong lover of To Kill A Mockingbird, I was much anticipating the release of this book, only to be kind of let down.  The tone is quite different from her earlier work.  In fact, it was hard to believe these were the same characters at all.  I was sorely disappointed that there was no explanation about Jem, and the writer could have done a much better job at portraying Atticus' mindset.  In Mockingbird, Atticus was very adept at explaining life, his convictions, and the way things were.  In Watchman, it is much more vague.  There is some reading between the lines to be done, which was not Atticus' style at all, and I think many of the general public missed it or misinterpreted it.  Just not on par with what I was expecting from Harper Lee.
I was incredibly disappointed with this book.  It was the first time I had actually pre-ordered a book, as I was much anticipating the prequel to To Kill a Mockingbird.  Being that it tells the story after the characters are older, it is more like a sequel, but I understand Harper Lee wrote it BEFORE she wrote Mockingbird.  It is fortunate this was not published first, as I would likely never have read Mockingbird, thinking it would be as lackluster and empty as this one.  There was no plot, no real character development, unless you consider caricatures and paper cut outs as characters.  I only knew these people because I read Mockingbird.  Watchman does not, and cannot, stand on its on.  Call it a prequel, if you will, it is really a weak sequel.
Harper Lee can do no wrong and she shows this with "Go Set A Watchman."  It was great to see Scout again... she is one of my most beloved fictional characters. The reviews that I have read focus on Atticus and how he has become a bigot in his age. I found the book to be more a reflection of generational prejudices and how most people are formed by their times. It is the rare character who can transcend time and reality and rise above it. I found Scout still delightful as she struggles with being a woman in the 1950's. Her father remains a most thoughtful and principled role model. He has been worn down by time. I am left to wonder what Scout would be like today?
I just read several other reviews of this book, just to check if I was the only person with a negative review, and it turned out that I found words like "boring", "tedious", and "sluggish." All of these words confirm what I also feel about this book: if Harper Lee had not written "To Kill a Mockingbird", this book never would have been published. It reads like a draft of a story the author is trying to work out, which, essentially, is what it is. I agree that there should be a preface explaining how this book came into being. And it definitely will be of use to students of Am Lit. Otherwise, I can't recommend it.
It was a good thoughtful sequel to the thoughtful book.  It is more of a time capsule, though, so don't have a cow if Atticus does not have a 2015 point of view about desegregation, etc.  This was written in the 60s and he was trying to be progressive based on that time frame and his experience up to then.<br/>I think it should have been edited and beefed up with more anecdotes from the past and maybe Dill should have called her up our something, but it is as it was written, or so they say and that makes it special.
To Kill a Mockingbird is and will always be my favorite novel. I was thrilled to see that Harper Lee's hidden treasure "Go Set a Watchman" had been discovered and published. I was not ready for the multiple changes and some of them, very heart rendering as I read. I could not put it down. I also purchased the audio for my car and have listened to the reading now twice. It touches my heart and I loved it although not as much as Mockingbird. Both creations have life lessons to be learned by all of us. Reading Watchman, allowed me to walk within Scout and to see Atticus Finch as my hero again and one who reminds us that life is a series of lessons to be learned and lived. Please read "Go Set a Watchman".
I'm not sure what I was anticipating when I started this book, and now that I've finished it I'm not sure what I received.  Part of me loved it, and part of me hated it.  Given the state of the Union in 2015, this book rankled more than a little bit.  But, there were gems of truth sprinkled through out.  I wanted to shake Scout, I couldn't believe that all of a sudden Atticus was portrayed as a racist.  I don't remember his brother, Jack, at all from To Kill a Mockingbird...maybe it's been too long since I read it.  Maybe Ms. Lee knew we needed another wake up call regarding race relations, and if that was her goal she certainly succeeded.  I'm glad I read it, probably won't ever re-read it as I have her other novel.
I really did NOT care for this book, but after all, it was the version that was initially rejected by Ms. Lee's editor.  I also can totally understand why this editor suggested she rewrite from Scout's POV and set in Scout's childhood.  The only part of this book that had that magic of Mockingbird, was the very short section when Jean Louise relates a memory from her childhood.<br/><br/>I really was not as surprised as everyone else seems to be about Atticus.  His attitude, as well as Scout's own, were a product of their time and suggestions of it showed dimly even in Mockingbird.  In Watchman, it is just set forth more clearly.  All in all, this will not be one of the books I read and re-read as I do Mockingbird.
It proved to me she did not write To Kill A Mockingbird without the heavy editing of Truman Capote.
She is a very great writer. The ending was odd though. And it's clear that the book was not edited.
It's imperative that anyone who reads this book also reads To Kill a Mockingbird. It's obvious why Harper Lee's editor did not accept Watchman but guided Lee to write a book with a different perspective. From a writing standpoint, one can tell that Lee had a similar style in her first book (Watchman), but her second book (Mockingbird) was so much more developed and intriguing. While the characters in Watchman were understandable, they were not likable and did not evoke empathy. The characters in Mockingbird were authentically drawn, and the reader becomes engaged in the story, the setting, and the characters' lives. This book is highly accessible for adults, young adults, and even some children 6th grade and older.
Did I love it? No. Did I hate it? No. I wish there were a journal of the revision progression from Watchman to Mockingbird, though. The childhood scenes come to life and I can see why the editor pushed Lee to rewrite using those antics as the basis for the novel. What I miss the most is the mood set in Mockingbird. The eerie mystery of Boo Radley in the frightening old house. The terror of the chase home in the ham costume. We get lots of words, lots of arguments, lots of speeches. (Will Uncle Jack ever shut up?) But the heart is missing, and kudos to the editor who helped Miss Lee find it for her masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird.
As a sequel to an iconic book and film, To Set A Watchman has quite high expectations to live up to. I reread To Kill A Mockingbird again before I read the sequel and I was surprised at how closely the tone of the novel was replicated in the sequel. There is some necessary repetition, some disappointingly absent characters as well as a disconcerting twist to previous characterizations but overall this is an interesting, if slightly uncomfortable, look at race relations in the American South during the 50's and 60's. I enjoyed the book but the narrative felt unresolved and I was left feeling unsatisfied. I love the main character and I wanted to see more of her life. I doubt that we will have that opportunity.
Much more thought provoking than some reviews give it credit for. Great sense of place and people.
A sequel to her best known book ("To Kill a Mockingbird") this book takes place about twenty years later.  Jean Louise "Scout" is living in New York, but regularly returns to Maycomb on her vacations.  In this novel Atticus' health is declining, but he still practices law.  One day while browsing she discovers that he is reading racist literature.  Her horror is magnified when she discovers that he and her boyfriend and p[possible husband are attending a KKK meeting.  After a lengthy discussion with her uncle, she confronts Atticus.  I won't say all's well that ends well, but she does have a better understanding.  Overall interesting, if a little on the slow side.  Still, it's worth reading.
A real let down from the prior novel. Harper Lee's reputation just went down the drain.
Had I not read the prequel to this book many years ago, it would have made little sense to me and it certainly would not have engaged my interest. Putting the exorbitant price aside, it had no real meat on its bones. I did enjoy reading about the character, Atticus Finch and pictured him as he was in To Kill a Mocking Bird. I thought the hullabaloo about him being a racist in this book was unfounded. He was simply living the life of a southern lawyer in a small community where racial problems were a daily concern. He did no harm. It did not take me long to understand why this book was not released decades ago. Very disappointing.
I didn't like how nothing really happened, it is really just a second look at Atticus' character.
Maybe I expected more after reading To Kill a Mocking Bird. The book did not live up to the hype.
I was disappointed in this book.  After reading it, I wondered why anyone bothered to publish it.
Great book that is good for deep thought and conversation. I loved it. Wish she had written more!
I really enjoyed it because I took it in the proper context.  It was a first draft that turned into "To Kill a Mockingbird"  (one of the greatest American novels of all time) and I thought it realistically portrayed the time and place.  Was Atticus a racist? No more so than any other white person of that time.  The racism was portrayed in a realistic way.  I don't think Atticus was hateful.  Yes, it was shocking to read but it made sense. Scout was horrified but she was also put into her place by her uncle to see what the real world was all about.<br/><br/>It wasn't as well written as "To Kill a Mockingbird" but then what is?  I recommend it with the caveat that it is a first draft.
I have greatly enjoyed "Go Set a Watchman". To Kill a Mockingbird remains a favorite book and it was nice to learn more about Scout, Jem, Dill and other characters found in the former published one. I don't understand why so many people are upset about finding out Atticus is not perfect. In this book, he is an older man and his world is changing too fast for his taste. I don't think it takes away from what he did for Tom Robinson. We may all have misjudged his motives but he still did a hard, good deed. Go Set a Watchman is not a great book maybe, but it's not bad either. I, for one, is glad it was published. Greed is probably the reason it was published but I'm still glad I got to read it.
Felt the chidhood sequences were endless and I found myself skipping whole pages. I found the character of Jean Louise changed so rapidly that it was hard to actually have an opinion about her and her relationships, especially with her boyfriend. One minute she was thinking of marriage and the next she could barely tolerate him. "To Kill a Mockingbird" was a classic and should have been left to stand alone.I felt the whole issue of segregation was left unresolved in this particular circumstance as if the status quo was just too much to deal with. The character of Atticus was seriously diminished for me as well.
very tedious to read, boring, definitely not the interesting story line in To Kill A Mockingbird
I feel like I just read the outtakes and if nothing else it shows how important a good editor is
When this book was published I had to get it right away because To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book. This book was a bit of a let down. Besides the  fact that some of the characters behave differently in this book, parts of the flashbacks are remembered differently than were told in To Kill a Mockingbird. I know this book was written first so the inconsistencies bothered me. If you have never read To Kill a Mockingbird this won't be a problem. While it is apparent that Harper Lee wrote this book, I found that there was something missing that I could not quite put my finger on. It certainly wasn't the worst book I have ever read, but it is not the masterpiece that To Kill a Mockingbird is.
This book was fascinating on its own merits, especially the interactions between blacks and whites in 1950s Alabama.(The Calpurnia and Jean Louise dynamics were heartbreaking). I could also see a lot of the characterizations that would eventually be fleshed out in TKAM. I think Atticus's portayal is believable, but the sudden creation of Hank as a lifelong family friend is not. His insertion into this prequel/sequel is jarring for those familiar with Scout's childhood as written in TKAM.
The world looked at Harper Lee's "To Kill A Mockingbird" and thought it reflected the soul of a brave southern lawyer. This tale fills in the gaps with a true discussion of the southern world after the Supreme Court ruling in "Brown vs the board of Education"<br/><br/>This ruling threw the South into chaos. 100 years after the American a Civil War, the Yankies were invading the south to correct their lives.  Jean Louise (Scout) from the Mockingbird story has lived in New York for some time and returns to Macomb, Alabama to find out that the Atticus Finch that she loved is a father is a man that she did not know.
Disappointing
No, it's not a continuation of the same story; just a different chapter and cause for thought, at that.  I liked the book as it took a realistic look at just what social misconceptions we all had about the loving place created in Ms. Lee's first novel.  This version is for the adults in us and does little to carry on the fantasy set in "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Atticus Finch, was after all a Southern man and a gentlemen....He wasn't perfect and as adults we are allowed to grapple with this issue, winning and losing some of our favorite perceptions that we have held onto. I quite enjoyed ;picking up the story again and seeing where it would take me and who I would lose along the way.
I was hoping for another book like To Kill a Mockingbird.  Go Set a Watchman is not anything close to that, but it is not that bad.  Author, Harper Lee takes the reader along with the now 25 year old Scout (Jean Louise Finch) as she makes her annual trip from her now home in New York back to Maycomb, Georgia where she grew up.  Alternating through flashbacks of the 12 year old Scout and the present time Scout the reader goes along as Scout remembers the things she did growing up and looks at them through now mature eyes of a grown up women. You need to read this book, if for no other reason, than to find out where the author came up with such an unusual title.  Yes it is explained in the book.
Okay, but such a disappointment after "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Story erratic at times.
This should never have been published. It's a hackneyed, sad and poorly written first draft of a book that obviously had tremendous help from some very fantastic editors. I love To Kill A Mockingbird and I feel for Harper Lee. Her wishes were ignored and her reputation exploited. There is no way an author would agree to publish this embarrassment with such hype and promise. Shame on the publishing house for taking advantage.
So Disappointed.  The prose of TKAM was so beautiful. GSAW was disjointed, the characters were marginal, and I understand why the book was supposedly initially rejected by the publishers.  My opinion only:  I don't think Ms. Lee ever intended this book to be published, and I was skeptical from the very beginning, but of course wanted to read it, as TKAM was one of my favorite books.  I think whomever was responsible for the publication of this book should be ashamed.  If Ms. Lee had wanted it published, she certainly had time in her life to do so.  The only thing I truly loved about the book was the title.
A book that allows someone to change his/her  mind after jumping to conclusions.  Choices for the townsmen seem limited, so , for the time it was written, it was normal to exclude women.  I wish it had been published about 50 years ago, because some of it seems oudated in 2015, BUT, I loved it.Her rhythm of writing is still apparent , and she is a natural in introducing people with quirks and keeping them lovable.<br/><br/>Had I been her editor, I would have  suggested she expand several characters, especially, her housekeeper , her uncle, the M.D., and Atticus himself.<br/><br/>I liked it a lot.  Important to remember that she wrote .this before "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Who amongst us hasn’t revisited our memories and childhood home and find things have changed?<br/>Honestly, I believe we either like the changes or loathe them.<br/>Who hasn’t sparred with one of our relatives? I know I have sparred with my dad and at least one of my aunts.<br/>I think this is a wonderful book.<br/>That is not to take away from “To Kill a Mockingbird” which was another winner. But, this writing by the author most likely tells it like it was, not how somebody wanted it to be.<br/>Not even time can suppress the truth of what was.<br/>Jeannie Walker (Award-Winning Author) "Fighting the Devil" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
Slow moving, no great challenges facing characters.  Good reflection of the south in that era.
Disappointing. I have a feeling the author would have preferred this book was never published.
Way overhyped.  Tedious and boring.  Waiting for a plot to occur.  Abandoned reading the book.
Disappointing, difficult and misses it's mark but interesting in terms of a writer's evolution
I think a lot of the criticism about this book is due to the fact that people tend to look at it through the lens of it being a contemporary novel, which it is not.  I think it accurately presents the issue of race in the South in that time.  Atticus, while not the man we thought he was in "Mockingbird" is not the racist that people have painted him to be.  He is dealing with the issue of race with the tool set he has.  He is still a good man.  Remember, this was written before "Mockingbird."  Scout, on the other hand, grows to be quite a special individual.  Read it with an open mind and read it as if it was written 50+ years ago and I think you will enjoy it.
Spoiler alert: I finally figured out what the author was getting at- Scout had an idealist's view of the world she had been living in as a child, but when, as an adult, she went away and came back, her father and uncle clued her in on reality. Took me a looooooooong time to get through this book because of the "twists" that were more like "meanders" which kept me not guessing, but wondering why in the world is THAT even in there?  But now I can say yes, I read it. No, I won't re-read it. Yes I will recommend it to other people so that they can take weeks to get through a short book and catch up on their naps in between pages. Not at all like To Kill a Mockingbird.
It was unbelievable ... not in a good sense, just not believable.  How could a young woman raised in the south, probably through her high school and perhaps her college years, come back for this visit and seem as if she was both blind and dumb ... blind as to what had been going on around her for all those years and dumb not to have taken it in.  It was also a cheat from the publishers and marketing folks.  They must believe their readers are both blind and dumb to believe this "newly-found" manuscript.
I hope the conspiracy is true and this was not indeed written by Harper Lee. I know how insulting it was to presume that only a man like Truman Capote could have written a masterpiece like To Kill a Mockingbird. I believe Harper Lee wrote that. I'm just hoping this was not her sophomore piece. If so I can understand why she did not want it published. I would love to find out she wrote the first half which was bloody brilliant but the last half was fan fiction or a coked out Truman Capote. Or maybe it was all brilliant and I am just being critical because I did not like Atticus the racist. Maybe I will give it a try sometime else when I am in a better mood.
Before I bought this for book club, I was leery because  this is the book Lee originally tried to get published. She was told to concentrate on the story that became Mockingbird. So this was not so great in the eyes of the publisher.  I am certain after the success of Mockingbird that Lee could have gotten the other in print and could have at any time in her life. But she chose not to. Probably knew it wasn't all that good. I had to force myself to read it. I found it boring, poorly written, and disconnected.  Somebody just wanted the bucks. This is a dreadful book. First, it is NOT a novel; it is a diatribe. There is no action. There is only Scout throwing a gigantic tantrum which includes her throwing her clothes in a suitcase and saying she will never speak to her father again.  She is also a horrible fiance. But aside from all this, the book is a boring, poorly written, account of how the South looked at integration in mid-19th century. It has no real relevance, no real spark, no real interest.
I think personally that criticism of the Atticus of Mockingbird being incompatible with the Atticus of Watchman is unfounded. I found the older Atticus completely believable as a man whose sense of justice in his own place and time was, shall we say, moderated by the passing decades. The less admirable older man was to me fully formed and quite in harmony with his character and world (if not with Gregory Peck's memorable portrayal of the younger man). His grown daughter's surprise and disappointment with him also makes perfect sense, so I think that some critics' claim that the one novel relates poorly with the other does not hold up to careful scrutiny.
It is important to remember that the story is about the South, as it really was, following the Supreme Court decision Brown vs. Board of Education.  It is also important to remember that the story was written only shortly after the time frame of its setting.  Given that, the story provides beautiful insight into how we need to adjust when we discover that our heroes are only good humans not saints, our homes while places of nurturing and love also maintain cultures of exclusion and predilection, and our own idealistic convictions function like bigotry.  I loved each of the characters for their simple straightforward humanity.  It is a tale of each of us.
Interesting history of south. Slow getting to good part.  Other book of Lee's much better.
The conversations  between Scout and Atticus seemed nonsensical to me.  There was no plot.
Despite critics, controversy, worth reading. Reread Mockingbird, after reading.
I was heartbroken. I read in the New York times that Harper Lee wrote this book before she wrote To Kill a Mockingbird (always intending to release this novel second). This is Atticus Finch's daughter's view of her father as an adult instead of through the eyes of the young girl, Scout (in To Kill a Mockingbird. I wish she had never published it. It is hard to view Atticus Finch in the same light as I once did. I found her writing less colorful and lacking description. What she did to her characters made it hard to read...she took what was good and holy and gave us ugly sin.
Did not like this book. No wonder Harper Lee did not want it published for so many years.
Shameful that author's agents and attorney let this first draft out as a "novel."
Thought it was slow in the beginning but picked up about 2/3 of the way through the book.
Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird, returns home from NYC to her Southern roots to learn that her perception of what is right is not as clearly defined as she expects.<br/>Atticus Finch must balance the South's past attitudes towards race relations with keener insight of a slowly developing change. Atticus is not seen as the earlier beacon of nobility and goodness in  Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird; rather he has developed into realistic human beings possessing dubious opinions.  The crux of the novel is Scout's process to understand her father and his Southern stand.
In the future, I think this book will be discussed more for its having been published than for its content. It really is not a well-told story. It jumps around and is poorly edited. Toward the end, it gets a bit tedious and didactic. It becomes almost a legal brief for the repeal of Brown v. Board of Education rather than a novel. I am not too surprised at how Atticus is portrayed, but I thought Hank was unfairly treated for his social standing. I was shocked and very upset when Uncle Jack slapped his niece. In any age, now or in the 1950's, that is abuse. It seemed to be condoned.<br/>I really wish this book had not been published.
I find it very sad that this book was published well after the author had lost her ability to prevent this from occurring. It is not a sequel to her masterpiece ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ – it is a fist attempt at a book that was later revised to become To Kill a Mockingbird. There is a lack of discord between events and characters. Some key characters no longer even exist. It is not the fault of the author – it is the fault of the money grubbing people who decided to publish this inferior draft (once the author no longer had the legal or mental power to prevent it!)
I was a fast read.  Well written, but not the unforgettable first, "The kill..."
Interesting story but no page-turner and too much flashback to the original Mockingbird.
It drags on too much.  Some folks think I'm nuts, but it is my taste.  LOVE Mockingbird.
I was thrilled when I heard that this sequel had been found and that it was to be published. I am one of the millions who cherished Miss Lee's unique novel "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD". I enjoyed the many flashbacks with Scout and Jem and Dill, once again at their summertime adventures. It was, however, a very hard price to pay. It was difficult for me to accept Atticus' change in character, and Calpurnia's hardness of heart, and distance from Jean Louise as an adult. Jem's death also seemed to be very superficially glossed over in an almost cavalier manner. If you cherish the first novel, perhaps the sequel would be better left unread.
The protagonist is annoying and there is no exciting plot nor character that grabs you.
I found it boring, repeating a lot of To Kill a Mockingbird, without much of an ending.
It rings true in terms of how Atticus Finch could be the person in THIS book and yet take the stance he took in To Call a Mockingbird.  "Hank" as a character is perhaps less well-developed in this book, and of course he does not figure in the classic.  Dr. Finch is a fascinating character but I don't remember him in the classic.<br/><br/>Some parts of this book, particularly in the first third, are "laugh out loud" funny, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure I got a good sense of what Scout, now a grown-up twenty-something, returns (permanently) to New York City, or eventually comes back "home" to stay.
There is a reason the publisher sent this back to Harper Lee without publishing it.  The sections where Scout remembered incidents from her childhood were great.  The rest of the book was nonsense.  It's amazing that she took the publishers advice and made the focal of "To Kill a Mockingbird" Scout's childhood.  To so completely change a character such as Atticus and add Jem as a main character does say something for her ability as a writer. All in all it would have been better to leave this manuscript in the safe deposit box it was found in.
I was, at first, disappointed in Ms. Lee's writing and could tell this was a first novel for her and at times the story was wordy and dragged in places but I'm glad I stuck with it.  When I finished reading it, I thought this is a really good first novel that tackled some relevant issues.  I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird right before reading this one and it is a far superior book in it's narrative and story line.  However, I would highly recommend it and have recommended it....just don't give up on it in the parts that drag.  It's well worth reading.
Awful, poorly written, boring , and annoying. I don't know what all the fuss is about.
Well, it was quite good, but the 2nd book was better, perhaps influenced by the movie.
No sorry line at all.  Loved To Kill A Mockingbird and this was such a disappointment!
Turned a page and found it had ended and wondered what I had missed.<br/>Disappointed
Harper's descriptions of the town and the people were excellent but finding our Hero Atticus as a KKK member was depressing. He insisted that he only joined to "keep tabs" on their activities and if Scout had believed him and the story had gone on to show he was telling the truth & she forgave him,it would have pleased me....OR....if the story went on to show that he lied and had always been a phoney..I would have been sad, but would have considered it complete. As it ended, it was an incomplete story that made me think she intended for the. first book  to be the second and the publishers made her publish it first..
I found this book to be so much more than a "story"<br/>It helped me to examine my own feelings and opinions about today and yesterday's racial issues. I was born and  raised in the deep south in early 50's and experienced segregation I am sad to say.<br/>The one part of this book that really stuck a nerve was the statement,"Jefferson believed full citizenship was a privilege to be earned by each man, that it was not something given lightly nor taken lightly"  .  We should use that as an example with today's border wars and illegal emengrient
Despite the fact that so much of this story has been given away in pre-publication hype, and that I was prepared to hate Atticus Finch, I loved this story. It’s made me think about how do you go about changing people’s attitudes. Do you do it forcefully or as a member of that society do you do it quietly amidst the neighbors who struggle with the concept of equal rights. The discussion between Scout and her father about the government moving in to enforce equal rights said a lot about what has to be done, but can cause bitter feelings.  I was so glad I could still like Atticus Finch at the end of the book.
This is a poorly written 1st draft - not surprising it wasn't published originally.
While there was so much controversy surrounding this novel, I found it to be a good read, and consistent with the characters in To Kill a Mockingbird, even though technically they didn't need to maintain consistency.  Definitely more careful editing was needed as there were some awkward switches in the plot that were difficult to follow, but I found Lee's writing to match that of Mockingbird.  Lots of excellently written sentences to provide food for thought.  The man vs. self conflict experience by Jean Louise made for excellent character development and interesting philosophical ideas.  I recommend it.
Harper Lee's first novel is in a sense a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird.  It covers a subject that you rarely see done, and covers it well.  When a person begins to realize that their parent[s] are not the perfect people they saw them as when they were children.  Scout has grown, returns home, and sees a different side of Atticus.  I know some people have claimed that this ruins the character, but those are people who either haven't read the book or who don't like layers to their characters.  I think it is a wonderful piece of writing and makes me appreciate Atticus the person and the parent even more!
It too almost 3/4 of the story before learning what all the hub bub was all about.  Even then, it was disappointing.  The writing is nothing like, "To Kill A Mockingbird."  I wouldn't have known it was the same author.  It reminds me of some of the lame sitcoms that are new or about to be released.  You're bombarded with commercials telling you how WONDERFUL they are, only to become more trash that is on television.  I was very disappointed in this book and won't even bother to share it with friends for them to read.
I don't think this is what the news stations portrays. It is set in a time when people acted, felt, and spoke in a way that wouldn't at all acceptable today .. but it I think was true to an era. The book picked up nicely from the first book and Scout is older and is thinking more like a woman of her era. I liked it and felt her (Scouts) rebellion and heart in this book. There was uncomfortable language but again it's from that era and time. I recommend it.
A first I was surprised at the lack of plot in this novel.  Still not sure if this was merely intended as a fragment or the author's further musings about race and segregation.<br/><br/>One thing that does appear clear to me is that eveything else in this book is a framework for the final big confrontation with and separation from Jean Louise's father.  Does she leave this town and her past behind for good? Does she have the courage to follow her own convictions?<br/><br/>And finally, this book provides some interesting insights into the question of race and equal rights struggles in the 1950's.
message clear...good to look back at the time...not the impact of the first novel.
THIS ISN'T THE TYPE OF STORY I ENJOY. I THOUGHT THE STORY IN WAS PRETTY FRACTURED.
You should definitely read To Kill a Mockingbird first. Reading this book/manuscript next, makes it clear why the editor and publisher saw such promise in Harper Lee's writing. It's interesting to read the perspective and message she was originally delivering with this manuscript and see how it evolved into the masterful novel she is famous for. This book's themes of southern historical views and race relations are still relevant today. So is the experience of learning that your childhood understanding of your parents and other adults will sometimes unfold very differently as you become an adult.
Fascinating, thought provoking, but not the same caliber as the first book/story.
I was disappointed in this book.  Now I know why it wasn't published for so long!
I truly believe this was a draft of ideas for never the final work on Harper Lee.
After growing up with To Kill a Mocking Bird, I guess I expected another classic.
Childhood reminiscenses were moving.  Last parts of novel pedantic and over done.
Book was OK  I loved To Kill A Mockingbird so was disappointed some with this one
I wanted to shake Scout, but didn't have to her uncle slapped her. She needed it.
Don't know why so many people were upset about Atticus. No surprise in this book.
Very well written with honest depiction of the turmoil dealing with equal rights.
It seemed like a long story that told very little. I was disappointed.
think this is more of 3.5 star book but it's Harper Lee so I had to up my vote!<br/><br/>I'm not really sure what to say or think about the story. Written beautifully as always, kept me hooked to the end but it didn't make me feel much. This surprised me no end.<br/><br/>I wish Atticus' treatment in the story was different. He was such an inspiring hero in 'To kill...' and this book shattered my image of him. It was meant to but I think that was wrong of the author to do so.<br/><br/>Overall, it may have been better to let these characters' stories end with the first book ... (less)
I enjoyed the book but couldn't help comparing it to "To Kill A Mockingbird" which had a clearer writing quality and a stronger message.  Some of the character descriptions were lifted directly from one book to the other.  It read like an author's first effort.  Atticus was portrayed as such a "perfect" father, lawyer, and community member in TKM that I actually appreciated the authors' efforts to humanize him in this book and her efforts to demonstrate the complexity of life from an adult perspective.  It did not have the emotional punch of TKM but was a good enough read.
As many have noted, I was happy that To Kill  a Mockingbird was published first.
It will eventually turn out not to be Harper Lees writing. In my humble opinion.
Thought the book dragged on and some of the flashbacks were pretty uninteresting
Rather boring so it is a slow read. I can see why it wasn't published until now.
This draft should not have been published.  It diminishes the author.
Contrary to some views expressed, I really liked this book. I thought the author was experimenting in character development--something that was later enhanced in "To Kill a Mockingbird."  This book was written before "Mockingbird" and some of the characters appear to conflict with the same characters in the later book. Or do they? I don't believe the characters change; I believe the readers have changed who cannot separate their world or view of society from the one or ones presented here.
If you want to preserve your vision of Maycomb, Atticus, Scout, and your belief in the writing power of Harper Lee, pass this book by. Boo Radley should have killed it along with Bob Ewell. This is an attempt to cash in before Ms. Lee passes away. While it would be unfair to expect another Mockingbird, this book isn't even in the same universe. I struggled to finish it and I re-read Mockingbird every year. There's little or nothing here.
My sorrow with Go Set a Watchman is the disjointed, incomplete writing. About once every twenty pages, one finds a beautiful bit of prose that rings true to the Harper Lee who wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. Otherwise oh sorrow this work desperately needed an editor. Harper Lee apparently did not want to publish the book. She was wise not to. It should have been left where it was.
can tell that this was a first attempt. Parts are either well written or a mess. Editing and re-writing is what makes To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAMB) such a great book. As for story, it is a coming home novel where what you thought was ideal turns out not to be so- next book would and should have been what happens next to Scout/Jean Louise. The kernels that became TKAMB took over 5 years to write and edit ( this was written in 1955 and TKAMB was finally released in 1960.  It is hard for one's Gods/Parents to be seen as not perfect - it is how one deals with such that makes a person.
A good read.  Harper Lee makes her small southern town come to life.  Beautifully written.  Could have had some deft editing. Somewhat pedantic. I remember the era and that the ambivalence of the South was also echoed in the North.  We don't like to hear it.  We pretend none of the ugliness was said or done.  Much of it reminds me of my sophomoric rhetoric and attempts to pull people along to an acceptance of  integration.<br/><br/>It probably would have been less commercial .than 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was.<br/><br/>Wish there was more work  of Harper Lee that we could read.
While Scout's voice is recognisable, she has none of the charm of the child we loved in "To Kill a Mockingbird". She is full of sound and fury and despite her own denials fails to recognise her own bigotry. Black people remain caricatures and repeated use of the generalising pronoun "them". There is no question that "Go Set a Watchman" gives insights into Atticus, however he has feet of clay and sets the law above social justice and humanity.<br/><br/>There is none of the humour and drama of the original and I not be rereading "Go Set a Watchman".
First few chapters were laggy - I couldn't really get immersed like Mockingbird
Quite a story. Lots of history  and different aspect of growing up in the south
I thought it was a great story about a woman learning her father is not perfect
I think this book was an interesting peek into a first draft.  I do think the editor who read this book was probably very astute in noticing the really well written sections when Scout goes back in her childhood to steer Harper Lee to write about this time period (being a child).  It is by far the best portions of this book.  Those sections, when the adult Scout goes back to her childhood memory of some event are very reminiscent of To Kill a Mockingbird in style and feel.  The same wonderful writing style that conjures up the same beautiful, clear imagery from her masterpiece.
This was a very hard book to finish.  Basically just words on a page
I was disappointed in Atticus and his thoughts that African Americans were inferior to Whites.  I was disappointed in Scout being so pig headed, not listening and not believing in change.  I felt I was listening to sermons with much of the dialogue.  The novel in no way changes my thoughts that "To Kill a Mockingbird"  is the finest novel I have ever read, and that Harper Lee deserves the praise she has always had for writing it.
To all those disappointed in the portrayal of Atticus, consider this: the novel was written before TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Obviously Ms. Lee rethought the character and made some major changes. This Atticus here does a certain amount of kowtowing to community speak--to blend in? because he believes it?  Who knows. Whatever, the Atticus in MOCKINGBIRD was probably a courageous change (considering when and where the author came from) that could only have been written once Ms. Lee left her hometown.
Well written.  The grown-up Scout is an interesting person. Regarding the plot:  I find it hard to believe that she's been to college...and living in NY....and is just now seeing the weaknesses in Atticus and Hank.  Scout's alliance with Uncle Jack was an interesting addition, but most of his dialogue was too esoteric to mean much to me.  Atticus' justification for being a part of the "anti-NAACP" meeting wasn't good enough. That kept me from rating the book any higher.  I'm glad the publisher challenged Harper Lee to write about the young Scout....much better book.
Wonderfully observed and remembered childhood incidents and episodes. Dialogue quotes are on occasion a little confusing, especially when they consist of just a few words but they still reveal bits of personality and subtle nuances. The interplay of past childhood and present day, with the final realisation that the beliefs held by a person have to change with one's understanding and maturity. We cannot have adult understanding and perspective that hasn't changed from what we thought as youngsters or even as young adults.- it's an expanding insight that defines who we are.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I borrowed it from my library for my kindle. I might have missed something important, but I honestly didn't feel that Atticus changed at all. The way I remember him in To Kill a Mockingbird was as a man who lived by the law. I think this book was really about Jean Louise seeing her hometown through the eyes of an adult for the first time. I guess you could read a whole lot more into it, but I didn't. Whether or not it should have been published is not really my concern. I'm sure that it would have been published eventually anyway if not now.
I have loved To Kill a Mockingbird since I was a child and hesitated to read Go Set a Watchman because I thought it would disappoint.  It did not. It is uncanny how this prequel written years  before To Kill a Mockingbird captured it so well.  It was also wonderful to hear how Atticus explained the South's reaction to The Supreme Court's integration orders. As a southerner, growing up during integration in the late 60s I can attest that his concerns were valid in the hearts of most Southerners.
I was curious to see how this book was different from To Kill A Mockingbird, as most people, I think are. I thought the story of Scout as an adult coming back home with her expectations of her childhood was very interesting.<br/>I know many people were disappointed to see that Atticus wasn't the hero they thought him to be, but I thought the character development was very true to the time and the place.<br/>Beautifully written, with so much insight. I was not disappointed & recommend to anyone who is curious, as I was. I do think one needs to keep an open mind about it.
Terrible book! No wonder she never published it. Now it is just a money maker!
Read To Kill a Mockingbird. Skip this book.  Read To Kill A Mockingbird again.
Started it, but didn't want my perfect Scout & Atticus ruined, so had to quit.
Nothing like To Kill a Mockingbird- glad I read it ,but a little disappointed!
Painful and sad. No book should be released without thoughtful editing, and none needs and deserves it more than this one. That it was allowed to go out into the world as is is shameful and disrespectful to Harper Lee and to Mockingbird and to the public.  Reading it is like biting on a sore tooth.  It hurts, you can’t stop doing it, and nothing good will come of it.
I probably would not have read this if I hadn't read and loved 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  I do think you need to know that story before reading this one. This one was definitely not as interesting as Mockingbird, and not as captivating.  Actually, at times I skimmed as I felt it was a little tedious. Although it is nice to find out how the characters grew up and what happened to them.  I got the feeling that Harper Lee had an idea for a second book and then when she sat down to write it, go tired or bored herself.  The concept of this book could have been so much more.
I couldn't wait to get this book.  To Kill a Mockingbird, is one of my favorite books of all time.  Honestly though, when I was reading this book I was disappointed.  Watchman kind of dragged on, and it didn't seem like there was much of a point to it.  If this book didn't relate to Mockingbird, it would be a very tedious read.  That being said I'm going to wait a few months, read a few other books and re-read Watchman.  Hopefully I'll get something different out of the book the second time around.  I'd still recommend reading Watchman, just temper your expectations.
This novel is a more mature, adult novel than TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, allowing more realistic characters to live in a world full of more greys in their morality (while also being much thinner in plot). I love, I mean love, TKAM, but this novel shines a light which makes the classic feel more like a child's story of black and white morality (appropriate for the age of its narrator).<br/><br/>Due to inconsistencies with TKAM, this book is more appropriately a companion than a true sequel.
Not my favourite - glad she wrote to kill a mockingbird. A bit confusing.....
This book started out well but quickly got bogged down in racial controversy.
Pretty disappointing read. More of a long, rambling short story than a novel.
A most challenging alternate version of To Kill a Mockingbird. Not wanting to give much away, all I can say is that Go Set a Watchman offers a complex view of race and America, perhaps especially relevant for today. This novel does not detract from Mockingbird, just adds depth to the legacy of the author and her message. Also, I found Scout, Jean Louise, just as compelling -- I liked her very much. Not sure one can read Mockingbird without this book, no matter how jarring the storyline.
An interesting style of writing, it is a mixture of filling in gaps in the childhoods of Jem and Scout, and going on in their adult lives. The ending I felt was a little contrived, but I thought that about To Kill a Mockingbird, and it detracts not at all from the story. In fact, what happened had to happen, for the relationship between Scout (now known as Jean Louise) and her father Atticus to survive.<br/>Like To Kill a Mockingbird, A Good Read. I totally do not understand the critics; Lee has not plagiarised anything, or cheated anyone, or lied about her work.
As a first draft of her masterpiece "To Kill a Mockingbird," it is an interesting read.  You can see the seeds of Mockingbird, but it doesn't have the purity of voice that comes from Jean Louise "Scout" as a child.  The young adult Jean Louise in "Watchman" is full of age-appropriate hubris and assumptions, but one cannot help but be disappointed that this is the adult from that amazing child.  Much has been made that Atticus is different, a racist even, but, in fact, Jean Louise does not have the ability to see the nuance of his behavior.
Wasn't sure what to expect with this book, but it was a good read.
Over hyped, under delivers.  This reads exactly like what it is....a first draft of a novel by an amateur author.  The fact that Harper Lee was able to rewrite this novel into the prize winning To Kill a Mockingbird is a testament to her real talent as an author.  It could also serve as inspiration to young first time authors.  Here is a great example that a good rewrite to a first rejected draft can lead to something great. Other than that this novel goes into the don't read pile.
The book started a little slow and I wasn't sure where it was going. But in Harper Lee's masterful style you end up exactly where she wants you to go with deep insights into Atticus, Scout herself and the whole community. No feel good assuaged guilt over what has been done but hard truths that need to be understood.  first glance heros all have their Achilles heel and most imperfectly human. There are complexities in our thinking that need to see the light of day. A brilliant book.
Should have been named "Scout Has A Hissy Fit".  Nice writing though
Seemed very trite and superficial. Not sure I believe Harper Lee wrote this.
It took about a third of the way through the story that it finally came together. Once I got through those pages, and the sensitive issues became apparent and discussions followed, it started to pick up, and get a rhythm. It was an intellectual excercise reading the arguments for not rushing towards acceptance of integration as they had done in the north. The discussions between Jean Louise, her uncle, and father were well expressed, however disagreeable the subject matter......at times the writing was undistinguished as coming from an award winning writer.
I was pleasantly surprised with the book. After reading many mixed reviews, I found the book to be an interesting insight into the psyche of Southern Culture. The recent controversy over the Confederate flag and a few KKK demonstrations puts a human perspective on our reluctance to change as a nation. Atticus Finch still elevates himself above the masses despite his human shortcomings. Jean Louise (Scout) comes of age as a outsider examining the closed community of Maycom, AL.
When Atticus says he's glad Scout's finally come to stay and be a voice for HER SIDE of the brewing argument on civil rights, it shows that Atticus is trying to understand and work WITH people who he refuses to see as "the enemy" but rather, he sees his friends and neighbors as people who have been fed their misconceptions and hatred and it's been passed down for generations.  It's not going to be overcome without struggle and if given enough time, younger generations will see the truth, in the author's opinion from what I gleaned from the novel.
Just because you are over a certain age you may not be grown up.  We travel the devastating moments when Scout becomes Jean Louise in this book.  While it has been a very long time since Ms. Lee penned this novel, it is a fine example of life at the time.  Many people won't like the language, the attitude of some characters or the ideas expressed, but if you stick with it, you will have read a superb book about a girl coming of age.  In a little while it will be picked up again and the second and subsequent readings will help me understand a little more.
I can see why Harper Lee's publisher sent this manuscript back to her with recommendations to develop the main character. Watchman is very clearly a rough draft that needed editing. The story is disjointed in places, has odd segues and badly needs character development. The publisher was wise. Watchman would never have achieved the literary success that Mockingbird did. I do recommend reading the book if the reader has read Mockingbird to see how Ms Lee matured as an author. If you have not read Mockingbird I suggest you do so before reading Watchman.
This was a disappointment. Don't appreciate the false advertising about it.
Should have left the manuscript where the author had left it...in a drawer.
Disappointing considering the grandeur of To Kill a Mockingbird.
I was a bit concerned after reading some commentary prior to reading the book myself, especially when "Atticus is prejudiced" was announced. However, if one takes one's time to actually read the story, one will find that Atticus and Scout continue to do what's right in the best way each of them are able. Excellent continuation of the story, and thank you, Ms. Lee, for letting us know what happened next.
I have heard a lot of negatives about this book, with people stating they were disappointed by the character of Atticus.  I think it's important to bear in mind that although set 20 years in the future, the book was actually written prior to Mockingbird, hence I don't think the characters were yet fully developed.  If you can keep that in the back of your mind while reading, I don't think you will feel such disappointment.  I enjoyed meeting Scout as a young lady who once idolized her father, then realizing that he is only human, with human flaws.
It was struggle for me to finish this book. Where I was completely engrossed in To Kill A Mockingbird this one didn't grab me at all. Characters who I found extremely interesting in Mockingbird had me asking myself who cares. The book doesn't come close to meeting the hype and build up it received. Save your money. All I could think of as I read this was "The publisher is hoping her reputation will sell." I now understand why she took fifty years between books.
I'm glad I didn't buy this book.  After reading the history of the manuscript and reading the story, I have a hard time believing it was meant to be a book.  If Harper Lee did write it, it's obvious she didn't mean for it to be published.  After the first few chapters, I was suspicious of its age.  I think it was written after the 1950s.  Since Ms Lee is unable to confirm or deny her part in this story, I think it's a shame it was published at all.  I would suggest anyone, libraries, book stores, and Amazon, remove this book from their inventory.
Unreadable
To appreciate Go Set a Watchman you probably should have read To Kill A Mocking Bird fairly recently.  I originally read Mocking Bird at an early age and then re-read it a few years ago as an adult.  You get a very different perspective when you view the original book through a lens filled with your own life experiences.  I appreciated Watchman, and I think its benefit was helping the reader understand some of what has recently happened in the South, particularly with the Confederate flag controversy and the context of how people feel about it.
a snoozer in the 1st half, but the ending made up for its quiet beginning.
Did not even seems like the same person that wrote To Kill a Mocking Bird.
Interesting book considering what is going on in our country at this time.
I loved "Go Set a Watchman"!  It's easy to want Atticus to remain as he was portrayed in "To Kill a Mockingbird" but I found that showing him as a complex person (as most real people are) made this the perfect sequel. Scout Finch was exactly as I would have pictured her. Harper Lee has created a new classic....having grown up in the South, I'm sure she had many people from which to pattern the characters.  I do hope they make a movie sequel as well!
I was hesitant to read this book. I had, of course, read "To Kill a Mockingbird." I had also heard and read reviews of this book after it first came out. Everyone said if you like "To Kill a Mockingbird" you would be mad or disappointed with this book. Actually, I really enjoyed this book. I was disappointed at Atticus, but thought it was another way to describe people's feeling towards the situation. I like to take in all viewpoints and though this was just another explanation for some opinions during an era in our history.
Had a hard time getting through this after reading To Kill A Mockingbird.
Should never have been published.  Contrived.  Needs significant editing.
Read it as if you never heard of To Kill A Mockingbird .<br/>I love the coming of age that a daughter experiences about her beloved<br/>parent being a human being with flaws as well as goodness .<br/>Living in a real world in a real time, with real people in that particular place and time.<br/>It is about what is in our hearts and learning to make a difference<br/>with what we can do little by little to learn to make changes in<br/>justice and fairness.
Save your money! This work was never meant to be published as a book. Irreverent powers saw an opportunity make money, plain and simple. A total mockery of 'mockingbird'. Plods along, with a fairly interesting first three quarters, revealing the white southern way of the Deep South of the 50's. The last part of this book is soooo bad it's an embarrassment. Even the pro equal rights and justice argument is consumed by totally racist and inappropriate language. There no reason this book warrants any merit other than financial opportunity.
Glad I borrowed it from the library instead of running out to buy it. I couldn't even finish it, it was so boring. I think it was a big money making scheme put on by the publisher. Lee didn't care about publishing this manuscript, or she would have done so years ago. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird. It will always be one of my favorites.
Other readers told me they heard this newly discovered book by Harper Lee wasn't any good but I really liked it.  It takes place when 'Scout' is in her mid-twenties and returns to her home in Georgia for a ten day vacation from NYC.  She reunites with her old boyfriend, but things go askew as she learns that the South is not changing as quickly as her own principles had, including the thoughts/actions of Atticus, her beloved father.  She has to really question how she wishes to proceed in her life and I found it profoundly interesting.
What a disappointment! I hated this book as much as I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird"!<br/>The main character, Jean Louise, is an unlikeable, foul-mouthed harridan. The story is one argument after another. There is no action. I regret reading it and can't recommend it at all. It's a sequel that should never have been published.
An interesting and provocative sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Atticus becomes a much deeper and more complex character, but not, I think, inconsistent with the beloved and respected character in TKaM.  In the first place you have to consider author's perspective TKaM was written by an 8-year-old, GSaW a mature and worldly woman.  The central questions are how one does good in difficult (if not impossible) circumstances and what does it mean to respect each person as an individual and to treat all persons with equality.
I guess you could say it is something you should read just to see what the hubbub was about. You will most likely be disappointed. I don't care what anyone says, I think it was part of the original manuscript that was just cut out by the editors because that's what editors do. I also think it was a money-making scheme by the publishers and Harper Lee and her relatives to bring it out now. They played it well and I'm am sure the estate is much richer now.
The editors were correct when they told Lee to focus on her childhood, because these are the most poignant sections of Go Set A Watchman. To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic, and this 'novel' is nothing but a pathetic attempt to make money off of a well known name. It will be on the dollar table at B & N very soon. I just hope it does not tarnish the reputation of a well deserved classic.
I don't know what I expected but, in my jaded opinion reading the book did not justify the pre-publication hoopla.  I read the book in spurts, not the incessant page-turning I did with "Mockingbird."  On the other hand, to have a book published when you're 89 is wonderful by itself.  I salute Miss Lee and wish I could get her autograph in "Watchman."  I checked "Mockingbird" out of the library so many years ago and read it at least twice. Money was tight in the 60's and you know the rest--non-buyer remorse.
It was very good. However, I think To Kill a Mockingbird is much better.
I liked "To Kill A Movkingbird" better but this was a good read.
A good read in in itself but not as good as Harper Lee's first book  "To Kill a Mockingbird"  It is a new slant on life in the South as change is taking place and viewed thru the eyes of  Jean Louise (Scout) when she returns to  visit her father Atticus Finch from New York where she has lived for several years.  She sees things in a new perspective and is shocked when she realizes are her father's attitude towards the negroes.  It does not appear that this book was edited and also whether it was completed by this author
I was really  thinking  this book would be a real look into scouts life. It was a sad reflection no wonder  the original publisher sent it back to  miss Lee to redo and expand on character substance.  I  was sad to see the flawed side of Atticus as he was my literary hero but we are all flAwed. Scout became Atticuses hero. I think that is what we all hope for our children. The book read like  short story not a novel. I wish it had not been published.
Unreadable. Zero plot by page 100. 1950's version of self indulgent naval gazing. It makes me believe in the conspiracy theory that after this draft was initially rejected, Harper Lee went home and collaborated with her friend Truman Capote on Mockingbird. What's the chances two multimillion best selling authors are friends who hail from the same small town in Alabama anyway? It also explains why she never published anything again after Mockingbird.
I am glad I bought the book, and not sorry I read it.  I am not sure it should ever have been published.  The story was a little thin and too quickly resolved in the end.  I hope Harper Lee has plenty of money to live in comfort.  I hope that my purchase of the book helped her.  I think she had not published the book because it wasn't ready.  I was reminded of the book Willie Morris's wife published after his death.  I enjoyed the hype.  Maybe others enjoyed the book or will read To Kill a Mockingbird.  I will read it again.
I felt that this book should have never been published.  It was poorly--if at all--edited.  It is merely a rough draft of To Kill a Mockingbird.  You can really see the work that went into creating a much better book--TKAM.  I think it has a few poignant moments in the story, but mostly it was just uncomfortable to read.  I am glad I read it, so I can see all the hard work that  went into creating a masterpiece.  But I really would not recommend it to a true Harper Lee fan.  This book is a disappointment.
I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird". Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for this follow-on. In this story, the characters are older and they have changed quite a bit. Further, the story is a bit all over the place. Jean Louise (Scout) has frequent flashbacks during the story. While these add to understanding how she has grown into a woman, the transitions to the flashbacks are awkward and sometimes they seemed forced. Although, Harper Lee's writing style is fantastic with a great use of vocabulary.
NOT A GOOD READ AT ALL. No wonder the publisher sent the initial writing back to Harper Lee to rewrite......and that she did in the wonderful book TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD.  What amazes me is how she turned the whole story around from what this writing was. I never finished this book because I was struggling to even pick it up to read and secondly my girlfriend who persisted reading it said not to even bother finishing the book.
I found Go Set A Watchmen totally engrossing and had a hard time putting it down.  When read outside the "To Kill a Mocking Bird" mindset, it is a great novel about post World War II Alabama, coming of age of a motherless girl, and the effects of the early Civil Rights Movement.  In a matter of days, Jean Louise learns that the world is not what she thought it was and learns a lot about her own prejudices in that time.
I was jaded by what I had read others say about this book before I read it myself. First, it was very refreshing to be reading Harper Lee again. I always enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird and her use of the English language. That's well reflected in Go Set a Watchmen. I started to think the story had become predictable but then it ended in a way I did not expect. I liked the book and if you like Harper Lee I'd suggest reading it.
"To Kill A Mockingbird" it's not... but it gives the reader some insights into the ethos of the Southern psyche. I realized that the progress of racial acceptance and respect did not go away following the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960's. I kept thinking that this was written 50+ years ago, but the plot,theme, and characters seem to be stepping out of today's headlines. Good read... Still leaves some questions unanswered. Maybe there's a third manuscript that will fill in some of the blanks?
Sorry I bought it.  Feel duped by publisher.  Was nearly unreadable.
Harper Lee definitely had one good book in her, and this was not it.
Very well written. Read Mockingbird first before you read this book.
Very disappointing--nothing interesting really happened in this book
I was very, very disappointed with this book. There was lots of character description, lots of setting description, but little or no plot.  I have taught English for many years and To Kill a Mockingbird was on the 10th grade syllabus.  So, I was hoping that her sequel would live up to the book that was written so long ago, and I do not think it did.  I wasted my time and money on this sequel, and most of all, I feel cheated!
I can understand why Harper Lee's editor suggested she write a novel telling the story as Scout the child and not Jean Louise the adult.  I liked about two thirds of this book but the last third I did not enjoy.  I did not like Jean Louise's reactions to the thought that her father was a racist.  I thought that Atticus was a man of his time having grown up in the south,  he would have held those beliefs.  A notable read if only because of the author's masterpiece of "To Kill a Mockingbird".
A LITTLE disappointing as what can surpass  "To Kill a Mockingbird!" Actually, this was written BEFORE.... The one thing I find sad, even though I have not finished reading "Go Set a Watchman" is that Atticus Finch turns out to be a RACIST!  What can I say?  Not surprising as the story takes place in the Deep South, but that was what was SO wonderful in "To Kill a Mockingbird" when a black man was given a fair trial and treated as a human being by some......... Again, sad..
Would give it another half a star if I could. I was so worried it would be dull, but Scout is as funny as ever. I wish her life in NY city was a bit more fleshed out, and of course, I wish I knew how it turned out later too. We do find out that Atticus has feet of clay, but he raised her right and she's still our hero, even if he's slipped from sainthood.
terrible!
Excellent
I understand why Harper Lee's publisher told her to go back and write a book about Scout as a girl. That was a more endearing story. Go Set... does not have the same appealing qualities as Mockingbird. This is not a bad book, but it was nothing special for me. I also believe one of the themes of the book - Scout's revulsion at the willingness of the "good white southerners" to go along with segregation - might have been punchy when it was written, but has been diluted by time and events.
I really don't remember if it was first person or not, but not important.  I was disappointed in the book and story overall.  It certainly wasn't up to the caliber of To Catch a Mocking Bird, but then, how many other books are.  I did appreciate and reflected upon  Atticus's feelings about race relations as they weren't what I expect based on Mocking Bird.  It is, however, easy to take those feelings and transfer them to similarities of issues today on illegal immigration and muslims in the USA.
Ends rather abruptly, leaving you believing the book is unfinished.
Very disappointed in this book. It did not live up to all the hype.
I was curious to read the novel since I consider To Kill a Mockingbird a favorite. While interesting it didn't have the power of TKAM.  The writing was early Harper Lee. The characters did not have the depth that I was hoping for in the novel. The main conflict regarding racism was raised but concluded that it was just a part of living in Maycomb. Characters outside the Finch family had little to add to the plot. Reading the novel was worth the time, but it is not a powerful story.
Harper Lee is a National Treasure as one of our most revered writers. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the top 5 novels of all time,  Go Set a Watchman is wonderful in the use of the same characters, and the locale.  It is a disturbing read in the way that Atticus is portrayed, along with the other Southerners, in their beliefs though. Realizing that the author may have written this prior to Mockingbird, and thus still in the time of continued<br/>hatred, I read it for what it was.
It's hard not to compare this book to To Kill a Mockingbird as it obviously comes up short. The plot was routine until a confrontation occurs between Jean Louise and her father over race relations.  It is a very good window into small-town southern attitudes before the civil rights unrest in the 1960's.  It also explores a daughter's disillusionment at a father who turns out not to be the knight in shining armor she thought he was.  For that reason alone, the book is worth reading.
A big disappointment after To Kill a mockingbird but it was okay.
Enjoyable. Not up to mockingbird standards but still a good tale.
I loved reading another novel by Harper Lee - it's like returning home to a familiar setting and characters. Atticus's apparent change of heart was unsettling, but it's worth reading to the end to understand the complexity of the attitudes and mindsets of the time. We have to be careful not to place our modern sensibilities into a story written about and in a time so very different from our own. Perhaps this shows the mechanism of how attitudes have changed over the last 50 years.
Very disappointed in this Harper Lee story. I totally understand why her original editor sent her back to the drawing board and we go To Kill a Mockingbird. If you are expecting the same depth of character and story pace, you will be disappointed too. This novel should have stayed in the "closet" so to speak. Don't waste your money.
I liked that the book had spirt , a desire for greatness and perfection, and that it showed a way to work on these  issues.  I did not like that I was always turning the pages backwards to find out who said what, where and what our heroine was trying to convey, and trying to accomplish.  Too much drama at the end of the book when it could have flowed easier and made the reading more enjoyable.  The story may or may not be useful today as we seem to be going backwards once again.
I feel humbled in even attempting to review this work; Humbled by the formidable literacy of the book and it's characters and by the depth of the novel's exploration of what it means to be an American from the South. I hope that many will read it with widely open eyes and minds and appreciate it in all of it's complexity. Thank you Harper Lee from this Memphis girl who married her Yankee far from home.
I had a hard time keeping up with who's who..didn't seem to remember what year she was in!<br/>Half way through, I had to picture her with the name "Scout" not Jean Louise..even maybe if Ms. Lee used<br/>just Louise it might have been easier to follow. I had seen the movie, To Kill A Mocking Bird at least  a<br/>dozen times and found it easier to see "Scout" when her role was as a youngster, but when she was<br/>older..I had  hard time, otherwise it was o.k.
A disappointment. Too preachy. This is no mockingbird.
Clearly shows why her editors asked her to take this and rewrite it from Scouts early years for the epic To Kill A Mocking Bird.  Badly in need of editing and context. Also, 50 years after the fact it shows the societal changes that have occured.  What was considered normal in the late 50's and early 60's in regards to segregation, voting and social norms is now almost unheard of.  It was an uncomfortable read given the pedestal that To Kill A Mocking Bird has been placed on.
Like Scout I was very disappointed in Atticus and his views on the mind set of the south regarding the African American population. At that time I suppose Atticus was doing what he felt he needed to do to keep a level of peace in his environment but, I found it very sad and disappointing.  Scout was somewhat over reactive to her discoveries but I do understand.  She had been living in NYC and us Yankee's do seem to have some different views on the subjects of race even today.
I heard that people were against the book because it showed our beloved Atticus Finch in a bad light.  So I was a little skeptical about reading it.  But it was a wonderful read.  All of the characters that I love were there.  Knowing the back-story, that this book was written first, only added to the delight of this beautiful book. The two stories belong together.  Harper Lee is a brilliant author.
For fans of To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAM), this is a good continuation of that story.  To be fair, there's enough in this book to make it stand on its own but overall, I think that you'll enjoy it much more if you have read TKAM.  I found the arc of story a bit strange - going from the mostly breezy slice-of-life narrative (spiced with a few flashbacks) at the beginning to some very intense interplay between the characters and theme exploration at the end.  A satisfying read.
A major disappointment... obviously not intended for publishing.
Thank God that editor recommended turning this into Mockingbird.
I wish I never bought it. Not even half the book Mockingbird is.
disappointing after To Kill A Mockingbird which was so excellent
It doesn't have the humor and suspense of To Kill A Mockingbird.
Read this book. Atticus is still a great person just not as forceful as he was in To Kill a Mockingbird. But Scout grows up and finds her true self. No characters are destroyed in Go Set a Watchman, it is simply told from a different perspective about a different time. I will<br/>always love Mockingbird and it's the one that deserved the Pulitzer, but I'm sure glad I got to read the book that got Nelle Harper Lee to her Masterpiece. Thank you Miss Lee!!<br/>God Bless you.
I read reviews about this book and didn't expect to like it.  Some of it was slow and unnecessary, such as a lengthy description of children playing, and unclear descriptions of their games.  However, I found the chapters about Atticus and "Scout" to be understandably realistic considering that it was placed in Alabama in the early 60's.  I ended up thinking the book had value, once one remembers that Atticus and Scout are fictional characters describing that time.
There is no way that this long-awaited second novel from the reclusive Harper Lee could have come close to achieving the popularity and acclaim of "To Kill a Mockingbird", so I intentionally avoided reading any reviews until I had completed the novel. My review is for the audio CD read beautifully by Reese Witherspoon. With her southern accent, Witherspoon is perfect as the voice of Jean Louise Finch (Scout), and does a credible job at reading the other voices so that you can distinguish the parts in dialogue.<br/><br/>Jean Louise has returned from New York to her childhood home of Maycomb, Alabama at the age of 26 for an extended summer visit and is looking forward to spending time with her father, Atticus Finch, and other family members as well as her best friend, almost-fiance, Hank. She yearns to find in Maycomb the idyllic, unchanged world of her childhood which probably exists only in her mind. At the same time, she chafes at the fact that nothing has changed. She is considering accepting Hank's proposal of marriage, but can't see herself leading a life as a Maycomb wife, discussing recipes and babies and gossiping at morning coffee hour...<br/><br/>When Jean Louise is confronted with the specter of overt racism where she least expects it, among her family members, she is horrified and angry and lashes out at them with her opinions and her sharp tongue. The times have changed in Maycomb, and the racial divide has actually widened since her childhood. Even their beloved housekeeper Calpurnia, who took the role of Jean Louise's missing mother, has turned her back on the Finch family. Jean Louise is truly color blind, and unable to comprehend or condone the racism she sees all around her, while others excuse it or actively work to keep the Negroes in their place on the other side of the tracks. When she tries to discuss it with her Auntie (Atticus' sister who has taken over the running of his household), Auntie calls her a "right peculiar girl".<br/><br/>With this novel, Harper Lee got up on her soapbox to spout her feelings about racism and stereotypes and the backwardness of the south. It gets a bit preachy at times, and would certainly not have made her a popular author during this post-war time in the deep south. It isn't clear to me who carries the role of the "Watchman" (from the biblical verse in the title) - Atticus or Jean. Lee has a wonderful ability to craft multi-dimensional interesting characters and put us right in the scene with her powers of description. I enjoyed the intelligent dialogue, the literary allusions, and the amusing flashbacks into Jean Louise's childhood in Maycomb. There is no mention of the famous trial that became the subject of the novel To Kill a Mockingbird, although some of the original characters come up, particularly Jem (her brother), Boo Radley, Calpurnia, and a few others.  Although she's probably too old to write another novel, it would be interesting to have a discussion with Harper Lee about racism in the south now - nearly 60 years later.
I feel like I got catfished.  I kept trying to convince myself while reading that the book was good, since TKAM is so sacred to me. There are a couple of enjoyable flashbacks, when the old squad is back together, (literally 2) but they really don't further the plot of GSAW at all. It's like Harper Lee knew she was spouting out to many Maycomb/Atticus doldrums so she generously threw those parts in as some comic relief.<br/><br/>The major issue in the story, besides the lack of plot, (Scout basically just goes from place to place fretting/flailing around) isn't really that the characters are so different, but that they're just so unbelievable. I'm sure even my dog knows by now that Atticus is a racist in this book, but the lack of character development made him completely unconvincing.<br/>Scout's over-the-top hysterical reactions to his new way of life were also just too bizarre. And regardless if she disagrees with Atticus or not, I cannot see someone with Scout's upbringing going as batshit as she did during, I guess, what was the climax of the story.<br/><br/>Uncle Jack was a complete weirdo with very little charm. Aunt Alexandra is about the same, although she really just functions as a much-less-enjoyable Calpurnia.  Hank/Henry is kind of adorable during the flashbacks, but is downright annoying as an adult.<br/><br/>Yes, I'm being picky, but the point is that all of these characters, including Atticus and Adult Scout read like minor, flat characters.<br/><br/>One thing I did like about the writing, not necessarily the story, is that you can see Lee's writing process. There are several phrases from TKAM that are basically word for word in GSAW. Obviously this doesn't make GSAW any better, since we're already read these descriptions, but it is interesting to see how Lee made her edits here and there.<br/><br/> I can only assume those who gave this "book" 4-5 stars would give E. L. James a similar rating.  Or maybe they got paid for them. Or maybe they're delusional.<br/><br/>If you loved TKAM and need to satisfy your curiosity, go ahead and read the book, but have a few gin and tonics first, and seriously lower your expectations.
I guess I had high expecations after her other novel, although I haven't read it in decades.  The characters simply never connected with me.  I will give it another try in the near future, but one of the most important things about a book is how quickly it captures the reader and connects. This novel just didn't do it for me.  Too much hoopla and not enough substance.  I sure hope they don't bother doing a movie, unless they are planning to completely rewrite the script.
Generally disappointed in the book.  Did not like the storyline.  You don't really connect it with the people in "To Kill A Mockingbird," which is probably best.  Not nearly the quality.  Where in "To Kill A Mockingbird" you have the wonderful flavor of the people and the era... you can almost feel the breeze on your face; "Watchman" misses the boat.  There is some good phrasing, but you don't feel immersed in the story... don't waste your time.
I consider this a coming of age novel. I grew up in the South and this book brougth back such fond memories. I was the Scout of  my neighborhood, taking dares, thinking up pranks to play on my friends and leading them into mischief because they would follow me anywhere. In adulthood this heroine learns some painful truths when Aticus topples off the pedestal on which she had placed him, but she survives the transformation and accepts her new role with admirable aplomb.
I had read "To Kill a Mockingbird" recently and had seen the movie several times over the years.  Although it was interesting to "see" the same characters in this book, it paled in comparison.  The author seems to have a great command of the English language; however, I would get lost in some of the long sentences.  I kept waiting for something to happen, not realizing it was completely centered on an in depth look into the people rather than an event.
No discernible plot, completely disjointed. Very disappointing.
I can see why she didn't want it published. Very disappointing.
Oh my goodness!  Can't tell you how disappointed I was.  I'd waited months for this release and was so excited when it finally came out.  Sadly, my expectations were way too high.  I forced myself through 70% of it, constantly hoping that it would "pick up".  Unfortunately, it never did and I couldn't force myself to finish that final 30%.  So sorry for the sad news, Harper Lee fans!
I stopped reading this book after only two long, tedious chapters. To Kill A Mockingbird was life-changing when I read it as a child and still one of my favorites.  I have read it at least ten times.  I realized that Go Set A Watchman was going to ruin TKAM for me, so I stopped reading.  I had heard the rumors for years that Harper Lee did not write TKAM.  Now I'm really hoping she didn't.
What a disappointment!  It was dull, focused on just one character (Scout) and her homecoming. I kept waiting for something to happen.  Reading it on my Kindle, I didn't notice I was at the end of the book and was anticipating that the book would finally pick up at the next chapter.  Instead, it fizzled to an end. What a dud!
My review is not meant to critique this book for it's literary merit or a thorough examination of the characters and their development. I am just going to say that at no point did I find this book to be at all engaging, enjoyable, or the least bit exciting. The best word to describe this book is boring. I struggled to make it through but ultimately wasn't able to finish it. If it were a movie I would have walked out half way through and asked for my money back.
OK, book, but not nearly up to the standard of Mockingbird.  Mockingbird is one of the most iconic pieces of literature that has ever been written, and unfortunately, sets such a high standard that any other book by Harper Lee is going to be unfairly held up to the same standard.  My wife liked this book for the most part, but is probably going to just be collecting dust on her shelf for the next 10 years rather than getting pulled out and read again and again.
Interesting when viewed as a draft.  Not ready for prime time.
Was a great disappointment. Sorry I spent the money to buy it.
I can see why her publisher encouraged her to rewrite the book
I understand why Harper Lee did not want to publish this book.
Not as good as I thought it would be. It was a little racist .
I was very disappointed in this book.  Would not recommend it.
I do not think the writing was as good as it was in To Kill a Mockingbird.  It almost seems as though it was a different author entirely.  I had been told about the unexpected events in the book beforehand but I decided to read it for myself to decide if the events were out of character or not for Atticus...... I do think they were........ I was disappointed in the end and would not recommend it to readers who have read or seen the movie To Kill a Mockingbird.
Go Set a Watchman is a scam, both by the publisher and the critics.  The book is nonsense; a group of notes stolen from the author and put out by an unscrupulous publisher.  They were banking on the capital of Lee's first book to make it sell.  I urge you not to buy or read this book, being both a waste of money and your time.<br/><br/>A classic example of the Emperor's New Clothes.
Having read TKAM first, this novel didn't stand a chance! It was good; I'm glad I read it, but that's about it. I can appreciate Scott standing up for her beliefs, but she came across as less likable as an adult. This story focused primarily on the race issue and I felt like TKAM covered more issues of the human condition. Had I not read TKAM first, I might have enjoyed this one more.
I LOVE To Kill a Mockingbird but Go Set a Watchman was just OK. I had to make myself keep reading to the end. How do you follow up a book like To Kill a Mockingbird? The bar was raised too high for Harper Lee to be successful. Still, all in all, I did manage to finish the book and I found the last half to be better. Having grown up in the South and during the timeframe of this book, I could identify with Scout and the clash of her ideals with the time period.
After so many years had passed it seemed like Ms. Lee didn't let you get closer than arm's length to each character. Almost like a passing reintroduction to them.  Scout's confrontation with Atticus seemed naïve, drawn out and confusing to the point I lost interest in the interaction.<br/>It was an 'okay' read but at the same time, having read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' many years ago,  It was a 'have to' read. I'm glad that I did get to read it none the less.
Originally, I was nervous that "Go Set a Watchman" would not be as well written or as intriguing as "To Kill a Mockingbird." Yet, after finishing the book earlier today, I'm happy to report that my aforementioned concerns were wrong. I found the book to be just as poignant and moving as its predecessor.
Maybe it's because I am English. This is probably fine for Americans who hanker for the past, in small slices. I found it very scattish and meaningless in places. The one area I did not like was the ending, I don't know about anyone else but slapping a woman round the face and then making her drunk is not my kind of therapy for any form of "tantrum" even if it's fictional.
I wonder if Harper Lee knows that this book was published because didn't her editor initially reject it and tell her to rewrite it--which she rewrote as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD? Was she aware that her family had this published? As an author, if someone tried to publish my earlier novels that were rejected and unedited I would shudder knowing someone paid money to read them. The plot wandered. I loved her characterization, but the story didn't seem cohesive.
Read it because it's from a classics author however this book doesn't appear to have the same clarity as her first published book. It's style struggles to translate to now. There is a lot of anguish in the book and the writer gets caught in detail rather than writing in a clean and precise way. The story is single focused around scout and her memories whilst to kill a mocking bird was timeless. this one is time bound. And now ticked of the must read list.
I agree with a previous reviewer who called this exactly what it is. It's a first, very rough, draft of TKAM.  The parts that were used and fleshed out in TKAM are wonderful here. The rest?  Somewhat disjointed and rambling in parts.  Scout seems very angry throughout most of the book.  Glad they changed her tenor for TKAM.  There's no way to read this as a stand alone. Not possible so I didn't even try.  I do think it's worth reading, but it's not good!!
The book started about one-half of the way into it. When the author finally got around to the point of the story it was at the end. Glad I read it, but would suggest reading from midpoint to the end, especially if you have read To Kill a Mockingbird. I did appreciate understanding the segregationist point of view -- I don't agree with it, but understand it now. I enjoyed the lesson of tolerance and being able to allow others a voice, even if you disagree.
So happy to be back in the world of TKAM even if it is slightly off kilter.<br/>Regardless of the changes, I enjoyed hearing more, good and bad.<br/>TKAM is and always will be my favorite book. Nothing will ever change that.<br/>Thank you for a bit more of Ms. Nellie Harper Lee and the world in which Scout lives.
Having grown up in a small Alabama town, I can relate to this book. This book touches on the real or imagined conflicts dealing with race relations at that time. Lee pretty much tells it like it was.  Both blacks and whites lived together peacefully before outside influences.. Atticus had to deal with local tension while trying to stay true to his basic beliefs. It is interesting that book could have been written to deal with some of the issues of today
Did not enjoy the book.  Not much to it.  A waste of my time.
Not very well written in my opinion, a struggle to finish it.
Unlike her other novel, this one seemed to be quite pedantic.
Hard to get into this book- not as good as Kill a Mockingbird
just could not get past the third chapter. very disappointed.
Such a disappoint.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" it is not
Everything I expected from Harper Lee. Wonderful and moving.
I read this back to back with To Kill a Mockingbird, and thought Watchman was much less appealing; the writing is inferior, the characters are less engaging, and overall it was not a very enjoyable read.  The sex and violence are minimal and some would say absent, especially by today's standards, but moral and social issues are prominent.  My bookclub shared my disappointment with Go Set a Watchman, but To Kill a Mockingbird earns every acclaim.
I enjoyed the book. It covers a time when there was a lot of protest and prejudice in the country. It reminded me of the past in the 1940's and 1950's when people were coming to Detroit for jobs in the auto industry and moving into previously all white neighborhoods. I felt the book described some concerns in parts of the country when the culture was changing. There was a lot of negative talk and fear expressed by some people about the changes.
I really tried to like this book but couldn't figure out how. I didn't like any of the characters. Jean Louise who is such a vibrant presence in Mockingbird, is a whining, spoiled baby in this book. Atticus, the hero that we all believed in and wished we could meet, is barely visible in the book. I wish I hadn't read this. Better to leave it be and re-read Mockingbird.
I tried hard but could not get farther than half the book. Quite a disappointment after the great Mockingbird classic and no wonder this book was originally rejected by the publisher and never published back then. I was excited like most to pre-order the new release and started reading as soon as I was able to download to my kindle. But the story and writing were too disorganized and badly written that I could not proceed past 50% of the book.
I am glad that I did not read any reviews before reading this book.  I must say that I enjoyed the trip with Jean Louise back to Maycomb. Funny how things are not quite what they used to be when you return home after a long absence. I must say I was hoping for little more depth in the conclusion, but it was not to be. Still, I did enjoy this book; good food for thought. (I was hearing Gregory Peck's voice each time Atticus spoke in the book.)
The story starts out slow and is much less interesting than To Kill a Mockingbird however the last ten pages or so were worth the price of the book.  We learn that some people during those times did not have the luxury of taking on society by the horns and devil may care about the consequences.  Atticus explains his actions to a grown up Scout in a most a stirring monologue that makes him more human than even the man portrayed in Mockingbird.
Go Set a Watchman really disappointed me after reading and studying To Kill A Mockingbird.  I loved Harper Lee's wonderful book, To Kill.... this book was such a disappointment in the development and treatment of the characters, esp. Atticus.  I understand why Harper Lee was sent home with the original manuscript and told to work on the characters.  I'm sorry it was discovered and published.  I like to remember To Kill A Mockingbird fondly.
As much as it pains me to write this review, I have to say that I wasn't at all impressed. I thoroughly enjoyed 'To kill a mockingbird', which is why I probably had such high expectations, but there was no story here. Had this book came out before TKAM, it would have been an absolute flop. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the few comical anecdotes of Scout.
I cannot understand the number of "avid readers" and "lovers of literature" who refuse to read this novel. It is as emotionally engaging as To Kill a Mockingbird and paints a very good picture of the times in which it was written. I'll leave the detailed criticism to experts, but I encourage you to read it and then judge it, not the other way around.
Go Set a Watchman is the worst book I have ever read. If Harper Lee wrote the book, which I doubt. It should have never been published not only due to the horrific content. The bigotry was so terrible it made me feel ill. Poor judgement was used with publishing this possibly fraudulent book which was even poorly written. Probably by someone not even from the South.
Too emotional. The story is more of an argument of a spoiled child that can't listen to anyone else's opinion. The adult Scout doesn't give anyone a chance to express an opinion different than her own. Atticus may sound predjudice at first glance, but he seems to understand you can't force quick change.
This book was never meant to be published and never should.
So bummed...lost inerest in the book so didn't even finish!
Surprisingly well writen, an excellent supplement to TKAMB.
If one publishes only 2 books in their lifetime - they should be these two.  Extraordinary writing and messages. Ms Lee is a wordsmith, selecting the precise word for impact, or tenderness. She is a storyteller par excellence.  The first page transports one back to the scenes we left several years ago when Gem was a child.  She is no longer and she learns more life lessons.  I won't spoil it for you.  But suggest you do not miss this one.
This story is a very insightful look into race relations in the south in the 1950's and before that time, and delved into the reasons why people were racist. I'm not condoning it, just thought it was interesting to see another side, that I have always found hard to understand. The reviews gave away the fact that Atticus Finch may have been a racist, but after reading the book I have a different view of him. All in all, it was a good read.
The book was not nearly as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. It took over half the book for the story line to actually start. If I had not read To Kill a Mockingbird first, I think the book would not have made much sense.The dialogues were so long that it got confusing who was talking which made it difficult to follow.  I am glad that I read it but am disappointed because there was so much hype that it made the book sound better than it was.
I enjoyed Go Set A Watchman. I had been so excited to read it, then disheartened when I started reading opinions of others. I think the trick to enjoying this book is to go into it with no pre-conceived notions and not to expect it to be To Kill A Mockingbird, which it is not. The characters were presented and fleshed out as adults. Atticus was seen and evaluated through an adult Scott's eyes which allowed his pedestal to shake a little.
It's not To Kill A Mockingbird, and, unfortunately, it seems it was rejected for publication all those years ago for a reason. There are flashes of Mockingbird's touching prose, the gentle hand at your back leading you on, but only flashes. An interesting historical companion to Mockingbird, but, at least in my opinion, not a stand-alone novel worthy of its hype.
I did not know quite what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. I loved meeting again all the people I loved in To Kill a Mockingbird, to discover afresh the wisdom, gentleness of spirit, and kindness of Atticus Finch, to rediscover the indepedent mind of Scout. I missed Jem.<br/><br/>This book is as relevant today as it was 65 years ago. Highly recommended.
Harper Lee's experiences in the South provided her with the emotions and torn alliances of justice vrs tradition so poignantly portrayed in this novel. The third person narration provides the reader with the larger picture rarely afforded through first person narration.  This is a thoughtfully crafted book from the heart of an author who has lived the deep Southern resentments of a complicated war.  I highly recommend Go Set a Watchman.
I am a little sad this book was published as it is clearly a first draft and it has all the strengths and weaknesses as such.  The plot line is uneven, the descriptions sometimes flat and the main character is not fully developed.  Lee's editor was right to tell her to rewrite it, and she then did such a masterful job. I had to read it because I was curious, but I would not recommend it to non-writers as they may not be as sympathetic.
I have heard someone say that H. Lee has taken an anti-negro move in this novel. I think she has left us asking what she really meant to do with her character, Atticus Finch, in this novel. Is he anti-negroes or is it as he said, (roughly  quoted) .... I think the  man has a right to say what he feels, as well as anyone else.... in other words, everyone has the right to speak his thoughts even if he does not agree with your thoughts.
A tad laborious in parts, a number of Mocking Bird excerpts are rehashed but no doubt  that is inevitable when this was allegedly penned first . I say allegedly as it really is hard to accept Watchman was Lee's first  manuscript when Arricis' beliefs appear so contrary to those so beautifully portrayed  in Mocking Bird which I am now re-reading to refresh my memory. Could it be Warchman is overhyped! Regardless,, wel. Worth the read.
This is a REJECTED MANUSCRIPT. Published shortly after Alice Lee, Harper's sister/lawyer/guardian died. Published after Truman Capote died. A "prequel" marketed as a "sequel," when in fact it is neither: it's a REJECTED MANUSCRIPT.
I gave it a 5 star rating because I see it as a timeless piece of writing. It delves into the good and the ugly of life in a society. There is truth, perception, opinion, history and the human experience in it's pages and words. Today's headlines leap off page after page. Some 60+ years and we still face these same issues. A time that was, yet a time that is.
As a stand-alone novel, it should probably be 2 or 3 stars. But as an exploration into the background characters and story for Mockingbird, this is a fascinating read. And the debate between a grown Scout and an aging Atticus about the aftermath of Brown Vs Board of Education is still so relevant. This is not a good novel, but a great slice of history, and a great tool for beginning writers to peek behind the curtain of the process.
Reads like a first draft and a poor one at that.
This is no "Mockingbird".  Don't waste your money.
Pretty sure she never wanted this manuscript to be public.
My expectations for another great story were not realized!
But not a great work. Not a patch on the author's other book. As many have said, it lacks a defined plot, certainly for the first 100 or so pages. I do think some of the writing - the actual use of language - is quite skilled and remarkable. I guess I would recommend reading it, but don't expect a lot. The best point it makes is that bigotry is not always what we've thought it to be, and that bigotry, in any form, is reprehensible.
This novel undermined the inspiring message derived from To Kill a Mockingbird. I was disappointed with the story for this reason. I also found it somewhat confusing to have the author digress to characters and information previously presented in To Kill a Mockingbird. At times it was unclear whether the events being described were about happenings in the current novel or additional information surrounding the plot of Mockingbird.
This book takes you to a different, simpler time.  As Scout grew older, race relations intensified as blacks fought for equal rights.  The thing that resonated with me is the varying degrees of racism.  Even Scout was a racist as she shared her view on inter racial marriage late in the book.<br/><br/>Fast forward to today and you appreciate Harper Lee's vision as race relations are as intense as they have been in 45 to 50 years.
Many have criticized this book because of Atticus' transformation but I feel in doing so, they have missed the point of the book. It is my opinion that Atticus' transformation is not really a transformation at all but is a reflection on the notion that people have many faces--one that we show at home, one that we show or friends, one we wear at work, one that we use out in public. Not even the virtuous Atticus was immune to this.
I have mixed feelings toward the editor who originally rejected this manuscript, and gave us "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Had "Go Set a Watchman" been published, we might never have had TKaM, but we may never know how close we came to not having GSaW.  If Ms. Lee's reputation were not secured by TKaM, this one cements her position as one of the true greats.
This book received a lot of hype, while I don't feel that a met the hype I thought it worth the read.  It was interesting to read of a grown up Scout.  Her spunky personality stayed.  I also liked the flash back stories of childhood.  I felt like there were some loose ends but overall it was an enjoyable read. I'm still trying to decide if I liked how things were wrapped up,but I like mulling over a book after the read is done.
It a great book when read as an adult looking back.  It's always tough to realize that the child saw the perfect hero dad in To Kill a Mockingbird  but when seen through her adult eyes that dad was not perfect in Go Set a Watchman.  Events going on around us shape who we are and who we become.  Atticus is still a hero in my eyes.  I also understand why  Harper Lee did not want to publish it.  Still I couldn't resist reading it.
Whereas TKAM was an excellent book with excellent character development and with a controversial topic presented in an allegorical way, this book should have remained in storage.  The struggle for racial justice is timeless, but here the rhetoric and the passionate speeches were standard during the Civil Rights era and now are referenced in short hand.
I was excited to read this since I loved To Kill a Mockingbird.  This book had a lot less plot.  It was sometimes hard to follow who was speaking.  It was sometimes hard to distinguish when Jean Louise was talking as opposed to thinking something in her head.  The language was a bit tedious.  I did enjoy the character development, but some of the characters were inconsistent with their younger selves in To Kill A Mockingbird.
This book was so boring I found no point in finishing it.
Such a disappointment.  I can't believe it was published.
I know why it was rejected. Story was all over the place.
It was hard to finish this book and was a disappointment.
Didn't rise to my expectations.  Hard to follow at times.
I found this novel interesting from the perspective of watching a developing artist.  Lee's style was just developing that was to later blossom into Mockingbird.  I wasn't bothered by denigrating the Atticus icon, nor by the racism as I had been warned about it.  But there just wasn't enough here to make a good read and this disappointed me.  Still yet, glad I read it and marry my opinion about this book to other influences.
If you don't expect this to be the same as To Kill a Mockingbird, the story is interesting.  This is not the same Scout and Aticus of Mockingbird.<br/>The twist are the attitudes of Aticus and Henry or Hank toward black people.  The story moves almost too fast all taking place in a 2 or 3 day span of Scout's vacation back home.  I am glad to have read it.  I probably would not have done so if I was not a fan of Mockingbird.
Scout, having lived away for several years, sees those she loves and who formed the foundation of her upbringing from a different perspective. Trusts earned and honorable traits assumed in her childhood are shattered by revelations during a visit home.  She is repulsed by discovered intolerances and prejudices, but does she realize her own intolerances?  This book was thought-provoking. I loved TKAM. TSAW did not disappoint.
Not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Not a page turner. Good discussion of change and the evolution of social views ever so slowly in the south. Scout grown up, has views of her own very different from Atticus. Has some relevance for today's social issues. Harper Lee was either ahead of her time or people just haven't changed as much as we think.
Horrible.<br/>It's a shame this was published. Just taking advantage of Harper Lee to make a few bucks. It tarnishes her image big time.<br/><br/>Price of book was slashed some 40% in a matter of weeks. What does that tell you. Save your money and buy a couple of comic books<br/>instead. You'll enjoy them much more.<br/><br/>END OF REVIEW
Wish I could say better things.  It was nice to have the characters pictured in my head especially an older Gregory Peck. I enjoyed some of the stories of Scout's youth especially when she thought she was pregnant.  The story was very thought provoking and I certainly felt Scout's disappointment in her father.  It was good to follow her shock and then acceptance and coming through with the help of her aunt and uncle,
The book itself was disappointing.. It did not have the narrative hook (the mystery and trial) of To Kill a Mockingbird.  It was more like a lecture than a story and so it did not live up to the hype.  However, if it was written when claimed, it is a remarkable social picture of the struggles in the south at that point in time.  Thus, I was glad I read it for that reason.. but as a stand alone novel, it doesn't work.
Must pay attention. It bounces around between past and present.<br/>I love the way Scout is still Scout even all grown up.<br/>I'm only half way through, and while it's entertaining and funny at times, I don't see it really going anywhere. It's just a nice story.<br/>That said, I'm really enjoying it.<br/>A must read if you loved To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>I love the way Harper Lee brings her characters to life.
The hpye on this book has been so distorting.  The so-called racism of Aticus reflects the advocacy of our times and does not consider the nuances of the issue in tho times the novel is set in.  The theme is more about coming of age of Scout.  The story ends abruptly and the writing throughout is poor.  Why didn't she let it lie in the closet?
What a disappointment! This novel neither offers the calibre of writing nor plot details of her most famous work and I can see why it was rejected. The characters are undeveloped as is the focus of her story. Seemed like a long short story to me. Just makes me wonder how she made such a quantum leap to be able to write To Kill a Mockingbird - there must have been a very heavy-handed editor (perhaps Truman Capote???)
"Go Set a Watchman" was the first draft of TKAM and consequently should not have seen the light of day. Supposedly it was discovered in a safe deposit box attached to a final copy of TKAM. Ms. Lee spent nearly two years transforming GSAW into TKAM under the editorial guidance of the book publisher J.B. Lippincott. The result, one of the best and most beloved books ever written. But a grave injustice was done to Ms. Lee and the reading public with the publication of the GSAW manuscript.<br/><br/>If one had never read TKAM I believe many a reader would find this manuscript lacking in any sense of character development. Who are these people? All we know of Jean Louise is that she grew up in Maycomb, was motherless, sort of had a boyfriend then sort of a fiance, was now living in NYC. Doing what? We don't have a clue. We know her dear brother died which doesn't seem to affect her much. We know she thought of herself as racially colorblind and she believed her father, until her yearly visit home, was as well. Certainly Jean Louise had a rude awakening during this particular visit but without knowing how Atticus was depicted in TKAM (had I not read the book) why should I find this information to be earth shattering or a reason to disavow a father you otherwise dearly love and respect.<br/><br/>Told in the third person this manuscript offers little insight into this family, who these people are.The Lippincott editors were correct in guiding Ms. Lee to a first person narrative allowing Scout to relate her imprinted childhood memories. Through Scout's voice we understand and recall as adults the joys, fears and questions we experience as children. Make no mistake about it, GSAW is not a sequel to TKAM. It is that from which TKAM thankfully arose. Kudos to Lippincott and Ms. Lee. Shame on you Harper Collins.
I chose not to read a single review before reading this book because I didn't want any spoilers or preconceived feelings toward the book. I purchased the book under the assumption that it was a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird because that is how I had heard it spoken about. Unfortunately, after reading the book and reading the reviews, I learned that it is not a sequel, but instead it is the first draft of TKAM. Because I read the book thinking it was a sequel, I was quite disappointed in it.<br/>1. The edges of the pages are uneven. Is this because it is supposed to resemble older books? One of my favorite parts of a new book is how the pages are perfectly lined up. (This has nothing to do with content, but is was aesthetically displeasing.)<br/>2. This book was boring. I'll give it the second star because it is a first draft and not a sequel, but I almost didn't finish reading it. I've only not finished 2 books in my life, and this one was almost the third. I know it was a first draft now, but it surely could have been revamped, or it needed to be advertised as a first draft. Either of those two options would have earned this book at least 1 more star from me.<br/>3. Jean Louise (Scout) seemed like a whiney brat. One minute she's yelling at everyone around her, and the next minute she is respectfully listening and replying, "yes sir," or "no ma'am." I understand the revelation she gets of her father (I've been there personally, just not quite as extreme), but she seemed like such a child in her responses. She reminds me of a Disney Channel character. If this is the way she is supposed to be portrayed, I don't care to read anything else about her or any other characters like her.<br/>4. There were some loose ends that didn't get tied up by the end of the novel. These include Zeebo's son's trial, Calpurnia's turning away from Jean Louise, Jean Louise and Hank (this is mentioned, but it would have been neat to actually read the conversation), etc. If these had been more fully addressed in the novel, it would have earned another star from me.<br/>5. I did like when Jean Louise would reminisce about events from her childhood. I felt those were well written and interesting. If her conversations with other characters in the present setting were more like her memories, I would have found the book much more appealing. In fact, I found her reminiscings more mature than her present actions.<br/>Overall, I was disappointed in this book. It is not a book that I will read more than once.
I got my print copy of Go Set a Watchman yesterday.<br/><br/>Most people who read To Kill a Mockingbird identify with Scout. The character I most identify with is Mayella Ewell.  She famously said, "I got somethin' to say," I'm going to say what I have to say.<br/><br/>Yes, I read the New York Times review. So what? I have been writing book reviews for years. Here are my bona fides:<br/><br/>I was born and raised in south Alabama, less than forty miles from where Harper Lee grew up, a few decades before me. I attended and received a degree from the University of Alabama. I wrote my first published novel about love and racial tension in a small southern town, set a couple of decades later than To Kill a Mockingbird. My second novel continued the story, set in the same place, with the same characters, in time a decade or two after the civil rights movement of the sixties. I still loved those characters and that place. It's where I am from.<br/><br/>I sent Harper Lee a copy of my first book, and received a lovely hand-written reply from Alice Lee. Nelle can't see well enough to read fine print any more, she said, but wishes me well in my writing endeavors.<br/><br/>My mother was my Atticus, my hero, my touchstone. She was born the same year as Harper Lee, and so grew up, poor white but not trash, in the same time period, in the same place, south Alabama.<br/><br/>Mama occasionally used the n-word, but she meant no offense by it. Some black people are crazy, mean, and lazy, just like some white people, but some black people are good, Christian, decent people despite all the incentives to be otherwise. They are sometimes better than good, Christian, decent white people who know no better than to read their Bibles too literally and examine their own family history not closely enough.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is what it is, a rough draft of a book submitted but not accepted for publication. Yes, there are sentences, some paragraphs, that are identical to To Kill a Mockingbird. No one should be surprised by that. This draft was set aside, and completely reworked, through an intense and prolonged editing process, and emerged as the finely crafted novel so many cherish today.<br/><br/>Nor should any fan of the classic work be surprised that the characters in Go Set a Watchman are different. The original Atticus was an old man, trying to stem the fast pace of change in his little town, and says some things that are racist. Scout is shocked and disillusioned to find out that her father is a member of the local Citizens' Council, a more refined version of the KKK, with membership culled from civic leaders and businessmen. supposedly to curtail the violent excesses of the KKK and to promote a slower turn toward desegregation and enfranchisement, sort of a benevolent attempt to influence events without bombs, burning crosses, white robes, and lynching.<br/><br/>Jean Louise did not accept this camouflage any more than anyone would. Horrified to find that the father she idealized is an old man with fear in his heart, if not hatred, she must come to terms with the thought that her entire belief system, predicated on what she thought were her father's beliefs, must stand on its own and not depend on the bolster of Atticus, who was not perfect, not a hero, just an old man with a crippling disease, and with a dis-ease about the changes that were happening too fast for the pace of life he lived.<br/><br/>I cried as I read the ending, bogged down in didactic pedantry, most especially in chapter fourteen, when Jean Louise turns to her Uncle Jack to explain and make everything better, just as he did when she was a child. This didacticism continues when Jean Louise faces Atticus in his office.  It is hard to swallow, but underneath, and more to the point, there is Scout's feeling of betrayal, the yearning of a child for reassurance that the father of her idyllic worship is not a coward, as she calls Atticus, among many other names. Jean Louise rants, nearly hysterical with the dissonance. Uncle Jack asks, "Jean Louise, have you ever met your father?"<br/><br/>Lest some of you who also worshiped Atticus and put him on a pedestal resort to the same hysteria, let me assure you that it is safe for you to read this book. While the racism of Atticus is not fully redeemed or reconciled, Uncle Jack does give us this hope: "The law is what he lives by. . .he'll always do it by the letter and by the spirit of the law. That's the way he lives."<br/><br/>So this is what I have to say. If you look for another classic morality tale, if you look for heroes of perfection, you won't find it here. Jean Louise, all grown up, is smart and smart-mouthed, and her mouth gets her in trouble. Jem is not present in Go Set a Watchman. Calpurnia is seen very little, Dill not at all, except in flashbacks to Scout's childhood that are just as wonderful and funny as such scenes were in To Kill a Mockingbird. One thing this rough draft, now published for the world to criticize, proves is that Nelle Harper Lee could write.  The editors at Lippincott saw that, back in 1957, and that's why they took her on.<br/><br/>Miss Lee was asked if she wanted to go through the editing process with this manuscript, and she said no. She is too old to care what people think any more, not that she ever did, much. If people are crazy enough to pay to read an old dusty manuscript, let them. If they want to see her feet of clay, then it's about damn time. She is eighty nine years old, deaf, nearly blind, and resides in an assisted living facility, but she is still sharp as a tack and just as smart-mouthed as Scout or grown-up Jean Louise ever thought of being.  She lives, still, in Monroeville, Alabama, that place she once loved so passionately that she wrote an American classic, a paean to small town life, to fathers we once thought of as heroes, to children.<br/><br/>Miss Lee was asked to write an introduction to the fortieth anniversary edition of To Kill a Mockingbird. She refused, so the publishers instead posted a short note she wrote in 1993: :"Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble."<br/><br/>Probably against what Miss Lee would advise, I have written here a long preamble to encourage those millions who read and loved To Kill a Mockingbird that it is okay. You can read this without shredding illusions you may have held about fictional characters.<br/><br/>To the grown-up and confused Jean Louise, I say this: If Nelle Harper Lee can go home again, so can you.
So I've finished Go Set a Watchman, and read it twice. I’m confused, sad, and honestly, a little pissed off.  One of my favorite books of all times is TKAM, so I had enormous expectations for this book. I preordered GSAW and counted down the days until it's release.  The first half of the book, I relished. It was like meeting a long lost and and beloved friend for the last time. But after that...the story pretty was pretty much over. It starts with Lee’s signature writing style that is so endearing to lovers of TKAM, but by the second half of the book, the diatribes from Atticus and his brother Jack Finch reads like a speech from a modern day white supremicist. Jean Louise, who prefers not to be called “Scout” in GSAW, spends the last half of the book fuming at Atticus over his deviation of the values he taught her, and prepares to return permanently to New York. Only when good old Uncle Jack literally slaps the bloody crap out of Jean Louise, does she see the light and they drive home together in the sunset. It’s one of the biggest "what the hell?" moments I’ve experienced in a long time.<br/>The best I can give this is three stars.  I adored Lee's style of writing, and in the first half of GSAW, you are reunited with that. But the second half...I can't help but wonder if Lee even wrote the second half.  This book is not a finished product, nor is it worthy to stand next to it's predecessor. And I really, really am having a hard time believing that a literary genius like Harper Lee would allow its publication in its current form. Maybe those rumors of Harper Lee being taken advantage of in her elderly age really are true. Whatever the case, something is rotten in the state of Denmark. Excuse me while I spend the next week sulking.
Reads like a draft, not a completed and polished novel.
Didn't finish it...forget why but it didn't capture me.
Not that good afte just finishing To Kill a Mockingbird
Overhyped, not that interesting. Glad when it was over.
I loved it; it was everything I expected and much more!
It was okay but I was disappointed in the way it ended.
It could not compare with ''To Kill A Mockingbird".
I expected the ending to wrap things up and it did not.
Doesn't come close to "To Kill a Mockingbird" .
Not as good as "To kill a Mockingbird", but good on its own. It depicts the Jim Crow South accurately from my perspective (some applies to the North as well). The demeanor of the book even with Calpurnia, the woman who cared for Jem and Scout, where the relationship was strained and Scout goes to visit and was told it was a bad idea to do so. If you are a fan of "Mockingbird", it is a must read.
It is an insult to Kill a Mockingbird
I had read about the book before I read it, so I sort of knew what to expect, but I see why she waited to publish. Good story, absolutely "of the time" it was written in, but Atticus (Gregory Peck, in the movie) is so different from what most of us have come to see that it was extremely jarring. And I was so disappointed in his character. I understand how it could have happened, but so disappointing...
Knowing this was written before Mockingbird made a big difference in how I viewed the interaction between Scout & Atticus.  I found the story compelling & hard to put down.  Very glad it was published.  To Kill a Mockingbird will still remain my all time favorite book, though.
This book reads like a draft of "To Kill A Mockingbird."  All of the essential elements are there, but the narrative is pretty loose and disorganized at times.  It is a worthwhile read, nonetheless, especially for aspiring novelists as it aptly demonstrates the progression from a first draft novel (Go Set A Watchman), to a sensation (To Kill A Mocking Bird) with the benefit of an extraordinary editor.
Too bad Ms. Lee is not in good health and able to finish this book.  It is plainly a first draft and needs a lot of work.  Some delightful vignettes and interesting dialogues.  But especially near the end it becomes interminably talky and preachy.  Back to the editor, please!
There was no suspense, quite boring at times.  Really only three main characters and they weren't fully developed.  Kept making references to her youth (To Kill A Mockingbird) but there was really no connection.  I judge a book if I would like to keep it, reread it, or give it up.  This one I would give up.  Lots of hype over nothing.
I am glad this book was published. If you take into consideration that this was Scout's real understanding of Atticus and that TKAM was written after this story you get a much clearer picture of Atticus himself, not an 8 year old's idealized view of her father. I am glad Harper Lee was able to release this, even at this late date, considering the state of racial injustice that still tears our country apart.
At first the characters are all likeable just as they had been in the Prequel - To Kill a Mockingbird. Somehow the second half of the book took on an entirely different tone - hard to say if the writer was the same. The plot became rather trite and not predictable but out of character for the characters. I don't recommend reading it. There are a ton of great books out there - spend your time reading those.
Harper Lee has an incredible gift of language and characterization. For those who have read To Kill a Mockingbird, there are a few characters who aren't in this story. There was only a brief mention of Miss Maudie. Jean Louise is very much the same as an adult. Though she is dealing with great disillusionment, I think the way Harper Lee finishes the novel helps the reader to resolve some of the challenges.
This story reads as if it was never edited or even read by an editor.  I know that it was or she would have never written the second book, if  indeed, she did write the second book.  I personally cannot believe that this book and TKAM were written by the same person even thought many of the characters came out of the first book.  I am glad to have the book but I am not sure that I will ever read it again.
It helped me to understand the history & struggle of racism from a southern perspective. I live in NH. I'm white & 81 years old; a retired engineer. I lived through the hardest times of racial discrimination. It was not easy & we still struggle with it today, perhaps to a lesser degree.<br/><br/>"To Kill A Mockingbird" was a far better book, but "Go Set A Watchman" was worth reading.
What a boring book.  No wonder it wasn't been published before now.  Don't fall for any hype, Harper Lee had one good book in her and it was published years ago, read To Kill a Mockingbird, but don't bother picking up this one.  You don't have enough time left in your life (no matter how young you are) to waste it on this tripe.
Harper Lee as diarist. It's a beautiful and rich accompaniment to Mockingbird. I definitely can see why it was foregone as a standalone and first work because it raises more questions - the right questions - that Mockingbird subsequently answers. It makes me mourn for the developed and edited follow up that should have happened.
Some discrepancies from "Mockingbird" to "Watchman" regarding Atticus's trial in "Mockingbird" (guilty & Tom's death in prison break attempt) & Jean Louise's trial reference (an aquital.) Different trials?<br/>Also time frame of Aunt moving in to live with Finch family.<br/>"Mockingbird" a much better book. "Watchman" interesting but not a nobel prize winner.
For me, Harper Lee's GO SET A WATCHMAN comes up lacking when compared to her TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Besides strongly needing editing and leaving some minor plots dangling with no solutions, the novel portrays Atticus in such a different light that true fans will exclaim that this version isn't the Atticus that they know and love.  Despite all the hype, this was just an "okay" read for me...
Starts well,  in the same style as Mockingbird, with humorous, engaging characters set in an interesting down and time. Great to catch up on what happened the main characters from Mockingbird. The condescending description of Afro Americans of the time, by Atticus is uncomfortably racist and largely unchallenged by Scout, causing me to lose  my empathy and interest in the characters towards the end.
I felt the story was not as well weaved as I had expected.  Not a bad book, but one should not judge it based on the characters in her second, and very famous book.  People have to realize that this is a book originally turned down by the publisher, and therefore not perhaps her best work.  I am glad I read it as it reflects the issues as they were playing out in the south from their point of view.
Harper Lee shows herself to be  a developing writer when she penned this novel. Pace is rather slow, no highs or lows in the plot, no real climax. That said, the novel exposes Southern culture/worldviews that has relevance today for understanding Southern culture and politics.<br/>It is worth the read, especially if you are a northerner trying to grasp Southern ways of relating and cultural mores.
Interesting, but I sincerely hope that  it is possibly a bit outdated. However I might be wrong as I am not familiar with the current situation in the South. I live in Norway and I do not know how the situation between the coloured and the white population is at this moment. However, judging by recent newslines serious problems still appear to exist. Difficult to believe when seen from far away.
I'm glad I read this book. Having read "To Kill A Mockingbird" many years ago, I was surprised to see another side of the characters with their actions and attitudes. The author was thorough and compassionate in her analysis of them and it helped me see how they came to their beliefs and prejudices. A worthwhile read.
I enjoyed this book without any preconcieved notion or relation to To Kill A Mockingbird and it was magnificent!  The writing is rich and you can't help but to be drawn in immediately.  The story is about a woman coming into her own identity.  You will again, enjoy a character named Scout but this time, from a new perspective
The author wrapped up her first novel leaving me wondering about all her main characters and hoping for more. She closed out "Go Set a Watchman" too quickly, almost as if she decided "enough is enough," leaving me with the thought, "So what?" Sorry to say that compared to "To Kill a Mockingbird," "Go Set a Watchman" is ho-hum. And I pre-ordered it too. Sigh.
I thought it was terrible and did not finish the book
Good read.  Not the quality of To Kill A Mockingbird.
Complex characterisation after To Kill a Mocking Bird
I went back and forth on whether or not to even read this book. The pre-publicity on it made me think I shouldn't read it, but I couldn't form my own opinion until I had read it myself. I really did not like this book and if this was the only book Harper Lee had ever written, no one would have ever heard of her. I felt like it needed to be edited. Disappointing after reading To Kill a Mockingbird
An interesting book- parts of the book were a little disjointed and a few of the characters were not developed enough. However I did not feel that Atticus was presented as a racist but as a man trying to work within the system. I felt the reviews I read were like Scout, jumping to conclusions without listening to his reasonings. Worth a read, especially if you were a fan of To Kill A Mockingbird.
I was very hopeful about this book but I can see why it was not published all those years ago. To Kill A Mockingbird will always be Harper Lee's gift to the world. This one, not so much of a gift. It is the story of Scout as a grown woman but I just didn't connect with the story line as I did with TKAM. I guess my expectations just were too high. Good read and I do recommend that people read it.
I really enjoyed this book. It was a different story with the same characters. I think that the people who are so disappointed that Adicus turns out to be a racist, totally missed the whole point of this book.  Even though I knew the book was written several decades ago, I found it interesting that the English was so antiquated.  Luckily I read it in my iPad and could look those words up easily.
This was preachy and without dramatic focus
This book should have never been published!
Don't read reviews.  Read the book instead.
I wish Harper Lee had not stopped writing after her first book was published.  I think she had a great gift that she did not use as she could have. Go Set a Watchman, in my opinion is a great book.  Maybe it only appeals to those who love literature about the south as I do but I enjoyed the book.  The characters were well developed and I am glad someone discovered it and that it was published.
This really should never have come out. It is a poorly written undeveloped disconnected item. I was afraid it would harm mockingbird, however no one is even talking about this book anymore. I can see why it was rewritten by lee and get editor years ago. The editor did an excellent job with it- I'm sure with lees approval
After re reading "To Kill A Mockingbird", I found this one slow moving in the beginning.  When things picked up, I cringed at the opinions that were so prevalent in the fifties and sixties, and indeed still exist in some places today.  A must read, even though I only can give it three stars .  If they had ten stars, I would give that to "To Kill A Mockingbird". What a writer!
I didn't think it possible, but I think I liked this book as well if not better than To Kill a Mockingbird.  It's an adult book about coming to terms with imposed, radical, social change, losing the idealism of youth and learning to forgive yourself and others amd loving  for what you really are.<br/>People who demean this book need to stand back and take another look at adult development.
Scout is too preachy for me  Not a polished product.
Somewhat of a let-down after all the publicity hype.
Excellent view of historical perspective and context
This book does not deserve a rating it was terrible!
Not all that great a story...more hype than anything
The last part/the last few chapters were disturbing.
Oh my! Harper Lee is a great writer! Love this book!
I definitely think this novel was written after To Kill a Mockingbird. Whether it was written by Harper Lee, I cannot say.<br/>The author seemed to lose sight of a plot.  I got the impression the intent of the author was to create a platform to<br/>state his or her views on racial inequality in the South in the 40s.
Wonderful to hear the voice of Harper Lee again!  Love getting more tidbits into the characters lives and read her first book, the prelude to To Kill a Mockingbird.  Some parts of the book were rambling on too much, but much of the story was quite funny and it was priceless to learn more about Scout and Atticus 20 years later.  Not near as good as Mockingbird, but so glad I read it anyway.
I received the download shortly after it was release and began reading it. Since then, I've only managed to read about 40 pages. It just hasn't gained my attention or drawn my interest. Perhaps, something interesting will happen shortly, but so far, it's an unremarkable read. I do enjoy many of Lee's visuals, but the story is meandering and lacks focus (at least through what I have read).
I loved how this story filled in some holes in Scout's teen years and dealt with her relationship with her father as an adult. She came into herself and it was fun to experience the process. I had to read "To Kill a Mockingbird" first, even though I had read it over 40 years ago in high school and I'm so glad I did!
I was disapointed in this book It should not be the top salleeI. It was not worth my time  I did not relate at all to scout  the story was weak at best  And I would not recommend this book  what a letdown over
I was very disappointed.  As To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books, perhaps my expectations were too high.  I really tried to get into this one.  I found it slow and quite boring.  I kept waiting for the plot......never DID figure out what it was.  I must admit that after struggling to read it, I put it away without even finishing it.  Never have I done that before!
It is a disappointing effort and I can see why so many think it should never have been published.  Some readers will be heartbroken as they see Atticus differently from how they imagined him.  That's not the most disappointing part; rather it's that the story doesn't hold together.  It's not TKAM, by any stretch...
Doesn't hold a candle to To Kill A Mockingbird.  Nice to check in on old friends, Atticus, Jean Louise, Aunt Alexandra, and reminisce about old times.  Sorry to see the changes in the people and the town, particularly Atticus and Jem.  Read it only if you have read TKAM.  Not nearly as well written.  Disappointing.
Not what I expected but certainly holds nice value. I recommend putting some time/space between reading "To Kill A Mocking Bird" and "Go Set A Watchman".  Otherwise, the first part of "Go Set" feels repeatative (where putting space seems like visiting an old friend).  Delightful book and excellent snapshot of the time period. Atticus and Scout, as great as ever.
Will not replace Mockingbird, in my opinion, but I very much enjoyed the read! I had no problem w/ Atticus' views. In that day, most of us felt the same though we wished them (known then as Negroes) no harm. We had been taught that "separate" was best for both races. No excuse but he was a man of the times. Which to me made his defense of the black man all the more impressive.
I felt the issue in the book was over blown and resolution of the main issue seemed contrite. Obviously, it would be nearly impossible to meet the expectations of To Kill a Mockingbird, but this novel was well below my expectations and it is equally obvious why the editor asked Harper Lee to go back twenty years.
I love the original.  This was just ok.  The loss of Jem immediately was a disappointment. The characters are completely different than the original.  I had a hard time seeing Scout as the original character in grown up form.  I expected to hear at least a few things about grown up Boo, who seems to be completely overlooked. The book did not have the excitement and flow of the first.
Been listening to the Kindle version all day at work. I have been very surprised and engrossed by it.  Although the fact of Atticus Finch surprised me, I believe it is more because of the fact that we might have Gregory Peck and Atticus FInch mixed into one person.  We must realize when the book takes place and when it was first written.  These feelings were a fact of life at that time, and you can see the next generation, in Jean Louise start the beginning of trying to change it.  There comes a moment in all lives when you finally see your parents for who they really are, and not the "superhero's" you have built them up to be (I know I Iearned at an early age).  The characters are more drawn out than they were in Mockingbird, and maybe just a bit more real.  The town has moved on since Mockingbird, and so have the characters.  Atticus is old, Jem is dead, but that doesn't take away from the feel of the book.  All the familiar characters are brought up and taken up to date.  Enjoying this book very much.
I enjoyed this book. It deals with important issues. Yes, we learn that Atticus is human. Life is complicated and messy, and Harper Lee gets that. While this book does not have as much plot line as To Kill a Mockingbird, I still read it in one day. I like Lee's writing style, and was very interested in the book.
Hate this book. Can't hardly make myself finish it!
Messy plot line, compared to to kill a mockingbird.
Disappointed! Definitely not To Kill A Mockingbird!
Not exactly what I was expecting but informative...
The writing style was like "To Kill a Mockingbird" and it was great fun to read about a 20 year old Scout.  It was also fun to meet the old characters again.  A  great part of the book is about the difference between the black and white populations and was very vivid and well done.. I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much had I not read "To Kill a Mockingbird."
I didn't expect to find this book to be the same as the author's famous book. I have not gotten far in it. It is less focused. With Mockingbird, it was like reading poetry. No extraneous word. This isn't as smooth, but I am enjoying it for what it is… an early novel by a writer that later nailed it. It is still very much a description of life of the era, or that time and background.
I do not think Go Set a Watchman was as well written as To Kill a Mocking Bird but it had merit.  I felt that Harper Lee was feeling her way with these characters and this first book was more like a first draft.  It is a shame that the two books couldn't have been published close together - To Kill.. followed by Go set... as one would have flowed into the other so much more clearly.
Mess of a book. Clearly not edited, or edited very poorly.  Flashback sequences are fantastic and in line with the genius that is "To Kill A Mockingbird".  The rest of the novel leaves something to be desired.  Clearly a forced a publication and evidence of what some people will do just to make a buck.
I have serious doubts if the authors of all the "reviews" I've heard and read about this book actually READ THE BOOK!  I heard and read that Atticus was a bigot.  Read the book, and then decide for yourself if he was really a bigot or attempting to get his daughter to stand on her own, decidope things for herself, and stop seeing him as a godlike figure.  I loved the book.
The writing is very good. Harper Lee does display her amazing talent in this book. The book does contain a shocking and disturbing scene. The ending left me feeling somewhat uncertain and that the issue addressed did not have closure. It is not as good as Harper Lee's other book, To Kill a Mockingbird. But if you are a true literary type like myself, you may find it a worthy read.
I dont know, I was hoping for a lot more, was disappointed.  I wont spoil it for anyone and give the plot away, but not at all what i expected from Ms. Lee. Luckily TKAM was so good I can forgive this one
Surprisingly good.  The first 3/4s is excellent. It is Harper Lee at her best.  Humor, nostalgia, and pathos fill the pages.  There are a few disappointments, but the reader must keep in mind that this was her first effort.  TKAM was the product of the the failure of this novel to be published.  Thank heaven.
poor value, poor read. commercial rewrite
Couldn't have been written by Harper Lee!
As others have stated here, this is disappointing in that it is so obviously an early draft of what eventually turned into a marvelous novel. To market it as a "sequel", or an addition to Lee's body of work, is deceptive at best, fraudulent at worst. It is poorly written; it can't  make up it's mind whether it is third person or first person, many of the conversations between Scout and Uncle Jack are incomprehensible, and the only reason we like or know anything  the characters is because we read To Kill A Mockingbird. Anyone reading this book who has not read TKAM would find themselves bored, and lost in the non-plot. The information we get in this book alone does not explain Scout's feelings; we know Atticus only because we read TKAM, and remember Atticus telling Scout that you can't get to know someone until you walk around in their shoes, or sitting in front of the jail all night to protect Tom Robinson, or making Jem read to Mrs DuBose to help her die free from her morphine addiction. In addition, this book is clearly set in the 50's, right after the Brown vs Board of Education decision; and wheras TKAM will be read for many years to come and not seem outdated, GSAW is already dated.<br/>  If the book had been marketed as strictly what it is, with maybe a forward explaining the historical context, I think it would be much better received.<br/>  My last comment: The whole book I kept wondering What does Jean Louise do in New York?  Does Atticus support her? Does she have a job? Sadly, we never knew!
This is not To Kill a Mockingbird.  This should be taken as a narrative of the time.  And pretty progressive for it's time of late 1950s.  You'll see some of the characters from Mockingbird and see the bones that were used to construct the final product we know so well.  This is a good book taken alone.  I did enjoy the surprise from Uncle Jack at the end.  Wasn't expecting that.
In both novels Attacus is deeply concerned to help individuals, including individuals of color, and he was to be fair and merciful.<br/>What this novel shows is the racist system in which he is embroiled and how difficult it is to see the problems in the system where you live.  Scout is able to see both her father and the system from the outside and it is a painful time for her.
Loved the follow up to "To Kill A Mockingbird" which I read again before reading "To Set a Watchman".  I didn't find it as riveting as "Mockingbird".<br/><br/>However, I am a product of the South (I'm near to Harper Lee's age) and while I witnessed many of the same things she wrote about, I am incapable of putting into words those experiences as she has.
This is a wonderfully honest depiction of how racism had a choke hold on whites and blacks in the south before the Civil Rights Act was enforced.  Instead of seeing Atticus as a racist, the author shows us that business people in small towns had to go along to get along.  It was clear to me that Atticus kept his enemies close.  He didn't join in their racist beliefs and actions.
I'm not sure what I expected but I certainly did not expect this.  I am really struggling to get through this book and am finding it very boring and no where near the caliber of To Kill a Mockingbird.  I've not read any other reviews and I very well could be the only person who dislikes the book.  All things considered, I'm sorry I wasted my money and wish I had never bought it.
In a word:  Complex  --  Read in 1 sitting.<br/><br/>Great read ~ Excellent insight of the southern mindset of the 50's or so.  Those who don't seem to like it or review it poorly have no idea what the country was like in the 50's or even 60's.  Its unfortunate that Harper Lee has only written 2 books ...
I was a little skeptical about this book after reading and hearing the reviews of others about Atticus being racist.  However, I was relieved after reading to discover that was really not the case.  My advice:  look at the big picture!  I did enjoy this book; in fact, I liked it so much that I could not stop reading it!  It is not as good as Mockingbird, but well worth reading.
I was very, very disappointed in this book.  Prior to ordering, I also bought "To Kill A Mockingbird" for my Kindle and re-read it as it had been a few years since reading it.<br/>There was so much repetition in Watchman that I was totally bored.  I feel I wasted my time and money in reading both.
The bottom line for me is that this book should have never been published.  It's a terrible disappointment for Harper Lee fans.  Where to begin?  Dialogue is forced and unnatural and dated.  Instead of a true plot, we're given sermons which are also dated.  I could barely finish the book and won't keep it.
Did not like it. Should have left it in the drawer
It's truly a good thing it wasn't published first.
It was more about Scout and her growing up and remembering all things that happened and her thoughts when she was younger.  Atticus' bigotry was mentioned but not the center of the book.  It seems the Uncle also had more to do with the book than Atticus.  I was disappointed in the book.  I expected more.
Did not think this was as great as "To Kill a Mockingbird," a classic.  Too political and disturbing for me.  Scout is a great character, but here also too deep to really love the book.  If one really feels bias towards others all their life, why would they change?  Scout is a true person while others disappoint her.  Would look forward to another book more up beat.
The book was very well written, as expected.  However, there is no possible way this is a perquil to "To Kill A Mockingbird". It had to have been written well after the first book.  I was happy it took on racial issues of the time, and this being the case, no wonder she waited until now to publish it.  I don't like the outcome of being satisfied with the status quo.
This story by Harper brings pretty much to closure.  I learned a lot from the insight clearly presented as all of the characters were exposed in depth.  A clear understanding of racism through the 50's on to today falls in place.  Wow!  What an ending.  Outstanding!  I felt I lived in that town as well.
Scout has defiantly become a strong women with her views, she thinks, conflicting with those of Atticus.  After her argument with her father on the rights of African Americans it was her Uncle Jack who made her see her father's point of view and she realized they were not so different after all.  I definitely recommend this to anyone, especially To Kill A Mockingbird fans.
No good ,bland, waste of time and money.
starts out much like mockingbird, reminiscing about her childhood. I really enjoyed the first third or so.  but  from about the end of the courthouse meeting on, it was very muddy. even considering when it was written. did not understand at all her uncle's or atticus' reasoning. the device she uses at the end to explain scout's understanding was very clunky. disappointed.
I can see why Harper Lee was sent back to the drawing board on this one...I tried to read it as if I hadn't read or seen To Kill a Mockingbird, to give it a chance.  This "rambled," and the vocabulary was a bit "stilted."  (Sent me to the dictionary several times!). I'm glad she started over!  I certainly like the characters better in revised book!!
It's a shame the estate decided to release this unfinished novel.  If Harper Lee had chosen to finish to I'm sure the theme would have been thought-provoking if disappointing to Atticus Finch fans.  As it is, it is an undeveloped story filled with characters who have not been fully fleshed out.
What a treat, fifty years after To Kill a Mockingbird to see Jean Louise "Scout" Finch as an adult, visiting Alabama from New York City.<br/>And it is timely that the same racial issues are presented from this perspective.<br/>We've come a long way, and we still have a long way to go.
Not as enjoyable as To Kill a Mockingbird but then, this book looks at life through Scouts "adult eyes" and her still unchanged tendency to "rush to judgement".  Go Set a Watchman is definitely a "part two" story and probably would not have been nearly as successful without its predecessor.  Overall, a good read with a rather abrupt ending.
I preordered this book so there no reviews.  After I started reading it the negative reviews started piling up.  I knew I was in trouble when I had to read the first chapter twice.  Just plain boring and disappointing after all the hype.
It's been A very long time  since to kill a mockingbird.I will read this new book again it made me laugh out loud so many times and could easily be about today. It was thought  provoking I can see why she did not publish sooner.I Remember growing up in a segregated world.Best seller I predict.
If you read Mockingbird and loved it, then you must read Watchman. Is it a great book? No. But you have to remember that it was Harper's first book and it was rejected and she was asked for a rewrite many times. The book as is would have bombed if it had been published then. There is basically no plot but it is beautifully written. Most of the characters in Mockingbird are mentioned. Remember that Watchman takes place about twenty years after Mockingbird. Times have changed, people have changed. The hoopla over Atticus being a racist are ridiculous. Maybe because I have lived in Montgomery, AL since 1955 I know what a real racist is. Atticus is mild compared to most. He is still an imposing character who loves his fellow man, he just doesn't want them living next to him. The whole story about how this manuscript was found and finally published will continue for some time because there are too many questions not answered.
In contrast to Lee's classic "To Kill a Mockingbird," I don't consider this work to be literature. Rather, it is a fascinating polemic on the topic of race relations as they existed in the US in the mid 1960's and earlier. I found the discussion of the issues historic and it provided excellent insight into the development of the issues through the years.
The story line was slow getting into....thoughts were fragmented and somewhat eccentric and difficult to follow.  I loved Jean Louise's character.  She was a strong, confident woman who loved her family and the Lord. The story was raw and a painful reminder of the growing pains of our country which continues to be plagued with prejudice and discrimination.......
Almost as if a different person wrote this book.
After reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" I decided to read this one. After the deep emotions stirred by "Mockingbird" I was a bit disappointed with "Watchman". Still, the story is both touching and revealing, bringing to light a way of life I'd never experienced. A "must read"? I don't think so. A pleasant and interesting read? Yes.
The value of a good editor is clearly demonstrated in this pleasant but uneven first book by Harper Lee.  Her brilliant mastery of dialogue is evident, and some of the young Scout episodes (playing baptism!) fairly jump off the page, but as a novel, the story needs more cohesion, pacing, and something more, the something that grips us in "Mockingbird."
The story started a bit slow. A quarter of the way it got interesting.  The end was a surprise.  What a disappointment Atticus turned out to be.  I felt like human nature hit me with a bat.  It was so sad about her brother Jem.  He was such a character in the first book.  Scout turned out to be true to herself  That creepy Hank is a disappointment and a coward.
This book received a lot of prerelease hype, understandably.  If you get lost in the flaws of Atticus Finch or the moral heroism of Scout, it can be tiresome.  I found the friction between holding onto the past and growing up and on to be fascinating and well written.  I think we all mourn for the lost simplicity of childhood and try to find joy in adult life.
I actually couldn't finish it and our in book club that read it (or tried to), several people couldn't finish it either.  To Kill a Mockingbird was excellent and from what I understand (may be rumor) she didn't want this one published but her family did it anyway.  Please don't let this novel keep you from reading To Kill a Mockingbird.  God Bless Harper Lee.
Frankly I wish I'd never read this book and left it a mystery. Harper Lee's TKAM was exceptional. Go set a watchman ruins the characters that we all adore and the political overtones are simply a bore. To kill a mockingbird is a great story. Go set a watchman is political rhetoric at best.
The dialogue is excellent which would easily transfer to a screenplay but the novel needs two more drafts.  It lacks description  and  should have been rewritten.  It is not the quality of a major American writer which Harper Lee is.  The dialogue of the Africian Americans is outstanding.  I personally have heard these comments and experienced this attitude.
The novel “To Kill A Mockingbird”, and its companion film, have become literature canon in the fabric of the United States.  It almost every school system across the land, that book will be read/taught at some point.  So, when a book is published bearing the name Harper Lee and contains such characters as Atticus Finch and Jean-Louis (“Scout”), it is indeed going to cause quite a commotion.  There are no two ways around it: this is an odd publication.  Once you get your brain wrapped around what it is trying to accomplish, however, you will likely get sucked into the narrative and have a pleasant experience.  You just have to “get past the hype” first.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, “Go Set A Watchman” tells the story of Jean-Louise, a woman in her twenties who happens to be travelling back to her small, dusty hometown of Maycomb, GA, a town in which all her precious childhood memories and ideals are kept.  Jean-Louise first reconnects with her aged yet incredibly respected father, Atticus, as well as Aunt Alexandra and an old flame, Henry, from her teenaged past.  Just as she begins to settle in for the visit, however, Jean-Louise happens to stumble upon a city council meeting that horrifies her in the way the members talk about “keeping the Negro down” and other racially charged topics.  Not only that, but Atticus is taking part in the meeting, a fact that she cannot reconcile with her past memories/experiences with him.  The rest of the book sees Jean-Louis, Henry, and Atticus working through those issues and coming to some kind of terms.<br/><br/>A little bit of editorial-ization before the “review process” begins: “Go Set A Watchman” is NOT a sequel to “To Kill A Mockingbird”, no matter how much HarperCollins might want you to believe that.  Though that publishing company has not (and will likely never) come out and officially admit this, “Watchman” is widely considered (among academic circles) to be a very early draft of a story from Harper Lee that just happened to feature many of the same characters as “Mockingbird”.  Whether “Watchman” turned into “Mockingbird” at some point in time or the process was much muddier, I cannot say.  But it IS NOT a direct sequel to that original 1960 work.<br/><br/>As such, “Watchman” is one of the most unique pieces of literature I have ever read, in the sense that 90% of the material could actually indeed be a true sequel.  It’s just that there are a number of scenes in this one that blatantly contradict some events in “Mockingbird” (like Jean-Louise’s memories of the Tom Robinson trial), and perhaps even some of Atticus’s behaviors (although that is a much trickier issue).  So, this book exists in sort of a nebulous “twilight zone” area in which it could be sequel (if stretching that definition a bit), but we know that it wasn’t meant to be.  A strange literature experience indeed.<br/><br/>Once I had that squared away in my mind, however, I was surprised by how much I actually become invested in the story.  It starts out slow and meandering, but as Jean-Louise does her tours of Maycomb and starts to re-connect with her past, it really does begin to tell its own story separate from “Mockingbird”.  Whereas that original was told from the unabashed perspective of childhood and featured an Atticus who championed human rights at all costs, this new piece is told from a rather cynical, adult perspective that paints Atticus as much more a product of his times.  Can those two approaches intertwine with each other?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  But if “Watchman” is just looked at purely on its own merits (tough as that is to be), it still comes out as an interesting piece.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the experience of reading “Go Set A Watchman” and would recommend it to any and all fans of “To Kill A Mockingbird”…again, as long as they understand it isn’t a sequel.  It’s more of a companion piece, filled with numerous ethical and moral points to think about in a mirror-opposite way that “Mockingbird” went about things.  In essence, what likely started as simply a money-grab for HarperCollins (and it worked…I believe setting the all-time preorder record for a book on Amazon) ended up turning into a remarkably interesting and thought-provoking novel in its own right.
A reader asked me to let everyone know what I thought about Go Set a Watchman. The reviews have been all over the place, a lot of them tinged by the fact Harper Lee is elderly, in assisted living, and possibly not 100 percent aware of her new notoriety. But I just want to look at the book, the writing, and its effect on me.<br/><br/>I. Loved. It.<br/><br/>I am a child of the deep South. Born in Mississippi. Reared in SC and MS. My parents are Southern. My mother grew up in rural Mississippi on a cotton farm. As a small child, I recall trying to keep up with the hands in the field picking my grandfather's cotton. I had a sweet aunt who could've fit in the book The Help who had a lovely lady who worked for her for decades. We won't get into the pros and cons of that.<br/><br/>I recall feeling like Jean Louise does in Go Set a Watchman. My generation was remarkably more modern than the previous, and I recall the differing schools of thought regarding race just as is in this book.<br/><br/>Harper Lee wrote this book realistically. I loved the political arguments. Loved the coffee clutch party. Loved the aunt's old-fashioned ways of corsets, dresses, and hats in public compared to Jean Louise's slacks and cigarettes. And I adored the ending. No, Atticus was not painted a racist, but should be considered more of a realist. To me, he was no different than in To Kill a Mockingbird. He was part of change, but recognized it as a difficult and complicated changing of the guard<br/><br/>Change is painful and is never handled with a clean break regardless of what people want. This book is so real about that change it stings. The prose is stunning, the concept deeply intelligent<br/><br/>Yes, I loved it all. It's earned a place on my top shelf of books, alongside Prince of Tides, The Stand, Lord of the Rings, The Paris Wife, and The Lewis Man. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. It's so refreshing to read something that doesn't fight so hard to be PC.<br/><br/> Now I'm going back to read To Kill a Mockingbird. I wish she'd written more. Lee speaks of a subject we're afraid to talk about without yelling and picking a fight.
I finished "Go Set a Watchman" last night, and I have a few thoughts. A caveat off the top - it's important to remember that Harper Lee wrote this book first, that when they found it, she was too old to edit it herself. I think remembering it is a first novel and not a second helps you get through the repeated info we normally wouldn't see in a second novel.<br/><br/>1. It's probably the most honest book written about this explosive time in our history which I have ever read. This is a no-holds-barred account of small town Alabama just before MLKJ showed up on the scene to turn the state on it's ear. It's ugly, but it's honest, and if you are going to understand a time period in history, you need to see ALL the sides of the story.<br/><br/>2. #1 means that there are parts in the book which are uncomfortable, and even unsafe from an author's perspective (in other words, you might lose readers because of people who post judgement because they did not read all the way to the last page).<br/><br/>3. Characters - Scout is still Scout in a bigger body. She has a lot of growing up to do, but she also has a big heart and it's in the general right place. Jem has passed, but we find that out in Chapter 1, so no real spoiler there. He is still a presence in this book as Scout flashes back to the past several times - all of which provide immense HUMOR to an otherwise very serious book. Atticus is quite different, so prepare yourself, and Aunt Alexandra is not as strong a presence, but still the same. Jem's friend Henry is Scout's love interest, if you can call it that, because this book is not really about a romance. Calpurnia is old but still kicking, and she has both a minor role in the book, but a major role in Scout's mindset.<br/><br/>4. What is it about? Firstly, it's a coming of age book, just like the first one. Scout learns what it means to truly be grown. Secondly, it is a book about relationships and how they make up a community, just like the first one. It's about LOVE, essentially, overcoming all obstacles and hanging on for the long haul. Finally, we learn more about this specific time in the 1950s deep south. We learn all the viewpoints, from all perspectives and most importantly, we learn that for the people who lived it, it was soul-wrenching. This isn't a history book. It's a drop-you-down-in-the-middle-of-history-and-see-if-you-survive book.<br/><br/>Blessings on your journey!
Go Set A Watchman, Harper Lee, author, Reese Witherspoon, narrator<br/>Atticus Finch, Jean Louise who was better known as Scout, and Henry (Hank), return in “Go Set A Watchman”. Although promoted as a sequel, it was actually written prior to “To Kill A Mockingbird”. Still, the story does begin several years in the future when Jean Louise, now an adult, returns home for her two week vacation. At 26, she now lives and works in New York City. Her old childhood friend and possibly even her sweetheart, Hank, now 30, is waiting to pick her up. Atticus, her father, has arthritis. He was not up to meeting her at the station as he usually did. In the years that have passed, Hank has gone to law school and entered the law practice of her father who has embraced him as a son.<br/>For the first part of the book, there is really little new to learn, about the goings on in Maycomb, apart from the passing of some family members and the presence, in her old home, of her spinster aunt Alexandra, who now lives with her father to help him manage. Just about half way through the book, however, when Jean Louise happens upon a meeting of the Citizen’s Council of Maycomb, the worm turns, and the story takes flight. Witnessing her father and her friend Hank participating in a meeting with the desire to restrict the rights of Negroes, she finds that she is horrified. What she later learns about her father’s participation in certain organizations completely unnerves her. Jean Louise had been completely devoted to her “perfect” dad and this news destroys her, inspiring a temper tantrum resembling that of a child. Jean Louise has never truly grown up or looked at the real world through her own eyes, but rather she identified completely with her father’s interpretation in all things, and now to discover that he was blind and indifferent to the very ideas that troubled her the most, she is ashamed beyond belief.<br/>Atticus is not only on the Council, but he is a board member. She also discovers he once even joined the Ku Klux Klan. He tells her that he joined to find out who lived behind the sheets so he would know who he was dealing with all the time. She did not believe that his reason was valid or truthful. She loses her temper with both her father and Hank and tries to distance herself from them. When Calpurnia’s nephew was arrested for the murder of a white man who wandered in front of his car completely inebriated, Hank does not want to defend him. Atticus insists that they defend him, but for all the wrong reasons, as far as Jean Louise is concerned. Calpurnia has worked for and been devoted to them for so many years, she believes that her father should give her nephew the best defense possible and not just defend him to prevent the NAACP from coming down and creating a scandal. If it wasn’t his fault, he should not be convicted, even if the town demands it because of the current environment. She decides that when he had defended Tom Robinson, many years before, he only did it because he believed in the letter of the law, not his right to equal justice under the law. Jean Louise understands the issues the community is facing but doesn’t look at them realistically, rather she is thinking idealistically, about solutions and not consequences. Still, she adamantly disagrees with her father, although she does agree with him that there are also white people who need as much help as the Negroes, and they should not be neglected in the effort to foster equality for all.<br/>The white community believes they have treated the Negroes fairly, maybe even better than fairly. They are angry and resentful because of what they believe are arrogant demands to have equal access to voting booths and driver’s licenses. Negative stereotypes and prejudices rise to the surface and shock Jean Louise, especially when these negative views are voiced by those she loves. Her aunt is a believer in class and does not even approve of Henry, who was not of a background she deemed respectable. At this point, one has to pause and wonder if Jean Louise was living under a rock some place, to be so unaware of the racial divide that existed in the country. Even in the northeast, there were racial problems. On the opposite pole, the Negroes and their organizations, of course, believed that it was the white people that were behaving arrogantly, and if the scales were viewed honestly, one would have to say that they were probably right. The scales of justice were most definitely weighted heavily in the favor of the white society because generation after generation, hate had continued to be inbred. Although things appeared much better between the races on the surface, underneath prejudice seethed. Perhaps it is much the same today.<br/>I believe that the author was either incredibly prescient or the book was updated and edited before publication, because, currently, even under the administration of the first black president, it seems the effort to get out the vote to make sure one or another political party wins, seems paramount, regardless of whether or not they can even legally vote or are actual citizens of this country. The legal qualifications of the voter no longer seem to matter, simply winning and pushing an agenda takes precedence. I thought this appeared to be the issue that motivated Atticus Finch against the equal rights movement, not racism. He believed the right to vote should not be taken lightly. He believed the voter should understand what, in fact, he was voting for or against. As we read the novel, we learn that “go set a watchman” possibly means to some, find your conscience and then act accordingly. Each person must do just that, when reading this book. Decide if Atticus was racist or a realist. Of course, if the issue is whether or not a black person can vote, then there can be only one conclusion. Every legal citizen of the country has and should have always had the right to vote, regardless of color or creed. If, however, it is based on whether or not you believe a voter should be aware of what he/she is voting for, you may come to an altogether different conclusion, but it should not be based on race. Keep an open mind while reading and determine if Finch is a racist or a realist. He lived in a different time and in a different place than we are now, but his thoughts may have foreshadowed future problems.<br/>The book has caused quite a stir in the publishing world, which is largely progressive and/or liberal in their beliefs, and therefore tends to respond in the manner of the “politically correct”. Almost in a knee jerk reaction, many reviewers have decided that Atticus Finch, the hero of “To Kill A Mockingbird”, has clay feet and they are outraged. The former perfect human being is actually just a human being with personal opinions and feelings. However he had behaved before, regarding matters of race, has been erased, and he is now painted with the broad brush of his daughter, Jean Louise, who is furious with him. Although he claims to be doing what he has to do to survive in Maycomb, and he believes that he is trying to also discover who is the enemy and who is not, since he believes he needs to figure out who will work with him within the system to bring about change that is doable, rather than idealistic, headed for success rather than doomed to failure, he is just being judged on the basis of this one moment in time and on his feelings about the letter of the law and the right of anyone to vote who is neither educated nor prepared for what he considers a great privilege.<br/>I wondered if perhaps there was another side to Atticus that we had not met, the Atticus that wanted to make sure that the Negroes would be provided with a better education to prepare them for the vote. Perhaps he didn’t, but that idea would have to be better developed in another book, because I don’t think they were developed well enough in this one. The main issue appeared to be Jean Louise’s decidedly immature reaction to his being on the board of what she considered to be a racist council, committed to limiting the rights of the Negroes in Maycomb. I thought the issue would come down to the problem of discrimination, but that issue seemed to drift to the background, for me, as her fury took the center stage.<br/>The writing style of the book is pretty much the same as in “To Kill A Mockingbird”. It is straight forward and easy to read. There are, therefore, no mysteries to decipher in the narrative.
I struggled for a few days with the question of how to begin this review of Harper Lee’s Go Set A Watchman. I wondered whether I should write about the revelation that Atticus Finch is a racist? Or that in this book a grown-up Scout is referred to as Jean Louise? Or that Go Set A Watchman utilizes a third-person narrator, as opposed to To Kill A Mockingbird, which is narrated by Scout? I considered comparing it to the remarkable, soulful To Kill A Mockingbird.<br/><br/>The first thought that popped into my head again and again is just how good this book is. Notice that I did not say great, but considering how this was Harper Lee’s first literary effort and assuming it is the actual manuscript that her agent forwarded to Lippincott way back in 1957, it is a respectable first novel. Even though the writing is smooth, elegant, and incisive, it does contain flaws. It does not appear to have been professionally edited, which makes sense since the editor to whom the manuscript had been assigned instructed the young author to rewrite and revise and rewrite and revise, which Lee did over the course of the next two and a half years, eventually submitting for publication a completely different story that she had renamed To Kill A Mockingbird. That lack of editing is probably why there are a few instances of the unclear use of pronouns, which is a trivial problem. Then there is the situation in chapter 15 in which “Mr. Tuffett,” the principal of the high school, morphs into “Miss Muffett.” After I reread those three or four errant sentences a couple of times it became clear that Harper Lee was not referring to a different character and that he (in that pre-Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner era) had not transformed into she. As someone who enjoys writing but finds editing his own work to be endless drudgery, I understand how that kind of error can happen. Even after my third or fourth read-through of a manuscript I come across typos, usage errors, and inconsistencies. However, the new publisher, Harper, should have assigned an editor to ferret out and eliminate those kinds of mistakes. It would also have been sensible to have made one change in the story: the narrator in Go Set A Watchman explains that Tom Robinson had been acquitted of the charge of rape 20 years before, which contradicts what happens in To Kill A Mockingbird, in which he is found guilty and murdered shortly after his trial.<br/><br/>While Go Set A Watchman is inextricably connected to To Kill A Mockingbird, it should be judged on the basis of its own merits, as if we had never heard of Harper Lee. The story is compelling and the characters are vividly depicted. Jean Louise Finch is bright, chippy, and filled with iron-clad social convictions as she remembers her childhood and retraces her steps in her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama. Acting as an amateur anthropologist, as she begins to see—for the first time—what she considers the ugly underside of Maycomb—and of her father and of Henry (Hank) Clinton, who wants to marry her—she is thrown for a loop. Why had she never known that her father, who she has grown up idolizing as a perfect human being, holds the same kinds of racial prejudices and stereotypes as just about all of the other white people who live in her rural hamlet? To be fair and accurate, Atticus Finch is not a hate-filled abuser of black people; neither does he ever use racial epithets to refer to those who live on the other side of the strict color line that is so integral to life in his hometown and the rest of the Deep South during the time period of the book, the 1950s. Nonetheless, Jean Louise, who literally cannot stomach what she has learned about her father, loses the contents of her stomach as she tries to figure out who he really is and the nature of her relationship to him.<br/><br/>That is the crux of the story. Who is Atticus? Who is Jean Louise? Where does she belong and where will she spend the rest of her life? In that sense, it is an old story, one that we have read before. That and Jean Louise’s gradual recognition of the wide racial divide in Maycomb would have made for a noteworthy novel in 1957, when Harper Lee submitted her manuscript to Lippincott; that is especially true in light of her background as a woman who had been born and bred in Monroeville, Alabama. In fact, that is part of what made To Kill A Mockingbird such a raging, revolutionary success.<br/><br/>In the end, Go Set A Watchman is an appealing story, but if it were not for the fact that Harper Lee is a towering figure in American letters and if not for the fact that this book is being viewed as the lost and found Holy Grail of American literature, it probably would not be in print today.<br/>That is not to say that it is not a worthwhile read. It is, but it is no Mockingbird.
Well, I've read Go Set a Watchman, and I see what all the angst is about.<br/><br/>The novel is in its first half sweet without being cloying--Jean Louise Finch, 26 years old, living in New York, makes her fifth annual return to Maycomb to see her ailing father Atticus. He's icing from severe rheumatoid arthritis, and some days he's in such pain, he needs his sister (Aunt Alexandra, as starchy as in To Kill a Mockingbird, has, rather surprisingly, spared Jean Louise moving back home by moving in herself with Atticus) to help him dress. His brother, Dr. Jack, has fashioned specially large-handles utensils to help Atticus eat.<br/><br/>Jem has been dead for two years.<br/><br/>It's the characters you know, for the most part--we get a visit from Dill in a flashback, even--and they're mostly the same.<br/><br/>Certainly in that sunlit first half, with flashbacks to Scout and Jem and Dill playing together, Uncle Jack being amusing, and Atticus facing disability and mortality pretty much as you'd expect him to.<br/><br/>--And then Harper Lee shatters the cozy little world of Maycomb. Jean Louise stumbles on a racist pamphlet among her father's books and papers, and blames Aunt Alexandra for it. Aunt Alexandra holds her tongue, but is innocent. Jean Louise follows her father to an unusual gathering in the courthouse--the same place where he heroically defended Tom Robinson--and finds that he's a leader of the Maycomb Citizen's Council.<br/><br/>It hits Scout hard, and the reader, too. Lee has done such a grand job of evoking the Atticus that lives in our hearts (extraordinary, really, because Go Set a Watchman was written before Mockingbird) that we are hit as hard as Scout.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the book for you; the first half has all the magic of the innocent comic scenes in Mockingbird, and yet virtually no overlap. The Robinson trial is portrayed in a quick two pages, and is less heroic, and less tragic than in the first-published book.<br/><br/>The "back 9" of the book depicts Jean Louise's reaction, her anger and sense of betrayal. She finds an unlikely ally, has a wrenching confrontation with her father, and one with her uncle.<br/><br/>Scout dies, but Jean Louise lives.<br/><br/>Any more, and I'll end up spoiling the book.<br/><br/>But let me say, if Mockingbird is important to you, read this book.<br/><br/>Harper Lee is saying something important about racism (oh, Calpurnia!), about growing up, about fathers and daughters--and about human frailty.<br/><br/>It is an extraordinary achievement, even though you can see the seams, as the editorial process led to the abandonment of Watchman and the creation of Mockingbird--one critical scene is too talky, though most of the talk is good talk. Most of it.<br/><br/>Atticus is not, at the end of the book, a hero. He's a man. Flawed, loving, wrong-headed, passionately just-- a mass of contradictions.<br/><br/>Like many of us.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of my favorite passage from C.P. Snow, with his protagonist, Lewis Eliot, engaged in a debate with a young Nazi official in 1938:<br/><br/>***<br/>"No one is fit to be trusted with power," I said..."No one. I should not like to see any group of men in charge--not me or my friends or anyone else. Any man who has lived at all knows the follies and wickedness he's capable of. If he does not know it, he is not fit to govern others. And if he does know it, he knows also that neither he nor any man ought to be allowed to decide a single human fate, I am not speaking of you specially, you understand; I should say exactly the same of myself."<br/><br/>Our eyes met. I was certain, as one can be certain in a duel across the table, that for the first time he took me seriously.<br/><br/>"You do not think highly of men, Mr. Eliot."<br/><br/>"I am one."<br/><br/>***<br/>Atticus, in either novel, would, I think, understand and approve.
Isn't this great? How often does a really juicy literary controversy come along to distract everyone? It's been a long time since my single reading of To Kill a Mockingbird, or even of my single viewing of the movie. But if I want to join the conversation, I have to read the book, don't I? (Not really -- see Pierre Bayard's <br/>.)<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is a short book, so it didn't take long to whip through it. A few thoughts:<br/><br/>Jean Louise Finch (Scout) is devastated to learn that her father Atticus is a racist. Her reaction though, seems overwrought. She becomes physically ill, can barely function for several days. Disappointment seems an understandable reaction, but becoming violently ill strains belief.<br/><br/>While Jean Louise comes to accept that her father is not the man on the pedestal she thought he was, she seems to have replaced him on that pedestal with Jem, her brother.<br/><br/>Jean Louise seems impossibly naive at times. When she visits Calpurnia, her former mother figure holds her at arm's length, and she can't see that while Calpurnia could afford to love the children, she holds all the adults responsible for the unfair treatment black townspeople receive -- including the now adult Jean Louise.<br/><br/>Wile Jean Louise gives full credit to both Calpurnia and Atticus for her fine upbringing, it seems to not occur to her that Calpurnia had children of her own that she had to leave to someone else to look after while she saw to the Finch family. When those children grew up to be less admirable than the Finches, no one mentions the obvious reason.<br/><br/>Jean Louise actually refers to herself as color blind, in the sense that she doesn't see black and white. Really. Her uncle also notes her color blindness. This isn't the character being naive, it's the author.<br/><br/>Short book, not a bad read, possibly ahead of its time sixty years ago, hopelessly dated and naive now.
I have just finished GSAW.  I had read a few reviews rating this book from the worst to the same level of its sister, Mockingbird.  I first read TKAM when I was 12.  I grew up and still reside a few hours north of Monroeville, AL, Ms. Lee's home town.  I have reread TKAM for course work, when it was required reading for my kid's classes and for pleasure.  I say this because I knew I would have a strong reaction to GSAW because the first book was so important to me.  I rated this book with 4 stars.  I could not give it 5 because I feel it is really not in the final polished form that would have existed, if the editor had seen this book as the story that needed to be told.  The editor saw the brilliance in the scenes of Scout, Jem and Dill and that was the story that we needed from Ms. Lee at the time.  The flashbacks that remain in GSAW are still some of the most enjoyable moments.  I laughed out loud at the kids playing revival and the school dance with Jean Louise's falsies.  The heart of the book is about another step in the maturity of Jean Louise.  We see ourselves as separate individuals from our parents and we wonder how we got there.  They usually helped us get there, we become whatever person we are due to them, at least in some part.  In her case she still believes that her father is still the perfect human being that molded her into the color blind woman that she has become, yet he is not a perfect human being.  No human being is perfect.  When we put all of our faith in an imperfect human we are always disappointed.  Jean Louise is knocked to her knees.<br/><br/>The book reads like a preliminary draft.  Some scenes detract from the main topic.  Some scenes seem rushed to a conclusion, especially the end.<br/>Overall I feel greatly rewarded by having the opportunity to read this book.  I have no doubt that Harper Lee wrote this book.  It is exactly the book that a young writer from Alabama living in New York trying to make sense of the changing social climate in the South would write.  Without this book there would have been no To Kill A Mockingbird.  That would have been a tragedy.  This book will hopefully bring out the theme of discussing our disagreements with those whom we disagree.  It is satisfying to see we have moved forward in our discussion on racial topics - oh I guess we haven't.  Perhaps we need this book now just like we needed To Kill A Mockingbird when it was published.
** spoiler alert **  **spoiler alert**<br/>THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br/><br/>First off, REVIEWERS, PLEASE INCLUDE A SPOILER ALERT! Geez.<br/><br/>Secondly, this book was written before TKAM, so to say that Atticus Finch "changed" is incorrect. If you read what is actually said in this book, it is clear that in TKAM Atticus vigorously defended Tom Robinson because he knew Tom was innocent and was unlikely to get a fair trial in Maycomb. For Atticus, it was a matter of upholding the law and advocating for justice. Had GSAW been released first, we would have known how Atticus felt about the so-called "races," but nevertheless mounting that stellar defense for his client in the second book. Atticus Finch did not change. Our *perception* of him changed because of the order in which the books were released. To give GSAW a one-star rating because we didn't like finding out that Atticus was a racist all along is in itself an injustice, imo. Can we not instead be thrilled that his daughter despised racism? That she told him straight up what she thought about his unexpected racism, that it made her physically ill, that it scarred her soul because her "tin god" was not who she thought he was? AND that Atticus welcomed her ability to stand up to him, to all racists, as she saw fit because it meant that his daughter finally saw him as human, not god-like, that she had opinions separate from his, and it was good for both of them to acknowledge that?<br/><br/>GSAW is, of course, beautifully written. Getting to read new material in Ms. Harper Lee's literary Voice was my chief joy. I know I'll read it again just to savor her extraordinary talent. I'm not giving this five stars because I thought the "come-to-realize" passages between Scout, Dr. Finch, and Atticus were tedious. Other than that, it truly was a joy to read. Highly recommended.
*Spoilers Ahead!*<br/>I vacillated between 4 and 5 stars on this read--It's a clear 5-stars for the quality of writing; 4-stars for my enjoyment of the book. The scenes of Jem, Dill, and Scout as children are worth the read alone. I was left heartbroken by the narrator's casual mentioning of<br/>*LAST WARNING FOR SPOILERS*<br/>Jem's death. It caught me completely off guard, and I teared up immediately. As the novel continued, I made peace with it, and was struck by the poetry in how he died of the same weak heart that claimed their mother.<br/>The major scandal is, of course, "Racist Atticus." Earlier this week, I caught wind of this twist on the news, so I was expecting it. Had it been a surprise, who knows how I could have reacted, but throwing the book across the room tops the list of possibilities. Given the buzz, I was certain Atticus was a Klan member, and it's not that bad, if one can grade bigoted assemblies (which is its own discussion). I did not agree with everything Atticus said, but neither did I agree with everything Scout said. Go Set A Watchman reminded me very much of Uncle Tom's Cabin in that, in its time, it was revolutionary, but now much later is cringe-worthy in some of its stereotypical treatment of the black and African American populations. In 1950/1960, Watchman would have been perfectly progressive. Now, not so much (although, one can't help but make comparisons between the subject matter of this novel and our current Civil Rights struggles with the LGBTQ community). One of Lee's points, if I may boldly presume, is that there is a big difference between advocating for someone's rights when they doff their hats and thank you for being so big-hearted while politely refusing the advantages you benevolently offer them and what happens when that people group starts boldly demanding the rights that should have been theirs all along. This gap is where Atticus and Jean Louise find themselves, and they address it in divergent ways.<br/>Now, there were some continuity errors between TKAM and Watchman due to the no-editorial-process stipulation.  Tom Robinson, though unnamed, was acquitted in Watchman; the Cunninghams were respectable; Helen was married to Zeebo; etc. All of these allowed me to safely compartmentalize TKAM and Watchman as related books, but of different mythologies, kind of like comics series. The Amazing Spiderman is similar to Spiderman, but there are noted differences, and the reader can appreciate the installments individually without compromising the love of one over the other. I'll confess, I greatly prefer my "Amazing Atticus" over Watchman's Atticus, and by thinking of the books this way, I am able to have him still.
I'm afraid that this publication was a huge mistake as it tarnishes the brilliance of To Kill A Mockingbird. Whereas To Kill A Mockingbird has transcended generations and continues to beckon all of us to a higher calling, Go Set A Watchman is a "Giant Step" Backward for Mankind.
Our family has lived this story as Southerners, our parents, our: selves and our children. The publisher did us all a great favor by letting us see ourselves first as children and then as overwhelmed adults.  Harper Lee truly sets a watchmen and a trumpet for our society!<br/> Ray King
I enjoyed Go Set a Watchman. I wasn't expecting To Kill a Mockingbird, so I wasn't disappointed; but I think some of the negative reviews are overreactions. I found it read easily and held my interest. Some of the phrasing was cliche, but it was written several decades ago. I found the disillusionment Jean Louise experienced somewhat familiar and believably expressed. The responses to her criticisms of the behavior of her friends and relatives were believable and probably reflected the beliefs of many people at that time, but ultimately they are unconvincing for the same reasons we see through racist propaganda today (or at least some of us do.)<br/><br/>I was disturbed by Uncle Jack's striking Jean Louise, but I suppose that was not unheard of in its time. Even more disturbing to me was how Jean Louise seemed to acquiesce to the inadequate explanations provided when she questioned Atticus, Uncle Jack and Hank. I've struggled myself with how to reconcile the inevitable personal flaws in my loved ones with the love and respect I feel for them. No one is perfect, so we must accept some flaws while drawing the line in other cases. Where do we draw the line? Which flawed human beings "deserve" our love and respect and when do the flaws cross a line so that the person becomes unbearable?<br/><br/>The novel responds that we must be responsible for making that decision ourselves, we must set ourselves as the watchman. But I thought Jean Louise should have set higher standards. Maybe it wouldn't have been wise to run back to New York, but she came around awfully quickly in response to some pretty weak arguments. That's not a criticism of the book itself, or the writing - but perhaps Jean Louise has her own flaws.
Interesting how - though written in the 1950s - the element of racism remains.  Though there are changes, it was interesting to see how Scout's perception of how things were was so different 20 years later and very emotionally telling re:  how she learns about herself in the process.  I hope they find yet another book to see how things ended up long-term.
Disappointed in this book after her first one.,
An "important" read. Really enjoyed it.
Slowest, most uninteresting book I ever read!!!
Quite a great book! What if it had been published first? It wouldn't had a chance. There would have been too much controversy! The publisher had a lot of forethought at that time for this novel to be published first! He knew what he was doing! To Kill a Mockingbird was the first one to be published and rightly so! I enjoyed both books at their own times!
In this day of prequels and sequels, I wish Harper Lee were still alive to give me more Scout - at any age. Go Set a Watchman so clearly paints the turmoil of the time, but I felt like I needed to know Scout and Atticus so much better before reaching the heights of this novel. I am in awe of the editor who knew To Kill a Mockingbird needed to come first.
Revisiting Scout as an adult and seeing how she comes to grips with her past and future is the point of this book. After all of the media noise, I was worried I would be disappointed in previously loved characters. I was not. This book was well worth the wait and not a disappointment.
It was always going to be a big ask to compete with Mocking bird.  It has a slow start and if you haven't read Mocking bird it is a thin on character .  In spite of the reviews I don't think Atticus was a racist in the end. When this book was written segregation was still dominant and I'm sure he would have been thought of as a liberal in his community
Though the quality and clarity of the writing does not match To Kill a Mocking Bird and their are some pedantic parts that drag, many of the themes explored are interesting and insightful into the complexity of familial relationships.  It is also fascinating to revisit the earlier published work in light of the characterizations set forth in this one.
I was extremely disappointed with this story. I was expecting the same quality and great story as "To Kill a Mockingbird". I am SO glad this was not published first! At least my curiosity was quenched and I would just tell others who might want to read it that for me I was happy to get through it and not lose any of my love of the first book.
The part about trying to justify prejudice (near the end of the book)  and even the classifying of people (trash) got to me.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" was so special it grieves me to think that Atticus was a racist.  Even if it is just a book, which I wish I had not read.
This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  I felt I was reading something a high school student might have written.  I soldiered on hoping it would improve, but no such luck.  What a waste of time.
Loved it very much
I didn't enjoy reading this book.
After reading all the reviews about Atticus being a racist, I decided I had to find out for myself. The book raised a universal theme about youth putting a parent or other adult on a pedestal & then growing up to find out that they are not perfect, just human.  I gave the book two stars because I felt it was poorly written. The story didn't flow well either to me. Overall it read like a quick, first draft.
"To Kill a Mockingbird" is my favorite book of all time.  I don't believe Harper Lee wrote this book, "Go Set a Watchman"  I bought the book believing she wrote it and re-read "To Kill  A Mockingbird " in anticipation of the release of a new Harper Lee book.  It is obviously written in current time with much stilted writing.
It was clear to me why Lee's editor pushed her to extract Mockingbird from this story back when it was published. Watchman, in my opinion, tries to hard to teach a lesson instead of telling a story. As such, the narrative suffers, and is at times confusing and poorly constructed.
Can't believe they were the same characters!!!
Found confusing and boring.  Did not finish it
Did not meet my expectations.  Not that great.
A boring book about race relations in the 50's
This novel was a big disappointment after To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>I can see why publishers rejected it when Harper Lee submitted it. Thank goodness they were willing to take another look at "Mockingbird," or we would have been deprived of a real gem. Thank goodness, also, that Harper Lee had the courage to write more, and submit more.
Nothing like the first book. Scout was portrayed as a whiny spoiled brat. It seem like most of the book she was ranting about something and was insensitive of peoples feelings. I actually had a hard time finishing this book. It did not hold my attention.  Only finished it because I thought something special what happened at the end but it didn't.
This was a disturbing read for me. As an author of color, it is demeaning to see the n word an other untruths written about a race. I often wonder how the other side would feel if I began to speak on lice and the wet dog smell that penetrates sheets of white when it rains. Until we can view others as human,  no race will matter. #blacklivesmatter
It was obviously a first novel.  I thought it quite immature while reading but I always stick with a book.  As I got deeper into the book it seemed to grab my attention.  There were quite a few of those last pages I copied as it showed the beginnings of her insight into the societal aspects of the time.  Many of her thoughts I can apply to today.
I liked the book because of who wrote it.  The turn of a phrase, the vocabulary and the fact that I'm older, from the south and have seen just about all that she writes about made the story relative to me.  I do not think it is to the standard of her other novel nor would I recommend it to anyone of a much younger generation.  He wouldn't get it.
The folksy charm remains, but this should have been printed 30 years ago. The characters are still stuck mid-century. The issue(s) could and would have been germane even up to the 90's, but it is far beyond those days and we are living in a world that hasn't grown any less complex. So, it was a sweet trip down memory lane, but fairly irrelevant.
oh my I really loved this book it was such a great story .I laughed so hard at parts .I wish she wrote more love harper lee .everyone who read to kill a mockingbird needs to read this fit so well together Im so glad I got both books so I could read them back to back.SOOO good.
Destined to be a classic and it is obvious from the content why it stayed in a safety deposit box for 4 decades. It is powerfully written, gritty, honest, offensive (by today's standards) funny, eccentric and there is no doubt that Harper Lee penned this sequel to Mockingbird.
By reading this book it's easy to see why the editors wanted Harper Lee to go back and re-write the book, focusing on Jean Louise's childhood. It provided the only humor in the book. Reading this, you can see how Atticus is transformed from the "Southerner" of his time, to the near mythological character we've all come to know and love.
This is not the book I expected.  Its writing is solid, but its tone is very different from Mockingbird.  It is much more about a father/daughter relationship and coming of age than racism.  Its definitely worth reading.
Seems Go Set a Watchman- the author's first novel attempt- may have been more focused on 'solving' a social situation rather bluntly instead of subtly through entertaining the reader.  At any rate- purchasing and reading Go Set a Watchman is justified if for no other reason as a tribute to Harper Lee for her second- much more enjoyable effort.
I am a writer, so when I started reading this I thought it read just like the kind of writing that many writers assemble when they are exploring ideas, before a novel takes shape. I think it has value as an illustration of the writing process but it appears that Harper Lee did not actually want it to be published as if it was a finished work.
I have not read To Kill a Mockingbird for awhile but this novel which Harper Lee wrote prior to I found to be really fun reading. I know it has had some controversy behind it but I have to love it for I was brought right into the character's easily. I recommend reading it!!
As hard as it is to take, that's how it was. To some extent it still is.  We have come a long way as a society since those days,but this book puts in perspective how much farther we have to go. Taking the story out of it, One is still overwhelmed by the beauty of the prose.
Grab your dictionary and southern-style verbiage knowledge because you'll need it for about every page. If you're the type of person that has to know and understand each word, this isn't the book for you. I was excited to read Harper Lee's new found novel, but I have to admit that I was rather disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype.
If you want to understand the american mentality about race and justice you have to read Harper Lee's books. I was very young when I read To Kill a Mockingbird. Go Set a Watchman gives me a better understanding of how difficult it's been for Americans to blend in as a country, as a culture and as the melting pot that has never really melted.
A realistic point of view of southern living.
Now I know why she never wanted to publish it
read like a draft that needed lots of editing
could not get into it; rambling without point
I was disappointed.  Plan to re-read it again
Too much time spent on one character---Scout.
I loved this book because it reminds us that, no matter how revered and perfect a person is, we all have feet of clay.  It's harmful to us--and the person we put on a pedestal--because that person is never allowed to be himself/herself.<br/><br/>An important part of Scout's growing up and maturation is doing this and still loving Atticus.
I knew about all the controversy surrounding this book and definitely read it as another book by Harper Lee. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird. Go Set a Watchman for me was more about issues and the relationship between Scout and Atticus as adults and separated my feelings between both books. Two totally different books and I read them as such.
Go Set A Watchman is not a disappointment because of the more realistic view of Atticus. It is a disappointment due to the prose style. The characters do not develop through dialogue and action. Any point made is preachy and long-winded. None of the main characters come across as likable which is the exact opposite of To Kill a Mockingbird.
Interesting. Not as full or satisfying as "Mockingbird."  Almost like a short prelude to M. Despite Scout's original shock about her family's position  r/t the blacks at that time, long ingrained, I felt like the book did her no justice by not developing how she squashed her feelings and assumedly accepted their explanation of same.
Disappointing story... a rehash of something we all read many, many years ago...only the storyteller is 20 years older...amd not wiser. It is a perfect example of 'marketing' something not as good and a story which was a treasure a long time ago...and this story is empty.
The best attitude that you can adopt before reading this book is to eliminate all your expectations that arise from TKAM. While the characters are borrowed from the latter universe, the lesson that this book attempts to impart are starkly different. Read the book with level emotions and you will be able to appreciate it for its full worth.
This was so bad it wasn't funny. You could tell it had not been edited. I will not let this phase me though. To Kill A Mockingbird will still be one of the best books ever.
I hesitated to read book at first, because I thought it would be poorly written, but I was wrong.  This book is completely different from To Kill a Mockingbird.  It truly shows the power of editing.  I came away with two things:  I am glad I read it, and I am glad the editor didn't like it, because we might not have gotten the end result.
The thoughts on racism are interesting, though sadly unconvincing.  Novel sorely in need of editing...at one point a character's name and sex changed over the course of two pages, without benefit of legal or medical assistance.  And most of this book is exposition, contrasted with the wonderful narration of TKAM.  I wish I hadn't read it.
I liked the book and can't understand why some of the news reporters were saying Aticus' image would change for the people.<br/>To Kill a Mocking Bird is one of the best books written and this one fits right in with the times. In the long run I don't think it tarnished Atticus' image. I wish Ms Lee had another book hidden away somewhere.
Loved the first book!! This one's okay it seems as if the excitement of having this book released was more important than its editing. Read this whole book in under a day. Go set a watchmen chapters are much like the first chapter of to kill a mocking bird. A lot of rambling with no support but still a good read into the view of the era.
....if the author's name wasn't Harper Lee.<br/><br/>This was our book club choice for October.  It read more like a manuscript in progress, not a finished work.<br/>The only interesting point I gained was to see the writer's progression through the creative process as Ms. Lee fully developed the characters in To Kill a Mockingbird.
I decided to re-read To Kill A Mockingbird to refresh my memory. Then to my surprise I learned of the release of this book and could not wait to get it for my Kndle. I enjoyed it so much it left me wanting  more of her. I hope she will consider writing more. Her books took me right back to my childhood.<br/>Thank you, Harper Lee!!!!..
I disliked that Harper Lee didn't allow the book to be edited. In my opinion it would have made it easier to read. This book has lessons for us all. I loved the way it made me think about the people in my life I have judged harshly and reevaluate. It's worth the read.
disappointing with all the hype it's gotten - # 2-3 on NYT Best Seller list - unjustified.  Everyone bought it because Harper Lee's masterpiece was "To Kill a Mockingbird" and this was written before it, never published.  Think someone wants to capitalize on her name and the $$$ that book makes.  Could have used a GOOD Editor!
Not sure why I thought this was to be a pre-quel, but just as pleased to find a sequel, and it makes me wonder how it would've been received had it been released when she actually wrote it. As I read it, I realized I was hearing the voiceover from the movie in my head-a thoroughly enjoyable read; 4 stars because it wasn't long enough.
I guess I was a little disappointed in this sequel.  As an author myself I know a bad review can be hurtful, but I was disappointed at how angry and unforgiving Scout had become and there seemed to be no closure at the end; it was left hanging as if another book might follow to set things straight and I don't know how that can happen.
I have little to add to reviews from more accomplished and experienced reviewers. "Go Set a Watchman" is less challenging and more pedantic than its prequel. The novel has entertaining and vivid moments but, in general, I felt disappointed to read rather than imagine what motivated Scout, Atticus and other characters.
A mostly boring story with flashes of insight. I think her publisher was right when he advised that she write a different story which focused on Scout and her brother, Jem, when they were younger. That was "To Kill a Mockingbird" and was the masterpiece which made her famous. This one, alone, would not have done that.
This book worked only when Harper Lee was writing flashbacks of Scout when she was younger.  Too bad that the aging writer was talked into publishing this old version of  her magnificent To Kill a Mockingbird.  Greed probably the motivation of the publisher.
My beloved author tried to hard. Good story but I was disappointed. I felt as if she was trying to impress me with her ethereal-ness. I found that one aspect was unnecessary and disruptive to the story. I much prefer Lee's old style of story-telling where there was nothing to prove yet left the reader hanging on every word.
It is amazing that Watchman was written before Mockingbird! Now really is a better time in America for this book than the 1960's would have been. It is a book about how Scout goes from worshipping her father and the southern town she grew up in, to seeing them in a realistic way. Her disillusionment is painful and profound.
I was bored after the first third of the book but keep reading in hopes it would pick up.  It could have been written as a story in a women's magagzine and deleivered the same message.  I don't know the story behind why the book was not presented earlier but maybe Ms. Lee thought twice before presenting it for publication.
I grew up during the time period of this book, yet the content was a bit hard to read.  We have come a long way from the bigotry of that era.  And we still have a long way to go. I enjoyed hearing Scout's voice again... she is refreshing, smart and clearly struggling with the small town values she now begins to understand.
In many ways I would call this a 5 star novel because Harper Lee is able to create place, time,  and characters with a fine description. But I would mark in a "3" because she lost me in the last 2/3 of the novel.  The writhing and moaning of coming to terms with the racial struggles of the family was just overdone.
To Kill a Mockingbird has been very close to my heart for 35 yrs since I read & reread it over yrs.The sequel is nowhere near it.Major mistake of the writer is to kill Jim ,who was very dear major character in the First Novel.I feel it was a mistake to read the sequel.It was very disillusioning,nowhere near the first work
A vacation trip home for Scout from her job in New York City begins begins happily, but takes an ugly turn when prevailing racial beliefs are uncovered. Has very strong finish providing insight into the origins of racial tension and prejudice that developed in the South following the civil war and escalated in the 1900's.
For me, this book started out 3-stars, and ended with 5-stars. Great insight and "food for thought" related to the Southern view of things. Although written in the 1950s, it gives a perspective on the "banning" of the Confederate flag today (aka the attempt of the "PC Police" to re-write history).
This was ok, but not great. Kind of uneven, with some parts, such as Scout's memories of her childhood, quite nicely written, while other sections were preachy and a bit klunky. Tried very hard to get across the idea that Atticus was a typical product of his time, but wasn't completely successful in selling that concept.
This book describes segregation in the South as seen through the eyes of a black family.  At first, the children accept segregation as normal, but as some grow to understand the injustices and limitations of segregation.  The fabric of the story unfolds comfortably.  I enjoyed the book despite a few slow-paced sections.
I was disappointed by the long speeches given by Scout towards the end, which brought me out of the story. Wanted to like it more than I did:(<br/>Characters felt real, as did the setting, but not enough happened - seemed like a lot of the book was just back and forth cerebral dialogue. Still, it was very well written.
I was disappointed.  I can see  why Harper Lee did not release this book earlier. I know she is living in assisted care and wonder she is in need of money and is the reason the new novel was released.
I have to say I was very disappointed in this book. I loved To Kill A Mockingbird...sadly this was not up to the same caliber. I almost wish I did not read it to be very honest. I would not recommend reading this book if you loved To Kill A Mockingbird.
Some of the plot reminded me of the past .
Not much of a story,not interesting at all
Disappointing after To Kill A Mockingbird.
there was no plot.  such a disappointment.
I liked to Kill a Mocking Bird much better
Understand why she didn't publish earlier.
So good to revisit the familiar characters from To Kill a Mockingbird, but what a shock to find things so different.  I have to say, though, that this portrayal is probably more realistic.  Sad to say, but people's attitudes are complicated.  We may de disappointed in the message, but it's good it came out in the open.
Based on what I heard about the book, I was expecting it to be far more scandalous. Although it wasn't, it did shed light on a mindset that many people in this country had at that time and still do, which I found to be quite thought provoking. The book was very well written and entertaining in classic Harper Lee style.
Loved this book!  Negative reviews stated the change in Atticus, but he is the same.  The only change is how Scout views him and him no longer protecting her from the reality of the south during that time. At last, closure to what would become is Scout
I liked most what I liked every time I read "To Kill A Mockingbird," which is the author, herself.  The way she writes is like loving the journey as much as the destination, or more.  What a talent for telling the whole story, both sides and both ends.
I was somewhat disappointed.  I read it after I reread To Kill a Mockingbird.  I now understand why the author decided to release To Kill a Mockingbird and to hold on to Go Set a Watchman.  I just did not think it was a well written as Mockingbird.  I may have felt differently had I read it and evaluated it by itself.
Very disappointing. Way too much time spent on meaningless details of the kids playing back in the day. A an almost senseless argument with her father, Atticus. It also was way too long. Scout was not a well adjusted young woman; I felt sorry for her.
The publication of this work raises so many questions.  Certainly it is a bonanza for the publishers but does anyone else benefit?  It is difficult to sort out the murky facts behind the "discovery" of the manuscript.  Surely if Nelle had wanted it to see the light of day she would have brought it out.  It reads like a draft with no significant editing.  One has to wonder if Harper Lee actually laid eyes on it in recent years.  The change in characterization of Atticus has generated a lot of distress.  I miss the original one too.  But there are so many flaws that have nothing to do with that.  There is an inexplicable change in verb tense early one for two sentences.  On one page Calpurnia has fled the house because of Jem's death.  Three or four pages later her absence is explained as being because of her age.<br/>There are entire paragraphs that are identical to ones in "Mockingbird ".  These and other ones that return to childhood are the strongest in the book.  The change from first person to third distances the reader from Jean Louise, who screeches through page after page.  it is impossible to have the empathy for her that we had for so many of the characters in "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I returned to that book immediately after reading "Watchman" so that I could see what Harper Lee had accomplished when working with people who saw the story she had to tell and encouraged her to refine it to the outstanding classic it is.  I suggest rereading it.
I could not put the book down! I was thoroughly engrossed in the book, and am awaiting the negative comments from people that were not as open to Lee's assessment of race relations in the South at that time. Sadly. the bigotry continues to this day.
I read this book after re-reading To Kill a Mockingbird. All around it was a good read. I preferred the first book. But I did enjoy this book as It helped complete the first one. A few of my favorite characters seemed to be missing out of this version. I wished the story line would have followed all the characters.
I was disappointed. The writing was somewhat sophomoric; the plot was convoluted and spent more time on the past than the present; and the ballyhooed revelation that Atticus Finch is a racist was kind of glossed over and never really addressed. All told, I probably wouldn't have bought the book in the first place.
well written, although not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. I would recommend anyone reading this read "Mockingbird" first. Having read that in the 60's, this book felt as though I was renewing acquaintance with real people out of my past.
Worth reading, although a sad picture of that period of time in our history.  If nothing else, it provides a picture of a beloved character in our national literature - and I am talking about Scout, not Atticus - that deserves better understanding.
in my opinion there would need to have been three books as a conclusion to kill a mocking bird.  it jumped too quickly from the tomboy girl to a grown up woman. i could go on but i am just going  to leave at this it was not what i expected to a follow up to kill a mocking bird. that book deserved it's acclamation
I wasn't super impressed; I wanted to love it. I didn't think it flowed and caused you to really care about the characters. I found myself skimming over pages to get through it. Perhaps I will give it another try down the road because I'd love to love it! One positive was in communicating her messages about race.
If we are to understand and progress we need to know our history  This is not a happy read. It Is I believe a representation of how things were and unfortunately continue to be in many respects.
This is a sequel sorts to "To Kill a Mockingbird", although it was written first and not published until recently. Atticus Finch is apparently not the man we all thought. An interesting discussion on bigotry, racism and the 10th Amendment. The novel does not seem fully developed, but does certainly raise issues.
This book should not have been published.
this book was for my high school daughter
I was hesitant to read this book because of some pre-publication chatter that proved to be nonsense.  It is wonderfully written and is told through the eyes of Scout as adult.  And yes, her world is revealed to her differently 25 years later.
I wasn't immediately pulled in, so it took a few chapters to want to continue reading, but once I did, I couldn't put it down. I loved watching the characters, yes, including Atticus, grow and evolve. Still loved TKAM more, but I'm very happy that I read it first. Would not have been the same impact if not.
The grown-up Scout wasn't as interesting as the child but the book gave us a look at Scout' s future. I liked the look back into her childhood. It added humor to a serious book about the race situations at the time. I can understand why this book was not published in the 50's. All in all it was a good read.
I found myself comparing it to To Kill a Mockingbird which was far better written and of course a classic.  Even though the time period in Watchman was later than Mockingbird, I understand that Watchman was written much earlier.  I, like many others, found the changes in the main characters hard to accept.
i started to read the book with no expectations, except, to not compare it to the "other book". it was ok, i think i see why she chose not to have it published when she wrote it.  i borrowed the book from the library and was glad that i didn't purchase it, which is what i originally intended to do.
Go Set a Watchman characters lacked any of the strength and fortitude that  was obvious in To Kill a Mocking Bird.<br/>It showed the usual "follow the crowd" mentality that is so prevalent today.The book was a great disappointment.
Not well written and had no real ending.
so boring. I did not read until the end.
It was awful. I really wanted to like it
very disappointing I could not finish it
What a let down.  Didn't even finish it.
Interesting, style of writing took some getting used to, flashbacks, etc.  comparison to the still ongoing bigotry and homophobia of the south...can't get away from it....Scout's reaction to believing her idol (Atticus) had clay feet was perhaps a bit of an over reaction...still, all in all, a good read.
No wonder Harper Lee never published this book.  It is awful.  A late fifties, early sixties rant on racism that is so preachy.  No way a daughter would talk to a father this way, what a crock.  The whole book had no story, just preaching.
I enjoyed it very much, the characters are the same as in Mockingbird, but story does not dovetail exactly as a sequel.  Atticus has been accused as a racist by some readers but he is not, he is just a southern man of his time who feels the negroes are not ready, revering what happened in Reconstruction
I agree with Adam Gopnik of the New Yorker--it's a failure as a novel. However, if you have any interest in getting inside the mind of Confederate flag wavers, this novel will allow to rummage around in there. Otherwise,  it's a hot mess.
I laughed heartily at the childhood scenes with the falsies and playing revival!<br/>The doctor/uncle character was just not too believeable and especially when he resorts to slapping--violence for the sake of violence.<br/>  The lesson, however is real and viable and as crucial today as in the 60's.
I found this book to be fascinating.  It reminded me of my hometown in the 60's as well as the Baptist church I attended. I love it and would recommend it to all those who really want to know how southerners felt during that time period.
Without the name Harper Lee attached to it this would have been a decent first draft of an angst ridden young Southern woman. With Harper Lee's name attached to it, it a disappointment.
I was really quite surprised after the pre-release publicity that this would not be of the same quality as her other book.  I was pleasantly surprised as the character set seemed to have remained the same in many ways.  Remaining small town and evolving as they did made this a read to look forward to.
Another intuitive story by an author with keen incite.  Stirring and accurate.  Her voice is very acerbic and necessarily so.  Sharp wit, very funny here and there but mainly a really good tongue lashing.<br/><br/>I am again, as I was after Mockingbird, ashamed of us white people.  Thank you Harper.
The book has some of the voice so appealing in Mockingbird, but the diatribe at the end doesn't fit with the style of writing in the first parts. I think it rubs our modern sensibilities the wrong way to hear segregation and the 'In due time" approach promoted by a character who is not all evil.
It has been decades since I read To Kill A Mockingbird but it was important to have read that before reading Go Set a Watchman.  Although I found it interesting, it was definitely not as powerful as her first novel.  I was troubled by what I felt to be loss of integrity on the part of Atticus Finch.
I liked this book.  Perhaps, because I read it without expectations. No it isn't "to kill...." bbut it is a good book.  I was more disappointed in Scout's character than the portrayal of atticus.  Maybe because I was growing up in the south of that time period, I wasn't shocked at his views.
I actually was anticipating this book sooooo much that it seemed never to come out. When it became available I read so incessantly that I think I "over-read". The more I read the more disappointed I became. This could have been a first book with Scout reminesing. I think I expected too much.
I found the book to be just ok. Some details were left out such as why and how Jem died and the judge. Aticus was in the back ground in this book. It lightly touched on so many main characters mentioned in To Kill A Mockingbird. This book was disappointing to read even though I finished reading it.
Glad I read it but wouldn't suggest it.
Absolutely loved this book. All the hype re Atticus and bigotry is just that. Read this it is delightful in the sense that Ms Lee was/is far sighted into the problems we are facing today. A read to be paired with Mockingbird forever.
I do not remember too much about it as it had to be the most boring book written.  I think a 10 year old child could have written a more interesting story. It is difficult for me to believe that Harper Lee actually wrote this drivel.
Unfortunately this did not live up to my expectation.  I purchased 3 copies as I am a very big fan of To Kill a Mockingbird.  I have heard that this was an outline of a book.  It reads that way,very disjointed and very disappointing.
I received Go Set a Watchman in the mail on it's publication day, and immediately began reading. I put it down after the first few pages because it was too disconcerting to read about characters I loved in a different context. I picked the book back up, and finished it a few minutes ago. It was a great book, one that Harper Lee could never have published  at the time TKAM was published-she could not have returned to Alabama for many years if she had. I don't feel any differently about Atticus. He wasn't the same person he was in TKAM, but neither was Scout. We do see our parents through different eyes as adults. Desegregation was a difficult time in the south, as Harper Lee clearly knew. It was a very different time. I gave the book 5 stars because it is an unbelievable example of a first novel, and as another reviewer stated, is even better because we are able to place the events of Jean Louise's adulthood in the context of Scout's childhood. I was reminded of another book by an Alabama author -The Help by Kathryn Stockett. Jean Louise and Skeeter are amazingly similar.
It is tough to follow Mockingbird, and to write without Jim and Dill. And no mention of Mr Arthur Radley.  This book focuses on Scout and Atticus and the compromises Atticus made. It does not have the satisfying ending of Mockingbird.  Still after the wait. It is worth it to skinny dip with Scout.
I was expecting a book on the caliber of To Kill A Mockingbird and Go Set A Watchman was not it.  I was disappointed in it mostly because I had high expectations.  I did enjoy the development of Scout and Atticus in this apparent sequel to Mockingbird even though it was written before Mockingbird.
I thought it was good. Made more sense when I realized that this was written before TKAM. I wasn't outraged that Atticus turned out to be racist, it was the rural south. I was a little perplexed by the ending...had to go back and read it twice. Overall, I say the book was good, not great, but good
I do n't have the same approach to prejudgment as H. Lee. Scout expressed all the emotion I feel. How Atticus rationalizes his position is beyond me! And then to have Scout try to buy into it, makes it more antagonistic. My conscience hAs to be expressed.  That's how my "Watchman" is set.
I enjoyed this novel and was not as bothered as some about Atticus revealing a more racist self. Scout's self discovery and coming to grips with her family's shortcomings is something quite common, I think, to the human experience.
This book is good to read as a point of history. For me it helped to explain racism in the south. It is rough in form -- too much lecturing and proclaiming by Scout. Dialogue is not realistic. But the perspective is much more believable than the sanitized view in "to kill a Mockingbird".
This book is overall unsettling, dealing with a subject that will never be easy or resolved.  Harper Lee, even early on, has such a profound understanding of racial issues, human nature, family intricacies and southern life, her voice will remain significant in the constant struggle to be human.
A good , quick read but no where near the impact of " to Kill A mockingbird" for me. Although the theme is universal and current , about parental relationships , the story seemed too dated . But, with all that it was still beautifully written and I'm glad to have had a chance to read it.
Solid book on its own. By the end, you can see how writing this novel helped Lee create the masterful TKAM. This one also explores a changing Alabama in the midst of Civil Rights, the notion of an ever-evolving hometown, feminism versus tradition in the South, and the fallibility of our heroes.
This was a difficult book to read as it exposes the racist thinking of the deep south at the time of the early civil rights movement.  It also shows the differences between those exposed to life in the north from those who have never left the south, and the misunderstanding between generations.
Shallow character development and predictable plot. At the end, the man female character is purposely hit hard in the face to knock some sense into her and then given whiskey to mellow things out. This was presented as acceptable.
I enjoyed it and found it humbling. I struggled a bit with the southern references and jargon unlike To Kill a Mockingbird which I only recently read. Both books deepen knowledge of the racial divide and it's roots in our country.
As well-written as To Kill a Mockingbird. Still thinking about what exactly she's saying. Wish I had paid a little bit more attention to what was happening during that time when I was growing up . Think I'll read it again tonight.
Wordy, rambling. Disappointed.
Disappointing. I am so sorry that this book was released. I think the fact that Ms. Lee is in poor health and may have been coerced into releasing it is only typical of the lack of ethics in our present culture.  Sadly in need of the brilliant editing used to develop the previous masterpiece..
I did not care for this book, To Kill A Mockingbird was much better, this book is out dated and does not reflect anything remotely close to the other book. If you did not know about the other book you would not even connect them,
This isn't To Kill A Mockingbird. Its a good book by a " southern writer" that is very relevant to current events. The characters are not the people from Lee's other works. The book stands on its own and is recommendable.
Go Set a Watchman, the accompanying novel to Harper Lee’s classic, To Kill A Mockingbird, is an excellent and intimate commentary on growing up, and shaping one’s views and morals as an individual. Returning to her hometown of Maycomb County after a taste of life in New York, twenty-six year old Jean Louise, “Scout,” Finch visits her family, and notices several notable changes in her main role model and father, Atticus.<br/> To Kill a Mockingbird was set in the time of Scout’s childhood, and was a controversial classic that explained how the racism in a small southern town could affect even a young child. In the novel, refreshingly fair and wise lawyer, Atticus, heroically took on the case of defending a young black man against rape charges of a white woman. Due to extreme racism in the Deep South and across America, the Finch family faced stunning amounts of adversity for accepting this case, but all along they knew it was the right choice. Jean Louise seldom expressed any negativity towards her father, and put him on a god-like pedestal, deeming him the living definition of honesty and respect. Throughout Scout’s adolescence and young adult years, she regarded her father in this way. However, this all changed when Scout returned home at age twenty-six, in the height of the civil rights movement. Jean Louise, still immersed in the more liberal big city culture of New York City, expecting to come home and find her father as unbiased and racially-tolerant as ever, and in full support of the NAACP, is shocked by what she discovers. She witnesses her childhood friend and current significant other, Henry, and her father, Atticus, at a Citizen’s Council meeting. This local organization was put in place to reject the NAACP’s efforts, and the presence of two of the most trusted and stable people in Scout’s life there was enough to destroy her spirits. The rest of the book consists of Scout’s internal conflict between what she believes and what she was raised to believe. The events in the story cause Scout to seriously reconsider the way she regards her father, and teaches her that one can never solely rely on another person’s opinions to sustain his or her life. Scout started off with regard for only her father’s morals, thinking that they were her own, but ended the story knowing that she has to experience the world on her own.<br/>The writing style of Go Set A Watchman, though different than that of To Kill a Mockingbird, was very relatable, as was Jean Louise’s internal conflict. I related to this book well, as I feel like I am at the point in my life where I am questioning the views and morals I grew up with, and seriously considering whether or not they are truly mine. I sincerely felt Jean Louise’s conflict as I was reading the story, and I felt like I, too, was finding out the simple but heartbreaking truth about an old friend, Atticus Finch.
Having read To Kill a Mockingbird numerous times, I had expected the same quality of work from this book. I was curious about the portrayal of Atticus Finch being so different from everyone's idea of him. Frankly, I found nothing shocking about Atticus in Watchman: a careful reading of Mockingbird reveals that he was raised to think a certain way, act accordingly, and basically be more like the others in the community. His defense of Tom Robinson stemmed more from the type of lawyer he was. He had been given the case, did not believe his client had committed the crime, and did his best to convince the jury - just like he'd do for anyone else. His integrity would not allow him to do otherwise. He could not hold his head up or expect respect from his children if he pretended to be such a person of honor but let the color of his client's skin dictate whether or not he would defend an innocent man. In Watchman, he's still a man of honor, still has his principles, but still doesn't want to be pushed around. He sees that the "powers that be" are trying to force certain events that no one - black or white - is ready to deal with. He joins a group - the only one available - to try to slow down the process, to allow for a more natural progression toward integration. In Mockingbird, he indicated that he knew what was coming, but dreaded it. No wonder he would work to delay the problems that would inevitably result. Note: I'm not saying that Atticus was against integration - it would simply have been better if the whole situation had not been forced by "outsiders" who did not know the environment or the people. Atticus Finch of Mockingbird remains the same Atticus Finch in Watchman.<br/>My biggest disappointment with Watchman is Jean Louise, or Scout. She is not at all the person I thought she'd be. At one point in Mockingbird, she says that she wants to grow up to be "just a lady," but she missed that wish by a thousand miles. Her language is disgusting at best, her behavior outlandish. Leave out Jean Louise's profanity, and the book would be shorter by a third.<br/>Several passages were identical to some in Mockingbird, especially in the descriptions of various people and tribes living in the area. Therefore I was amazed - putting it mildly - when Jean Louise made reference to her daddy's defending a young black man against the rape accusation made by a 14-year-old white girl, and getting the man acquitted of all charges. It seems that he could not have done the deed because he only had one good arm. Now, this begs the question: how many one-armed black men did Atticus Finch defend against rape charges? The presumed central theme of Mockingbird is the trial of Tom Robinson, his innocence, his conviction and subsequent murder. Don't tell me that Jean Louise simply remembered it wrong - she was almost killed because of it. The only way I can resolve it? Maybe Tom had been accused of raping a 14-year-old and had been acquitted, thanks to Atticus. Later, when 19-year-old Mayella Ewell's daddy beat her and possibly raped her, she saw a good person to pin it on: a strapping young black man already accused once of rape. This would give a little more insight into the desperate struggle of Atticus Finch and those who knew Tom's innocence, as well as the extra-murderous attitude of many folks in the community. The Ewells are not even mentioned in Watchman, even though they played a major role in Mockingbird. Also glaringly absent is Boo Radley. Granted, at the end of Mockingbird, Jean Louise said she never saw him again, but he, his mental illness, and the town's thoughts about and behavior toward him are as vital to Mockingbird as the issue of Tom Robinson. Maybe there's another book hidden somewhere...
I didn’t want to do it to her… but I did it. I read Chapter One of Nelle Harper Lee's new/old book. The chapter was released for free by the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp, also the parent company of the book’s publisher, HarperCollins. I mean, whuddidyouthink? Sometimes a manuscript, in the hand of one man, is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of another.<br/><br/>I couldn’t help myself. On moral grounds, I didn’t preorder. Why not let our Lady of Letters go out in a more dignified fashion? But having taught TKAMB in my 8th grade class many times, and not being able to count self-control among my virtues, I capitulated and read the first chapter.<br/><br/>And yes, it reads like the sophomoric fan fiction version of her more mature—and well edited—classic. It’s full of tired, easy phrases, stock portrayals and awkward tense construction—signs of a writing newby. But a sentence here and there hint at the sharp, brilliant writing in TKAMB. And like seeing the hidden paint layers of a famous canvas, it’s fascinating. As for Atticus the racist—the fodder for much discussion on social media, largely by people who don’t seem to have read the book yet—that hasn’t come up in Chapter One. Perhaps it will offer a more unvarnished look at attitudes about race in the Jim Crow South among ‘progressive’ whites, than Atticus the hero. Lord knows we need more honest discussion.<br/><br/>I’ve been brought to tears by the poignancy and beauty of certain passages in To Kill a Mockingbird virtually every time I read them aloud to 8th graders, or they read them aloud to me. I’ve been stopped in my tracks over and over by a sentence, a paragraph, a description, a shift in point of view, thinking “How does she do that?” And yeah, each time I teach the book, I grapple afresh with how to tackle the sprinkling of anachronistic and offensive passages about race and gender and some problematic characterizations, without tamping down the deeply important message or the joy of the read. Harper Lee had a lot of it right, but she was a product of her time and place.<br/><br/>As for Watchman, everyone needs a good editor. Everyone needs time to develop as a writer. Our literary elders should be cared for, and their accomplishments honored and protected. Shame, shame, News Corp. Will I read the rest of it?  It might be a little like shootin’ a mockingbird.
What to do when a hero tumbles? As almost everyone who is interested in “Go Set a Watchman” knows, Harper Lee’s new novel isn’t really new. From this third-person narrative that bounces back and forth between grown-up Jean Louise “Scout” Finch’s 1960s little-town Alabama and her mostly idyllic childhood years, Lee’s publisher got her to winnow it down to a first-person narrative of a defining incident in Scout’s childhood. In “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Atticus Finch, Scout’s father, defends a black man accused of rape in the segregated let-no-man-put-asunder-South. For fifty-five years Atticus has been a hero to a lot of us.<br/><br/>“Go Set a Watchman” plays out against a background of Supreme Court-ordered desegregation, an angry call for states’ rights, and a burgeoning Civil Rights movement in the South. As has been so widely publicized, Atticus indeed is discovered to have been a KKK member in his distant past. He now (late 1950s) runs a citizen’s council in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, which objects to federal and NAACP intervention in their government.<br/><br/>Where “To Kill a Mockingbird” had a dramatic main story, with a wonderful rendering of Scout’s unconventional life anchoring it, “Go Set a Watchman has no focal point other than Jean Louise’s frustration and growing alienation from the town which birthed her. She has come from her home in New York to visit her father, uncle, aunt, and hopeful boyfriend, Hank. Although her visits have been yearly, this time she notices a definite change. There is no longer one Maycomb, but two. Where blacks and whites knew their “places” and, at least in the opinion of the whites, amicably co-existed, now there is suspicion and an underlying hostility. The saddest scene in the book is when Jean Louise visits her family’s old housekeeper, Calpurnia, a black woman who raised her from the age of two after Scout’s mother died suddenly. “Go Set a Watchman” is primarily about Jean Louise’s struggles to understand how her nearest and dearest can tolerate what is going on and whether everything she learned as a child is suddenly invalidated.<br/><br/>The rushed ending crams a lot of philosophizing about the end of a long-standing culture, no matter how odious its genesis. Yes, Atticus says the Negroes are “children” and still in need of guidance before they can be given full civil rights; how dare the federal government interfere. It’s a forgettable and regrettable mandatory tiding up of a storyline, such as it is.<br/><br/>What is still marvelous, however, is Harper Lee’s ability to evoke Scout’s childhood. In flashbacks, Scout is still irrepressible, incorrigible, exuberant, and good-hearted. We see her in adolescence, too — quite a poignant depiction and a real treat. This greatness outweighs the grown-up Jean Louise’s duller journey of re-awakening, although what makes that journey interesting is that it was written at the time it depicts; it isn’t a rendering with the precious foreknowledge of what will happen.<br/><br/>Remember as you are reading that this Atticus Finch is not the Atticus of TKAM. Harper Lee distilled what was best of her character and tethered him to a story that represented the intensity and volitility of the times. And that was genius.
It was just OK.  I am a huge "To Kill a Mockingbird" fan so my expectation was pretty high.  To me this just would not be how the characters grow up.  It would be nice if she wrote another one with a completely different scenario, just keep going with different possible continuations.
A young woman who intellectually has not become and adult until she returns home and finds the Father she thought was God like was really an old man challenged by racism.  All the characters in the novel were so very believable.
Lovely tale that shows the true colors of mankind, and that even great and heroic men are not infallible. "Home" is not always what it seems thru your adult eyes...it's always difficult to see a your hero turn out to be human...
Unless you are a completionist and want to read everything Harper Lee has written simply because she's Harper Lee, you can do better by selecting other books.  The hype and promotion accompanying the release of this novel miss a simple truth: there is a reason it wasn't published originally!
It is definitely not on par with To Kill a Mockingbird however it has some merit.  Some have condemned it for ruining the "reputation" of Addicus Finch but I think people are missing the point of time and place. IT wasn't the greatest book I have read but it was not the worst either.
This was an unedited manuscript.  Could have been great, but it needed some rewrites, to link better with 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  I know they were not able to do that.  But since Lee Harper actually wrote this book before TKM, it really become a learning experience, which made TKM so good.
Not in the same league as Mockingbird.
i am not convinced this is Harper Lee.
Loved the book .. I will read it again
This novel deals with bigotry and justice, coming of age and old age, gender, roles, responsibilities, mid-20th century politics, set in a slightly familiar but skewed southern town. Is it an argument for "letting things take their course" or a treatise on "the way things should have been"?
I had read that this book was a "prequel/sequel" to "Mockingbird",but I felt it was disappointing in places.I understand why the reviewer/publisher advised Ms.Lee to rework the book some--hence the reworked book of "to kill a mockingbird",which is a much better book.
A new novel from a writer like Harper Lee, who many considered would be a one-novel wonder, is bound to raise a lot of arguments. More so, when the novel that comes out after 55 years was supposedly written before the novel that was published 55 years ago. What I’m afraid is that in the dust and din of the debate Go Set a Watchman will lost its way. As comparison between the two novels, one set in the 1930s and the other in the 1950s, are inevitable, let’s see where they differ:<br/><br/>-In To Kill a Mockingbird, the first-person narrative by Scout worked well with readers while Go Set a Watchman is in the third-person.<br/>-In Mockingbird, it has two section with thirty chapter while Watchman has 19 chapters spread over seven parts.<br/>-In Mockingbird, Atticus and Scout endeared themselves to readers and fellow characters alike but in Watchman their characters have gone through tremendous changes.<br/>-In Mockingbird, the editing, characterization and plotting was almost impeccable but it seemed to have received shoddy treatment in Watchman.<br/>-Mockingbird ends with a sense of hope whereas in Watchman there seems to be a state of uncertainty and unease.<br/><br/>Yet, Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee is an extraordinary journey that brings to life memorable characters with whom we have been well acquainted. It is a deeply affecting story about the relationship between a father and a daughter, and how the ravages of time and the racial tensions of the 1950s turned a tolerant widowed father in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, into a severely prejudiced man. A compelling read by all means, Go Set a Watchman will either repulse you or help you grow in your understanding of the human psyche.
It had portions that clearly showcase the brilliance of her talent for telling stories, but overall it falls short of the high mark she set with "To Kill A Mockingbird." I purchased it because after reading "To Kill A Mockingbird," I would have purchased ANYTHING she wrote!
The first third was laugh-out-loud funny in sections, after which the story darkened considerably.  This book should not be read as a a continuation of Mockingbird.  It is a stand-alone effort which Harper Lee ultimately declined to publish. Scout and Atticus underwent substantial revision, and became immensely more likable if less complex, in the Mockingbird we all love.
Needs editing, but I think they all said that.  Some really good stories, but a lot of lecturing to book characters and to readers and I pretty much don't want to hear it.  Anybody who has had a child come home from college after freshman year ready to change the world has heard it before.
Really disappointed with this book.  Very over-hyped to build sales.  So not worth the price and the time taken to read it.  Harper Lee did not deserve her legacy to be tarnished by those who handled the release of this book.
Ok I got suckered into buying a memory. Don't bother unless you are looking for a poorly written novel about sexism classism and racism.
I am ever so glad I read this book and ever so glad to have had to waited 50 years to do so.  I grew up with the myth of Atticus Finch as did Jean Louise and in order to "get" the message we had to age.  I don't think those that labeled Atticus a bigot, really understood this book at all.
Poorly written. Author seems to want to show off how many phrases she knows. Also such twisted vocabulary you feel overwhelmed trying to understand what she is attempting to express. Some "nice" things about being colorblind
This book was a one that I was looking forward to reading since "To Kill A Mockingbird" is one of my favorites. I was disappointed in the overall story, but it was fun to read about Scout growing up. I wish that they would have provided some discussion questions for my book club.
Makes one want to re read her classic. Brings back many literary memories. Well worth reading, but alas, there is a classic behind the story here that came many years ago. Very grateful to have read all her published works.
I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this book!  However, what a disappointment!  It was shallow in character development and could have been written in one day!  No depth!
I was anxious to read the sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, but between the pre-release hype and the less than stellar writing, I was dissappointed in the outcome of Go Set a Watchman. Mockingbird remains my favorite novel of all time and is definitely the better of these two writings.
This is NOT "To Kill A Mockingbird".  So lower your expectations. It is very good and I enjoyed it, but it does not move you the way Mockingbird did. The characters are well defined but you have to remember you are seeing them from a 1950's perspective.  But it is a good read.
I'm depressed that people can do  the  right thing when called, while harboring prejudice.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" it's not, but it's sadly an honest look inside the South.  The struggle is real.  Once the South accomplishes a better world - it will be more authentic than the North.
This book was fairly light in character development and story pace - and almost tiresome in it's repetition and pace at times.  I understand why it was not published when first offered, and feel it was only a successfully sold book due to media hype and fans of To Kill A Mockingbird.
Such a disappointment for TKAMB fans!
Give it a pass--don't waste your time
Not particularly good but moves fast.
Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.
This novel stands on its own; never mind the naysayers who didn't like how Atticus was portrayed. The author is an artist and I wish she had written more. This novel is better than the hype and is written from the heart.
If you are modern sentient citizen of the old South you will understand the complex subtext of this book.  Initial reviews on Amazon seem to fault the aging of the Atticus character without understanding the perspective of the ideological undercurrents that bridge modern life in a metropolitan city and the historical undercurrents that despite all things persist and continue.  When Atticus won the trial in Mockingbird, he did not win over the people or change their attitudes overnight.  Racists are alive and persisting in South:  a black man is dragged to death behind a pickup in East Texas,  a black woman fails to signal  a turn and dies in a jail despite reporting a history of suicide; black children in Texas continue to attend grossly inferior schools, and Trump tells us that Mexicans are rapists and drug smugglers.  Remember the author chooses to live in the old South; she does not offer an absolution or a solution to racism.  I've seen a series of unusual historical wide angle photographs taken over some years in the early 20th century in Waco, Texas.  These photos were wide panoramic photos one sees of high school classes.  A series of photos I have seen are of the annual Waco Klu Klux Klan picnics.  The odd thing is that men, women, and children are photographed in the full Klan regalia - notably with their hoods down. There are no public Klan members.  Apparently a few hundred Waco citizens attended these annual picnics - but none of them wanted their faces seen in the photographs.  This wasn't just one photo, but annually for decades.  Those hooded and anonymous Klu KIux Klan members are the strange deep South ethos that Go Set a Watchman captures.
Harper Lee did a marvelous job on the first book. Enlighting for Scout as she learns more about her father than she ever wanted to know and also discovers herself.  I enjoyed the book and applaud Harper in her honesty of the south during the struggle of great change. Wonderful book.
Let me start out by saying that Harper Lee has to live up to, "To Kill a Mockingbird" and that isn't fair because not to many writers could ever live up to that book and she did not in this book.  This book was written before Mockingbird but the story takes place a couple decades after her famous book.  I re-read Mockingbird immediately before I read this book and there are some incongruities between the two stories.  Saying that, if she did not write Mockingbird this would have been a pretty good book to read overall.<br/><br/>I want to address some of the criticisms I have read or heard and the first one is how broken up people are because it turns out one of the main characters. Atticus Finch, is a racist.  In the first book he defended a black man against rape charges in the 1930's South.  That is supposed to prove he was not racist.  What he is, though, is human.  In both books he lives and abides by the law.  He is a stickler.  I like the fact that he has flaws and foibles and one of the themes in the story is his daughter figuring that out for herself.  And while his actions in the book appear racist to today's hyper-sensitive culture, to me the actions rang true and Atticus was more upset because he believes in state rights over a big federal government.<br/><br/>There were also a couple paragraphs that were taken word for word in both stories.  No worries there.  Sometimes Scout seems to be overacting in her reaction to events and that was a bit much for me.  She seems more of a two-dimensional character than she did in the first book. Her reactions are more childlike in this book than in the first one where she was an actual child.
I don't know if this book would gather any attention had it not been for the original.  And it's not as good.  Yet, it did a commendable job showing a certain point of view which us northerners can not quite understand.
Very relatable to current events.  We have not come very far since the 1950's.  I went to college in Alabama in the 1960's as a Yankee and had a front row seat to the integration of Alabama enrollment of Vivian Malone.
Without giving to much away:  I was skeptical as I'm sure many people who love To Kill a Mocking Bird are.  I will say I was very pleased with the book and can see where Mocking Bird get its roots.  Well worth reading.
Go Set A Watchman wasn't as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  It seemed distracted and got bogged down with "what if" in people's heads.<br/>It was worth reading in the end.  It was a good to look at the racial problems between blacks and whites from a southern perspective.
Initially, I agreed with some of the critics who said this was a first draft and an inferior piece of writing (wish I wouldn't let myself read that stuff!); after finishing the book I found it had a lot of thought-provoking messages and I'm really glad I got the chance to read it.
Wish I had this as a coming of age book 15 years ago... No point comparing it to Mockingbird. It stands on its own — and I frankly think it's a more accurate coming of age story for a young woman -- in any generation.
I came in excited and full of eager expectations. I ordered this early in the year and waited impatiently for the July release. It is almost November and I'm maybe 5 chapters in. I am trying, really I am...but I am bored. Maybe I will put aside for a few months and start it over.
An interesting read.  unfortunately, the joy of "To Kill a Mockingbird" set my expectations high but it was a very interesting subject matter.  Having relatives in the South make the understanding of the book most interesting. Saw much of the subtle and obvious prejudice.
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorites, so I guess I was expecting a stronger story. Although the book made me look inside my own thoughts about society's stands on equal rights, it did so without painting the kind of wonderful story the first book offered. Not my favorite.
A significant novel portraying life and views of race relations in the South of the 1950's.  Similar to The Help and the movie Corina Corina it puts light on what white southerners were thinking during this period of time and how a more open and accepting attitude was developing.
I did not like this book I kept wondering who really wrote it?  My love of Atticus has been destroyed and now I need to reread TKAM and pretend I never read this book.
The spark of genius gleams brightly in this book. Her editor saw Harper Lee's potential and coaxed her into totally recasting this early version to become "To Kill a Mockingbird," a tale narrated by the child Jean Louise Finch (Scout).  "Go Set a Watchman," by contrast, is told by adult Jean Louise who comes home from New York to discover deep-seated racial prejudices among the townspeople, including her father and the man she thinks she might marry, that she had never noticed during her growing-up years. These men still have the fine qualities she admired, but now she also sees their faults and can't reconcile the good and bad sides of those she loves.... doesn't know if she can go on loving them ... can't wait to get away from the stultifying life in her home town and back to New York.<br/>The ending of the novel and Jean Louise's future are full of ambiguity.<br/>It's not the great novel "To Kill a Mockingbird" became ... but it is a very good one. For me, it was a stark reminder of how truly dreadful things were in the 1950s at the dawn of the civil rights movement (the years of my own youth), how firmly held and defended were those prejudices and beliefs (God meant the races to be separate ... mixed-race children are mongrels ... My own sister-in-law said that to me once, years ago.) It shines a light on the extent to which those evil ideas, though they are fading, are still alive and well in America. It's a very readable book and an enlightening one. As the earlier, less perfect version of "Mockingbird," some feel "Go Set a Watchman" should not have been published. I am very glad it was.
Of course this book can never live up to they hype nor can it be compared to "To Kill a Mockingbird" which is my favorite all-time book. But I enjoyed reading it and I enjoyed seeing the original characters as adults and reliving the first book a bit through their eyes.
It's not a stand alone book.  Need to have read To Kill a Mockingbird first to really get the full effect of the book.  But it was a very enjoyable read, and I will likely read it again to look back at the details.  I think everyone that read Mockingbird, should read Watchman.
not as good as to kill a mockingbird
Very boring.  I did not finish book.
Not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird
Not nearly as good as I anticipated.
Was expecting more from this author!
Great writer, a classic of our time.
It reads like a first draft of To Kill A Mockingbird. It was sad to see Atticus Finch as a man of racism rather than one of high morals and integrity. I felt as if someone had given the super hero in "Mockingbird" a fatal dose of kryptonite. I felt completely letdown.
I could see where the author was going, but the characters were not fully developed.  All the publicity was about Atticus being unlikeable, but the most unlikeable character in the book to me was Scout.  Nevertheless, the relationship between Scout and Atticus was compelling.
I'm really, really, really disappointed that the main character of To Kill a Mockingbird is now clearly racist...!  Also, I don't think this should have been published in its current form.  I think it should have been reworked to some degree.  It could have been really good!
WOW!  I'm so glad that this book has surfaced after all these years....it has given Mockingbird a completeness that I never realized was missing. It also gives Scott a way to grow up in our minds even if it's in the turbulent times of the 1950's South!  Thanks Harper Lee!!!!
I'm not sure Harper lee WROTE this??? Can't tell from reviews by critics and there seems to be some controversy over whether she even wrote at least version that was published. I didn't care for this book at ALL.
Nice sequal because you know the characters. It would be hard for high-school students to get through this book. Vocabulary was sometimes challenging - which is good - but the moral and story line drag on too much for students. Good independent read but not for a classroom.
An outstanding novel that adds richness and depth to the characters found in Ms. Lee's TKAM.  This novel provides a trip down memory lane for those of us from small towns in the Deep South - the vernacular reminds us of the graciousness of our grandmothers who lived in a time when women and African-Americans were first becoming upwardly mobile in society. We see the progressiveness of the New South coming to terms with the richness of its heritage, and while not agreeing with its premise, certainly not condemning it as a relic to be tossed out like refuse. More like a treasured keepsake that has been broken and pushed to the back of a shelf in the ever present china press.<br/><br/>To understand GSAW more fully, remember that this was the first draft of TKAM. How TKAM emerged from this is a difficult concept to grasp - it must have been almost a complete rewrite, but it gave Ms. Lee the luxury of knowing what her characters would be doing in the future, and how thus, to develop them as children in the first novel.<br/><br/>Maycomb, Alabama comes alive again - a vivid portrait of small towns across the South, where the family tree means everything, and the old, respected families that form the backbone of power in every town, despite their flaws and blemishes, serve to understand and protect those born to less than fortunate circumstances.<br/><br/>This novel can stand on its own, and is a work of art by a literary giant. It is not to be compared with TKAM, but as TKAM is arguably the greatest novel of its time, how can any work of literature compare to it? This is definitely worth reading.
I've never been so disappointed in a book. I reread To Kill A Mockingbird before buying  Go Set A Watchman. I don't think they were even written by the the same author. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
Not particularly. The writing in the beginning was not Harper Lee style but as I continued to read I became more engrossed in storyline. Still must be honest.,  Not sure if this novel was truly written first????
I have heard that Lee did not want this novel published, but that her wishes were disregarded in order to finance her memory loss health care.  After reading, I can fully believe that Lee did not want this to go public, for several reasons.  First of all, it reads much more like a first draft than a polished work.  There are even times when she switches from third person to first person narration.  Secondly, both the characters of Scout and Atticus, such absolutely BELOVED staples of strong, likable, moral characters in American literature (though each is sligthly flawed) have become in this novel, in their later years, not only more tarnished, but much less likable figures.  I think Lee wanted to protect us from losing those cherished heros.  Lastly, the narrative voice, the world view, does not even sound the same.  It sounds more bitter, less hopeful, less filled with grace.  While this is a very interesting study, for those who write or study literature, on how an author's writing style can progress, it will not stand as a great, or even a very good, piece of literature.  That said, there are still some lovely descriptions, some very nice turns of phrase, and most enjoyably, many places where Lee's sharp wit shine through.  There were numerous occasions when I laughed out loud.  Worthwhile read for avid fans of "To Kill a Mockingbird",<br/>but DO NOT EXPECT the same skill or a replication of the moral lesson.  This book is far more about how to continue ti get along with those who hold points of view abhorrent to yours than it is about race relations, human cruetly, or injustice.
Disappointing -- the plot was weak, it was wordy with useless literary references, and the flashbacks were nice to read but served no purpose.  I feel that this book could have been summarized in one chapter.  I enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird and felt let down by this book.
Some people have called Atticus racist, but it was a book about the time in history. I am glad I read it and I still love Atticus and the whole family.  I was sorry when the book was over. I will read it again.
Obviously, curious as most are - a bit disappointed - didn't flow well and characters were not crisp.  A lot of editing could have been used in some chapters.  I sincerely hope Harper Lee hasn't been exploited.
I just finished reading "Go Set a Watchman" earlier today.  As others have said, the spoiler alerts in many reviews regarding the alarming changes to Atticus Finch in this new publication, as opposed to the heroic Atticus in "To Kill a Mockingbird" disturbed me greatly.  I asked myself about these changes.  Certainly, the 1950s and the birth of the Civil Rights Movement brought on changes in the Southern way of life that many were unwilling and unable to cope with.  For these people, the "good old days" of the 1930s South when the divisions between the races were less gray and 'separate but equal" was the law of the land was preferable.  I reread Atticus' famous trial summation from "To Kill a Mockingbird" to get some sense of his true views at that time.  Atticus clearly stated that "We all know men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe...(but) in our courts all men are created equal."  That is what Atticus believed in the 1930s and that is what he believed in the 1950s.  In "Go Set a Watchman", Atticus is less iconic but is definitely more human.  Thank you, Harper Lee, for helping Jean Louise and all of us grow up and think for ourselves.
I will never, never believe that Harper Lee wrote this book and I especially cannot believe that any editor would have read it and suggested that she write another book from Scout's point of view as a young girl.  It just doesn't resonate with me.  I thought it was awful.
Such a disappointment. Pre-ordered and was so excited as I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird" and re-read it in the days prior to the release. I'm convinced that Harper Lee didn't write the book and would be mortified if she knew it was published. Would like a re-fund!
Enjoyed it thoroughly. I saw and read To Kill A Mockingbird over 50 years ago when I was a kid. I viewed Watchman as a totally different book and found it well written and interestingfor the time and region. It helped to have read Mokingbird but it is a story unto itself.
So disappointed.  The plot was pretty much nonexistent.  Scout is conflicted and makes some important realizations.  The figure of Atticus is shallow.  What happened to Jem?  Sigh.  Was expecting so much more.
Thin plot; writing shows how much the editor's hand must have been in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Although it's disappointing to see Atticus as a segregationist; it succeeds in making him a man rather than a myth.
This rating may be a bit premature because I haven't completed reading this book.  Having said that, I haven't finished it because I've found it to be somewhat boring and slow moving.  I'm disappointed because To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all-time favorite stories.
Aha! It becomes clearer now. Lee wrote "Watchman"--NOT very good and/or worthy of publication--BORING & TEDIOUS, like being lectured at about civil rights; the "editor" of TKAM WAS Truman Capote. Thus, the reason Lee never wrote anything else publishable.
As i started to read it I couldn't believe it was Harper le.  Though it must be s ghost write or lie.<br/>Then I found out it was a di not publish due to lack of good writing.  How mercenary to publish and tarnish To kill a mockingbird.  If I could get a refund I would.
Although this was written many years ago, I believe that it still reflects the attitude of our Southern States regarding the rights of the Black residents; It seems to indicate that  they will accept them as citizens only when it is profitable or expedient to the whites.
Great read if you understood why it was so bad to kill the mockingbird in the author's first book. This is Jean Louise's moment to realize she's been away from Maycomb either long enough or too long. If you remember Atticus as a hero, you may not want to read this novel.
Reality was not what I expected from a Southern author of Lees generation. This is a wonderful book that should must be in every secondary classroom  It's a perfect book for book clubs.<br/>Marlene Schofield
I was expecting to be blown away the same as I was back in junior high when I read "To Kill A Mockingbird." I set aside any need to have the characters behave the same as they had in "Mockingbird" but found the pace and the character development lacking.
I was interested mostly because of my admiration for To Kill a Mockingbird.  It is not as well written, and the reaction of Scout to her father's development was predictable.  The denouement was unsatisfying to me as an admirer of the Atticus Finch of the earlier novel.
ALTHOUGH I FOUND OUT THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BEFORE, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I FOUND IT TO BE INTERESTING. MY YOUNGER SON SAID, IF HARPERS SISTER, THE LAWYER, WAS STILL ALIVE, SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED HER TO PRINT IT. IT ISN' T NEARLY AS GOOD AS TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD!!
I thought it was very childish in story line. I kept reading to the end to see what would happen. Did she really write it or is it someone else cashing in. I bet it becomes an international seller though and they have Ann Hathaway lined up to play the lead in the movie.
This book was a big disappointment.
This book was a big disappointment!
Haven't read it.  Regret buying it.
Can we pretend this never happened?
a lot better than the naysayers say
A good read as well as informative.
Nothing like to kill a mockingbird!
Very disappointed with book. All the hype about this being the "book of the decade" is so wrong & misleading. Don't buy this book, if you want to read it, borrow it from a sucker that already has it.
I wish she had stopped writing about Atticus Finch after "To Kill A Mockingbird", because I have a feeling this book was closer to the truth and it resulted in the loss of one of my dearest characters.  Well-written, to be sure, but I wish I had never read it.
It is difficult to read this novel and keep it in its proper perspective. The work of a "developing artist" - this is most clear when images of TKaM come into play.I tried to keep a reasonable perspective, but I feel I was successful only about 50% of the time
I liked the TRUE SOUTH come out in this book. However, I am a bit disappointed in Atticus, after To Kill A Mockingbird. You have to read that to understand this book. It's a bit like all of us growing up and learning things about our childhoods that disappoint us now.
Harper Lee had an almost romantic aura about her fiction. She wrote one book which affected so many people and was a staple of classrooms around the world. Then news came of not only a second novel, so many years later, but one with some of the same characters. It sounded too good to be true. When news also came that Atticus Finch, perhaps one of the most beloved father figures in literary history, was revealed as a racist the tide of goodwill started turning. So to judge this book on its own merits is difficult, such is the weight of its predecessor and its own expectation. However reading the first chapters the style and prose are so familiar and wonderfully evocative you feel at home.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Scout's return from New York in the mid fifties to her native Maycomb. She finds a town that doesn't sit well with her memories and expectations. The familiar characters and southern feel is there as before and this really does resonate. However, it takes until almost half way through to reveal it central story. This can be a little frustrating. However, to see it play out and the final conclusion is a real bittersweet delight. Whilst the writing is wonderful the subject matter is difficult and dark.<br/><br/>To compare this with TKAMB is a little unfair except in one regard. The first novel was an exception novel of a child's innocence and this is of a grown up awakening from adolescence and beginning to question and become themselves. Forget the bad press. This is still a great read which resonates and does not diminish a legacy.
The author makes painfully human her previously deified iconic character of Atticus Finch, and does so in a way that touches on the complicated, essential relationship of fathers and daughters, and the often painful process of creating one's own identity.  Well done.
This book was unsettling. It seemed to me to have one major theme--that is "coming of age" of both Scout and our nation. If it can be viewed that way, it was a good book. The author left much interpretation up to the reader. I wonder if others saw different themes...
Good story. It was like checking back on some old friends who you haven't seen in years. Good character development and some plot twists, I kind of wish we could drop back in a few years after this book ends to see what had changed and what remains the same. Solid B+
If this novel is to be believe as true to To Kill a Mocking Bird, because if I believe it I have to assume Atticus Finch has gotten senile or the author has.
Insights keenly relevant to the political arena of today. Challenging questions raised between the generations which beg reflection on a variety of levels. I will be pondering this story for many years.
I reread To Kill A Mockingbird in anticipation of this book coming out. I was surprised how much the prose is exactly the same tone in both books. There is definitely a moral lesson here, but by the end of the book it seemed to read more like young adult fiction.
It does not match To Kill a Mocking Bird but I knew that when I bought the book.  It lends a whole different light to the racial unrest that was present and gave new light to Atticus, himself. In hindsight, it was good that  To Kill a Mockingbird came out first.
I hoped would get the book, but was promised a kindle instead, which I am not able to use. Never received and product, only the billing. I do not use kindle.<br/>Would like to have the book, but I am afraid to order. I might get the kindle again. What can I do?

long wait for a big disappointment
I'm glad they had her re-write it!
Boring and terribly disappointing.
Did not enjoy this book very much.
Wish this had never been released.
I read this novel the day it came out but hesitated to write the review because all the pre-reviews were so grand.  To be honest, the first one-third is quite ordinary, and I didn't want to say anything negative. However, from the moment Jean Louise finds the pamphlet, "The Black Plague," it becomes a different story. The character's interactions turn excellent and really begin to define the racial issues in Alabama before and after the Brown versus The Topeka Board of Education Supreme Court Ruling.  She's lost her beloved Calpurnia, and her pain grows when she secretly views from the courthouse balcony the meeting of the Maycomb County Citizen's Council with her father and future  fiancee sitting quietly as the  racist speaker says horrible things about Blacks. After this she becomes the  angry conscience of all color-blind people, attacking the hubris of generations of white people. Having lived through the 1950's and 1960's, watching two Alabama governors block Blacks at the doors of educational buildings, I believe that the novel offers an excellent inside look at the horror that was to come. Therefore, it Is as proclaimed, a great novel. Alice Dennis Kennedy
This book was not nearly as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. I did not like the development of the characters in this book, and I certainly did not like the rationalization for segregation of the races.
Not a favorite of mine. I was very disappointed.....Harper Lee writes much better than this.  Atticus Finch is one of my favorite characters and it would have been better to leave him alone...........
A great book, however "To Kill A Mockingbird" must be read first. An honest representation of racism on many layers from brutal ignorance to paternalistic acknowledgement. Scout wakes up to realities of her environment with a bitter sweet coming of age.
I really can't rate this because it was purchased as a birthday gift for my mother's 80th birthday. her response was she was having a hard time getting "into" the book. She is an avid reader.
I did not think this book was as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I think I may have been more disappointed in the characters later in life than the younger versions of them in the first book.  I think you should read the book and decide for yourself.
The first half of the book was good and kept my interest. I liked the reminiscing about Scout's childhood and the details that we hadn't heard before.<br/>I was surprised that there was no explanation of what had happened to Jem. The ending was disappointing.
I began reading with trepidation, as the snippets of review seemed shocked and disappointed in the character of Atticus. However, when I closed the novel, I had an impression of veracity and felt such pleasure in revisiting Maycomb and Scout. Loved the character development of both Uncle Jack and his sister. The tremendous opening up of Scout's eyes at the end of the novel was realistic and, as Uncle Jack says, overdue! Given the times, the location and his generation (and let's not forget his profession) I find it plausible that Atticus would want his finger on the pulse of the more vociferous groups in town. He believes everyone should be able to vocalize their views and we may not need to do anything until they act in a way that is harmful. When he refers to Scout as a "states-rights Democrat' it crystallizes that the South still holds a post Civil War wary view of being told what to do by Washington DC. As a Northerner, it was educational to see and grasp the southern view of the NAACP at this time. It is always important to understand another's point of view and 2015 is bringing us this lesson on a daily basis. For me the heart-rending moment came when Scout visited her proxy mother, Calpurnia, to show her love and concern and we inconclusively hope that Calpurnia's head shake meant "yes".  I missed Jem, Dill and Boo, but loved meeting Scout's beau and lazing back into her funny and warm cadence. An older and many-sided Scout gave me much food for thought. Just loved my visit to Maycomb!
An easy read, although it seemed that the author went back and edited using a thesaurus to throw in a couple of "big" words.  A sad addition to the "To Kill a Mockingbird" script.  The work is a constant and tiring display of humanities flaws.
If you come to this novel expecting a masterpiece the equivalent of To Kill a Mockingbird, you will be disappointed.  You have to read it for what it is -- a first work and a draft of better yet to come.  The editors at the publishing house saw the talent in Harper Lee and knew she could do better. It's why they told her to put this manuscript aside and write it from Scout's point of view as a child.  The best parts of Go Set a Watchman are Scout's memories of events with Jem and Scout.  In them, you can see the beginnings of TKM in the detailed narration and the voice.  While this book clearly states Scout's admiration for her father, she doesn't flesh out his character or why her admiration is so deep until she writes TKM.  The same is true for Jem and Dill. While I wasn't particularly impressed with the story line, I did enjoy watching Harper Lee as a novice writer and seeing how her talent developed.  When I finished, I immediately pulled out my copy of TKM, read just the first page, and said, "Wow!" The editors were right to push her to do better.  I can understand why she put the manuscript aside and never bothered to publish it. And -- I have to wonder if she would have offered this particular characterization of Atticus if she had known him better -- taken more time with him -- before writing this novel. My suggestion is: read Go Set a Watchman for the experience of watching Harper Lee's development as a writer. If you're expecting another TKM, you won't find it here -- only its seeds.
Raw, as it is largely unedited but it works well given the subject the author tackles. Though written some 50 years ago, the social issues are as relevant to today's world as they were 50 years ago.
I am pretty cynical about the provenance of this book, but working under the assumption that Harper Lee did write it (it certainly sounds like her, at least in parts), and that it was written before Mockingbird, as advertised, then I can only say that I'm glad that Lee's agent recommended that she give it major revisions until it turned into the book we all know as To Kill a Mockingbird. They're really two completely different books, and Mockingbird is far more compelling, more endearing, and more worth reading. However, I have to give this three stars because it shows Lee's raw talent in writing--the plot might be thin, the writing occasionally clumsy, and the story somewhat disjointed, but it shows real promise, especially in the flashbacks, when she capture's Scout's voice perfectly. I can see why the publisher found Scout more interesting than Jean Louise. I did, too. But this is worth reading just for the historical interest. Also, never mind how she makes Atticus look. He's no racist in my mind--after all, this is just the first draft. By the time the masterpiece of Mockingbird was finished, he was the wise and fair man we all know him to be.
Excellent follow up to To Kill A Mockingbird. I think people have misunderstood the portrayal of the Atticus character. Hopefully repeated readings will assist with understanding Scout's father's stand; especially considering our collective American history.
About what I expected. Not as good as good as 'To Kill A Mocking Bird' but didn't expect it to be.<br/>Lot of going back in time and telling what was left out of the first one. Would be difficult to<br/>make a movie because of all the flashbacks.<br/>Okay
Interesting but not anywhere near as good as Mockingbird.  I really liked the little girl Scout in Mockingbird but I found myself not liking her much in this novel.  I thought she over reacted to her father's situation. and treated him with total disrespect.
Self important narcissistic Scout isn't a wonder anymore, just self righteous foul mouthed adult seeking to diminish everyone that doesn't fit in her liberal agenda.  Disappointing waste of $15.00!
Such a boring book!! Scout is the most unlikeable person in literary history and whines and complains the whole time and the ending is ridiculous. Don't bother, it'll just ruin mockingbird for you.
This book deserves infinite praise for what it accomplishes. It touches on subjects so grand and universal while managing to make itself feel deeply personal. Yes, race is definitely at the heart of its plot and it does a great job of addressing that conversation. But more than that, I felt for Jean Louise. I remember the first time I heard my own father say something I passionately disagreed with. It nearly changed my entire opinion of him; I feared that I would never see him the same way. This is exactly what Jean Louise experiences with Atticus. I think that this element of the plot makes it the perfect complement to TKAM. It brings Scout's "coming of age" full circle. I believe we all, at some point, realize that our parents are separate individuals from ourselves. Whether we are children, teenagers, or young adults when that happens is entirely personal, but it DOES happen. And it's a jarring experience. Harper Lee's depiction of this experience is so real and affecting that you can't help but feel it tug at your heartstrings. The conclusion of the novel was perfectly paced and satisfying.<br/><br/>As I read the novel, I could point out spots that I believe Harper Lee might have changed if given the opportunity to rewrite it. I don't really love the fate of Jem's character. But otherwise, I'm entirely satisfied with this novel and I'm thrilled that it was published after all. As a soon-to-be English teacher, I cannot wait to teach this novel someday.<br/><br/>I recommend this novel highly.
"Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends."<br/><br/>After reading "Go Set a Watchman", I have to say it far exceeded my low expectations based on the reviews I'd read (that I now don't agree with). Watchman was raw and real in a way "To Kill a Mockingbird" could never be. I can only imagine the response this book would have received had it been published in 1957 when it was submitted. Surely it wouldn't have won the author a Pulitzer. It probably wouldn't have even sold all that well. The civil rights movement was about to explode but the American feminist movement wouldn't kick in for several more years -- and the main character of this story -- an extremely independent, outspoken, intelligent female -- probably wouldn't have been widely accepted.<br/><br/>It was easy (comfortable) to embrace a tomboy as she shared a fairy tale version of her father via her child's eye in Mockingbird, but an adult Jean Louise facing her own disillusionment would have been entirely too much. For me, Mockingbird was black and white. It was comforting and charming. It was a hero's story. Watchman is gray. It's complex and difficult.<br/><br/>I disagree with the reviewers who have tagged Atticus as a "raging racist" or say Watchman "is kind of a mess that will forever change the way we read a masterpiece." I would hope most readers are deeper than that. Read it for yourself and then decide.
"The ending more or less leaves Scout to deal with her childlike attitude that her father was a god. Atticus upheld the law so his activities outside the courtroom did not matter. Not the message I was hoping for. Book was written well enough, however.
Although this is not "To Kill A Mocking Bird", it's a well written, well told narrative that should be viewed as a reflection of the time, not as a betrayal by the author.  I wonder whether It will be required reading in school, along with its predecessor?
I really enjoyed this book. At first, it was a little unsettling compared to the first book; but then I started remembering  the realities of life during that time. It was insightful. As as southerner, I felt right at home with the language and traditions.
I got this as a preorder. This was a long awaited book for me as I loved to kill a mockingbird. Go Set a Watchman is a wonderful continuation to the first novel. Highly reccomendations this book.
I expected this to be as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  Not so!  I found it hard to get into, and as I continued reading it continued to be boring.  I wouldn't recommend spending the money on this, not even to get into the issues of racism raised within.
Wasn't as good as the first book.
It was very very very disturbing.
Started out slow but overall good
Well written but found it boring.
I was not impressed at all. sorry
Well done but a disappointing ent
Disappointed. I am aware the author had rewritten this original story to publish To Kill A Mockingbird.  From what I have come to understand even her sister didn't want this published years ago.
I read this and couldn't help wondering why Harper Lee wrote the book from this perspective.  She answered questions I had as I finished To Kill a Mockingbird. In some aspects this book seemed way ahead of its time.  Enjoyed it and glad it was published.
There were parts that were a bit of a shock, racism speaking, but I think it gave a true picture of the culture of the south. And Atticus was true to his ethics as well as his neighbors / friends. He sure needed Scout to move back home to influence many.
Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird but I don't think anyone expected that. Still a very good book and worth reading. Comments about Atticus were unfounded. Read the whole book and see what I mean. Enjoyed the book, glad I read it, and can recommend it.
Pleasantly surprised after hearing such mixed reviews...Harper's development of the complex relationship between Scout and Atticus surpasses the depth of any relationship in TKAM. I actually thought there were more important themes in GSAW than in TKAM.
Almost a 4 star.  I found it a good book; however,  would characterize it as  "generational" book.  I grew up in the 70's and 80's in the South.  My parents and anyone from my generation can relate to the struggle for identification in the plot.
Scout's discovery of Atticus's character flaws (human weakness?), her initial reaction to them, and her confrontation with her father were fairly well written. But her approach with Calpurnia was disappointing, falling short of what I expected of Scout.
It was a good follow up to "To Kill a Mockingbird" but if the rumors are true and she tried to publish this first then she wouldn't have a Pulitzer. but I liked it, and it speaks to currents events just as well today as it would have in the 50s
It is a real downer, muddy with no clear purpose other than making sure we know ALL southern whites are racist bigoted idiots, especially Atticus.
This is not "To Kill A Mockingbird," which asks more questions than it answers, but that is understandable because it reflects the experience of a child. Scout has grown up in "Go Set A Watchman" and confronts, oddly for the first time, the fact that her father, Atticus,  is a human being, not the perfect hero she thought. I was somewhat disappointed because, at her age, she should have figured that out much sooner and because Atticus had to hit her over the head with it before such a thought might even occur to her. All loving children face that reality on their own. Their parents do not tell them and even if they did, it would not register because children need to confront their own fallibilities first.  Parents especially cannot tell a child to grow up. That comes with the self knowledge of the child. Furthermore, what adult admits to his child he is a bigot?  Bigotry by definition requires denial of one's own fallibility and imperfection in order to deny others of the basic rights of humanity. Accordingly, the end just didn't ring<br/>true to me and seemed contrived.  Nevertheless, I couldn't put the book down.  In this effort, I think Harper Lee is trying to provide a means for<br/>northerners to "get'" traditional southern bigotry.  It doesn't fly - too much time has passed since the civil war. It's way past time for the South to get that it doesn't exist anymore.  We are a country of immigrants, a melting pot if you will.
Even though it's a 'draft' of the characters to come in To Kill a Mockingbird (aka a test run) I really have to wonder about the timing of this book's release.<br/><br/>Lee had to have seen the mountains of publicity Kathryn Stockett got over her own novel--and compared that against the initial reception to "Mockingbird". There just weren't the same venues for publicity and book sales back in 1960. Positive reviews from Time Magazine, The New Yorker, and Atlantic Monthly perhaps seem quaint in today's world. Zillions of blogs automatically post thoughts about books to readers worldwide in minutes.<br/><br/>Perhaps she wanted to 'jump back on the horse'?<br/><br/>She had previously told audiences 'Mockingbird' would be her only work. Considering Lee is still a staple inside public schools, I am not sure why the need to repackage a 'draft' from the polished work. She got the praise she had been seeking Well, now she knows what reaction she would get in the internet age.<br/><br/>In this version, Scout goes by Jean Louise. She returned to Alabama and is now dating Henry. Jean Louise  is shocked to discover that Atticus actually is a segregationist. Having defended a man against faulty rape charges apparently does not mean that you want them sharing the same municipal or private sector facilities.<br/><br/>It's hard to look up to somebody who might not really be that  'good' of a person after all.<br/><br/>During a visit to Calpurnia (whose grandson is on trial for having killed a pedestrian while drunk) she is treated abruptly. Having always been smart, Calpurnia is well aware how Atticus in this novel really feels about her. He does not regard her as an equal person either.<br/><br/>Jean Louise's family tries to explain why segregation is being enforced in the south. Uncle Jack's words only confuse Jean Louise who had actually looked up to Calpurnia as an authority figure. She does not like what she hears.<br/><br/>You're not missing anything by ignoring this one.
Prose/style VERY different from "second?" novel, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Plot/dialogue choppy.<br/>Not engrossing. Redeeming quality is its presentation of the race problems which are ongoing 50+ yrs since TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD was published.
This book was okay. I was drawn in immediately at the beginning of the book and couldn't put it down. I was excited to read the continuation of the lives of Scout and the other characters from the first book. I didn't really enjoy the end of the book.
Nice first effort by Harper Lee, but I am glad that the publisher required a rewrite to produce "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Go Set a Watchman is less subtle and more polemical, but I did enjoy this peek into the mind of a liberal Southern woman.
Some of the book - descriptions mostly - is taken from To Kill A Mockingbird but it will only bother you if you read both books close enough together to notice - like I did.<br/>The book is worth a read but it's not the masterpiece the other one was.
This is a free standing novel apart from "Mocking Bird." If you were alive during the time period described, and were Southern, it will put a lot of the turmoil of the times into perspective. Even so, the attitudes are jarring to modern sensibilities.
This book is brilliant. This young woman, in the mid 50's, so simply explained the birth of the racism that exists today. This book should win a Pulitzer Prize like To Kill A Mockingbird did.
Based on this horrible book I will NEVER pre-order any other books.  I'll wait for the reviews.  Only got through a couple chapters before I quit
Choice for our October book club. Found it to be more relevant after discussing the book and hearing others comments. It was probably not intended to be a novel, but a work in progress. Glad that she will be most remembered for To Kill a Movkingbird.
I was not expecting much given the reviews I've read, and I loved it...it is a great book with a lot of insights<br/>and very timely, considering when it was written.  I will re-read soon.!
Meaningless if you haven't read and loved To Kills Mockingbird. Not a terrible book.  Interesting plot twists on TKAMB, some of which you really need to appreciate the political climate and growing civil rights movement of the 1950s to appreciate.
It takes reading the whole novel to get the full understanding of what she is trying to say. Anyone from the south can say they have an older relative they love and admire, who taught them to treat everyone with respect and also felt like Atticus.
I cried at the end...do not want to spoil it.  Kudos to the wonderful writer who truly knows the human heart
Much of the to-do in the media talks about Go Tell A Watchman as a sequel to Mockingbird.  However, Although the events in Watchman take place twenty years after Mockingbird, it would be incorrect to think of these as a sequel.  Watchman was actually written first.  It was, apparently, submitted to a publisher who urged Lee to focus on Jean Louise's childhood and her father's famous trial.  Told through the innocent eyes of a child, Mockingbird became an instant classic and a powerful piece of literature for the civil rights era.  The message in Mockingbird was more subtle than in Watchman.  It also captured vividly childhood innocence.  Once Lee published Mockingbird, she never published another novel until in her old age the original Waychman manuscript was found and brought forth.<br/><br/>As a standalone novel, Watchman is a slow, ponderous story about a young lady's return to her small Southern hometown after living in New York.  Returning to her home was incredibly disappointing.  Her father who could do no wrong suddenly has feet of clay.  This story is clearly about the civil rights era and it uses the opportunity to hit you over the head with its message.  It's also a young woman's coming of age story ala Judy Blume.<br/><br/>As an additional layer of depth overlaying Mockingbird, the book is interesting.  It makes Atticus more complex, more nuanced.  He may have defended Robinson, but he's still a Southerner.
With so much hype about Go Set A Watchman, I'm going to get right to the point.  It's been years since I read To Kill a Mockingbird, and I remember it fondly.  But please forgive me if I don't recall every minute detail of the story.  For that reason I can read Go Set A Watchman how it was intended, as the first novel.<br/><br/>Jean Louise Finch has left Maycomb County and moved to New York City.  She returns home to visit her aging and arthritic father, Atticus.  What she finds is a slow, Southern way of life, so different from what she's become used to.  Scout always loved home but this time she sees it without the benefit of rose colored glasses.<br/><br/>There's a line in the novel about Atticus, and I'm paraphrasing,  that he made everyone feel like his friend.  He's a highly respected man, living in the south where the roots of segregation run deep.  He knew how to play the game.  Jean Louise uncovered a side of him, he'd never chosen to reveal to his children.  It's called growing up.<br/><br/>I loved this book.  Harper Lee's prose glides across the page effortlessly.  I could feel the hot humid days, snicker at Aunt Alexandra's disgust at Scout's modern ways and sit uncomfortably on the hard church pew.  Jean Louise and Atticus are both strong, vivid characters with or without To Kill a Mockingbird.  The world has waited for more from Miss Lee for decades.  Here it is and in my mind, it was worth waiting for.
It is amazing how things change  and how things stay the same. Race issues still continue to divide our nation. Also Scout learns her idols have feet of clay as a final step to adulthood.
Having just read To Kill a Mocking Bird,  and discussed in a book club, Go Set a Watchman,  was disappointing.  It didn't near hold my interest! The constant reviewing the past, might have been necessary for those who did not read the first book.
Perhaps because I had such high expectations, perhaps because it is nowhere near as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, but I could never get hooked with this novel. It is not a bad novel, it's just not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. Not even close
I really didn't like the book. I wish I could describe it from a critics view, but it had no substance, and the characters had no depth.<br/>Maybe there was a reason she kept it buried.
Good book for discussion especially if "To Kill A Mockingbird" has been read also.  Very relevant with contemporary issues such as the Confederate flag and current racial issues.
The writing is good, but there isn't much substance to the story.  It's more a short story.  If she had taken the book through Frank's trial it might have been as good as Mockingbird but the story just drops off just when it was getting started.
It is a description of the southern life Harper Lee lived, but the story has no where near the poignance of To Kill a Mockingbird.  I have read a lot about the author, and this book seems to me to autobiographical.  Worth reading, but not great.
This was a good book. Not great like To Kill a Mocking Bird, but I was expecting it to be fairly bad, but was pleasantly surprised. I found bits at the beginning a bit confusing and lacking clarity; however I was generally pleased with the book.
I didn't really care for this book and had a hard time getting through it.  I would not recommend it maybe if I lived during this time I woud appreciate it more but foud it very boring.
I am very disappointed with this book. It is poorly written with one-dimensional characters. It shows that it is a first novel. It needed a much better editor. Had the author not been Harper Lee, I think this book would not have been published.
I was disappointed in this book, I really enjoyed the first one. This was more of a prequel with many flashbacks than a sequel. It did show that giving black people freedom and rights was more complex in the South than many thought it would be.
I never personally believed To Kill a Mockingbird needed a sequel. In Watchman I would never have recognized either Atticus or his brother. And to have Jem dead before the story even started, completely destroyed this main  character from TKAM.
I found it very interesting.  It showed me the real problem in the south.  More blacks than whites. How will the problems ever be solved unless it is through education, understanding of each culture and bringing people together with God's love.
As a huge fan of To Kill a Mocking Bird, I could not wait to read this sequel novel following Scout into adulthood and I was not disappointed.  Scout is as impetuous as ever, but demonstrates that we are never too adult to learn simple lessons.
Loved the first book - To Kill A Mockingbird - and loved the second as well.  There were some surprises (Atticus' views on the world around him), but the lessons learned by Scout were well stated by Harper Lee.  I would recommend it to others.
Harper Lee's long lost novel should have stayed lost. It is clear why her editor rejected the book and sent her back to write what would become To Kill A Mockingbird. Had this been the novel that was released no one would remember Ms Lee today
I can't finish this book. I read 70% and I can't continue. It's so scattered I don't know what I'm reading. That saddens me as I was really looking forward to this book being released.
I was fortunate enough to get a copy from the library. I read a couple of chapters, but got bored. There is probably a good book here, but the story is rambling and in need of editing.
I enjoyed To Kill A Mocking Bird much Better.  Go Set A Watchman dragged quite a bit. I liked Scout's character as well as her Uncle Jack. I found it interesting when Scout realizes Atticus Finch was a white supremacist. Not my favorite book.
Some parts of this book did not flow and I was disappointed with the characters progression. I had a hard time following the story and the message being conveyed. It moved slowly and was not something that drew me in. I was very disappointed.
The first  part of the book is very slow, with not much happening. In my opinion, the whole point of the book is summed up in the dialogue between Scout and Addicus, her father, explaining a southerners point of view about racial segregation.
Big disappointment. It was hard to judge with only the most beloved book, "To Kill a Mockingbird" to compare it to, but It didn't feel like Harper Lee's writing. As I was reading it I questioned if Harper Lee actually wrote this book.
I liked when she talked about her childhood she seemed like the old scout. Attitude character was very  difficult to read. He'd been almost a God to me for over 50yr<br/> It'd a good thing this was not published first. We would neve had tkam
Even though this depicted addicus as different.  This is her original tale.  It is also more true for the times.  I loved to kill a mockingbird!  But as her original work it was good.
I was surprised how much I enjoyed this after  all the negative comments I had read.  This was the awakening of the child in all of us, realizing that real life our heroes are often just human after all.  Atticus was still a hero in my mind.
"Go Set a Watchman" began well enough, but soon deteriorated into a confusing and unpleasant miasma of the stiflingly dull "storyline" and excruciatingly bad dialogue. That was, until the last chapter. I put it down and walked away, trying to make some sense of it all. It was only tonight, that I forced myself to pick it up and finish it. I was hoping, I think, that there would be a sort of magician's reveal at the end. A younger version of the protagonist, who while standing on a box, who would whisk away a curtain and we'd all have a good laugh at the joke that had been played on us. Sadly, no "ta-da!" was forthcoming.<br/><br/>So, why read it? To state it as calmly as possible, I can't really recommend it. It tells no new stories worth reading, no new truths we haven't discovered already and despite a few beautifully worded passages I have to seriously question if this is even Harper Lee's work.<br/><br/>There may have been a trick in there somewhere, but it wasn't I fear, for our amusement, but rather played on us.
Not what I expected. The characters have evolved into completely different people than they were in To Kill A Mockingbird. I can understand why this novel was put on the back shelf and she was persuaded to write To Kill A Mockingbird first.
It is important to read this book as it is and not as too close a comparison to To Kill a Mockingbird. I liked Scout (Jean Louise's) efforts to find her way when going back to her hometown. It did bring nostalgia for a simpler pace of life.
Was pretty slow getting started, Not a book I couldn't put down. I could skip a day or two, never felt like I had to see what happens next. Some entertaining parts but if it was by an unknown author, I would say it was a little lack luster.
This was a book grappling with major issues that the country was dealing with, intertwined with major issues 20-something's deal with. While the story was all over the map, it is tied together well. The writing feels more modern than it is.
what I expected from the author
Not up to original book quality
For the life of me, I could not finish this book. It is horrible. If you are considering buying it because it is Harper Lee, save your money and DON'T do it. Practically unreadable.
This novel is more complicated in its themes than To Kill a Mockingbird but is rich in humanity.  Shows the world through adult eyes and the frailty of man.. No one is perfect. I really liked it and wish we had more novels from Harper Lee.
I knew when reading this book that there could be no comparison to Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.  I read Watchman because of my admiration for Lee's masterful classic.  As a stand alone novel, I could not recommend Go Set a Watchman.
Plain that this was a first draft, lacks entirely of the polish one might expect from a well-edited novel. Would be of little interest if To Kill a Mockingbird was not such a gem.
I was very disappointed in this book.  The story jumped around too much, and when I finished the book I was left with a very unsatisfied feeling.  There was no depth to this book.
Despite other reviews, I enjoyed the read. It was a nice reminder of the book I loved as a kid. The glimpse back in time to the stories along with her own current moral struggles.
Feels like an afterthought to the first book, sort of sequel but with repeats and reinterpretation. Story is not as coherent and neither is writing. Feels like story is wrapped around the point author is trying to make , artificially so.
That editor all those years ago who saw the glimmers of TKAM in this book was brilliant to send Harper Lee back to her typewriter to flush out the backstory of this book. This book, on its own, is pretty darned average. The little jewels that are mere throwaways in "Watchman" were plucked out and turned into one of the greatest novels an American writer ever composed.<br/><br/>Where "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a gentle voice, "Go Set a Watchman" is a shrill screech. It's tough reading a book with known characters who are not yet fleshed out. Atticus in particular is just a shadow of the man we know from TKAM. His brother Jack is more of a whole character and was likely sacrificed in order to combine some of his characteristics with those of Atticus in TKAM.<br/><br/>Harper Lee seemed to be having mental arguments (possibly with her own father) and putting them down on paper, and that doesn't always work here. Conversations go on for pages and pages and become too much to follow or to care about. That's where good editors come in, but apparently this book had very little editing. That's a shame, because it could have been much better.<br/><br/>Interesting too -- This story has a number of points that are relevant to today's racial issues in this country. Why am I not hearing it discussed in the MSM?  (Hint: Because the important stuff isn't politically correct.)
Boring.  Anticlimactic.
I felt this was an angry book? I did not enjoying reading it and I felt like the characters want to really developed. I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone to read.
While I had an idea about the book's subject, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the author made her points.  The interweaving of Scout's past and present life was phenominal.
Not at all what I expected. A big let down compared to Mockingbird. Characters are shallow and the story keeps shifting back and forth.  Not sure what the point of the book was; just a repeat of the themes in Mockingbird. Disappointing.
Jean Louise is a true hero in this book.  Her views on the civil rights movement taking place during that time are words we should remember today.<br/><br/>It was not a fast read for me and was hard to get through. Very slow at times.
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird was brilliant - thank you to her for that but THIS - Go Set A Watchman is pathetic - amateur - unfinished - basically a rough draft and put in the safe because it went NOWHERE - There is a reason why Lee did not try to publish GO SET A WATCHMAN - it is meaningless - pages and pages of circles and a Scout that is in no way consistent with the original character - I think this was published for money - I even wonder if Harper Lee even gave her consent - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME - Go Set A Watchman - great title - pathetic text
Enjoyed the book.  Keeping in mind that this was Harper Lee's first novel.  I grew up in a small southern area and can appreciate the look at that time period.  I am sure she did not have the help of an editor--which many people do.
I think I over-anticipated this book. "To Kill A Mockingbird" is such a classic that any sequel would have a hard time following in its footsteps. Characters I loved before I now found I just wanted to shake some sense into.
I didn't finish this book. I liked 'to Kill A Mockingbird' and read it several times. Loved the movie also. This book was disappointing and I really didn't care about the characters enough to spend time reading the rest of the book.
I was disappointed and think that if it had been it had been published in the '70's it would have had more impact for its socio-cultural insights. For me it was a nostalgic, well written, coming of age novel with no real surprises..
Interesting but obviously a first effort. Written in the same style as To Kill a Mockingbird and the character development is oustanding. This novel comes across as more of a "coming of age" story. Read and see what u think
I thought it was pretty good when I started the book.  Was just getting into it when it abruptly ended.  Much too short to make an impact on me.  Very disappointed.  Very poor value.  You can buy much better books at a lower price.
Good but not great! It probably would have been better had it been published when it was written. Story of two different sides of race relations in the south. Nothing stood out in either character to make it a "great" book.
This book was nothing like I expected but I did like it. I think the fact that this book had to live up to the status of To Kill A Mockingbird made it hard to see characters that were hero's\icons  become more human was difficult.
It starts very nostalgic and then twists into deep thought and controversy. A wonderful book and perfect complement to "Mockingbird".<br/>It's easy to read for a non-reader like me. This ought to be a school reading must.
Delightful writing, clear, crisp...in the moment. I've only read it once, and believe it needs at least twice to take in the nuances. I wish we had more of Harper Lee's writing to enjoy...and I wish I could write like she does.
I didn't like this book particularly well. It was a fast read. I didn't think Atticus changed his mind about anything. I thought it just showed how people thought in different times and different situations. I was disappointed.
I enjoyed the book enough to keep reading however it paled in comparison to the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>Skillfully and intelligently written but I found the book slow and not engaging enough to rave about frankly.
The book was a little tough to get into at first, but picked up after a few chapters.  I found it enjoyable and thought provoking.  I'm not sure what my review would have been without being such a fan of To Kill a Mockingbird.
Lee understands human emotion, with its learned prejudices, and examines how deep insight into one's own core beliefs may overcome the prejudices. I still prefer To Kill A Mockingbird, but both are well-written and insightful.
In the beginning her flash backs made me laugh more than once but as the story progressed it jumped around to much.  Had to go back and read the last chapter  again just to see if I missed something.  Not as good as I'd hoped.
What a big disappointment!  This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  The characters were not well developed, since this was Harper Lee's first novel.  There was no continuity in the story.  The flashbacks were not always pertinent to the story.  It jumps from the current time of Jean Louse's (Scout) visit to her childhood in no order.  It is difficult to believe this was Harper Lee's book except for her name on the the title page.  I have so enjoyed reading & re-reading "To Kill A Mocking Bird", that it is difficult to believe the same person wrote "Go Set a Watchman".  I can easily understand why publishers returned her manuscript for "Watchman".  One book seller has offered all that purchased from his company & disliked the book the option of returning the book for their<br/> money back.  Don't waste your money on this book.  If you really want to read it, check it out at the public library.
Did not like the book at all.
Draw out and disappointing...
boring. not worth the effort.
It was boring. I returned it.
Not impressive.  Predictable.
the book was not as expected.
Harper Lee is a gifted writer
Disappointing yet compelling.
Strong characterization of Jean Louise makes this novel a good read, especially for northerners looking askance at southern values of the past. Scout reacts, learns, and grows as a result. Good dialogue and very believable...
This book should win a consolation prize for the worst of the year.  I forced myself to read this book, since it was a 'literary event'  and "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my all-time favorite books.  However, it was very poorly written, difficult to follow, and not very interesting.  I am glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't pay any money to buy it.
The story is boring.  The ending is lame and weird.  All the characters including Scout are unlikable and annoying?  I think a lot less of Harper Lee now.  I'm not even sure if she wrote TKAMB.  It probably was Truman Capote.
It's certainly no To Kill a Mockingbird. There's not much of an overall storyline and I found the end unfulfilling. If nothing else it's an interesting perspective on the Southern way of life during an ugly period of history.
I think it's an important book to read, especially for those who read and loved To Kill  Mockingbird. But as a stand-alone novel, I felt a little underwhwlmed. It lacked a good story line and truly felt like an after thought.
Kind of ruins the first book
Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I don't even want to go into all the reasons it's terrible, but I would not recommend this book to anyone. Poorly written.
Harper Lee is a goddess amongst authors. To Kill A Mockingbird has, and will always be, my favorite book; however, this is a very close second. It is a must read.
Very interesting. I read to kill a mockingbird then go set a watchman without knowing anything about them. Mockingbird is awesome and watchman is so interesting in comparison. Lit classes will have fun with this pair.
I was so looking forward to this book it started out wonderful and then it seemed like someone else besides Harper was writing it. Not sure if it was a first attempt or a lets finish what we found. I wish it was more.
I, like so many, was stunned by the media leaks that Atticus was a "racist" and I had decided not to bother reading the book when it arrived on that Tuesday.  However, I soon succumbed.  It is obviously a first-draft writing and did not benefit from good editing and rewrites...how could it?  Nevertheless, I feel  it is a literary work of value;  it touched a hidden energy deep within my "beingness."  I grew up in the deep South and I have never been prejudice against African-Americans because there was a black woman in my small fishing village who became my chosen surrogate mother;  without her unconditional love, my sanity would not have been preserved.  "Watchman" helped make me aware that buried very deep within my psyche that growing up in the deep South with it's dominate segregation/racist attitudes left blemishes and scars on my Soul.  I know how to deal with this and I will do so.<br/><br/>I feel racism...regardless of the source...is like a surreptitious virus that invades one's psyche deep within it's core;reaching that core to eradicate the vagrant often requires lifetimes of introspective, diligent work and Divine Grace to heal.  Like all of us, Atticus,Scout and Calpurnia were works in progress.
Don't bother reading. It will ruin your love of To Kill a Mockingbird. In moments, Lee captures the charm from her Pulitzer-winning novel. This one is simply a rough draft. If you must know about it, but the summary.
You can understand why her editor asked her to revisit the story. I am not sure why all the hubbub is out there because of the Atticus character. It's fiction. I enjoyed the read and recommend it without reservation.
Purchased this for our summer road trip. Reece does a great job narrating the book. We listened to "to Kill A Mockingbird" on our last trip. We enjoyed it immensely. It is just as good as Harper's other book.
This is definitely an emotional book to read but it makes some really valid points about adapting to changing situations in life.<br/>Scout was always a hard-headed stubborn child.  Clearly she was still that way when she returned home from New York, at age 25, for this visit to her father and hometown.<br/>She had always taken the word and actions of her father as if he was god and she is dismayed and very angry to find that the conflict of the civil rights movement makes him attend meetings and consort with people whose actions she doesn't agree with.<br/>It is her way to plunge headlong into loud vocal battle against things she disagrees with.  It takes hard lessons to make her understand that that can make the situation worse.<br/>Her father's plan of "go set a watchman" clearly means if you know what your "enemies" are up to you have a chance to manipulate a calmer response or stop violence before it goes to far.  If not, you know who the perpetrators are to proceed within the law.<br/>I can relate to the concept of Scout being "color blind".  I hadn't realized it until reading this book but perhaps that's part of my problem, too.  I just don't understand why people hate each other for any reason.
Wish it was longer -ended abruptly -seems like it's missing like the other half.  Was good to get it touch with scout  again! I hope there's a sequel SOON!
I have not yet read "To Kill a Mockingbird", but now I most definately will. I have no doubt that Lee's first book is the better crafted one, but "Go Set a Watchman" has a lot going for it and can stand on it's own two legs. It's the story of how a young girl, Scout, painfully discovers that the racial relations of her hometown has worsend by far, and that her beloved father isn't quite the man she always thought him to be. There are some lovely scenes from Scouts childhood in this book, and some quite painful scenes where Scout confronts her family members. The story works very well, although I wished for a bit longer and a bit less dramatical ending. Nevertheless it was a very good read alltogether. I'm a bit sorry to see so many negaive reviews of this book in the media. Seems like almost all literature critics thinks that this books "destroys" "To Kill a Mockingbird". It does no such thing! But "Go Set a Watchman" is a darker and more complex book than "To Kill a Mockingbird". And therefore not as easy to love. In fact broken illusions are the main theme of "Go Set a Watchman", so its rather a good thing that it upsets so many.
If this was published before "To kill a mockingbird, she would never have been famous.  This book was very disappointing. Don't read it, not worth it.
At the start I was disappointed, but I realized the story was about an adult Scout coming to see the real world.  I am happy that this book was published.
I was looking forward to reading Go Set a Watchman but was left feeling a bit disappointed.  The book seem unorganized and confusing.  I did think the subject was interesting in the end and thought provoking.
I was a bit disappointed.  It read fairly well - a little melodramatic - the end felt forced and tacked on.  If this was the first book I read from this author i would probably have not bothered with another.
I am glad I read it. Could identify with her situation as we had black people who worked for us in the 50's and they were good people. Like Harper Lee I think I thought (as a child) that all were good people.
I was a little disappointed with this book.  It wasn't of the same quality as To Kill A Mockingbird.  I thought had spots that were funny and some were thought provoking.  It didnt live up to the hype for me.
The sections where Scout reflects on her childhood are strong but much of the book is didactic and preachy. Interesting from a literary perspective to see how a first draft could become an iconic best seller.
I was born and raised in North Carolina in the 50's and 60's, and know exactly what riled Scout. I escaped the south at the earliest opportunity and rarely have gone back because the racism, politics, states rights, and "heritage" hollering drives me absolutely crazy. This book made me look at those things in a more thoughtful light.  I still have the beliefs that I have, but I was taken with the way Harper Lee described so vividly (at least to me, as a child of the south at that time) the background of the way that part of the country reacted and evolved. Not in any way saying it can excuse past or present behavior, especially in this day and age, but I think it was a remarkable look at how the deep south reacted to those times.  I will buy and reread this book (and TKAM).<br/><br/>I think many people get upset at the thought of tarnishing Atticus because they still see Gregory Peck (and who would want to tarnish him?).  If you can get the movie out of your head while you read the book, I think you will come to know Atticus as the person he really was in those difficult times. Please don't decide to bypass this book because of your feelings for the TKAM characters.
I had hoped that it would be as good or better than "To Kill a Mockingbird" but it was not good at all. I read the whole book although thought of quitting many times. It was slow and not good at all.
Not as well-written as To Kill a Mockingbird and that is not really surprising since Go Set a Watchman was actually her first novel.  Enjoyed learning what happened after Scout grew up and revisited Maycomb.
I enjoyed it. I reread To Kill a Mocking Bird first and then Go Set a Watchman. It was very meaningful for her time as well as the present. I especially enjoyed the playback of the games the children played.
"To kill the Mockingbird" is one of my favorite books. "Go set a Watchman" also by Harper Lee is beautifully written, historically interesting, but in my opinion to self absorbed and tedius.
I expected more from this book.  I admire the actual writing style.  I thought the main character "Scout" was very immature but the characters were exactly what I would have expected for the period.
Couldn't be sure where this was going.  Parts of this book made me wonder if the entire book was written by Harper Lee.  Some of the revelations appear a bit off compared to "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Interesting turn of events, and Scout gets extremely upset--which goes on and on--but  her tirade brings us to the real reason for her family and townspeople doing what they do, and it makes a lot of sense.
I was hesitant in reading it , with all the press coverage. But on the recomendation of my son, I'm glad I did. It is wonderful and beautifully written.
I very rarely want to destroy books. It's not because Atticus Finch is a racist in the book, but because the whole book is far more accepting and reluctant about racism that should be accepted in modern society. I understand this book was written in the late 1950s and that Go Set A Watchman's outlook on these topics would have seen progressive for that time, but for today and for the author that wrote To Kill A Mockingbird, they are a barbaric reflection of the time and the author.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone who enjoyed To Kill A Mockingbird to never, ever read this book. Not for what it does to Atticus, but for what it does to Harper Lee.
i have to say, it was VERY powerful. i have never read "mockingbird" before so i bought it and this before it came out in pre-order. i can see why she released mockingbird first. you really need to read it before reading this one. but it will be worth the effort.<br/>SPOILER ALERT:----<br/> one theme which was the focus of mockingbird was "you can't understand someone till you see things from their point of view". in watchman, the reader as Scout, becomes the outsider, observing two separate groups of people in the 1950's jim crow south. how they react to one another and even to her shock react to her. add to this the loss of innocence and the full flaws of her father which come to light. i think this book was extremely unexpected, which is what will make it a legend. it could not come at a better time in American social history with the problem of racial discrimination  in america today, with protests and riots over the mistreatment of african americans and the law. and also the issue of the the confederate flag as a symbol. this book shines a blinding light on the fallacy of that mindset, and exposes it's underbelly. this was a magnificent book.
The book is about becoming your own person, and with that, being secure enough to accept those you love, flaws and all.<br/><br/>I found the dialogue witty. Harper Lee has a razor-sharp sense of humor.
This book was only OK compared with To kill a mockingbird.  Lots of sections were almost identical between the books which I read one after the other.  Character development could have been a lot better.
OK if she really wrote it.
I couldn't even finish it.
Not at all what i expected
WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ALL.
Slow, not enlightening....
Not as good as anticapated
I was somewhat disappointed,  over all it was a writing that skipped around too much.  Not hard to follow,but I can see why it was rejected at first.
Interesting, but I'm glad that she took her editor's advice and rewrote the book from the child's perspective!  "Watchman" would have bombed where in "Mockingbird" she created a classic.
Huge disappointment
Great read.  period
Being from the South I must say I feel the story is typical of of most Southern born and bred young women and men who have left the South for an education in the North. Young folks go off and achieve a sense of sophistiication and worldliness that makes their Southern counterparts seem diminished in their Southern ways and education. Also it is SO easy to be judgmental of your elders and friends you left behind in your teens when you you encounter them again when are thirty years of age.<br/><br/>The townsfolks and  Atticus Finch never changed. The same predjudices where always there, but seldom overt. Most folks are basically good and decent and know right from wrong. The townsfolks predjudices are a result of their fear of the unknown and of ther changing social times .Scout Changed and her judgement of her hometown was extreme. Scout had the benifit and had the opportunity of a completely different social view point of our changing social structure that her hometown could have possibly experienced. No matter how close they had followed the changing times, their geographical location had not changed. Thus their opinion couldn't change.
I did not finish this book, just not interested in it.  I so enjoyed Too Kill a Mockingbird is the reason I purchased it.  I would not recommend it.
The author switches between the past and the present, which was confusing at first.  I enjoyed reading this novel and love how it all ties together.
The first of the book read like a teen novel, however as I got into the book it improved.  Maybe the improvement came because I talked to an instructor who guided me to a new way of Loki g at the book.
The book was nostalgic as far as going home to a small town after living in a big city.  The point of the story is taken for granted today (at least for me) but wan't at the time the story was written.
One minute I was laughing as Scout was remembering an incident from her childhood and then the reality of segregation slapped me in the face. What a wonderful writer! I wish she had written more books!
Would have given it 5 stars but the characters weren't as developed as To Kill A Mockingbird. Still an enjoyable read - and had tears towards the end, when she realized she'd have to "grow up".
A very rough first draft of a novel Harper Lee and her sister never wanted published. Her sister passed away, and "by magic" this manuscript appears--and by "novel" I am being generous--some passages seem taken directly from journal scribblings, some passages come directly from To Kill a Mockingbird, some parts make no sense at all. No editing as been done, it's reported, and it certainly shows. None of our favorite characters appear: no Boo, no Jem, no Dill, and no Calpurnia, and Tom was acquitted. It is an immature work, will probably set back any forward motion on the dialogue of race, and there is no reason for this to exist other than for the publisher to make a lot of money.<br/><br/>Harper Lee is more Boor Radley than Scout these days, and by publishing this pile of scribblings, they have killed the mockingbird!
It seems to be the book she wanted to write if the publishers had no concern for the politics of the day and the world situation at the time. Is it as good as her masterpiece, NO but interesting read.
Perhaps because of the prepublication hype I was expecting more.  Clearly written at a different time than "Mockingbird"----sequence of events not the same.  Some disappointment in characters.
I just read "To Kill a Mockingbird" for the first time (and still haven't seen the movie). I found it a compelling, charming piece of storytelling - not quite the Great American Novel it's been called - but highly impressive, especially for a "first novel." But I'm finding Harper Lee's real first novel, "Go Set a Watchman," even more interesting. And this is because its two main characters - Jean Louise (formerly called Scout) and her father, Atticus - are seen in a more complex light than in "Mockingbird." And its central theme - a young woman's shattering loss of innocence - strikes me as a more dramatic subject than the rather melodramatically obvious concerns of "Mockingbird." The Lippincott editor was right in urging Lee to flesh out the childhood details for "Mockingbird" But she was wrong not to have encouraged Lee to take another look at the darker "Watchman" and enrich some of its patchy moments. Still, it's a finely written, passionately felt book, as is, and read together, the two novels come closer to true classic status than "Mockingbird" did on its own.
It must have taken the world's greatest editor to see "Mockingbird" somewhere in this unedited mess.<br/>My first thought was that this is a really, really, lousy book.  My second opinion (after finishing it),  was that it would probably be a suitable book for an intelligent adolescent girl, (one who had never read Mockingbird) away from her Nancy Drew.<br/>IMO it should not have been published except as a curiosity on novel writing research.
This was not my favorite book.  It had a couple of cute stories (pregnancy and falsies!), but that's about it.  It's a good thing see published To Kill A Mockingbird first.  Just my opinion, however.
I thought the first half of the book was much more engaging than the second. It got sermony/speechy as it went on and I got bored. In the beginning, some of the wit and color of Harper Lee showed up.
I'd heard mixed reviews so I tried to go into it without expectations of it picking up where TKAM ended, simply as a stand alone story.  I think it's because of this that I enjoyed the story so much.
Good read.  A more racially realistic 1950s sequel to Mockingbird.  Still love Mockingbird.  Still love the Atticus the Mockingbird lawyer, although considerably diminished as a lawyer in Watchman...
This is not To Kill a Mockingbird.  It's a different story.  It's about the coming of age of a woman who was Scout in the first book.  It is sweet in places, brings back warm memories of the time when Scout and Jem and their friends roamed Maycomb, Alabama, and It gives the reader scant glimpses of those children as adults.  The importance of this novel is that it contrasts the characters from the time of Mockingbird with themselves several years later.  It shows us how Scout sees Maycomb with the eyes of someone who has left the town and returns only to visit her Father and family.  There are wonderful characters, in Scout's family, who are new or expanded in this book.  Her father's brother and sister are perfect and bring fresh dialog to the story.<br/><br/>As you read the first half of this novel you will reminisce, along with Scout, about her early years when she was still at home with Atticus and Jem.  At some point, the story line then takes a darker view of people of Maycomb.  When that happens you will likely struggle to understand if anything has changed since the trial of Tom Robinson and the death of Bob Ewell.
Though not nearly as good as To Kill A Mockingbird, it is eminently readable. The majority of the critics fall into two camps, those who tell you that you should be critical of the book because a supposedly heroic character has turned out to be a "monster," and those that tell you they don't like the activities surrounding its publication. Most of these critics are blowhards who have not read the book themselves. As to the first suggestion, if there was any hero in the first published novel, it was Scout who revealed all to us, and potentially Boo Radley who rescued Scout from certain peril. Furthermore, the ultimate status of other characters still living at the time Go Set A Watchman are ambiguous at best, and a complicated ethos is wrangled between competing factions for a full two chapters near the end. As to the second suggestion, in none of the hundreds of books I have read in my lifetime, have I ever felt it necessary to ask the question, "Cui bono?" so why should I begin now, because some dilettante with a blog spiels a rant, and then that rant goes viral with bunch of copycats? Not on your tintype.
Pretty mundane for Happer Lee: a decent coming of age story but a let down for those who admire Aticus.  Interesting to see that this was the first story and wonder how she journeyed to the second
Story line was not clear.
Did not enjoy the book !!
Read Mockingbird instead.
Not especially memorable.
NOT quite up to the hipe.
I hope Harper enjoys all the money she made from this pitiful mess. you have to ask yourself was it worth it... die rich or die an icon... hmmm
I thought I would give Harper Lee another chance and even reread her first book published again before reading this one.  Ah, I am still not too impressed with her writing.  But it is an OK read.
Since To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest novels ever, I had to read Go Set a Watchman immediately. In short, Harper Lee got excellent advice from her first editor to revise extensively.
Very interesting politically.  I'm also enthralled with the characters, who I came to love in 'mockingbird.'  Their interesting dynamics leave me thinking about them after I've set the book down.
Excellent story with good description of the hardships and thoughts of the times. Very good expansion of the person behind the man, Atticus.
A little disappointing. I thought is rambled and wasted a lot of time getting to the point. But I love how Harper Lee writes, he descriotions of growing up in the South are right on the mark.
Excellent! And very appropriate for all that's going on in the US regarding racism and racial violence. We think we've come a long way, but not really. I loved this book. I read it in 3 days.
You can tell this was written earlier in Harper Lee's career.  Her literary voice was not fully developed but there were some glimpses of the writer she would become.  I had read about the controversy that Atticus had become a racist.  There is an explanation provided for the things he did later in life.  Did it justify his actions?  Perhaps.  I think Uncle Jack was the best character in the book.  His wisdom and compassion helped Scout reconcile her differences with her father.  He provides the voice of reason that Atticus had in To Kill A Mockingbird.<br/><br/>My one question is what are the duties of the editor?  Is he/she only there to correct tense, spelling and punctuation?  I'm wondering why the events that occurred in To Kill a Mockingbird and referred to in Go Set A Watchman were not amended so that the facts coincided.  Maybe that's not the job of the editor.  But when three major facts are inconsistent, it makes me wonder why they weren't changed.  Perhaps this is why Harper Lee never tried to have this book published after the success of To Kill A Mockingbird.
No one in book club really enjoyed this book and we all really were looking forward to reading it,  It was ok but not really much of a plot
I enjoyed the book very much. i found it a coming of age story for Scout. Those were very different times. i found no fault with the story.
Don't be put off by negative reviews - Aticus is not racist in this book, but he is certainly a man of his times.  Best of all reading Go set a Watchman made me reread To kill a Mockingbird.
Perhaps it is the knowledge that "Watchman" was written before "Mockingbird" but it seems quit evident that Harper's ability as a writer improved greatly from novel to novel.
Didn't think I would, but I liked it!  There were some deep issues that were addressed, and I thought it had merit.  Maybe not on the scale as "Mocking Bird", but still, a good read.
Not as good a book as "To KIll a Mockingbird" - definitely the poor relation. !!! Not quite as bad as some reviewers made out . Quite enjoyed the book but a brillaint book it is not.
I feel manipulated!  No wonder Harper Lee elected early on not to publish another book.  As it is, I cannot believe that if she were fully cognizant that she would have chosen to publish this book now.  While some of the parts where she is a young girl are enjoyable, the discovery that her father is a bigot and the subsequent sermonizing as he attempts to justify the validity of his views are beyond awful.<br/><br/>This book is a total waste of money.  In today's climate of racial unrest, this book should be considered a hate crime in itself.  AWFUL!!!!
Excellent and thought provoking, this novel was hard to put down.  There is controversy as to when this book was actually written but the setting is about 15 years after the events in To Kill a Mockingbird.  There is controversy in the press regarding claims that Atticus (the hero of the Mockingbird) is a racist.  I believe that those claims are mistaken and that those making them do not read deeply and especially do not understand the South.<br/><br/>As mid-twenties Jean Louise aka Scout makes her annual vacation visit home, she is confronted with the many changes happening in her hometown of the 1960s.  She tries to understand the ways in which the people she grew up with are changing in response to efforts of the NAACP and others.  She has an intense time finally coming to grips with herself, her father and her home.  Essentially, she finally grows up.  In the process, the thoughtful reader is forced to view their own views of racism and Southern cultural realities.  This book will stay with you a long time if you care about these issues.
There is no question that Harper Lee's editor was wise not to publish this when it was written. I lived in that time, and the book would have been considered inflammatory, perhaps even subversive. It certainly would have offended a lot of people...who needed and deserved to be offended, but then To Kill a Mockingbird might never have gained the following it did. To those who are shocked at what they perceive as a chnage in Atticus, I say it was not Atticus who changed; he was always a creature of his time.  What's different is that, in TKAM, Lee successfully traveled back emotionally and saw Atticus through the eyes of the child she had been, while in Go Set a Watchman, she sees him as he is and has always been. It is she who is the odd duck for her time. The ending is a bit abrupt. It's really too bad that it wasn't published until it was too late for her to edit and revise it from a more mature perspective.  Nonetheless, it's a magnificent book. Its flaws are merely cosmetic. I sat in a public place and cried as I read.  It was that real.
I loved this book. It's now one of my favorite novels of all time, alongside Charlotte's Web and The House of Mirth. From the first page I was drawn into the life and world of Jean Louise (Scout). I was laughing, savoring, I didn't want the book to end. It was not a first draft. It moved flawlessly from one scene to another. The flashbacks were integrated well. Harper Lee is a master story teller, and she kept me with her throughout.<br/><br/>I don't think I have read Mockingbird, but from what I hear, it romanticizes Atticus Fitch. This novel still displays his good qualities, his human flaws and complexities as it did all the characters. I felt for each character. No portrait was spared, but they all came across as products of their unique experiences and point in history. Anyone who is so enamored of Mockingbird that they skip this novel is missing a real treat. Anyone interested in Civil Rights, history, southern culture, and a story of coming of age and becoming one's own person, will enjoy this novel. I am so glad it was published.
If I had not read "To Kill a Mockingbird" first, I may have enjoyed this book more.  The characters did not seem true to their later lives as portrayed in "Mockingbird."
Interesting. The writing was a bit uneven. I can see why the editors encouraged her to rewrite having Scout be a child. The best parts were Jean Louise's recollections of her childhood.
The novel has lots of the southern humor and charm from the beginning.  However, the last quarter seemed forced and whiney.  Never thought of Scout that way.  The majority was enjoyably
Sequels never quite match the original and this one was up against a classic. Nonetheless a worthwhile read. Great insights into the "Southern" way of life and vexing questions.
I knew this book wouldn't be as good as To Kill A Mockingbird but I was hopeful it would be on somewhat of the same calibre.  It started off interestingly enough but quickly lost steam.
this was a quick and enjoyable read.  I was a little disappointed in the ending as it did not seem related to the theme of the book. It was fun just to see what the first book was like.
Lack of editing showed.
I felt like I was reading a book that was written to justify segregation ........ This book would never have made it to the best seller lists if it were a first book by the author.
Not sure why they wanted to print this book.  I had no preconceived notions about Go Set A Watchman.  Harper Lee definitely improved as an author between this book and Mockingbird.
Very slow. Almost put it down several times.  Too many pages with nothing happening.  The last 20 pages were good, some profound thoughts, but the first 80% of the book was boring.
I was thrilled to have this opportunity to read more by Harper Lee. i loved the book because it filled in some of the gaps for me about Maycomb, the South, and the main characters.
I have read many of the professional reviews of this novel - the angst over the character’s from To Kill a Mockingbird - their changed social view, etc., and think after reading it that those reviewers did a disservice to the book and poisoned the well for many readers going into this.  If you are a reader that is open minded, can understand the deep south in the time in which this book was written - and see the true point of the book’s treatment of Scout(now Jean Louise), and Atticus - the broadening of the subject of racism to include the methodical study of the folks perpetuating the myths - and the need to find a politically savvy way to move the needle by being in the discussion rather than being outside the discussion - then you will have a fruitful journey through Go Set a Watchman.  If, like Scout, you are committed to your world view of Atticus from To Kill A Mockingbird, and cannot fathom his dimension shifting and changing in Go Set a Watchman - stick to biography, rather than commit to Fiction -
Very disappointed in the novel.  Was so looking forward to a novel similar 'To kill a mocking bird'.  Did not live up to the hype.
I read all of Go Set a Watchman today. As someone who has studied, taught and adored To Kill a Mockingbird, I was very worried that I would be extremely disappointed, especially after reading warnings about Atticus being a segregationist. Overall, I have mostly positive feelings toward this newly found work of Lee’s. As I discuss it here, I will try not to give too many specific plot details, since some of you may be planning on reading it, too.<br/><br/>First, I will address the title which piqued my curiosity when I first heard it many months ago. It’s from Isaiah 21:6 and just as God set Isaiah as a prophet and one to watch over Israel, this title speaks to the need for someone to serve as one who will truthfully declare what they see and serve as a sort of moral compass. Scout (Jean Louise) hears the preacher discuss this passage in church when she returns to visit Maycomb as an adult. Jean Louise later learns, with the help of her Uncle Jack, that she hadn’t fully developed her own con... Read more
Not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird...but good in its own way.  I know why it was not published when it was written, but I won't give that part of the story away.  Worth reading!
I think the book was very interesting, although you can't read unless you've read To Kill a Mockingbird. Also, the ending was disappointing, it doesn't seem anything was resolved.
A very well written and very interesting book, worthy of many more discussions.  I wonder what readers will think of the tale...
I'm glad I read this, but it's not one I would necessarily read multiple times, as with To Kill a Mockingbird. The plot and characters didn't seem as rich as I'd been expecting.
Mockingbird was so very powerful that almost ANY follow-up would seem drab. For me, this one seems to portray the southern culture and its impact on the towns citizens of color.
It read like it was written by some one other than Harper Lee.  Just did not sound like her voice.  I thought it could have been written by a ghost writer or even Truman Capote.
This book unveils the raw bigotry and cruel prejudice of an upstanding family to a child who grew up blinded to the reality of her own life and the loves of the people she loved
Not too exciting-but I'm glad I read it.  It brings a new light on the black slaves becoming free and the struggles that both black and white had<br/>and still reflected today.
Quite a surprise ending and with such a southern flavor. Those days of ladies with gloves and hats were really special. I remember my mom had one hat only and was so very proud!
A bit slow and dated.  Kept waiting for the "plot" to emerge.  Still enjoyed the quick read.  It was nice to "catch up" with all the characters from Mockingbird.
Watchman comes from the same point of view as Mockingbird, but fails to have the interesting story plot.  It is more of a character study of previous characters as they all age.
The book is written in easy prose, but it is not a "page turner." I generally had no quibbles about putting the book down mid-chapter. At least two characters seem to step out-of-character in extended dialogue which seemed to me to deliver a message that had to be heard, but that wouldn't fit neatly within the confines of the book. (Have you ever finished a term paper the morning is was due?)<br/>As the book makes vividly clear, everyone in the deep South — and I mean everyone of every race — over the age of 50 has been exposed to racism. It is ugly. However, exposure to racism does not make one a racist.<br/>I will applaud Ms. Lee for exposing key characters for what they are. By that I mean human beings, far from perfect in thought and deed. Relationships, even familial, are messy at best and disappointments abound within the storyline and in real life. And watching Scout find her own way, her own identity separate and apart from Maycomb, Alabama and her father was interesting.
I liked the storyline and was a fast read.  Up until the end when Dr Finch slapped Scout, I found his character hard to follow. I wish the story left Hank in a better light.
you can tell this was Harper Lee's first book because the characters aren't as well drawn out as her second book. Also the storyline got a little confusing by jumping around
What a disappointment!
A huge disappointment,
A little disappointing
Lessons to be learned.
A really great book to see how a small town Southern young woman reacts to the racist culture of her home town after living in New York.  I read a dozen or more reviews before reading the book.  As a small town man myself, though born in the Midwest, I have some idea of what it feels like to come home after living in Chicago, then Rome, Papua New Guinea, and back to Belle Plaine.  She didn't fit in, and she hadn't seen the depths of her father's identification with the South of the "Lost Cause" myth, but the Atticus of both books is one person, and the Calpurnia of "Go Set a Watchman" is a woman who is now dealing with Scout as woman-to-woman.  The story drags a bit, sure, but I think Harper Lee has captured Jean Louise Finch's transition to adulthood's disappointments in an engaging story.  My home town wasn't beset with the racism of Maycomb, but it took some getting used to.  Fancy pants reviewers with no idea about small towns need to get real.
As a HUGE fan of Harper Lee and "To Kill A Mockingbird" I looked forward to reading this "lost" novel.  Although it is certainly not as good a story as her first book, it depicts a side of Southern culture and mentality during the civil rights movement that is not often brought out.  Good people who were not radical KKK members, but were not ready for true equality.<br/>Calpurnia's character was not developed as well as I would have liked.  Aunt Zandra's character as the typical southern matriarch was well developed and believable.  Why did Jem die?  The character of Henry is weak and I wanted to know more about Dill.  The uncle is the strongest character in the book and the dialogue between he and Scout was impressive.<br/>The last quarter of the book was the best, and when I finished I wanted more.  It's hard to believe that this was written before Mockingbird.<br/>That being said, I finished the book in a day and would recommend it to others.
I could not get into this book.  After looking forward to reading it, I was disappointed.  I could hardly wait to finish it.
Boring & hard to follow. Nothing like Mockingbird. Thought it was rather confusing and I would be reluctant to recommend it.
Anyone who likes Harper Lee's writing should read this book.  The writing is wonderful.  The story isn't as tight as To Kill a Mockingbird but it is still a wonderful read.
I love the way Harper Lee writes, but it was somewhat disappointing  at the end of the book. It's like it was cut short , left me wanting for a few more "resolves".
I liked it a  lot and did not think I would after the not so good reviews it was given.  Characters were well developed by the author. The end was surprising but well done.
There were quotes I loved in the book, I loved seeing scout again as a woman, grown. However I found it hard to follow and stay with at times....but overall, enjoyed it....
It is a bit hard to get in to. I can understand why the publishers wanted her to write Scouts story in early years.<br/>To Kill A Mockingbird is just impossible to top....
very disappointed.  Started out very slow, hard to get into.  Only finished because I felt compelled to.  Not a nice story.
It was an enjoyable read, but it isn't "To Kill A Mockingbird."  Harper Lee would have had to reach further to write another classic and this one misses that spot.
While Harper Lee's writing is wonderful, this book was painful to read.  a book for another time in history---I see why the publishers preferred Mockingbird over this one.
A first draft for Mockingbird, her editor was right to tell her to redo it as the story of the children who are adults here. Best part of this is a short childhood memoir.
Interesting story when you take it for what it is. This is not a sequel to Mockingbird, but rather a draft that was not published that was later reworked into Mockingbird.
Glad I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird prior to this book. No comparison on how the characters were developed. TKAM is much better more insightful and much more engaging
I thought I wasn't going to like this book because of racist reviews that I had read. I loved it. It was so down to earth and probably what life was like in the south.
Before you read Go Set a Watchman I highly suggest that you examine your motives. If you wish to revisit Atticus Finch and the people of Maycomb, then I advise you to reread To Kill a Mockingbird. If you wish to see a deeper set of characters and be introduced to some surprising view points then read Harper Lee's latest.<br/>Keep in mind once you begin reading her knewly published novel that it is not your average written work. This novel was created from a rough draft of what would become To Kill A Mockingbird, this was not written specifically as a novel unto itself. You may find the flow and editing of the novel off putting at times, but one must remember that this novel should not be read as an exercise in literary criticism, but a chance to see what an author intended a group of beloved characters to develop into.<br/>If you can see past a few flaws, then you are in for a wonderful last glimpse at some classic characters.
I read bad after bad review, and I know someone's personal opinion may differ. The first half was slow and knowing the fact it was a quick read was the only thing that kept me going.<br/>The second half or so, opened up and became quite good, and in the end I feel hopeful for society and my own personal and familial relationships.<br/>Having read this has not changed my mind about anything I already conceived myself, but rather, helped me understand others and gives me some hope for reconciling relationships, even if we have completely different opinions.<br/>My mom read it and said once her friend read it and they discussed, she felt like reading again with a new insight, I hope to have the same discussions and I think that's what it was all about.<br/>Little Scout has come of age and stepped out of her dream world and has to face it, will she run? You really want her to, but facing it is much more realistic and thoughtful.
Go Set a Watchman is the long-awaited successor to Harper Lee’s masterpiece, To Kill a Mockingbird. In it, we find Jean Louise as a New Yorker and young adult, “easy to look at and easy to be with most of the time, but…afflicted with a restlessness of spirit.” She must contend with her Aunt’s assertive manners and standards, and try to understand her uncle’s and her father’s small-town ethics through a new perspective. While Mockingbird showed us some definitions of societal and racial prejudices, Watchman forces us to watch heroes fall, to rediscover the beginnings of bigotry and prejudice, and to reassess survival in a small town, even if it means sacrificing part of yourself. With more controversial themes and conflicts than its predecessor, Go Set a Watchman is a book that will be heavily debated for decades to come.

I normally don't spend so much on books but the library waiting list was too long a wait until book club.<br/>We all agreed this book was a third the book MOCKINGBIRD was. Several people re read it before reading this book and said parts seem to be lifted from MOCKINGBIRD into WATCHMAN.<br/>In the first part of the book I felt like I was enjoying the sentences themselves but that they didn't add up to a meaty paragraph, if that makes sense. I liked the recollections of her childhood but it seemed odd to me that no mention was made of Scout's job, or social life in New York. I thought it interesting and sad that her family members felt her long time friend and possible fiancé was still considered trash despite all he had overcome and accomplished in his life.<br/>Reading this after the events in Ferguson, Baltimore and elsewhere this year made me sadder and more aware that small minds stay small, as this book clearly showed.
If I can describe this book in one word, it would be "deep". This book is so full of surprises and the overall moral of the story is so dark and pretty tragic. Here we follow Jean Louise Finch back to her hometown of Maycomb for her annual two week vacation. She is also keeping an eye on her aging father, Atticus, who is stricken with arthritis; however things aren't as happy-go-lucky as things normally are. Here Jean finds herself in the middle of the conflict where dark secrets are buried deep within her family. She is forced to rethink her whole life, because everyone has changed, or has she changed? We also see how she deals with the secrets she finds out about her beloved father, who basically symbolizes moral perfection. All-in-all this story is very intense. It is so upsetting to see characters that we all know and love from To Kill a Mocking Bird to change so drastically, but I highly recommend this book!
A fitting sequel to "Mockingbird" from a mature Scout's point of view. Now she can see her father through an adult's eyes, rather than a childhood hero-worshipping simplicity. It's the same writer, but a much deeper one than Lee projected of hereself in "Mockingbird." One can see why her editor convinced her to rewrite the portrayal of Atticus from Scout's childhood eyes. If Lee had published "Watchman" in 1960, she would have met the same fate as John Howard Griffin. The Deep South white population was not ready to be told who they really were as social beings at that time. One can only wonder if Lee waited until being near the end of her life to "discover" a "forgotten" first novel and slap some reality into her admirers. The drawn-out race and culture arguments in the last part of the book show a tremendous grasp of different perspectives, but could have used considerable pruning.
This book is so completely polar opposite "To Kill a Mockingbird," that it threw me off guard, and I haven't recovered. My opinion is still simmering on a back burner.  I have serious doubts that Ms. Lee intended for this to be published, very serious doubts.  While the lyrical writing style is beautiful, quintessential Lee, the very subtle plot makes the work feel more like a character study, perhaps an exercise to prepare for the writing of a major novel. Perhaps after Lee created the character of Atticus, she changed her mind about his basic essence. In reality, I've never seen a person with the saintly conscience that he portrayed in "TKAM" lose that strong character because of a cultural situation. This was disturbing to me. Additionally, the lack of subplots makes it seem more like a novella. I will be thinking about this for a long time, especially when compared to the highly episodic "TKAM."
I did not think this book had much of a story to tell.  The main theme was the relationship Scout had with her father rather than than the racial issues of that time.
If you don't think of Watchman as a sequel or prequel to Mockingbird, but a story of it's own, it's an okay read.  Very entertaining in parts, slow in other parts.
This book stimulates deep thinking. It was not a quick read since I was trying to sort out Scout's dilemma with her.
I had just finished "Mocking Bird" when "Watchman" comes out so I had to read it. The book should be billed as a sequel to "Mocking Bird".
I was very disappointed in this book. The writing was not nearly the standard of Ms Lee's other famous novel.  In my opinion, it should never have been published.
A compelling coming-of-age story that completes the transformation of young Scout from a starry-eyed girl to a woman who can think critically and now see clearly.
An interesting altho far inferior, sequel.  People seem to be concerned that this book exposes Atticus as the racist that he was, but this really shouldn't be a surprise.  The character of Atticus was a man devoted to defending the law of the land, regardless of who happened to be on the wrong side of the law.  There should never have been an expectation that he was anything other than bigoted - he was simply able to rise above that in order to do his job, defending the defenseless.  The character was a privileged, white, Southern male from many years ago.  While noble, Atticus was not perfect.  Other than that, Scout has grown up to be a rather boring adult and other interesting characters were unfortunately dispatched.  There was quite a bit of repetition from the first book, some almost verbatim.  Worth reading, but in my opinion, it is not a companion book to Lee's first (far superior) effort.
A disappointment. Totally unexpected from remembering "To Kill a Mocking Bird". I expected better! I wasn't impressed so didn't get past the 3rd chapter.
Since this was written before "To Kill A Mockingbird", she was still developing as a writer. I was disappointed but In all fairness this was a first work
I enjoyed this book but I liked To Kill a Mockingbird better. I thought To Kill a Mockingbird  had much more social commentary which sadly is still cogent today.
After Mockingbird, this was not as good, but interesting and good reading. The finding that an elderly lawyer in south Alabama favors segregation is not a shock.
I really enjoyed the book.  I learned a lot about Atticus Finch.  I now know why it is such a  controversial book.
I always wanted to know what happened to Scout and Jim. Like real life the magic and mystery of childhood ends. Adulthood forces  life's imperfections to light.
I was disappointed in this book.  I loved TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  I think the author would be humiliated to know that this HIDDEN manuscript had been published.
Mockingbird trumps this novel although book was enlightening--unfortunately the subject matter is still relevant today.  Going to re-read To Kill a Mockingbird.
interesting insight into the civil rights movement for the small Southern town, but overly cryptic in parts. Wonderful flashbacks though into Scout's childhood.
don't expect to kill a mockingbird. It's about changing views of people over time starting from childhood to being an adult, mixed with race views in the south.
There are a few passages in this book that are taken verbatim from Mockingbird. It's like listening to an old relative talk who tells the same story every time you see them. It's my impression that this was an alternate tale to Mockingbird, not necessarily meant to be a sequel. This must be the case as the trial depicted in Mockingbird has a different outcome in this book. This being the case, I think Mockingbird was the correct version to be chosen for publication and this could well have stayed stuck in a safe. Also, the shock over Atticus's behavior wouldn't have been as great if this were the book initially chosen, so this one doesn't work as well without the other. I don't think this book was really great but it was not horrible. Where Mockingbird relied on events to propel the story, this one is mainly driven by Scout's thoughts and inner turmoil. It's a much more interior story.
I ordered this book for a few reasons. Ms. Lee's first book is a favorite of mine and when I heard her second book (really her first written but unpublished) was being published finally I just had to read it. I had heard the rumors going around for years that she never published another book because she hadn't really written the first one and I thought I wanted to read this one and see how they compare. Well, I am pleased to report that the storytelling is the same exceptional quality. The same flowing, clean style as "To Kill a Mockingbird". I enjoyed it very much and look forward to some smart producer in Hollywood getting it to the movie screen! I highly recommend "Go Set a Watchman", even if you haven't read Ms. Lee's other book, but especially if you have. I also want to mention, I ordered the large print version of this book and it's been a real pleasure to read.
Maybe I was expecting more, but this story was closer to a novella than a novel.  Scout could have been more complete as a character.  It's not clear what she does in New York, for example, and does she like her work?  Her relationship with Henry isn't developed either.  Sometimes she acts as if marriage is certain, and other times not.  In the end, it doesn't seem to matter.  Her great debate with Atticus is really an adolescent tirade.  Her conversations with Uncle Jack can be confusing at times, and in the end, it's hard to tell where he stands on the big issue.  It's also really a stretch to see Atticus as the lawyer who saved Tom Robinson and endeared the black community in " Mockingbird."  I have to admit, I wouldn't have read this book if it weren't for "To Kill A Mickinbird," one of the great American novels, in my opinion.  My advice to others is " Don't bother to read it."
The story of Scout as an adult looking back on how she was raised and how racial issues had changed since she was a child. There really wasn't much of a story.
The story is outdated.  Disappointing in fact.  No comparison to its predecessor To Kill A Mockingbird. Everything about Go Set A Watchman pales by comparison.
The book focused to much on Scott's recollection of the past and not enough on Attus.  I did not enjoy it and it was a struggle for me to finish the bottle k.
So highly pre-advertised; the wait was not worth the read. It would have benefited from the extensive edits which made "To Kill a Mockingbird" strong.
Watchman is an ok read. It certainly isn't in the same league with "To Kill A Mockingbird". It is a slow starter but does pick up some toward the end.
Wasn't surprised, but understand how the *racist* description could be given to Atticus, altho I can see the dimensions of his beliefs due to his ancestry....
I was a little disappointed in this book! Interesting in so many ways!! I find it hard to believe this was actually written before " To Kill a Mockingbird" !!
A big disappointment
Slow and predictable
Just disappointed !!
Very disappointed in this book.  I think it was published because her other book. Not worth the time to read it.
This book was never meant to be published. Some greedy people to advantage of an older lady to make this happen.
An excellent analysis of the white southern culture at the time of the Civil  Rights movement. Very well written
Just got the CDs and have not finished them yet but I am entertained with snapshots of Scout's<br/>family life.
I didn't expect this book to be as good a read as "To Kill a Mockingbird" and I was not disappointed.  Ms. Lee has an annoying habit of employing sentence structure that is sometimes difficult to follow.  She knows what she wants to convey, but to me, over-using the Southern vernacular was tiresome.  She either has a tremendous vocabulary or she had a thesaurus handy.  I must admit, it kept me on my toes trying to understand what she was describing.  If you loved Scout, be prepared to be disappointed in her as a grown woman.  Everyone was so afraid of Aticus being a bigot in this book as opposed to the fair-minded, southern intellect we all love, but that's not I found at all.  I won't say more here.  Read the book.  It's absolutely worth your time and investment.  Thank goodness "Mockingbird" was published first or it might not have been published at all.
This isn't shocking, or disappointing as to the revelations about Atticus Finch, who is, after all, a fictional character. It's just not very good. I stopped several times while reading it to read other books. I finally finished this one (it's not very long) and my reaction was to be glad I was done with it.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes are charming in Harper Lee fashion, but the meat of the book, the dialogues between Scout and her father and uncle, are labored polemics, not enlightening, not particularly interesting. It seems odd that this would be a first draft for TKAM because it refers to beloved characters in a way that would be of no interest to anyone not familiar with them from TKAM.<br/><br/>I wish this had stayed "undiscovered" but it doesn't dim my appreciation for "To Kill A Mockingbird" which is still one of my favorite books of all time.
A terrible disservice was done to Ms. Lee with the publication of this novel.  It paints all of the white characters as bigots, including Scout herself (the personification of Ms. Lee in the novel).  We know from "To Kill a Mockingbird" that Ms. Lee's "bigotry of low expectation" matured from the time of writing this novel to the time of her masterpiece.  What a shame to have this one dimensional freshman work as her legacy.
Glad I read it.  It would not have been as enjoyable if it had preceded To Kill a Mockingbird.  Knowing the characters made it an enjoyable visit to Maycomb.
I get the reactions of Scout in context of the times, but her reactions could have been more nuanced. And Hank and Aticus were just flat and one-dimensional.
This is no "To Kill a Mockingbird"!  The book nor characters grab you at first but by its end, I found it somewhat interesting especially Uncle Jack.
Took forever to get to the point and the ending was a cop out.  Found the book rather boring.  Loved To Kill a Mockingbird.  Very disappointed with this one.
This was delivered as a gift to somebody else's Kindle by amazon. For some reason I keep getting reminders to review this gift that I've never seen or read..
I really liked the book.  Some parts seemed long and I skipped thru but the book made me think, and that is always good.  Challenged my today's social issues
As a reader who adored Harper Lee's To Catch a Mockingbird, I was utterly disappointed with this book. In fact, after a few chapters, I decided to set it aside and try reading it again after a few weeks.  I couldn't get my head around an aged and forgetful Atticus Finch,  a smug Scout and the death of her brother. The fact that the movie To Kill a Mockingbird is still at the top of my movie favourites, doesn't help since I can still visualise Gregory Peck and others who were so well cast for their roles. This version of Macon County  with these new "old" characters simply doesn't get my attention as a reader.
Just finished this beautifully written novel, no, not novel, this work of literature. During the first half of it I couldn't imagine what all the controversy was about, although I had deliberately ignored details until I read it for myself. Her writing is wonderful, lyrical and well crafted. I won't comment on the controversial topic of the work except to say that I'm afraid some people will only take out of it the parts that support their biased views they already have. But it will insight many interesting and philosophical discussions in many a classroom and book club for years to come.<br/><br/>Reese Witherspoon does a fantastic job with the audible audio book, and I highly recommend listening to the book that way. It is then a performance that takes on greater meaning with her into nations of the characters, and will make the funny parts even more enjoyable.
For any long-time fan of To Kill a Mockingbird, any further glimpse into the lives of the Finches of Maycomb, Alabama was a welcome site. I found Watchman to be exactly what it was - a writer's first attempt into the story she wanted to tell which had been based on events from her own life. I found a grown-up Scout much as I imagined the little girl from Mockingbird would have developed. Here we get insight into the life of the South in the 1950's and the struggles an independently minded young female of that era sometimes had to face. The really intriguing part for me was finding the journey Harper Lee went through to craft the masterpiece that became Mockingbird. Those who will struggle with what has already been described as a "racist" Atticus haven't taken the time to understand what they are reading in the first place. Atticus didn't change; Lee did.
Disappointing.
As a huge fan of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' I found this story uninteresting...but I did finish to the end...definitely a disappointment I'm very sorry to say.
I hear a different tone that influenced my mood while reading this book!  The mood was not comfortable and, therefore, my love for this book was diminished.
It was interesting, knowing the history behind the book.  But it seemed somewhat incongruent with To Kill a Mockingbird and lacks the polish, in my opinion.
Interesting and disturbing read. I was disappointed in some of it-- confusing in parts, and rambling.  Brings up the question, " did  Lee write it"?
Not "To Kill A Mockingbird" . Still it says a lot about the deep south in the 40s-50s. Broke my heart that Atticus was a mere frail man of his time.
I was a little disappointed as I had hoped for a "happily ever after" ending.  Otherwise the book was "okay".  Not as good as it's prequel.
Much of the book was copied word for word from the original "To Kill a Mockingbird". The writing did not flow well. I was disappointed in the book.
I loved this book. I love the way she writes, and how she tells the true story of how people feel. You can agree to disagree especially with those you love
Growing up, accepting the world in which your view is so narrow,your blinded by its comfort, it's love, you can't possibly know it's truths...that is exactly what Scout learns on a return to her beloved home town. This is a powerful story...perhaps what every young person needs to learn about their roots. Bias, racism,territorial superiority..in good time we all must figure out where we stand. Worth every, second, minute, hour. It's as important today as any other time in our history..but not just because of racial tension but because we need to know ourselves first before we can accept others. A must read.
Loved knowing adult Scout.  And I don't think Atticus was "ruined," I think he was shown to be human.
It just sort of ended w/out much understanding what Scout decided about her town, home, father, or friends.<br/>Seems as though this book was unfinished.
Good story that holds your attention.  However, To Kill a Mockingbird will always be the better novel, a true, forever classic.  I like my Atticus heroic.
A little disappointed - the book is more about Scout's maturation than racial issues of the 1950's.  I'd give 5 stars for "To Kill A Mockingbird".
Ok, I'm no English teacher, writer, or journalist. Heck, this is the first book I've read in a year. I'm not going to go into some long spill using terminology that the common person can't understand . This review is for the 30-something year old that read Mockingbird in high school,enjoyed it so much, and thought GSAW would be worth the time. Having said that..... Don't waste your time on this book. Yea, there are several flashback scenes that I enjoyed and I actually LOL'd  but it just simply did not cut it.  Jean Louise was not even likeable in this book and I found that extremely disappointing.
If there was no TKAMB, this book would never have been published. Ridden with nostalgia, cliches, and under-developed characters.  Don't waste your time.
I love To Kill a Movkingbird and Harper Lee, but I just couldn't get into this book. I may try to finish it later but I'm reading the Poldark series now.
I found this book nowhere near "To Kill A Mocking Bird ".  It was slow and extremely boring to the point I could not read past the first quarter.
I enjoyed the book very much.  It was fun to read the continuing journey of Scout from "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Another great work by Harper Lee
It was a really good and easy read.  I guess I was disappointed in the content.  It is sad that such a wonderful author only wrote and published 2 books.
I'm glad I read the book.  Having read early reviews helped me put the "To Kill A Mockingbird" characters in perspective.  Not much of an ending.
Easy read; excellent depiction of growing up and the separation of parent / child thoughts. I enjoyed seeing Scout grown up and the evolution of Atticus.
If you read with an open mind and know anything about the deep south during this time period you better understand where Aticus and Hank are coming from.
A good story about coming of age and relying on your own conscience, not what you perceive as the appropriate conscience ascertained by emulating others.
This is not To Kill a Mockingbird and I understand why her editor back in the 1950's encouraged her to write a story from the point of view of Scout. That said, you will find this book to use the same wisecracking, humorous tone as Harper Lee used in the other book.  This was especially true in her description of stories from her childhood.  The characters are the same with the addition of a few members of her family.  There really is no plot as much as it is an account of Scout's vacation in Maycomb from New York City where she has lived since graduating from college. I didn't find the same criticisms of Atticus as many critics have. However, the story is more about what a person may face when they become an adult and learn a side of a parent they didn't know.  Worth the read as long as you don't expect an extension of To Kill a Mockingbird.
The characters are so patently one dimensional that no reader can relate to anyone's continuous whinning. Lee was correct in never wanting to let this edition come to light.  The Finch families emotional responses run from A to C from belly aching Scout, loving gruff uncle, tart aunt, and sweet ole boyfriend to e. Go back to New York City Scout where no one knows you or cares to know you. AS FOR YOUR PORTRAYAL OF ATTICUS AS A RACIST, THE EDITION BORDERS ON THE ABSURD.  I AM DELIGHTED I GOT THIS BOOK FROM OUR LOCAL LIBRARY SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY ANY MONEY FOR THIS MISAPPLICATION OF A LIMITED TALENT.  LET'S NOT FORGET IT WAS THE MOVIE THAT BROUGHT THE BOOK INTO FOCUS.  I THINK "WATCHMAN COULD MAKE A GOOD MOVIE IF IT WAS ANIMATED BY THE ICE AGE PEOPLE, WITH SCOUT BEING PORTRAYED BY AS A  SPONGE, HER UNCLE BY A GRUFF TIGER, ETC, ETC.
Scout such a brat. I thought the book would be different. Great writing by the author. To bad Gregory Peck is not alive so another movie could be made.
Despite internet outrage, I found book in keeping with Mockingbird. It just added depth to the characters. Liked the book, but Mockingbird still rules.
The hardcover is quite nice but the pages are very frayed around the edges. It looks like someone ripped the pages out one by one before assembling it.
This book was a disappointment to me, but in reality, how can anything compare with To Kill a Mockingbird.  The last chapter of this book was the best.
Loved this book --- liked it even more than To Kill A Mockingbird and that one is excellent.  The ending was incredible and should be read by everyone.
Quite disappointing
Very disappointing.
I was disappointed.
Very slow moving...
What's not to love?
A pointless effort by a good writer. Just remember that this was a rejected manuscript - that says it all.
Good reading with a good lesson. Standing up for what one believes regardless of what the majority thinks.
Expectations were high I admit after reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" many years ago. Sadly, I was disappointed in "Go Set a Watchman."
The first half of the book was more filling in of details from To Kill A Mockingbird.  The rehashing of the first book I found a bit stale.  At about the halfway point, it started to get better.  It was not until near the end of the book that I made my decision on whether Atticus was a racist or not.  I do not recall Uncle Jack (Dr. Finch) in the first book but he definitely had a unique way of getting Jean Louise (Scout) to give serious consideration as to whether Atticus was racist or not.  I don't like the last method he used to get Jean Louise to come down to earth and be realistic.  Uncle Jack reveals who the secret love of his life was and the outcome of that relationship.  I was saddened to hear of the passing of her brother Jem.  I am being vague on the specific details so as not to ruin the book for future readers.
I couldn't put it down.  It was wonderful.  I am now going to read "To Kill a Mockingbird" again!
This book was totally far from what I loved in To kill a Mockingbird and disappointing, very sad and bad.
This is a great book because it allows lovers of to kill a mockingbird to see that life is not so simple.
it was okay  .i was kind of disheartened some  as after reading her to Kill a Mocking bird was very different but a very good southern writer she is.
The writing is awkward, the characters unpleasant, the plot disconnected and the insights old news. Its only value is as a comparison to Mockingbird.
Not a classic but didn't expect that. Entertaining look at the Deep South lifestyle and perspective at that time even though it's not what I believe.
To Kill a Mockingbird is difficult to beat and will remain my favorite book of all time. Go Set a Watchman  leaves me with many unanswered questions.
Disappointing story.  If I had read this book before reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" I would never have read "To Kill a Mockingbird".
I felt that the publisher was probably right to send Harper Lee in a different direction. I believe that this book was published with no real editing or polishing done to the manuscript. It probably would have been better if it had been, after all Ms. Lee spent several years getting "Mockingbird" ready. The fact that Atticus turned out to be a gentleman bigot wasn't that upsetting. I've come to believe that books about the "white savior" are just lulling us into complacency about our racial attitudes. I've also come to believe that everyone (including me) has racist feelings and it's time we started to acknowledge those feelings and address them, in an effort to eliminate them. This may be the great benefit of "Go Set A Watchman". We lose Atticus but we gain insight into our deepest selves.
There will never be another To Kill a Mockingbird. I expected too much from this book. It was a good read but not in the league of it's predecessor.
A perfect sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird. I just want there to be more. Definitely one of my favorites.
I really really really wanted to love this book. Let me start by saying "To Kill a Mockingbird" is my favorite novel of all time. I have read it yearly for decades. What I loved about "Watchman" was its familiar tone and prosaic style. Ms. Lee's writing is flawless as ever, and it was a nearly-physical pleasure to be re-immersed in her world. What it lacked was a viable storyline. Really, it's a book about nothing. The resolution of a misunderstanding, and bridging the gap between points of view. Okay, fine - but nothing happened.I waited for this volume with 'bated breath, but in the final analysis, it was a letdown. I would still say - it's a worthwhile read, as it undeniably handles some exquisitely painful and timely themes, but don't expect it to have the same impact as "Mockingbird."
A beautifully intellectual masterpiece contrasted by a simplistic elegance, "Go Set a Watchman" is every bit a reader's treasure as "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Once again, Harper Lee pushes the limits of human consciousness and reasoning in a way that is bold, yet innocent.  I should only hope to parent with an unconditional open heart the likes of Atticus Finch and go about exploring the world with the curios and questioning mind of Jean-Louis Finch.  Thank you, Harper Lee, for making the world a better place with these two prolific characters, once again.
It was not "To Kill a Mockingbird".  In fact, had to really push to finish.  Would not recommend, except if you are satisfying a curiosity.
I don't want to give anything away but I hated reading one of her beloved characters from To Kill a Mockingbird was dead in the very first chapter!
Everything falls short of "To Kill A Mockingbird" and this book is upsetting for lovers of that books characters.  But still a worthy read.
"Go Set a Watchman "wasn't as good as I expected.  " To Kill a Mockingbird" was such a good novel it would be difficult to beat it.
I know it's been called a "prequel" in the sense that it was written before Mockingbird, but the time period is some 15 after Mocking Bird.
A little disappointing after "To Kill a Mockiingbird". Not much of a story & somewhat rambling.
Poorly written---and not well edited---so much so I could not finish it!  Does Harper Lee an injustice!
I found the book charming, very much the same wonderful style of To Kill a Mocking Bird.  It showed a family who love deeply and characters who tried their best to live according to their moral compass.  They all knew that prejudice was wrong but where at different places in their capacity of dealing with it.<br/><br/>I believe that the author decided not to publish this book was that she feared that readers would misunderstand what she was trying to say at the time it was written.  Some of the critiques I have read prove that she was right.  I don't see Atticus as a bigot.but rather as someone who is trying to do what is. "Right" but falling short to shed prejudice completely,  something his daughter has been able to do.<br/><br/>I would recommend this novel to readers who enjoyed Mockinbird.
Very disappointing  Too much rambling on with out making a lot of sense.
I could appreciate the story but at times I found it a bit tedious. I am not sure why it was so popular other than the Truman Capote relationship.
Please see my essay, "Facts, Fictiion, and Literary Ethnography: The Controversy Over Harper Lee's New/Old Novel," Society, Nov-Dec, 2015.
Lots of media hype around this book. Still enjoyed it and appreciate it for what it is. Would definitely recommend this and To Kill A Mockingbird!
I enjoyed most of it. Some of racial expressions were hard to read but I understand the time it was written. Some really funny stuff in it as well
This is an excellent book.  I didn't want to put it down.  It is now one of the books on my list of books everyone should have on their bookshelf.
It was good but not as good as I'd hoped.  It was had a lesson to learn and worth the read, but it had so many wasted pages on tangential stories.
If you are a fan of to Kill a Mockingbird  and the way Harper Lee writes then you will love this book.
A for time growing up in the south, for people and the country. Very insightful from a southern woman.
Not at all what I was hoping for.  I kept waiting for the plot to develop - I don't think it ever did.
First hundred pages were boring but after that the story came together. A lot of history and interesting facts but they are deep in the storyline
As the author herself stated, the writing is not particularly good. It does contain some glimpses of "Mockingbird" humor and sensitivity.
I read this for book club, the discussion was more interesting than the book. The conclusion was ambiguous but dramatic. We were glad we read it.
Since I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird" I was excited to read this new novel. However, my anticipation did not match up to my expectations.
I came to this with expectations not of a competitor to Mockingbird but to see what else this author could come up with...and because I had no expectations that it would better that classic, I was pleasantly surprised. It's less nuanced than Mockingbird in that the narrator is less innocent, in some ways anyway: but I appreciated the way in which Lee's narrator wrestles with ordinary people, wrestling with real issues (how do you relate to a nice person who's a hypocrite, a racist, or with visible flaws? Are only perfect people good? nice? acceptable?)<br/>And I suspect that it needed editing...and that Lee, had she ever wanted to, would have made some changes. But I liked it: and think she was courageous...and that it adds subtlety and depth to our view of Maycomb and thus of ourselves...
Well, I found this as disappointing as the early reviews suggested. It reads like lousy To Kill a Mockingbird fan fiction...the kind that ruins a literary hero (kinda like finding out Holden Caufield went on to be a successful ad man on Madison Ave). The constant change from first to third person narration is distracting...I think I see why she couldn't get it published all those years ago.
No opinion at this time.  Much too deep to give an option with reading again. I did make a mistake in my rating.  I actually give it five stars.
I absolutely loved the book. The message was amazing. You can't leach on to someone else your whole life and never have your own opinions. You'll never be happy if you don't become your own person. TKAM Is still my favorite between the two but Watchman was a great follow up.
Watchman is quite different from Mockingbird, and making a comparison between the two would be an extended college course.  Mockingbird was set in The Depression - and really during a period when the South was still recovering from The (so-called) Reconstruction.  Watchman occurs as the South is finally joining the economics of the rest of the country and while a sea change in racial politics is just starting.  This timing is the catalyst for an exploration of some of the deeper - and maybe darker - sides of the personalities of Atticus Fitch and Scout, and maybe even of the entire South.  While it does not contain all the levels of Mockingbird, it is a powerful book and offers a perspective that is rare and unique.  I loved the book and found that got stronger with each passing chapter.
The publisher got Ms. Lee's work right. I do not believe Watchman would have been received like Mockingbird if it had been released first. Watchman works because we know and love the characters from Mockingbird. We feel Jean Louise's pain and shock because we know her; we have lived with her and her family for years. We yearned for more from this author, and when we finally got it, the emotions were successfully transmitted.<br/><br/>Watchman would not have worked as well if it were released prior to Mockingbird because we would not have cared for Atticus and Scout the way we do. Scout's disappointment was just as shocking to us.<br/><br/>While not destined to be the classic of the first novel, Watchman is a good read. I am glad that it was published. I hope the author is happy too.
I disagree with so many reviews stating that this book was a disappointment. It was a book that embodied the struggle faced by a young woman returning home. After seeing her father through the viewpoint of a child for so long, it was difficult to see him as an adult an have her world come crashing down upon realization that he wasn't immortal or a deity. Atticus was a shell of the man he once was, as happens, but he still loves her and had her best interests at heart, even if they disagreed. I loved this book, and am so happy that it saw publication.
I was disappointed in the the Atticus Finch character development .  His racial bias was too divergent from his role in To Kill a Mocking Bird.
I had higher expectations--To Kill a Mockingbird is beautifully written! This book felt unfinished and unpolished when compared with the other.
Not great, but ok.
Way too confusing.
Very disappointing
Not worth reading.
Very disappointed.
Very disappointing
Very disappointed.
Big disappointment
What a vile book. Atticus is what would be termed today a Tea Partier, railing on about activist judges. If anything, it's clear that the South has.not evolved much in its thinking. This book should never have been published, not because I don't agree with its view of the Civil Rights movement, but because it was poorly written and slightly tarnishes the classic "Mockingbird".
i was disappointed. nowhere near as good as 'to kill a mockingbird'. did read right thru to the end but still waiting for something to happen.
Somewhat of a disappointment. A lot of over-the-top dramatization on the part of Scout. The premise is interesting and the ending was fitting.
A really engaging story, and an insight into past tensions, loved the simplicity of childhood thinking and the analytical wisdom of the adults
To really appreciate the book, I would recommend the reader to see the movie (or read the book) by Harper Lee "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Harper Lee's first book, Go Set a Watchman, is a bit of a disappointment when compared with her wildly popular classic, To Kill a Mockingbird.
I didn't realize this book is from only a draft of a novel Harper Lee worked on prior To Kill a Mockingbird. These same characters would appear again when she wrote her novel, Mockingbird, which is a prequel to Watchman and takes place about 20 years earlier. I didn't find the older characters at all likeable, even Scout. The saddest thing about this book is Atticus. He is simply not the same man as the hero he is in Mockingbird. Also, some of my favorite characters from Mockingbird aren't even part of this story. I now tend to believe the rumors that Truman Capote heavily influenced Mockingbird which was written after To Set a Watchman. This publication reminded me of the sad failed attempt to write a sequel that capitalized off the success of Gone With the Wind. Don't bother.
I read 4 pages of this book.  I found it to be poorly written and will never open the covers again.
It was disconcerting to have so many passages repeated from To Kill A Mockingbird.  I did not understand this method.  Overall disappointing.
I don't think Harper Lee ever wanted this "draft" printed. It is merely a collection of past history and the story line if very poor.
I'm glad that I read the book due to its notoriety.  The skill of the author is less developed than in her later book, To Kill a Mockingbird.
I reread To kill a Mockingbird before reading this book. I was expecting To Set a Watchman to be just as fabulous. It wasn't, it was just OK.
BORING!  Don't bother. this is no "To Kill a Mocking Bird"  I found it hard to believe the same individual wrote each of these books!
There've been a lot of professional reviews of this book, a lot of readers who've decided, because of them, they shouldn't read Go Set A Watchman. It's been quoted out of context, and many of the worshippers of To Kill A Mockingbird --and Atticus Finch-- are outraged.<br/><br/>But Jean Louise --and we-- must grow up and see Maycomb as it really is.<br/><br/>I was afraid I'd find this novel a mess, something Harper Lee had thrown away and some publisher dug out of the trash for profit. I'm relieved to find Lee here: her language, her vivid imagery, gorgeous turns of phrase, her breathing characters, and another powerful story.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to read this novel. Our old genius, Harper Lee, is there in the pages, welcoming us back to her amazing imagination.
Absolutely not worth reading.  Without Harper Lee's name attached this would never been published.
Fast reading - but liked it.  You had to take yourself back to that era to fuller understand the circumstances that took place in the south.
We read this for a book club selection, and not one of us really liked it.  It really is a re-write of To Kill A Mockingbird (or visa versa)
Ms.Harper should have quit while she was ahead.  I waited two and a half months to get this book from my library.  It wasn't worth the wait.
I was very disappointed in this book!  To me, the only thing that was similar to "To Kill a Mockingbird" were the character's names.
I was anxious to get it but it is so hard to get "into it". Very slow paced. I am 3/4 of the way through it. Hope it redeems itself.
A good follow up to "Mockingbird", but nowhere near as strong nor compelling. No storyline. But more dimensional. Also very preachy.
I was disappointed in this book. I suppose it is because To Kill A Mockingbird was so good, I had higher expectations. It was ok..not great.
I can't say I loved this book. I loved it until about the last seventy five pages and then I found it hard to keep my attention on the book.
This book was okay at the beginning, tough to get through in the middle, and life-changing at the end. The finish was worth the wait for me
Was very disappointed in the book. Good thing she wrote "To Kill A Mocking Bird" because this book would never have made her famous
Go Set a Watchman is not about Atticus Finch being exposed as a fraud - it is the compelling story of a young woman discovering that the ideal she created was not complete, and the shattering experiences she must undergo to reach that realization.  In To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout understands and idealizes what only a young girl can based on her maturity level. Her idealized view of her father is not tarnished until she experiences more of life and matures into her own views. Her realization that Atticus' views of life are nuanced is a jolt to her. This story brilliantly portrays her own growth into a realization that idols do not exist, but values may be maintained in various manners, some of which are tailored to the environment in which "the idol" exists.
I was hesitant to read this and had it several days before doing so, because of the negative reviews and those who said Atticus came off as a racist. Yet, I had to read it.<br/><br/>Personally, I found Atticus a man of his time. I don't agree with his views, but it 2015. As I tell my students,you must keep the context of both the author and the character in mind when you read. I still found Atticus kind hearted and we'll intentioned. I continue to admire him.<br/><br/>I actually found the conversations about race still very  pertinent, sadly. I wish we'd progressed further.<br/><br/>I did miss Dill and Jem, but it was the story it was meant to be. That of a daughter coming of age and becoming aware of her father's clay feet.<br/><br/>I recommend it
I was prepared to hate this book, based on some reviews I had read. While I don't think Watchman is as well written as Mockingbird, I do think it is a worthwhile read. I absolutely loved To Kill a Mockingbird, and had read that Go Set a Watchman destroyed Atticus. That didn't prove to be true. I enjoyed 'seeing' into the mind of an adult Scout. And Atticus, while quite different from the hero he was in Mockingbird, is still a marvelous man. He has reasons for everything he does, and I loved the end of the book with Atticus and Scout developing a new relationship.<br/>The language and racial interaction is jarring in the book, but quite true to the times of the 50s. I'm glad I read Go Set a Watchman, and so very glad Atticus can still be one of my heroes!
I grew up with Mockingbird so already had an idealized view of the characters. I think that really influenced what I expected in this book
Very hard to follow at first. Finally toward the last quarter of book, message began to rear it's gilt head. Scout was finally growing up.
If you have read To Kill A Mockingbird you will enjoy Go Set A Watchman.  Anyone living during that time will understand how Scout feels..
I read this book because I was curious about the hoopla in the press before its release and because Harper Lee had written it. While I enjoyed the book and thought there were sections in it that were beautifully written, it is not a polished masterpiece. I didn't expect it to be so. However, the stories in the press about other readers' disappointment in Atticus' character dumbfound me. To me he seemed to be very much the same Atticus as in "To Kill a Mockingingbird."  This story is told by an adult Jean Louise....that's the only reason Atticus is depicted differently. Also, "Go Set a Watchman" isn't about race. It's about Jean Louise's journey into a full adult understanding of her world, within the context of the 1950's American South.
Wow!  This novel will take you to the heart of the a torn generation.  If you have read 'To Kill a Mockingbird' you know the passion of the Finch family and the independence of Scout (Jean Louise) Finch, but you have never known it like you will after reading 'Go Set a Watchman.'  In this novel you meet a young woman who lived a sheltered existence but doesn't know it until she see's it through on of the most controversial and tumultuous times in the south, integration.  You will feel pain of a young woman coming into her own and discovering the bitter taste of finding who you are in a time in the south that called for anything but independence, especially of women.  This book will take you on a ride you will never forget and change you for the better.
This book was clearly written for the 21st Century.... in the early 1950s. Harper Lee's narrative of someone's hero, and idealistic sense of the world crashing is a perfect contrast to To Kill a Mockingbird. I think the irony is that a lot of people who dislike the book, are exactly in Scout's shoes. They are watching a hero they have held near and dear for a long time become someone that they don't recognize, and can't respect, but they have to learn to love him nonetheless. Great book. Only adds to Lee's beautiful legacy.
Disappointed
Really enjoyed the book.  It was so different but with the same characters as "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Definitely worth reading.
A delightful and thought-provoking journey through Scout's past, present and future. The title answers so many questions...pay attention!
Incredibly disappointing read although the passages describing the attitude of southerners during this period of history are fascinating.
Good read and really timely. Of course it is not as compelling as Mockingbird but I loved the section about Southern heritage vs. racism.
I really enjoy Harper Lee's writing.  Wish there was more of her works.  Story is very life like and believable.  Most impressive writer.
This is not a review of the literary merits of Go Set a Watchman, but rather a subjective critique of Reese Witherspoon's reading of it. She does read it which I didn't realize until I had already bought and started listening to it. Her reading of dialogue lacks distinct character and rhythm, all except Atticus who stands out and apart from all other characters as sounding like eyore's older brother. I found myself becoming terribly annoyed with him, but after going over the story in my head I realized it was Reese's reading of him, not his actual character. I absolutely bristle at and am deepy distracted by the star of Sweet Home Alabama being allowed to be the voice of this story. The person who should've read this aloud is my dad on the couch.
It's hard to believe this novel was written in the 1950's because it's so relevant to today's troubling times. It reads like a modern day version of our news headlines.<br/><br/>Scout is now a grown woman who has returned to her childhood home for a visit and stumbles upon Atticus at a Citizen's Council meeting regarding the negro population of Maycomb County not "staying in their place". She's stunned when she hears Atticus agreeing with those she knows are racist and closed-minded.<br/><br/>In the end, there's a heart wrenching verbal battle between Scout and Atticus. It's easy to feel Scout's pain the moment she realizes her father is not as infallible as she's always thought. This book will surely open up some heated discussions
Realistic portrayal of the era of racial history in the Southern United States when well meaning Whites were benevolent but patronizing.
The small Southern town perspective was interesting. However, I'm not thoroughly convinced that all of the book was written by Miss Lee.
I wonder if Harper Lee ever intended for this book to be published.  She may have realized it's faults and later wrote To Kill a Mockingbird as a book she really deemed print worthy.  I grew up in her era.  I never, ever, ever was taught that people were inferior or superior to one another.  God created us all and loves us all unconditionally.  Jesus died for us all.  God is color blind, Scout was color blind and I was raised color blind.  I never thought the "N" word was a bad word, but in today's society we understand it is offensive and therefore out of respect should never be used.  I read this book feeling cheapened for having to see that word in print so much.  In fact I lost interest in the story simply because of that word.
Dull beyond words
Very disappointed
not worth reading
It fit the times.
Thought provoking
I think the book is a scam.  I don't believe Harper Lee wrote it.
Glad she didn't publish this first.<br/>Certainly disappointment to let go of the Atticus of Mockingbird.<br/>It's well written well.
Disappointing...but obviously...if you don't write a winner the first time, you should try again.  Harper Lee's next novel is a winner.
This book reminded me of the movie, "Three Days of the Condor."  One needs to read it twice to determine what is going on.  TMc
We all might like to have a personal "watchperson.". At best, the book could be a  good treatment of girl-turned woman and coming of age to realize that your childhood "eye" does not see all, or see truth.  However, the writing, even for a first novel is staccato and awkward and does not approach the fluidity of Lee's Mockingbird.<br/><br/>  Moreover, Atticus' explanation of his own perspective does not seem complete.  Despite the difficult and ugly views, the story might have been a good exercise in the perplexity that underlies our inner motivations and outer actions, but it simply doesn't ring true, even apart from the view we have of Atticus.<br/><br/>A bit lackluster.  A bit incomplete.  Not a satisfying  read.
As a first novel, it has some of the fits and starts one would expect. The protagonist, someone we all "knew" as a child, is in many ways the same now, but aspects of the plotting and the writing of some scenes are weaker by far than To Kill a Mockingbird. One scene involves Jean Louise visiting Calpurnia, now elderly, who has experienced a very stressful family crisis, and I had to re-read the scene three times to fully grasp what Jean  Louise seems to, that Cal is not her loving mother-figure anymore, but has pulled back from her. Strange, and hard to square with the evocative and crystal-clear writing of TKAM. No more spoilers, but just go in expecting that it will be somewhat less "wowing" than the first novel was.
As much as I love To Kill a Mockingbird, I've always thought Atticus was too idealized, too heroic.  He's the father everybody wants and every man wants to be.  That tale would be unbearably saccharine if they didn't lose the case.  I read somewhere it was the movie version that made Walt Disney decide to start making live action stuff, which is so on-the-nose it's probably apocryphal.  Now this second story (which wasn't actually the second) addresses the problem -- a problem most of the original's fans would never admit to.  It tackles that fundamental flaw head on, and it does it without destroying the character in the process.  But this book will never be as beloved as the first, I expect, because it's too real.  Scout grows up.
I only read about 50 pages, just could not get into it.  I know it's hot in it's ratings, but this is mine.  Did not hold my interest.
Interesting study  of main characters with some new ones added.  I am not a southerner but  I think a very traumatic time is explored.
It's not "To Kill a Mockingbird", but it's Harper Lee and she is always thought provoking and has an excellent way with words.
it is not as well organized as To Kill a Mockingbird, but it is worth the time. Her style is developed and her characters are defined.
The book seems truncated somehow. It's enjoyable but it ended before I was ready. Lots of impassioned speeches. Glad I read it though.
People are complaining that Atticus is a racist; there is so much more to this novel than racism.  If you read To Kill a Mockingbird closely, there are several instances where Atticus knows what the KKK and others are planning.  The only way he could know with certainty is to have been to those meetings.  He says he goes to know what the others are up to and to make sure the letter of the law is followed. Atticus, after all is human.  Humans change between their 40's and 70's.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with Go Set A Watchman because it wasn't written as well as To Kill A Mockingbird.  But what a perfect example of how a writer takes a first draft of an idea and crafts it into an award  winning novel and an American Classic.
After finishing this excellent book, I thought what a shame Ms Lee didn't write more.  She sets up her situation with loving description and vivid characterization and let's it lead into the conflicts with passion.  She illuminates what it means to be human and accept each other faults.  The great Atticus Finch may have his shortcomings but he remains the admirable man he has always been, here more as a man and a father than as a symbol of righteousness and justice. Jean Louise is a fitting lead character and her search for truth is filled with the youthful passion of her age.  In short, the book works and gives pleasure to the reader as well as much to think about.  I wish we could have had more from this first rare author.
People loved TKAM, I didn't and didn't like this one. YOU MIGHT THOUGH. I Read it for the hype. Need to read now what I want to read.
Well, not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, but good enough to know what white people were thinking during the civil rights movement.
Scout grows up and see Atticus as an adult- imperfect.  He did a heroic thing in Mockingbird. But just like all heroes, he is human, and living in a culture still reeling from the War.  Yes, still.  I thought the book did a great job of exploring differing Southern perspectives on the Civil Rights movement.  As a born and bred Southerner, I recognized these viewpoints, and appreciated their airing.  Nobody could write this better than Harper Lee.  I hope this book will become a talking point for people- black and white- to come together and heal.  We all need to spend some time on each others' porches, just like Scout did at the Radley House in Mockingbird.  Scout is the hero of this story, showing all of us a path forward.
Do not believe this was written by same person as To Kill A Mockingbird.  Very disappointed.
To Kill a Mockingbird, was 3 x the book of Go Set a Watchman.<br/>To me Watchman was a bore
Just as good... maybe even better than the first! This is a masterful call for humanity to take the extra effort needed to develop a mature and autonomous sense of self and conscience. A wonderful description of the importance of being true to your own inner voice and at the same time working to truly understand and thrive with those who don't carry the same opinions as you in social justice issues. I'd love to see this book take it's place on the list of must read literature in schools. This book brilliantly tackles and disassembles all that is wrong with the shallow, simplistic and two-dimensional conversations running rampant in our society today. It challenges us and gives a framework for a much healthier alternative.
If you read "to Kill a Mockingbird" its worth reading to see where the characters end up but this is not nearly as engaging.
Honestly, I couldn't get through this poorly organized and edited book. I am a great Harper Lee fan, but I did not finish this book.
The story line is so boring I couldn't get past the first 30 pages... Total waste of money!
Thought it was a very good book, did not compare it to To Kill A Mockingbird, but throughly enjoyed reading Harper Lees first book!
Not what I expected, but I couldn't quit reading. So much has changed since those days, and yet, so much is still, sadly, the same.
It Was a fair read, but lacked narrative tension...dialogue was wearisome.  Still, it was interesting to read after her first book.
I thought the ending could've been better, but Harper Lee exceeded my expectations with this book. It was definitely a page turner.
Loved To Set A Watchman.  Very interesting to see the interaction of a grown Scout and Atticus.  It was when reality made her see him as a regular person and not the Christ figure she was worshipping.  He was a typical person of his time and place of living.  The most disturbing part of the book was Cal and Scout.  Cal was so distant and cold toward Scout.  She raised her from the age of two.  It broke my heart when Scout asked her if she hated them.  The book proved you can not go home again.
Glad I read it.  Shows how much the author's writing skills progressed after this first attempt - and the value of a smart editor.
Great Book I wish I would have run across it sooner.  4  stars, drama ,funny. Some sadness and very interesting. Love it  Read it.
No where near a good as To Kill a Mockingbird which was a wonderful book.  I had a hard time getting into it and was disappointed.
Although not as well edited as Harper Lee's original, the book is fabulous and brings to light issues worth discussing even today.
Good reading. Entertaining and really causes the reader to think. Very real. Not quite as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Ignore the "reviews" that say Atticus is a racist and read the book for yourself!
I can see why the editor returned  this manuscript with directions to focus on a story about Scout, Jem, and Charles as children.
It's a steady read but not as well-written as To Kill a Mockingbird so I believe true Harper Lee fans will be a bit disappointed.
Too chatty in the beginning.  Just could not get into it and finally just gave up.  Clearly not her best work.  So disappointing.
Several unexpected turns. Characters are much the same but viewed from different perspectives. In many ways, a book of the times.
Good read but the ending was a little disappointing. I was reading and all of a sudden it was over. Not how I expected it to end.
I really liked this book.  I have read her other book and enjoyed that as well.  After hearing all the stuff about people being disappointed that the father is a segregationist I went into this with an open mind.  I found this book very enjoyable and feel that it was more about what the main character needed to learn from finding out about her father than it was about him.  It is more about her struggle with what she finds out and how she copes.  That being said, there were some very funny parts to this book and I would (and have!) recommend it to others to read.  Do not buy into the press.  Read it for yourself and you might be pleasantly surprised at what you find/learn/feel.  A very good read.
After great anticipation, I loaned a copy of the book from the library (glad I didn't buy one).  It read like a first draft, rambling its way through one-third of the book before the plot materialized.  Although I enjoyed revisiting the antics of Scout as a child, her adult self I found less appealing.  The changes in Atticus were jarring, and the ending left me feeling less than satisfied in terms of resolution.  This is not remotely of the same caliber as To Kill A Mockingbird.
Not her best writing -- she's put POV changes from one person to another on a single page, plot is slow and not very compelling.
There is clearly a different writing style between this book and To Kill a Mockingbird.  This was much more confusing and wordy.
It read like a first draft...and it was very slow to get to the point. Not at all what I was expecting. I was very disappointed.
I thought Scout's POV as an adult was interesting and confusing, much the way I felt about the grownups I knew as a young woman.
Great book. Gave you alit to think about. Definitely different perspective as an adult. Those of us who love to read will enjoy.
I would not have been so critical of this novel if I hadn't read To Kill A Mockingbird first.  It's hard not to compare the two.
I didn't compare it to "To Kill a Mockingbird" and I think I liked it.  I think I was hoping for a better ending though.
I really enjoyed Go Set a watchman. I just love Harper Lee's writing and am saddened because there will never be any more books!
Several friends stopped reading Go Set a Watchman about half way through the book.  Discovering with Scout that her father, the much beloved Atticus, was a mere mortal--a thoroughly Southern man, weighted by the traditions and mores of his family and community, was more than many readers can bear.  But, moving beyond that dramatic revelation, Scout steps further into her own maturity, grasping the depth of entrenched customs to find a path which might lead to compromise and a new phase of realism between the races in her beloved Dixie. I faced my own biases against the old traditional attitudes in the Deep South and found more understanding, if not acceptance, due to reading Go Set a Watchman.
Couldn't finish.
Not much to say.
A publicity scam
Unreadable.
I was quite excited when I heard that "Go Set a Watchman" was "found' and would be published. "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my all time favorite books and certainly deserved the accolades Ms Lee received. In preparation for the arrival of "Watchman," I read "Mockingbird" again. Loved it originally and loved it yet again. Now as to "Watchman," bottom line I was very disappointed in it and almost did not finish it. In my opinion the book was choppy and in need of much stronger editing than it seemed to have received. I would warn anyone who is planning to read it to not think this is a true sequel to "Mockingbird." It definitely is not.
While reading Go Set a Watchman, I felt that I was reading a lecture or an essay.  Though framed in a story, Lee presented information about the South, its people and history in a very clear and personal way.  I felt Scout's sadness and frustration at what she feels is her family's and boyfriend's betrayal of her ideals and sense of justice, especially during a time in history when the rest of  country is moving forward in the civil rights movement.  Things she sees so clearly are not so easily possible in her hometown.  She may come and go between her life in New York and Maycomb, but those who live in Maycomb don't have the luxury of expecting centuries of tradition and attitudes change.
Reads well but nothing spectacular. I was expecting much more from the writer of Mockingbird and therefore highly disappointed.
Well after reading To Kill A Mockingbird, this book was a disappointment. Hard to believe the same 2 people wrote both books. This one was confusing, and jumped around a lot, and kind of left you hanging with certain characters. Obviously there was a reason that the first one never made it to publishing. I think someone capitalized on this "find" and hyped it up since Harper Lee never wrote another book after TKAMB. If I had read it before TKAMB, I doubt I would have even finished it. If you are going to read it, do read TKAMB first so you are familiar with the characters. There is much better character development, and you'll be familiar with who they are and what they stand for.
I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't what was delivered in "Watchman."  Spoiler alert--what bothered me most was the discrepancies between events recounted in "Watchman" with the events in "Mockingbird."  Tom's arm was an injury, not an amputation; he was found guilty, not acquitted.  Dill is conspicuously absent (but recognizable as Truman Capote in physical description).  Atticus is from some other planet; the same man in "Mockingbird" could not have been the man in "Watchman."  Perhaps I expected too much, "Mockingbird" is an impossible act to follow.  This is a case of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  And it was fixed.
Brilliantly written !  As the story unfolds the reader is forced to question exactly why we think and do what we do and think.
I was disappointed in the book, not sure Harper Lee ever meant for that to be published, or that it was even completed by her!
Seemed to end kind of abruptly.  Glad it was finally published.  Good glimpse at southern racial situation in the time period.
Total waste of time.  Maybe I expected too much, due to the hype.  It is not the fact that Jean views Atticus as a racist; at times, I had to speed read due to the boredom.  If there was a message, it completely escaped me.
I enjoyed To Kill A MockingBird: Both the book and the film.<br/>This....book was a huge disappointment, to say the least. I understand many disappointed readers are getting refunds and I understand why. This is not a sequel or a pre-quell. This was actually rejected when it was originally submitted. Harper Lee is senile now and in a nursing home. I'm guessing some unscrupulous soul dug this up when money was needed. Who knows. Fat is: This is one disappointing read.
How could I not give 5 stars??  This is the best book, since To Kill a Mockingbird, I have ever read.  Come on a journey  of growth with Miss Jean Louise.....show her how much you've grown...after all, the majority of us read "Mockingbird" so many years ago when we were young and rebellious, just like Scout.<br/>Beautifully written, Miss Lee...thank you for having the kind of determination to always exceed....in everything you do.<br/>Read it, read it, read it......
An interesting turn on Scout's view of her father as an adult, and her view as a child.  I found this book thought-provoking.
Don't know what all the fuss was about this book. I think it was a very good book all on its own. I loved the grown up Scout.
THe book is well written.  It will take a second reading before I understand Atticus's point of view regarding desegregation.
Simply a good read. I wasn't expecting a tour de force such as mockingbird. I quieter look inside a genius's mind. Thank you.
This is a most interesting book because of its history.  I enjoyed reading it along with many of the excellent reviews readers have provided.  Many have been concerned about the "new" Atticus.  I really did  not have a problem with  this and can understand many of the concerns voiced by him.  The one action of his that did not ring true to me was his attitude towards defending Calpurnica's grandson; only taking the case to thwart the NAACP.  At times  I felt the book could do with a good edit but it remained an enjoyable read and a good descriptor of life in the South.  I also rather liked  the concept of baton change in  fighting for good from Atticus to his daughter.
Agree with others who have pointed out there was a reason this book was not originally accepted for publication. The beginning drags, while the end dissolves in a rant. I felt bludgeoned over the head with the message.<br/><br/>There are so many compelling subjects touched on in this book: racism, peer pressure in small towns, the differences between the North and the South, a child's first disallusionment with a parent. The writing just does not do them justice.
I'm a lifelong fan of "Mockingbird" and Atticus Finch. I let early reviews sway me just a little, but this book is actually surprisingly good. I thoroughly enjoyed the read and truly believe that if Ms. Lee had pursued the prevalent themes (childhood love, acceptance and tolerance of ideas, the journey of pre-Feminist movement modern young womanhood in the 1950s, idolatry) in the novel further; this book could have lived up to the standard of Mockingbird.
"Go Set a Watchman" is a bore and an embarrassment--a stilted, directionless anachronism and a tedious apology for white resistance to integration.<br/><br/>The 20-something Scout--now called Jean Louise--returns home to Maycomb  and stumbles upon seeing her father, Atticus, in a meeting of a white citizens' council, tacitly supporting the segregationists with his presence. Shocked and devastated to see him as Archie Bunker instead of Oskar Schindler, she eventually confronts him in a breathless tirade conducted (like the rest of the book) in lingo from 1920. Later, her crazy uncle slaps the bejeezus out of her--which the author seems to regard as all any emotional young woman really needs--and so Scout goes back to loving her dear old racist Dad.<br/><br/>If that's not enough to dissuade you, here are the main reasons this book is garbage:<br/><br/>First, it reads as if it were written in 1934, not 2011, 2014, or whenever Lee's hangers-on/future grave robbers are purporting she wrote it. The words and phrases Lee uses--e.g., "shot his cuff," "made a date for their leave-taking," "impedimenta," etc.--are so hoary they sound like Montgomery Burns from The Simpsons. There are gratuitous references to authors and historical figures, some of whom are incredibly obscure (e.g., Wade Hampton, Bishop Colenso). It's very distracting and makes the book tedious to muck through. I refuse to believe any modern editor took a pen to this prose. It reads as if my great-great grandmother wrote it.<br/><br/>Or better yet, have you ever read a Hardy Boys novel? Take away all the action and suspense and liberally sprinkle it with the "N" word, and there you go. "Watchman" reads like the Hardy Boys if Franklin W. Dixon were a senile old lady.<br/><br/>Scout's conversations with both the uncle and her father are incredibly stilted, tedious, and hard to follow. That's partly because people haven't talked this way in 80 years. (Does anyone address their Dad as "Sir" in the middle of a conversation?) It's also because the conversations are thinly veiled authorial intrusion--like those in another long slog of a mid-Century sociopolitical novel that, like "Watchman" amounts to a sophomore slump following a promising first act: "Atlas Shrugged."<br/><br/>Second, the book is directionless. The plot bounces from Jean Louise's having strange (and pointless) conversations with her bad-side-of-the-tracks boyfriend to her stewing about race relations--the main topic the novel ham-handedly deals with. Add to this the completely unnecessary stock characters of her portly long-suffering aunt and the aunt's brother, Scout's eccentric physician uncle. Their only role is to drag Jean Louise back to sanity when she loses it at her father for realizing he's not God, just an old racist who wants the Negroes to be treated fairly, so long as they're not allowed to vote and are kept in their place as, in his words "backward" people.<br/><br/>And that's the worst flaw of this novel: It's essentially an attempt to excuse Southern whites' resistance to integration--"Take Up the White Man's Burden" without the undeniable musicality and the excuse of being written 150 years ago. Atticus and his brother spend a lot of time decrying the NAACP and how it and its cruel Yankee supporters have forced the Southern blacks into a world they're not ready for. In "Watchman," the Big Conversation--the conflict that starts the resolution of Scout's crisis of conscience--consists of Scout's uncle telling her that Southern whites are resisting integration not because they're racist, selfish, hypocritical, or sadistic--just that they don't like being told what to do by the federal government. REALLY, HARPER?<br/><br/>Even Lee's attempt at comic relief falls flat. She spends an entire chapter going through the knee-slapping hilarity of the local reverend's newfangled recitation of the Protestant Doxology and the confusion it sows among the congregation. Stop it, Harper; you're killing me! Sigh.<br/><br/>The book's main themes, in a nutshell: 1. Southern whites were right to resist integration, because those childlike "Negroes" were not ready to exercise their full rights; 2. Every young girl sees her daddy as God (even though inexplicably, she doesn't even call him Dad) until she catches him being a hypocrite, and 3. Every young woman must end up with a young man of her own social class.<br/><br/>I really wanted "Watchman" to be all that it promised as the purported sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird." To say it's disappointing is an understatement.
As good as Mockingbird. A must read. What a shame Harper Lee didn't write a lot more!
I was very disappointed in this book.  I couldn't believe it was over when it was.  I felt like I wasted my time reading it.
This book should never have been written.  Pretty much a re-hash of what has already been written.  Very boring and tedious.
Go det a watchman portrayed the actions of the characters as reasonable for that time, location and  and what was happening.
It was very interesting to read this book. You will appreciate "To kill a mockingbird" much more. A must read for me
It is not To Kill a Mockingbird. It was well worth the read and I expect a good discussion when we discuss it for Book Club.
What a disappointment; I wonder if Harper Lee really wrote this---and if she did, who wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird"?
Book was delivered promptly. The story and characterization a were not as captivating as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
I was disappointed that the critics, and, media did not understand that Harper Lee did not portray Atticus as a racist.  True he had a patriarchal view towards the southern blacks in the 60's but he did not begrudge them, or, work against their freedom.  The hype about him being a member of the Klan turned out to be just that hype.  His excursion into that particular darkness was for a reason consistent with Atticus' nature as portrayed in  To Kill a Mockingbird. (i do not want to be a spoiler)  To kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book.  Atticus Finch as a lawyer was an inspiration to me in my choice of career ....and he remains so...despite his frailties as an old man.
Was very disappointed.  You knew the ending from page one.
If Atticus Finch of "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a hero to you as he is to me, this story may leave you feeling a little let down.  However, "Watchman" is a reminder that people in real life, and in the best fiction, are complex and multi-dimensional.  Ms. Lee's prose is humorous and engaging.  The story is not as compelling as the plot in "Mockingbird" but the interest level is high throughout.  Unlike Mockingbird which was narrated in the first person from the perspective of Scout, Watchman is written in the third person.  However, it for the most part follows Jean Louise (Scout) and the reader is presented the story mostly from her perspective.
This is another masterpiece!  I found myself immersed at once in both my childhood and the happenings of today.  Ms Lee is able to take me from my formative years to a realization of how we have come to the race relations that are giving our society so many troubled episodes today.  Atticus is not the bigoted racist that some reviewers have seen. He is truly a very wise gentle-person who passionately believes in the law and the constitution as it is written.  He is committed to its practice.  He, his brother, Dr Finch, and his sister are among the wisest of people.  Let the story in this book and this family wrap itself around you and influence how you live your life!
Like many, I was profoundly disappointed with many aspects of this book, especially knowing what happens with some of the cherished characters.  I grew up with To Kill A Mockingbird, both book and movie, and like Jean Louise, I traveled that path of personal growth so necessary to all of us as she traveled hers in Go Set A Watchman.  Those of us who are Southern bred, born and raised may well understand this book better than any others, or we may come out of it totally confused.  I'm happy to say I understand.  While painful at times, the understanding and the growth that accompanies that understanding has rendered me calmly peaceful in the end.  Thank you, Ms. Lee.
While the book was verywell-written, it seem to meander around without much point. The plot it was supposed to have failed.
I was disappointed in Go Set A Watchman. To Kill A Mockingbird was so fantastic that I think my expectations were too high.
Really like this book. I've learned a lot in this book and I'm satisfied now. Great story and I can see the litter clearly.
Not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird for sure, but not with out merit. Has some funny passages and some annoying ones too..
A wonderful read<br/>Great characters<br/>I really enjoyed that much of the story was flashbacks to the Mocking bird days
some beautiful scenes and a predictable but touching finale which is nicely executed. not in the same league as mockingbird
For those who are not reading this due to outside influences like media and spoilers, I say read the book for yourself!  There are some great Harper Lee moments and comparing this book to her To Kill A Mockingbird is like comparing two children from the same family.  If this book was the same as Mockingbird, all the critics would be bashing this novel as not being different or giving the reader something to think about.  The characters have evolved and changed , as people often do in life....this is not Mockingbird, so don't expect it to be.  Just read it and make your own interpretation of it--which is what any good reader does with any book by the same author!
It was a clunky story, clunky execution, but interesting idea. Given a few more drafts it may be good. Points for history.
Did Harper Lee write this novel?  Did someone else write it.  if she truly wrote this book who wrote To Kill A Mockingbird
The story would not have been paid much attention to except that the characters were the same as in To Kill A Mockingbird.
I suspect an unwritten 3rd book would have brought everything full circle.  In Watchman, Atticus agrees to defend his long-time black housekeeper's close relative against manslaughter charges in a car running over a white man.  There are throwaway lines suggesting said white man was so frequently drunk in public Atticus would have come to the conclusion he had to plead his client not guilty and publicly "run down the dead man again", not out of any sense of racial injustice, but merely justice.  His young partner and Scout would have been there on the side of the defense, with only Scout acting out of racial sympathy, and all three learning empathy.
Best Book ever.  With all the hype, I was a little skeptical, but it was wonderful.
The story of Scout, grown up and returning home for her yearly two week visit.  I think the writing was great. More complex than Mockingbird, but this is truly a grown up book.  Where in Mockingbird Scout tells her story from the eyes of a young girl, in Watchman we see an amazingly forward thinking (especially for the time) Jean Louise who is finally able to voice her own conscience. I heard some talk of people being upset about the Atticus character. I think he is portrayed as a real person with faults. Scout is the real winner in this book. If this is any way the biographical story of Harper's early years...I wish I could have met the woman she was 😀
Read it till the end before you decide... It has a message that's greatly needed in our modern and still-divided America.
The story of a small town Alabama town in the early 1950s is skillfully interwoven with childhood memories of the 1930's.
Makes me reflect differently on To Kill a Mockingbird and I don't want to. Lots of prejudice towards "family member" Hank
When the buzz hit the street that Atticus was revealed to be a member of the KKK and against the NAACP in this book, I was one of the first to be horrified.  The good news is that Scout is more horrified than the rest of us, and gets to explain and confront every bit of our outrage to her father. The book is certainly of a period and doesn't sit as easy as Mockingbird does (Tho, what really ever could), but Lee's prose is as evocative and brilliant as one expects, the characters still as fleshed out, and the world of Maycomb still as timeless.  I was not disappointed.  I don't regret this journey, and I don't regret its existence.  Well worth the time.
Little Scout's all grown up and come home for the long awaited sequel to the American classic, To Kill a Mockingbird. The book is new and I don't want to spoil anything, but it has roughly the same setting, with time moved forward to the civil rights movement. Harper Lee's prose is as beautiful as ever. There's a million different ways to feel about this book, whether she even wanted it published, what it means about our view of life then and now, how readers might now view the original in this new context, etc. I'm sure it'll make more than a couple decent book club arguments. It belongs in the canon of American literature and was well worth the wait.
For those concerned that Atticus Finch is a "closet" racist, fear not.  My discipline (psychology) is well acquainted with a research method known as Participant Observation.  This technique involves embedding oneself in an organisation (political party, KKK, student groups, etc.) in order to learn WHAT the group is doing, and/or plans to do, and - with luck - possibly defuse any ideologies and behaviours that are counterproductive (as in "anti-social") to the public at large.<br/>SPOILER ALERT:  Atticus has even Scout believing the worst of him.  Read the book; it's well worth it, and Harper Lee remains my favourite American author.
Very slow reader. Last fifty or sixty pages made the book. Wasn't what I expected.
Found it boring
Wonderdul read.
Boring and sad.
A real disappointment. Scout wasn't a likeable person. Story just ambled around with Scout feeling superior to everyone.
A bit thin, it felt like a first novel by a writer witch it is. It should be read to see all sides of Harper Lee's work.
It was not a book that I couldn't put down. However , I really enjoyed the writing. It had an excellent form of flowing.
It's OK and a bit entertaining in parts, but not life-changing or enlightening for me in any way. A wimpy Bildungsroman.
I did not want read this book as I had such a clear picture in my mind of Atticus as he was in the movie!  In bringing the relationship up and forward in time,  I feel the author was trying to explain the way the times had changed ;  Atticus didn't change- he was living in a segretated world and saw no reason to question it.  He respected the law above all things.  And he acted exactly upon his principles;  no matter that his daughter saw things differently now.  The coming of age of Scout is painful for them both but I now understand the whole process she underwent to find her place in this "new "town .  I highly recommend this book.
It amazing that this was the first book Ms. Lee wrote. It has all the nuance of a second book. To Kill A Mockingbird is told from a child's point of view where as Go Set A Watchman is told from a 26 year old Scout who realizes that her hero's feet are made of clay. It's an honest book for that time and space and the hardships of one world changing with people cling to that world, all the while the you have people like Scout who are color blind and can't see why there are so much animosity with all the changes in the world. This is a book that should be read by all and see it as a sequel and not as the first book in the story of Scout's life.
a real disappointment....not up to "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Seems to have been published for profit ..........
A bit disappointing after the high standard set with Mocking Bird. Could not associate the same Atticus with this book.
A great read but kept comparing it to Too Kill a Mockingbird. My grandson was named Scout after Too Kill A Mockingbird.
Having just re read To Kill a Mockingbird it was somewhat easier to follow but do not feel it is a "must" read.
This book made me think about how things were in the 50's and 60's and how things stand now considering race relations.
Slow, plodding disconnected plot. I read it so that I could discuss with friends.
Excellent writing!  At times I laughed right out loud!  Harper Lee does it again.
This depiction of Atticus is perfectly consistent with the time when Harper Lee was coming of age. He is not described as an active member of the KKK, but as an infrequent visitor keeping an eye on them. His leadership in the Citizens' Council, dedicated to ameliorating the expected problems arising from the Brown vs Board of Education decision being represented by the NAACP at the time, would have been expected from all but the most insistent of civil rights activists in the Deep South. Scout's liberal instincts are perfectly represented as she deals with being part of her culture and community, ending with acceptance of the inevitable.
I kept putting it down but ultimately forced myself to finish it. Wasn't that impressed. At least I can say I read it.
Interesting to read after Mockingbird.  The writing was not as good, but fun to read anyway, because of the backstory.
I found the writing "dis-jointed".  I can't believe Harper Lee wrote it.  My book club members (7) all agreed.
It is amazing how much of the sentiments of that period are still so relevant today in the Southern States of the USA.
I went in to this one not expecting a whole lot which was a good thing. Anticlimactic. About as I thought it would be.
I had to keep reminding myself that this was written before To Kill a Mockingbird. What a difficult time in the South.
I. Liked. The. Book. But. The. Ending. Was. Very. Disappointed.  It. Sort. Of. Just. Stopped  and. Left. You. Hanging.
I liked this easy to read prequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. You have to read through to appreciate the socio- history.
Really like this accounting of the characters. Enjoying how they are developed and delves into the background of them.
From someone who lists TKAM as their favorite novel, this was a letdown. Period.
It was rejected when written.  Why?  It really was not a very well written book.
I read this book in one day.  A complicated thoughtful story.  Hard to put down.
Interesting book. There are mixed opinions on the book, but I enjoyed it. Don't expect another To Kill A Mockingbird.
Intense, intelligently written. More mature naturaliy I being an adult and more realistic than To kill a Mockinbird.
Harper Lee did not disappoint, answers to many questions I oferten asked myself over the years, a must read for fans.
I still really enjoy her style of writing, but I didn't enjoy the plot.  Not nearly as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.
I was disappointed. I do  not think it was a well written as To Kill A Mockingbird. It was just a dissapointing read.
A shameful attempt to take advantage of the great success of "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I was so disappointed.
Interesting that it's about class in addition to race.  I'm from<br/>Alabama, so there's some nostalgia here for me.
What an honor to read more of Harper Lee's writing but this was a disappointing first draft version of the later draft that was Harper Lee's best work.  This is clearly a stab at publicity and profit and while it was a joy and privilege  to read, genuine TKAM fans are aware that this is simply the first attempt at a later masterpiece.  In many places, this version  includes passages, verbiage, and exact stories from TKAM, but the perspective from Scout as an adult seems almost whiny and petulant--but the same response from a child seems more natural.  Harper Lee's editor was brilliant to see the potential in this first version.
I really enjoyed this book, it was so thought provoking, especially the ending.
As a huge fan of TKAM, I could hardly wait to read Watchman. After reading several reviews, I began questioning whether I should read it all. Several reviews stated they felt the character of Atticus was racist, a seemingly far cry from the original character. I read the book, and I enjoyed the book. I did not feel the character was racist, but a rule follower - a lawyer. I took what I think Lee put forth as the intended moral of the story, away from the story. Scout is not Atticus, her integrity runs parallel to his because of him - which, without giving too much of the story away, I feel is the point Lee is trying to make.
Perhaps 40 or 50 years ago this would have been terrific, but now that it is 2015 it seems to offer little too late.
I was disappointed -- the story drug in places and the characters lacked the depth I was expecting from this writer.
Very disappointing novel. I couldn't believe when I turned the final page that it was the end. Would have liked more.
Harper Lee's original work should have been published first.  Glad it is here. Sad it took so long to be discovered.
Starts out really well, and as you think it really is going somewhere it goes flat !! So much hype about nothing ...
Certainly different from To Kill a Mockingbird, but perhaps its  release now is relevant.  Definitely worth reading.
Not as good as the original "To Kill A Mockingbird" did not track well with "To Kill A Mockingbird".
Somewhat disappointed. I love "To Kill a Mockingbird"  and expected to feel the same. Still a very good book
Horrible, sorry I wasted over $13.00 in this rubbish.
I am sorry that this sorry book was published, and sorry that I bought it. Too bad that the manuscript wasn't lost.
Just not the quality of To Kill A Mockingbird. I wanted to shout at Scout, " no body is perfect, even you."
Could easily get involved with the characters, now time to go reread To Kill a Mockingbird again after a long time.
Great book. What a wonderful storyteller Harper Lee is! Brought out a lot of emotions. Laughed out loud many times.
"Go Set A Watchman" is an amazing book!<br/><br/>Especially, if you love reality and irony it's your type of book.<br/><br/>It's a complicated story about a women who slowly realizes the father she idolized is a copywriter and a racist.<br/><br/>I read or saw the film "To Kill A Mockingbird".<br/><br/>Maybe when it was written, America needed  a story & "hero" like the Atticus in "To Kill A Mockingbird" -<br/><br/>as some sort of symbolic hope that there was good people not afraid to stand up for right in such a racist society & time in America.<br/><br/>That wasn't my reality or experiences, so as a child I could only view the premise of "To Kill A Mockingbird"..,<br/><br/>and especially the "Divine" character of Atticus, who's character was supposed to a shining example of rising above the "ugly fray of the times" - as unrealistic,  boring and binary -  too good - bad, black - white.<br/><br/>I may be completely incorrect in my assessment, but I have no regrets about not reading more than five pages of Mockingbird or "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" or "Gone With the Wind".<br/><br/>But I'm so very thrilled Ms. Harper Lee finally had the chance to release - "Go Set A Watchman"<br/><br/>The truth is not always pleasant or pretty - it's usually a complicated, messy ugly affair - similar to the Atticus in "Go Set A Watchman" -  but you if you can face and stomach the truth, you can always learn deeply from it to grow.
It was an interesting archaeological expedition, but does not nearly measure up to To Kill a Mockingbird.  The first half of the book was rather interesting, as long as you understood that it was simply a time capsule of the thoughts of southerners at that time.  The second half slowed to a crawl and was primarily a discussion between Scout and her uncle and her daddy.  Had it been strongly edited, I think it held promise as literature, but as it is, it is simply a glimpse into the Old South in a new age.  Thus, it left me empty when I was done, instead of filling me with understanding and hope, as did Mockingbird.
I think this book held up pretty well to the orginal, if you but yourself into the mindset that "this was written before TKAMB". One thing I do have to say, is that the book is not about racism like the media said. The book, like TKAMB, is about Scout growing up and seeing the world from an older view. All thought racism is a main conflict and an underlying theme. If you want to read a book heavily dealing with racism, I recomend The Help.<br/>Overall, I think it was a good read, and I highly recomend it to any TKAMB fan, or anyone for that matter, because you do not have to read TKAMB to read this book.
Book could have used an editor's touch.  Good story.  Did not ruin my perception of Atticus. Glad I read the book.
Describes what the south was under going with integration and the. Many facets of understanding between the races.
Surprising and unsettling, but good.  Almost seems like there will be another sequel???  What happens to everyone?
Gosh, I really don't know exactly how to review this book.  I was very excited to read it but was rather disappointed in the story.  The fact that Atticus was not the exact man we thought he was in "To Kill a Mockingbird" was not unexpected.  Atticus was just a product of the times.  I thought Ms. Lee did a fine job in some areas, especially how the blacks really felt towards the whites.  The overall plot was lacking in my opinion. I would have probably cast this book aside after the first few chapters if I had not liked "To Kill a Mockingbird" so well. Ho Hum...at least I can say I read it. :)
Wonderfully written. Does not change TKAM for me. I am glad I read it second so I knew the beginning relationships. This story introduced other family members and continues the story of Scout and her father. I couldn't put it down. Read it cover to cover before the sun went down.
This is a boring book.  I couldn't get past the first few chapters.  Scout turns out to be a not very nice woman.
I enjoyed this book although nothing can compete with her first one.  it's great to have another Harper Lee book.
It's a good look at how to deal with one's feelings when someone who we look up to falls off his or her pedestal.
Taken on its own,this is a compelling view of the times. I enjoyed the book and found it to be a worthwhile read.
The first half of the novel was excellent; the last half wandered off into long discussions of race in the South.
Disappointing after "to Kill A Mockingbird". Wish I had not read it.
So good! Loved it so much! Harper Lee has now written my two favorite books.
Poorly written
Totally boring
Disappointing.
Disappointing.
We got conned!
I loved this book, I believe it should have been released as a precursor to Kill A Mockingbird! It showed the growth of Jean Louise and her<br/>Passage from the innicence of youth to real adulthood. I don't understand the bad reviews, perhaps it is because I did not go in it the reading if tnis book with the expectations that it was the same story as to Kill A Mockingbird. I loved it excellent writer if course!
Not as great as Mockingbird but very good read. I felt nostalgic reading but liked Mockingbird a whole lot more.
I looked forward to reading this book; I was sorely disappointed. I found the plot to be ponderous and  complex.
The first half of the book moved very slow. The second half, particularly the ending was very thought provoking.
I was expecting more from Harper Lee.  It was slow in some parts and was not up to the standards I was expecting
A number of heady reviews now  circulating  give this book little  love or respect.  It has been called rambling,  of weak plot and not worthy of sophisticated readers.  I beg to differ.  To me, the construct of this book was simply a vehicle  for the author  to  share her life experiences of growing up in the Deep South,  warts and all.  The reader is immersed  in the details of place and period...  insular, backward and stubborn yet somehow beckoning.  The book brings to life the many conflicted feelings of living in a world that is both beautiful and hateful, and witnessing its inevitable decline.
The perfect companion to To Kill A Mockingbird!!<br/><br/>Like the complaints about Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, the detractors of this book either did not bother to read it, did not understand it, or simply should not be offering advice on what to read.<br/><br/>To Kill A Mockingbird allowed us to admire Atticus Finch.  Go Set A Watchman gives us a chance to understand why we admire him, and what we should do to try to emulate him.<br/><br/>The discussion is not encyclopedic, but extremely inspirational,.  It is the discussion we should all have on a regular basis, but almost never have.
It seems odd that this book was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I'm glad I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" first, as "Go Set a Watchman" uses some of what we already knew about the characters.  And, there are some really funny stories about Jean Louise (Scout, in "To Kill a Mockingbird")  Harper Lee's clearly expressed understanding of the relationship between whites and blacks in the '40's-'50's makes us reflect on what we knew, or thought we knew, about the period.  I think this should be mandatory reading for discussion in every high school in the country.
I knew going into this, it wasn't going to be To KIl a Mockingbird. It was nice to see how Scout is as an adult
Character development was good. Storyline seemed like it was going somewhere interesting but in the end just uneventful
Disappointing, none of the character of To Kill a Mockingbird. Didn't feel like the same author writing at all.
Provocative read but needed editing and some tender loving care by publishers that got what they wanted....$$$.
But also nice to hear from a grown up Scout with amusing flashbacks to her coming of age experience. Easy read.
If you liked "Mockingbird" you'll like this. Most of the same characters. Mixture of comedy, and drama.
I was disappointed . I guess I was expecting much more. Quite a let down after "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD".
A very interesting descriptive narrative of live and thoughts of a young adult returning to childhood memories.
interesting as it fills in the background and clearly a look back of what was going on at that time in history!
The timeliness of the discovery and publication of this book reveals God's Spirit at work. The insights into the issues of Scout's day reveal how little and how far we have come, both in matters of law and social justice. Many of Atticus' fears have borne fruit. The constitution is trampled more by the congress and supreme court every year, and the black family has become an oxymoron throughout much of the United States.<br/>The timing of this book's discovery could not have been better, and one can only hope it will start a better discussion about the issues that face our nation and our home.
I read To Kill A Mockingbird a few weeks ago for the first time. I think the detail of that book was enchanting and gripped the reader into the world Lee set out to create. Go Set A Watcman was good, however compared to TKAM it rather more a summary of the events that place in a small timeframe following Scout's return home as a young adult. I was only attached to the characters because I had just read the "first" book, it was definitely written in multiple POVs and used an ancient southern language, neither were too distracting and didn't take away from the story. It was a quick read-
Oh, how I wish you had written more novels...but could any be as good as To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman?  This book is about Scout finally growing up and becoming Jean Louise and realizing Atticus is not perfect, but just a man.  I felt every bit of her pain because I too thought he was perfect. I also realized (being a child in this era and also a Northerner), I had no clue as to what was really happening in the south and how their way of life was dramatically changed.  If you are about to read Go Set a Watchman, read Mockingbird again first (as I did).  One leads into the other.
Well, to be honest with you, I could not get through the first half of the book. I prefer more narrative rather than dialog of he said she said. Not much action going on at first to grab my attention and being that it was written as it was, male/female relationships and roles have changed so much that there's a lot of irrelevance. That said, I enjoyed TKM very much, but this "follow up" should have been published back then or a lot sooner than now in order to be more current with views. Chances are, being HL, the novel will end up great but I don't have the inkling to sit through it.
Prose was uneven and ear from the standard set by To Kill a Mockingbird.  I don't think Harper Lee wrote this.
To kill a mockingbird is so much better. This novel should have been left undisturbed in the safe deposit box.
disappointing, dull, it should have stayed where it was all these years,but i spent the $ because of book club
Did not get the merit of uncle decking neice .  This was supposedly a loving family so how was this necessary?
Harper Lee's writing style is great.  This book was a good read but does not compare to her most famous book.
A reminder of the 1950's expectations for women's roles and racial divides relieved by Harper Lee's wry humor
Have to say I did not enjoy the beginning but it started to grow on me. Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.
AsFantastic.  Wonderful look into the subtleties of a woman becoming her own and xq ws losing her gods in the processad
A smalltown tale about the southern US. It is related by an omniscient narrator who indulges herself in little snippets of memories from way back. The cover for this unrevealing trip to the past is an inconclusive  final discussion about race relationships in the south but preceeded by a vast lore of dredged-up tales from the narrator's own past. The characters are mouthpieces, not credible figures. The story is rambling and the intertextual references are so artificial that the narrator draws them to the reader's attention. Varied vocabulary at the service of insubstantial content.
The story is disjointed, poorly conceived and poorly edited, and ruins one of the best characters is literary history. I've no doubt this book was never supposed to be published.
Fun summer reading. It got me talking about divides in families over race
Leaves the reader with lots to think about. I would definitely recommend.
Excellent writing, I probably wasnt the target audience but I can still recognize excellent craft mastery when I see it. I must admit that I did get caught up in the "oh my gosh! Harper Lee's unpublished novel is finnally out!" Hysteria, I should have taken more time to really research it first. But nevertheless, i'm still glad I bought such a large piece of literary history, and would suggest adding it to anyone serious about their collection, or simply anyone who has pent up agression about society's short comings and likes to read loaded writing with an alterior motive.
While some people might regard this book as just emptying the vaults to make more money, having now finally finished the book it's plain to me that this book and its message are absolutely essential to the canon of 20th century American literature.  I actually lament that we were forced to wait so long before being able to finally read it.  I feel considerably robbed by that, quite frankly.
What a wonderful insight into the creative process of Harper Lee! It's fascinating to trace the various aspects of her characters with this backward look...what they evolved to has firm root in their younger years. Graham Greene's opening line in "The End of the Affair" is true for Harper Lee's "Mockingbird" and "Watchman." ----"A story has no beginning or end:  arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead." This novel's humor is compelling and is one of the highlights I most enjoyed.
I loved this book. You have to think about the time it was written, and I loved meeting the grown up Scout.
A good read with many literary references but hard to believe it was written prior to her more famous book.
Definitely written in Harper Lee's style. Enjoyable, but not quite as good a plot as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Great sequel.  What a great story of our times as a people and a nation.  Life presented in verbal pictures
I was disappointed. I understand now why it was originally rejected and Ms Lee was encouraged to try again.
If you read it with the understanding that it is a first draft, and not a complete work, it is a good read.
A complex, masterful, and moving literary treasure! A must-read for anyone who loves To Kill a Mockingbird!
All the reviews comparing this work to TKAM is ridiculous.  TKAM was the result of thoughtful, professional editors working with Lee to develop what is arguably, one of the great literary works of all time.  A manuscript abandoned can never be compared to a work that has been worked over and over to tighten the narrative and develop characters.  This is a fine story.  I enjoyed it, especially the reveal of Atticus as just a man of his time.  Not great.  But not bad.  TKAM is the classic.  Watchman a raw reflection of a unseasoned author.  We should all be okay with that.
I'm a big fan of To Kill A Mockingbird, and was so excited to read Go Set A Watchman.  It started off a little slow and rough, but after a chapter or two, it was a smooth read and I found it difficult to put down.  The story seemed a little choppy at points, as if Ms. Lee had left out some details that might have made for a more complete plot, but considering this wasn't a novel that had been through a complete editing process prior to being published, it's nicely done.  I felt the ending was a bit abrupt, but overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others.
Could not wait to for my e copy to arrive. This book is so well written and perfectly describes the mid 50's way of thinking. Don't want to spoil the story for anyone else, so I won't give in depth details. To me this book perfectly represents and explains, what so many people thought was the right thing to do at the time, regardless of ethnicity. It should not make you hate Atticus, Calpurnia, Scout, or any other character from the book.  To me it is about growing up and realizing as humans none of us are perfect and things are not always what we remembered as a child.
I was prepared to dislike GSAW upon hearing of its release but was determined to read it nonetheless. Although the book was in dire need of someone sitting down with it with a good editing pencil, I found myself enjoying it. Now, it is not a To Kill A Mockingbird, by any means, but I think it serves as a good companion to that book. TKAM is seen from a child's idealistic viewpoint. GSAW is seen from an adult perspective. Atticus was Scout's unblemished hero and Jean Louise's disappointing but real/3 dimensional parent. GSAW is proof again that you can't go home again.
I couldn't wait for the release of Go Set A Watchman, since TKAM is one of my all-time favorite books.  Had read all the pans of this book before my copy arrived. so wasn't expecting it to be a stellar read.  However, I enjoyed reading it from a purely sentimental point of view.  It's not the book that TKAM is, but reading it is not the beat-down that some other reviewers would have you think.  If you read it because you love Harper Lee and the way she turns a phrase, you won't be disappointed.  If you're looking for a book of the same calibre as TKAM, keep looking.
interesting to find out what happened to family even though this was written before To Kill A Mockingbird.
Boring book;pretty sure I never completed reading the dull account of some boring people in a boring town.
A truely emotional journey of becoming an adult individual with firm, right but ahead of time convictions.
I thought it well written & fairly accurate portiat depection of race relation at the time.  I enjoyed it.
The characters were great but I was disappointed with the tantrums. It was unsophisticated in its telling.
This is not an exceptionally well written book. It really needed editing. However, the story was wonderful
Of was good. According to my expectations. It came into the range, but nearly the highest limit. It was Ok
I just did not think the story held my attention. Maybe because I knew where it was going most of the book
It is not as well written as I had hoped. The book is ok, but certainly not another To Kill a Mockingbird.
I found it a very readable, honest and engaging story. A family tale, very much of its time. I enjoyed it.
I wanted so badly to love this book. Unfortunately, I disliked it almost all the way through it.  I waited and waited for the story line to appear - only to find it in the last few pages. The conversation was largely boring - if not completely incomprehensible.  As has been said in other places, only the flashbacks held any interest for me; those seemed to be written by an entirely different hand than the body of the book.<br/>Rats...I spent good money on this book. I guess I'll leave it in the breakroom at work, and keep someone else from wasting their money.
Interesting as a study of a talented editor's influence on a mediocre first draft of a truly great novel.
Abrupt ridiculous ending but up until last 10 pages book wonderful. No where near To Kill A Mockingbird~!
It was difficult to get into, but improved a bit to the end. I can see why it was sent back for revision.
A better read than its critics give Lee credit for but certainly not in the same league with Mockingbird.
Starts a bit slowly...picks up speed as you go. Remarkable depiction of  the racial attitudes of the day.
Disappointed.
Lacked a plot
Underwhelming
Disappointing
Not worth it.
Disappointing
I really question if this is the same author as To Kill a Mockingbird.
I enjoyed the book very much.  I did not find the changes in Atticus Finch unusual at all.  Most of us are complex individuals  and that was the case with Atticus.  He was a student of the law and as such he had defended a man wrongfully accused.  That respect for the law did not mean that he was not overwhelmed and distressed by the changes in his society.  It can be difficult for us to understand that the society that we have loved and supported will probably not survive us.  I loved the book and thought it was an excellent squeal to To Kill a Mockingbird.
Forget current political correctness when you are reading this novel.  It illustrates life in the south in the 1950s and does it well because it was written then; it shows the thinking patterns of what was the current day. Though it was written before Lee's first novel, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, the characters in this novel, the same ones who are in MOCKINGBIRD, are now grown.
I really, really wanted to love this book.  As a long time fan of To Kill A Mockingbird, I got so excited & even pre-ordered this.  After reading it, I could see why the publisher sent it back, why it ended up lost for so long.  There are the threads of an amazing book here but they never come together.  Harper Lee rambles on and on for the first half developing characters before finally delving into a plot.  At the end, it feels like there is a panic to close the story and it results in an unconvincing close.  Only nostalgia makes me give this 2 stars...
Really enjoyed this book - really made you think about how you would have reacted in those circumstances
A true description of the deep south in the 60's and a worthy sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird."
I really didn.t enjoy the book as much a s  I though I wood.  I don't know I expected but that wasn't it
I finally broke down and checked out Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee from the library. I am SO GLAD I didn't buy this book. It is absolutely horrible! It advocates racism, brutality against women, and ironically accuses anyone who disagrees with racism as being the bigot. Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird was a real hero; a model of kindness, compassion, and courage. Over the last half century he became a symbol of what a good person can aspire to be in difficult circumstances. With the racial tensions and explosions occurring across our country today we need symbols like that. Instead this metaphorical role model for justice and equality has been destroyed. His character has been sullied as Ms. Lee turned him from being an ideal that could be looked up to into a racist who believes in segregation because "black people are not smart enough to make choices for themselves and others". The fact this book was published and so many bookstores not only encouraged people to buy it but held events promoting it is all the more sad knowing greed has yet again triumphed over common decency. With all the boycotts, parades, riots, etc that have been going on to make people see the racial divide I am honestly surprised no one is calling out this book for being the racist crapfest that it obviously aspired to be.
This isn't "To Kill a Mockingbird." However, I learned a lot about the south during the 1960's.
Enjoyed reading about Scout as a grown women but the book could not compare with To Kill A Mockingbird.
Was not impressed. All the hype for it and I couldn't get past the first chapter. Boring and confusing.
I am not quite finished with the book but so far am enjoying it even though parts of it are disturbing.
Very good read as a stand alone book and without trying to make comparisons with To Kill a Mocking Bird
Well-written, but considering To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books, this is underwhelming.
I truly enjoyed reading this book.  Comments I had heard from others proved to be wrong.  I felt this book was realistic for the place and time described.  The writing held my interest and I was pleased with the insights gained.  I'm not one to review books and tell the story. No need.  One must also consider the time when the book was originally written and the "world" views of the folks in Maycomb County at that time. I would recommend the book for those interested in the history of the most challenging issue in American society today.
Thank you Harper Lee for keeping a wonderful surprise so many years!
Nice to see Scout's ideas of being an adult now and how she feels about the issues from her home town.
Interesting to read about the further lives of the Finches. Just okay - no great literary masterpiece.
Not as good as Mockingbird but interesting for its insight into Ms. Lee's earlier thoughts about life.
Not nearly as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird" but in my opinion no other books can be as good.
A shame that she didn't go back and finish this book. The makings are here for a truly important work.
The themes and concepts are better than the plot. It was a fast read, and I don't regret the purchase.
so wonderful to read the first novel by an American icon. More about attaining adult hood than racism.
Get over the hype about the racism. I'm saying it's not about racism and I myself am African American. It's more basic than that. You the reader, will be having the same experiences as the main character in the book. The publisher was completely correct to have Lee publish "Mockingbird" first because it gives you the same perspective and view as Scout has in this book. Just read it. Sometimes it gets bogged down with references you can't even Google or with dialogue that's a bit too wordy. But it's the raw experience of it. It's masterful.
In my humble opinion, no book could live up to To Kill a Mockingbird, but Go Set a Watchman was incredible! I hear a lot of negative reviews saying things like, "Atticus is racist in this book! It's so contradictory to the first one!" I believe that's the whole point. This novel is Scout reflecting on her childhood and coming to terms with the fact that her father is not the perfect man she thought he was. Atticus was always racist she discovers early on, and that is something she spends the novel coming to terms with. Bravo, Lee!
This is an excellent read, only complaint is that it seemed to end abruptly and leave you in the air.
Too bad this wasn't edited. I'm not unhappy that I read it but just disappointed in how long it took.
Great read.  Insightful to life in a small southern town  and some of the reasoning to resist change.
I was expecting not too like this novel based on the reviews but I really liked it- a very good read!
Harper Lee should have stopped with "To Kill a Mocking Bird".  Didn't kill it with this book.
Didn't love it, but I really didn't think I could anyway. Ms. Lee's editors were right to send her back to the writing table after this work was turned in, so she could go on to create the wonderfully inspiring story of "To Kill a Mockingbird". It was an interesting exercise to read this book and see where it all began, but it was not an enjoyable exercise.
Harper Lee's prose is to be treasured, as is her essential message that life is often, if not always, far more complex than we'd like.  Far from reducing the esteem in which Atticus has been held, justifiably, for so long, she gives us a more complete man whose love for his daughter knows no bounds.<br/><br/>Miss Jean Louise is most definitely Scout, or vice versa, and she is to be loved and admired, but additionally we get to know Atticus' brother Dr, Finch--and what a character he is.<br/><br/>This book is a gem, pun intended.
Most of it does not seem to be written in Harper Lee's style of writing. Certainly a true Southern daughter who adored her father would never speak to him the way the adult Scout did. Small portions seem true to her writing. If I knew nothing about the book and just picked it up to read, I'd guess that it had been written by 2 different people who then just kind of slipped in the writings of one and then slipped in the writings of the other to fill out the book.  Very disappointing. two stars simply for the "true" passages.
Don't be swayed by public manufactured controversy --  read the book. It's not so overtly political or shocking as you've been lead to believe. It would actually be more unrealistic if a man of that time and place did not accommodate other powerful members of the community. At any rate, Atticus is not the star of the show, Jean Louis is (grown up Scout). In my opinion, her character is not as true to life, however. It says little about her experiences in New York to explain why she has such different views than the other townsfolk.
Was hoping for a bit more. Easy read, but not in the range of to kill a mockingbird. Bit pedestrian.
I can understand why it was initially rejected by the publisher. I thought too many subplots without the intrigue of "Mockingbird"
It was slow and when it finally got interesting it ended.  To Kill a Mockingbird was so much better.
Needed an editor. I liked the story, but not the overly wordy dialog. I'm glad I read this one, too.
I like Harper Lee's writing.  I thought the points she made were valid and I did enjoy her opinions.
I liked this  book it showed changing times.  Showed the attitudes in different locations in the US.
Interesting perspective. Looks back at To Kill A Mockingbird. Scout gains many insights to the past.
Miss Lee was right to resist the publication of this early effort.  Mockingbird is so much stronger.
My mother cried when she reached the end of the novel! A sequel to "To Catch a Mockingbird".
Seems unfinished and apologetic - or maybe just hard to understand what point Lee is trying to make.
I had high hopes for this sequel as TKAM is my favorite book and movie of all time.  I am up to page 100 and have not gotten into story yet.  The dialogue about Dill and the background of Maycomb I skimmed right through.  I do not know if I will finish it.  I had such high hopes because of the hype and because this manuscript had just surfaced.  Like with theater and movies, the more people rave the more you feel stupid not going along with public opinion.  Yes Harper Lee is a great writer but I am waiting for the plot to unfold.
should have never been published. Dishonest publisher promoted it.
Simply a wonderful read.  It reminds of parts of my own childhood.
In reading Go Set a Watchman, I have laughed; I have cried. I have prayed. I have thought about my father.  I have thought about my mother; I have thought about growing up in the south. I have put Gregory Peck's face on my father and my father's face on Gregory Peck. I don't know if you'll be disappointed in the "new" Atticus. I don't know if more editing would have made this a better book  I don't know if this book was supposed to have been replaced  I know one thing for sure... everyone I know needs to read this book.
As I started to read this book itself as warm and familiar as an old tennis shoe.  As I read further, it began to curl up like a rattlesnake until it finally lashed out, striking me to the core.  This was NOT a book about Atticus and Scout-- it was about me!  Harper Lee was able to catch my life, my growth, my parental disconnect and put it on paper.
Forget the hype, forget the dismissals - this is a very good book, but very different from To Kill a Mockingbird, covering much of the same ground but two decades later.  I don't want to ruin your read by revealing the plot, but it will surprise you.  Warning: the book may be troubling not because Atticus but because of Scout (Jean Louise).  I would like to give a full review, but instead will discuss it with others who have actually read the book.  If you have not, put your prejudices on hold & do yourself a favor - read it.
Just not the book that To Kill a Mockingbird was.  Dialogs were tedious and descriptions were flat.
The ending was a bust. Hard to believe this one was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird".
I haven't been able to finish this book.  It's not engaging and I don't really like the characters.
Well written, deep, and a lot to think about. I have a whole new view point to explore. Great book.
Sorry just not up to the standards I expected. I can see why she didn't go forth with it years ago.
This book would not have made it if not for the fact it was written by Harper Lee. The first almost 50% of the book is a total write off with the second half primarily dedicated to Jean Louises' almost appalling immaturity, blubbering about how backwards Alabama is compared to New York and how she needs to "find herself". It has some fine touches, even some fine paragraphs and the writing is what one might expect of Ms. Lee - very good. Too many times one simply wants to slap Jean Louise and yell Grow Up Girl!
Oh, my!  How do you rate Harper Lee's novel?  I think you have to look at it as the first draft of her wonderfully marvelous book, To Kill a Mockingbird.  It's not really too good when considered as a stand alone piece.  I kind of wish I hadn't read it, but I did, and I guess I'll just consider it a piece of the development toward Mockingbird.
Totally not what I expected after having read To Kill a Mockingbird.  Harper Lee is a fantastic author and this book just reinforces that.  Atticus and Scout are well developed characters and it is interesting to see the South in a time of change.  I don't want to ruin it, but Atticus is not the man I expected after reading TKaM.  Great book!
I had so much fun reading this book.  I came into the reading of this novel as something that really did not connect with TKAM.  That made it better.  The realizations that Scout has to overcome and understand made it very easy to relate to.  Learning about all of the different laws and what was happening at the time was an eye opening experience.  This book made me think a little more about my own thoughts and how I come to think about the outside world.  As long as you don't expect TKAM, you will enjoy this book.
An incredibly well written book.  Harper Lee is a master at exploring the nuances and facets of a complex concept from so many different angles, providing justice and compassion in her exploration of the themes.  Step back and read not as a comparison to Mockingbird but as a complementary story that augments the themes of culture, racism, prejudice, ignorance, naivety, relationships, equity, equality, and family.  I just finished and am sitting in awe, contemplating going back to page 1 and starting all over again.
Reads as a first draft. Odd use of punctuation and rather flat characters. I read the first chapter and quit because no author should have to expose a first draft. Harper Lee must have been taken advantage of for sheer money because of her name and status. Don't buy or read this book.  You'll be disappointed with content and angry at publishers and all others who brought it to print. Travesty against a woman in her later years who is said to not have all her previous cognitive capacities. Shame on them. Bless her.
dissaponting
Disappointed
Not worth it
Unsatisfying
Good book - must read it at least once - read it, its better than any review written about it : )
Slow but steady read but then picked up at the middle and picked up momentum and race to the end.
I expected more.  It came off as more of a lecture than a story.
I understand now why she didn't publish it.  I was disappointed.
This was much better than previous reviews had led me to expect.
Despite others feelings of disappointment,  I loved the book. This was.a time when I was a young person and lived in the same era as Harper Lee.  We don't change history even as much as we find it offensive. My experiences of racist people were very upsetting to me also as they were in my own family and they were my loved ones.  Unfortunately it was very common for my age group and so many of my friends had the same situation to contend with.  Did we agree with them - no - did we love our older generation - yes.
Great Book. Easy Read. Will hit home for anyone raised in the South who is over 50, especially. In my opinion, one should read Watchman first, and then read (or re-read) Mockingbird. Watchman stands alone, and Mockingbird serves as a prequel, giving both stories deeper meaning. Of course, I live close to Monroeville AL, and have a friend who went to school with Nell, so it's particularly special for me. I've ordered the boxed set, to keep as an heirloom, as I expect Watchman will take feet like Mockingbird did.
This book is one that must be read more than once in order to capture each and every level- it is that deep. Lee takes the reader on a wild roller coaster ride that ends in the most reasonable way, making us understand society as it was in the 1950s but also what makes us all tick at the most basic level. She also shows us the better angels of our human nature in her beloved characters when dealing with the south's ingrained attitudes regarding racism. another classic set 20 years after To Kill a Mockingbird.
There's no question that, if you enjoy Harper Lee, you'll enjoy this book. It was a bit of a roller coaster ride because I had some difficulty accepting parts of the novel but, if you hang in there, it all comes together nicely. I hate that I teared up at more than a few parts but I'm glad I did because that's what makes this a solid piece of literature in my book! There are a lot of wonderful ideas to ponder throughout this novel and Harper Lee makes the process incredibly enjoyable. Read it, you'll like it.
This has to be the worst book I have ever read. I couldn't wait to read it, and then had to force myself to finish. It is the Seinfeld of books. Nothing happens. Scout is a spoiled brat. All she does is whine and complain. I just could not believe how unlike Mockingbird it was. It was like a different writer wrote Watchman. All this stress on Scout about what is happening in Maycomb. So Uncle Jack smacks her in the face and all is well. No wonder Harper Lee never published this rubbish, if she even wrote it.
I understand why the revised version won all the acclaim. This seemed bit rough and difficult to understand, didn't convey the message I think Harper Lee probably intended to give about her perceptions. The final version as seen through a child's eyes reflected her maturity as I recall from reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" many years ago
Eh, dragging monologues that lead to nothing. It's okay overall though, once you get past those.
Had trouble gettting into the story!  Not as good as her other book!  Considered it just so-so !
Disappointing. Character development was poor and the storyline just too thin to be captivating.
This was nowhere as good as the first book.  But it provided an ending to the first book anyway.
An excellent story. It's a sequel to,  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Well written in Harper Lee style.
If I had read this first, I never would have read To Kill a Mockingbird.  Totally disapppointing
I just could not get interested in this book, I expected so much! May be if I ever finish it ...
Not much happens in this novel. I never read To Kill a Mockingbird, but saw and loved the movie.
After all the hype, I loved the book.  I always thought Harper Lee was a keen observer of all things Southern.  This book confirmed it and managed to give me the benefit of a truly Southern voice from a New York point of view.  We are given a new way to understand the complex race relations and sectoral differences that continue to divide our country today.  There are a lot of Atticus Finches left for us to discover and if we "go set a watchman" we may find ourselves disappointed in a lot of them!!!
Dismal, disjointed,<br/>disappointing...and then it got worse.
Difficult to follow plot.  Rambled on too much.  Not good read!
Enjoyed all the differences in style..but truly loved the story
Always loved TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and hated GO SET A WATCHMAN!
As a long-time fan of "To Kill a Mockingbird" I was greatly disappointed in the quality of writing in "Go Set a Watchman": I cannot believe that Ms. Lee in her right mind would have approved this book's release.  The writing at times is amateurishly cringe-worthy.  At best it can be written off as juvenilia.  I hold no grudge toward Ms. Lee, however, as few writers don't experience an awkward phase and, in any event, "To Kill a Mockingbird" remains a classic of American fiction.
It was ok and I enjoyed it but I understand why they made her rewrite. This pales next to TKAM.
Loved the book as much as I did To Kill a Mocking Bird.  Great character build and plot layout.
Just okay-does have some interesting commentary re southern thoughts and views on civil rights.
Scouts return to her hometown is a heartbreaking to her , not what she remembered. A good read.
Enjoyed the book - a good read - I think I was expecting way more due to all the hype going on.
Great read.  Only problem was that it far too short.  I was eager for more when the book ended.
I'm no scholar so I'll keep this simple. I was shocked and initially disappointed in the direction of this book, but that's the point isn't it? Bigotry is ugly, and the history of bigotry in the south is the ugliest. This book challenged me to consider the many layers of complexity beyond a simple right and wrong. I feel blessed to have read this book and to have faced this issue through Scout's eyes and heart. Read this book; you'll be sad but moved. You will want everyone you know to read this book.
To Kill... was a novel with clear lines between right and wrong. The world was a little simpler. Atticus was a hero. Scout, Jem and we readers worshipped at his alter.<br/>In Go Set... Scout grows up, the world sees two wars and is in the Atomic age. The lines in this world are blurry. Atticus's image too. We realize he is all too human. There is no Boo but the nostalgia of that older defined world hovers throughout. It's a good read though.<br/>I read it on the Kindle. Had no issues with the book.
Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee<br/>Purchased: Target - $16.99 [Original Price $27.99]<br/>My Rating: 5 of 5 Stars<br/><br/>Spoilers!<br/><br/>What's it all about?<br/>We are plummeted into the future that is Scout, Jean Louise Finch’s, life at the age of 26. She has returned home to Maycomb, Alabama from her steady life in New York. She is there to visit her agin father Atticus, and while there she is thrown into the mists of tension of civil rights as well as political turmoil. These new additions to her life cause Jean Louise to figure out who she really is, and learn that it is ok to have your own opinions in life. It’s a part of growing up, and that exactly what this book entails. Just how much of a woman has Scout grown into?<br/><br/>The Best Parts:<br/>I loved everything about this novel. The second I bought it I cried from happiness. This has been a long time coming and I just needed something to sooth my soul. It helped a lot that Jean Louise was 26, very close to my own age. I was able to relate to her so much as a young woman, even though I times are different. The writing style for this novel was fantastic as it stayed in third person the whole novel, but focused on the person that needed to at the same time. I also loved the use of flashbacks especially to help us see what had happened in our time gap between now and twenty years ago. This novel does great as a companion novel since it doesn’t take away from To Kill a Mockingbird, but adds more to the lives we had already gotten a glimpse into. I loved the story line of not just the political aspects going on in the south at this point in time, but the fact that the people Jean thought she knew changed while she had moved away, and it takes the entire novel for her to realize that she had changed as well. This is a great becoming of age novel, and I recommend it to anyone who has those thoughts of what am I doing with my life, and why do I feel so different form everyone else. It spoke directly to my soul, and that of the fact that I have al lot of the same attitude of Jean. When she stands up to Henry and her father I couldn’t help but cheer and feel so proud, just as her own father does. I couldn’t have asked for more form this novel; it was everything I wanted, and nothing that I expected.<br/><br/>The Worst Parts:<br/>There was nothing bad about this novel in any way shape or form. The only thing I must say is that there is one part that captures my heart and holds it there for a long time. I didn’t break because of it, but I didn’t feel great. The first time it comes up in the novel is at the beginning, but the more it comes up that more I just can’t wrap my mind around it, but I think it’s because Jean can’t either. Jem’s death comes at a shock to us all, but I think it stays in that shell shock state because Jean hasn’t fully accepted it as well either. It if fully confirmed of her standpoint on the death within the last part of the book, and it just solidified the growth within her, but how much she still has left to grow as well.<br/><br/>Final thoughts:<br/>To Kill a Mockingbird was one of my first classic literature novel that I had read and I fell in love with it. It was the writing style, the characters, the lessons, everything about it was perfect. So when I heard this novel was going to be releasing this year I freaked out. I needed to have it and needed to learn more about this world that changed my love for literature all together. I woke up this morning at 8am, went and bought the book, and finished it at 3pm. I couldn’t stop. I needed to know everything and I updated my friends on Facebook as I continued my journey. I can’t wait to be able to talk to my friends about this book and all that there is to it. I have read some of the reviews for this novel, and the ones that give it 1 star I feel couldn’t have loved Harper Lee’s first novel. If you love To Kill a Mockingbird then I know this will hit your soul, and if you didn’t then don’t read it. That simple. Harper Lee has filled my heart with a new kind of love and profoundness for literature, and by far this is the best novel I have read in many years.
I read this for a book club meeting. It was OK, but I felt that it lacked a little continuity.
I found the book to have no plot and boring to read . Do not know what all the hype was sbout.
Harper Lee is wonderful, but I should have left the story with "To Kill A Mockingbird"
A very accurate portrayal of the south during that time, and sadly some attitudes still today.
Doesn't get to the real meat of the story until halfway through book.  Also, it not very long.
Evocatively written. Thoughtful. Good to be back in Scout's world even though it is tarnished.
This book is an amazing book and so is the author. She captured Alabama in such a detailed yet unconditionally true manner. The book was far ahead of its time when being wrote and even in how to kill a mockingbird. Harper Lee you are an amazing author, you have seemingly wrote a book that is so vivid it made me feel as if I was part of Louise Finch's life. You have created a book that will like your other live on throughout time as a literary masterpiece. I highly recommend this amazing book.
I was disappointed in this book.  It was not near as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Good easy read, although I found the ending was lacking for me. Otherwise I enjoyed this book
I think her older sister gave her good advice when she suggested she put the manuscript away.
Well written....characters believable. ...enjoyed..but quite as much as To Kill a Mockingbird
contrary to the pundits, I thought the story was well written
Loved the book. Beautiful writing style and a realistic story
I definitely did enjoy this book!! I would say that "To Kill A Mockingbird" is still a better book but this one was still fun to read and I enjoyed the parts where Scout was reminiscing of the past. There were also a few parts in this that was a bit depressing but the overall story is excellent!! I withheld a star from this review because I think the book should have been edited better. It is still enjoyable none the less!! I couldn't put it down!! I would definitely recommend!!
A very Interesting time line!  Is the government infringing on  #States Rights.  Harper Lee brings into a view how the government and NAACP may not be beneficial to the individuals receiving welfare benefits.  Harper has shown interesting flashbacks that shows how previous historical events in our lives can effectively channel our thinking in the present.  I will now read "To Kill a Mocking Bird"  I did enjoy this book that was left un-published for so many years!  Read and Enjoy!!!!!!
To Kill a Mockingbird was much better, to me.  This book did not hold your interest as well.
Hard to read and enjoy the characters after the gem tha was "To Kill A Mockingbird."
I guess my expectation was set too high.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books.
It definitely not as good as Mockinig bird, and i really wish she had not written  this one.
It needs to be read with an open mind and an understanding of the times. It is well written.
Excellent portrayal of southern life at a turning point in our history. Wonderfully written.
I fell in love with Scout many years ago, when I first read "To Kill A Mockingbird". This "sequel" (A few plot points don't quite match) was written first and seems more of an apologetic than anything else. It all works towards "Everything was getting better until those Damn Yankees interfered"
While I don't in any way think that it measures up to To Kill a Mockingbird, if the explanation of when and how this book came to be written and never published is true, it is a very good first novel . It was surprising to see some of the plot twists foreshadowed in this book that were made before TKAM was accepted and published, especially because they were major catalysts for much of its plot. Judging it just on its own merit and putting aside any expectations, it was a good read.
This book is a must read after reading To Kill a Mockingbird
The book reads as if it may have been a draft and not a finished novel. If you have read To Kill a Mockingbird, then as you  read this book, you can appreciate the manner in which Harper Lee developed into an acclaimed author. She shows her gift of story telling through some very funny stories yet at times the writing rambles. It seems that Go Set a Watchman was a necessary piece of writing that allowed the author to explore the characters that we so love in To Kill a Mockingbird.
It's difficult to compete with "To Kill a Mockingbird" and the quality of the writing in this book does not. I found it to be a bit disjointed and filled with obscure references. In addition, the premise that Scout lived to her mid-twenties with absolutely no clue that Atticus was a bigot is hard to believe.
I enjoyed it. Not as good as Mockingbird, but it was good to live with the characters again
I felt it did not measure up to her first book. At times I had trouble following the theme.
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD IS A SPECIAL MEMORY. IT WAS GREAT TO RE-VISIT SOME OF THE CHARACTERS.
Am about half way through reading the book.  It is very well written and very entertaining.
Love the subtle nuances of the underlying racial quality but hated the ending, wanted more.
Her comprehension of the old south was incredible, however the story itself wasn't as good.
Not my favorite book.  It was difficult to get into and the story itself was disappointing.
I was disappointed in the book.It did not have the same interest as To kill a Mocking Bird.
Not as good as I had hoped. This book had several of the same passages from the first book.
A book that at the end of the day is somewhat flawed by its dated nature. Atticus has turned into a garden variety racist; like many of his real-life counterparts, he sees the South in the post-brown vs board of education era as an exceptional place which should be immune from the de-segregation movement that was burgeoning. The book is flawed because it ends too abruptly and doesn't give us significant closure to the Atticus-Scout debate. We could use another 75 pages, Ms. Lee.
Dearly loved her style of writing.  All you folks out there that grew up in a small town or community should, by all means, read this book.  You will have several chuckles and memories to pop up in your mind.  It is my understanding that this manuscript was lost for years, but turned up and was printed into a book.  Thank goodness it turned up and on top of that is a best seller .....too boot.  Thank you Harper Lee!!!  The way this book ended, so we dare look for another sequel?
This book was not much more than a retelling of Scout's childhood memories and an attempt to rationalize the South's (and Atticus's) reluctance to accept integration when Scout challenges them, now that she has had a taste of New York. They win her over in the end, and it hurt my wonderful memories of Mockingbird.
Absolutely amazing to read Harper Lee's beautiful writing again.  Having read To Kill a Mockingbird several times (I rarely read books more than once) I was beyond excited though hesitant when I heard about Go Set A Watchman.  How could it be as amazing as TKAM?  The opening chapter, the words, the structure, the writing style - amazing.  I was in heaven again as I had forgotten how much I loved her writing.  Highly recommend this book to all and especially to Harper Lee fans.
I loved finding out what kind of woman Scout grew up to be.
Had hope for the book but ultimately, not impressed.  The last couple of chapters fizzled.
I am still reading this book, but like Mockingbird it is very well written.  Worth a read!
I loved it. It shows that all people are human in the way they think and the way they act.
Not as bad as the reviews that came out, but lacked the subtlety of To Kill a Mockingbird.
I think it could have been awesome if given more time to develop the story.  I enjoyed it.
Great read.
Not so good
In so many ways, it is certainly not TKAMB.  The transition at the end from her preaching to Atticus one minute to Scout's realization that she was actually a narrow-minded bigot and being judgmental about a community that she no longer really understood and then to her acceptance of being a watchman and understanding how she could help was believable but all happened much too quickly for me and was not well-written.  The message should stimulate important discussions.
Book started out wonderful - drew me right in.  About 3/4 way through it took a turn and slowed down,  Overall I was disappointed with the book and can see why the publisher first refused it (at least that was the rumor I heard).  I was confused by Scout - what did she really decide?  I almost stopped reading it all together but did finish it.  If you love To Kill a Mockingbird you might not bother with this book as it tears apart those beloved characters a little bit.
I was very sorry I bought and even sorrier that I read this novel.  I thought the first 80 pages were very poorly written and I forced myself to continue.  I almost question if the same author wrote To Kill A Mockingbird and this novel.  Whole phrases lifted word for word from To Kill A Mockingbird shows that the book could have used some extensive editing.  Did anybody read this book before they decided to publish it?  I am sorry for Harper Lee.  I think there was a reason why she never wanted this published.  Perhaps the novel might have been better received in the time that it was written but it definitely is dated.  I would not recommend this book.  Cheap shot from the publisher!
Loved To Kill a Mockingbird.  This is okay but didn't have the suspense.  Kind of boring.
to kill a mocking bird is much better written  read first  the writing is a little choppy
Certainly not as good as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  I told my friends it is not a must read.
Just an okay book.  I'm glad I read it, but not on the same par as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Giving this book one star is being generous. It reads as though it was not edited at all.
Not nearly as good as TKAM. Glad I read it, but there's no way I'll be reading it yearly.
A realistic tale. Truth of how it was, and still is in the Southern states to some degree
love Harper Lee.  Her written cadence is so pleasant.  I thought this book was excellent.
a lot of hype and I do not think it will every surpass To kill a mocking bird  Ever Never
Slow moving story. Parts were hard to read. It was interesting to see  Scout as an adult.
Too slow to get<br/>Into the<br/>Plot but after  I  got to the real story it was great.
An awful sequel to one of the greatest novels of all time.
It's a draft of a novel and shouldn't have been published.
great dialogue and subjects pertinent today 55 years later
With so many reviews, I needn't wax on about my thoughts on this novel. I will say that I found the dialogue between Scout and Dr. Finch, her uncle, to be quite tedious. Since I was a young adult when the book was written, in a very different time, I tried to imagine how profound it might have been then. I think probably not as profound or as well-written as Mockingbird. It was OK but I really would not recommend it beyond the interest in the history of both books.
There are valuable lessons to be learned in the pages of this novel.  I would say Harper Lee had tremendous foresight when she wrote this book.  Some folks will read this book and get inflamed thinking it racist and demeaning, that would be the product of a very narrow mind.  I feel the book has been released at its proper time.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the book and I hope everyone else will.  If they rise above backward thinking they will see the story for its value.
While many readers of Watchman are disappointed and even offended by the change in the character of Atticus.  He was a paragon of virtue in To Kill a Mockingbird, but he is a more complex character in Watchman.<br/><br/>As seen through the eyes of an adult Scout, Atticus' complexity is an outrage.  Here we have a generational juxtaposition between idealism and pragmatism.<br/><br/>What I gained from Watchman was a deeper understanding of 21st century racism.
I just didn't like it.  Could not get into this book. I regretted I downloaded the book.
I'm an avid reader....surprised I found it difficult at times to follow this story line.
Not bad, I can see why it was reworked for the late 1950's. Seems like an abrupt ending.
I did not enjoy this book, just did not move fast enough for me, not my type of reading.
I'm glad I read it - but it was rambling... Definitely good she redirected to write TKAM
Writing style is obvious. Very interesting relationships between characters. A good read
Not a great read for me.  But interesting history from the '50's.  Characters were good.
Somewhat slow beginning, but the story gets more interesting as you continue to read it.
It is not nearly as good as To Kill a Mockingbird but I did like the ending. It was good
Can only compare to To Kill A Mockingbird....and not quite as good.  But worth the read.
An unfinished draft but should never have been published.
A disappointment . There was a good reason this book was shelved by the publisher . Had I not read To Kill a Mockingbird, the characters would be bland. Did not think they were really developed in the first book. Reading it now at least you knew who and what they were., to me the book was boring, thought it would have more history of the  trail and  what went on during the trail. Love a To Kill A Mockingbird, and I will just forget the  Go  Set A Watchman.
Nowhere near the quality of "To Kill a Mockingbird". A bit of a disappointment.
Having found TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD an all time favorite, I found this a disappointment.
Much to do about a blah novel. However,  I have not finished it as it has been so dull!
enjoying seeing Scout all grown up, her father taught her well,<br/>he is not a racist
Not a fan. Too slow for me. Call me shallow, but so are the characters and the writing.
Slow in the beginning.  It took some time to get into the book, however I did enjoy it.
I'm not as disappointed as many critics by Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman, but I don't feel like there was much of a plot. It's an interesting view of southern attitudes in the late 50s. I do think that Go Set a Watchman and To Kill a Mockingbird should be combined as one story, one book. This would allow dear Atticus to be seen as the multi layered character he is, rather than that all good or all bad that happens from reading those two books separately.
Well, it was an interesting read, but not up to the standrd of "To Kill a Mockingbird". There was a lot of ranting on social issues, and I believe she seriously tried to show the very real birth pangs of a new and differnt society, where there was long tradition of one, and the growing turmoil of another. She stated both fairly well, but the pathos of "To Kill a Mockingbird" was not really there. Decent read, though, all things considered.
If you expected Mockingbird, this is not it.  But you can revisit some old friends like Jem and Dill and Calpurnia, but they are only names. You will meet her uncle and a serious boyfriend not in Mockingbird. I thought the angst over the racial situation was drawn out and came to a slightly lame resolution.<br/><br/>But the language was crisp, and there is humor and humanity throughout.  But I missed Boo Radley.  I hope they don't make a movie of it.
I was very excited about this book since I am such a fan of "To Kill a Mockingbird," teaching it in my English classes for years. I knew that it was an earlier work, so it might not be as good as her later, brilliant effort. That is an understatement. It was lackluster to say the least.
Not as bad as everyone said. But seriously how do you follow up to kill a mockingbird?
did harper lee write this book for sure, it lacks the poetry of to kill a mocking bird
It was good but was hoping it would have ended different. Wish they had put Boo in it.
Very good book would recommend to anyone who has read " to Kill a mockingbird"
Lots of hype. Very disappointed in this storyline and racial environment at that time.
At times I thought the story could have used more editing to have made it flow better.
Good story, but in my opinion, doesn't come close to "To Kill a Mocking Bird".
Interesting? Didn't love it, but glad I decided to read it, since a huge fan of TKAMB.
I enjoyed the book up untIl the confrontation between Scout and Atticus. It was too preachy and the aftermath was just strange. Harper Lee's editor made a good suggestion to rewrite it for 20 years earlier.  And I can see why Harper Lee did not want to publish this book - not nearly as good...
This Book was such a let down after reading To Kill A Mockingbird. It seemed to ramble on and on . There was a lot of repitition of the first book .I am from Alabama and can understand a lot of the racial injustice and predudice that the author ranted about but it seemed she did just that ranted and raved . Another thing I did not like about this book was, the first 70 pages rambled on about her return to her old home town but went no where with it.
Can I give it half a star? Or less? This was so disappointing. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, as I had heard some negative buzz before I read the book. But out of admiration for Harper Lee and my affection for To Kill a Mockingbird, I felt I ought to try it anyway. It was painful to read. I did not enjoy the writing style, the plot or the characters. I was so glad when it was over. Truly, I have nothing good to say about Go Set a Watchman.
When I wade through all of the rubbish these days that is referred to as literary fiction,I find myself drowning in poorly written muck.  I had pre ordered this book as soon as it was available.  Unlike the talking heads of the news,I don't feel that this book portrays Atticuss as a racist. But certainly references the difficult times in the segregationist era of mid century south. Would certain recommend to all who treasure "To Kill a Mockingbird"
As I read Go Set a Watchman, it was interesting to reflect upon the author's treatment of race relations. This book is a reality check for people who may think that they are nostalgic for simpler times.  Unfortunately, this novel reads like an incomplete work.  The characters are inconsistent, therefore unconvincing and the tale ends abruptly.  I have to agree with the reviewers suggesting that to release this book was a disservice to Harper Lee.
Not sure what all the uproar is/was about as this is the same story line, characters, setting, and images  as Lee's  Mockingbird novel.  The difference is that Scout is older and has a foul mouth.  If you read it, I think you'll say "oh, okay.....hum, hum, hum".  If you don't read it, you will not have missed anything special.  It's an easy read and a thin book, so it won't take you long to finish the book.  Just average.....not NEW news.
Many reviews I read before getting the book said that Scout discovers her father is a racist.  That says a lot more about the shallow understanding of reality on the part of the reviewers than it does about the content of the book.  To read a book written that long ago, it is really helpful to have lived several decades in America.  Life never was and never will be simple, but a lot of folks today take simplistic views and hold them to be useful.
I was a disappointed fan after I read Harper Lee's newest release. It wasn't just the hype but the fact that I was such a fan. I found the book by the Chicago Tribune writer (titled something like The Girl Next Door) to be exceptional. I liked the unapproved, Harper too.<br/><br/>Yes, I think it did a good job explaining prejudice, moving through stages of judgement of others and wisdom.<br/><br/>Thanks for the opportunity to read this book.
Really? So much fill in information just the same as "To Kill a Mockingbird."
The story is well written, however, I didn't like the way she chose to end the story.
Don"t expect another To Kill aockingbird.  C confusing which book happened first.
My 8 person book club gave it 4 0-1, 1 five and 2 sevens.<br/>Not a success at all!!
The story is interesting from a historical perspective, but the writing is not great.
DIFFERENT BUT IN SYNC WITH THE WAY SHE WROTE HER STORY I LIKED IT AND WILL REaD AGAIN
To me, this is a Coming-Into-Your-Own-Consciousness novel. I recommend this novel to anyone looking for a read on the effect of race relations in a family---especially from the father-daughter perspective. I liked the novel and I am glad I read it. I don't think you need to read To Kill a Mockingbird in order to understand this story but it gives plenty of background into the characters.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading this. Have a great day!
Please don't compare it to her other book.<br/>I can understand why it wasn't published in the 50's-60's.  If you grew up in a small town, or in the south, or in this time frame, you will know the character choices & the complexity of the times.<br/>Do not compare it to today's era.<br/>I found parts hard to read, personally speaking, but, in the end, I thought the book was well written & a very thought provoking book.  Even in today's day.
Such a disappointment after To Kill A Mockingbird. Alas, it's true: All our heroes have feet of clay.  There was nothing redeeming in this "long awaited" novel.  At least she did not drag Dill into the future and he at least remains locked in memories of better, earlier days.  If only...
I really enjoyed this book and cannot understand why some folks think it takes away from To Kill a Mockingbird.  I loved how the characters changed and evolved from the original.  Life is always changing.  You must remember the mindset of some folks from the South at that time, and how most of them have changed today.  There are those who will always be bigoted, but most of the country has moved on and are more accepting of all people today.
"Watchman" was a thoroughly enjoyable read and did not affect my feelings about "To kill a Mocking Bird ".  At first, it was difficult to accept that Watchman was written before the acclaimed novel.  But upon reflection, it seemed that the author wanted to explain why she had become so obsessed with her image of a perfect father and man.  Mockingbird depicted what Scout had perceived as a child and the times she grew up in.
Not To Kill A Mockingbird.  Half shocked it was published in our sensitive society.
Harper's easy going southern manner is so easy to read, one gets sucked right into her plot without knowing where she is going. Because it was written when politically correct language was not necessary, Harper gets her story told in a much more authentic, straightforward manner. Two extreme points of view about the Civil Rights controversy are put forward in dramatic fashion - both sides having a legitimate argument for their case.
I read this directly after reading "To Kill a Mockingbird". I felt that 'Go Set a Watchman' would not have made much impact if I had not done so. I felt that the publishers were right in having Harper Lee not have this published at the time; if it were we would never have heard of her.<br/>This is more a sequel than a prequel and is much more relevant after Mockingbird. They compliment each other in the order of publication
Lousy story.  Her  Mockingbird book carried this one.
I thought Atticus Finch was not adequately portrayed.
I was terribly disappointed with this book. Could barely finish it, in fact. It was not because of learning that Jem had died. It was not because the whole Finch family, with the exception of Scout, is racist and defined by a deep south prejudices that pigeonhole people as "our kind: white educated," "not our kind: poor white trash," and "them: the entire black population of Macomb." I was disappointed because the book was poorly written and a boring, very didactic, preachy read. One wades through long chapters of go-nowhere dialog between Jack and Atticus and Scout as the men try to justify their racist beliefs to Scout who flails, yells, and gets sick to her stomach because she feels duped by the polite southern veneer she has all of her life mistaken for her father's upright honesty.<br/>I gave it two stars rather than one because it contains one small chapter in which Scout looks back on her childhood with Jem that rings true to the writer and the character we know and love from "To Kill a Mockingbird."<br/>The sudden appearance of this manuscript in the publisher's files does not ring true to me. I suspect the "finding" of the mss and subsequent media frenzy to be a giant hoax perpetrated by the publisher and author for monetary gain. Furthermore, the publication of this manuscript has put a blot on Harper Lee's good name. The writing is mediocre and didactic, but I begin to repeat myself.
Seems like part of this novel was written by another...especially towards the end.
I didn't like the way the story just ended. There was no conclusions to the story.
Interesting. Easy to understand why her editor sent her back to the drawing board.
Surprisingly disappointing.  I hope she didn't leave any more out there like this.
You can tell this was her first effort.  Good for a first novel but no Mockingbird
I fully understand why this manuscript was not release at the time it was written.
This is obviously an early concept that led to Mockingbird. It is not fully fleshed out or realized and is disjointed in many ways. The writing is not nearly the final quality of TKAM. I have read both and played Atticus on stage. It is no surprise to me that Atticus was racist in his time and place and anyone who read it differently was laying on their own hopes to the character. Academically interesting but not a great read.
Great read
Good read.
Tremendous
Excellent.
I know many people haven't liked this but I thought it was excellent for her first book ever written. Times have changed and My Mother says this was a truer depiction of those times when she was growing up. Good coming of age story where a young girl finds out the truth about the chivalrous but phony veil men wore in the south then. Some still do. Also the rigid roles and abusive treatment for women are accurately portayed
It is Harper Lee but this was no Mockingbird.  It does give one food for thought.
I love Harper Lee's writing style. It takes me back to my childhood in the South.
Slow moving, which surprised me, since I remember liking the first novel so much. It's just OK, not great.
Certainly kept me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen next..
I could not get into this book - very disappointing.
So a slap in the face fixes everything?  Despicable.
I felt this book was still in the rough draft stage.
I am a huge fan of Harper Lee.  A really great book.
Perhaps the best novel I have read in the last 50 years.  Made me remember what quality writing was all about.  Erudite without pedantry.  Forces the reader to dredge up every scrap of information to which they have access.  In addition, depending on the level of rewriting that was done between the initial submission and the ultimate publication, Harper Lee deserves to be ranked as a prophet with Huxley, Orwell and Rand.
I know this received a lot of negative reviews, but I find it to be true to the time period.  A few discrepancies from To Kill a Mockingbird, but the style of writing is what you would expect from Harper Lee.  Read this in the context of the 1950's.  It also raised some interesting comparisons to the current political environment:  arguments over the Rebel flag being taken down, ultra conservative views in politics, etc.
Harper Lee overwhelms the reader with this coming of age story of the little girl now grown. So much has been written about the racism of Atticus Finch. Atticus is merely a player...the God is Scout who is divine enough to grow and realize that the clouds of her memories can only obfuscate her reality. Scout, and we, grow up but only when we slay our idols and allow human beings to be human...nothing more...nothing less.
Clear and simple this book was an early draft of a novel that eventually becam TKAM. It has good moments mixed in with some moments that clearly needed more revision. Transitions where choppy and characters where a bit different from their final versions. I would recommend reading it with the mindset that this was her original vision, a rough one, before it was polished up. Keeping that in mind, it is an enjoyable read.
Some have been outraged at this novel, but I view it as reflective of the times.
If Scout is to be the "watchman" for Maycomb's future, may God bless it.
I did not think it was quite as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, but I enjoyed it.
Forget the back story, which has gotten so much press.<br/>This narrative allows us to reengage with an adult "Scout", and the Finch family and community (with slight modifications to the storyline and characters of To Kill a Mockingbird) as they address racism and equality issues, sadly still fresh after 55 years.<br/>Reese Witherspoon breathes life into passages which, in print, would be pedantic and plodding, much as Sissy Spacek did for the " Mockingbird" audiobook.  (There's a legal discussion reminiscent of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde).<br/>" Watchman" is fairly short, and could have benefitted from further tightening. If it weren't Lee's work, it would be just another women's "coming of age" novel, albeit one with some insights into Southern white life in the wake of "Brown v. Board of Education".
I was very disappointed. there were whole paragraphs lifted from "to Kill a Mockingbird" and inserted into "Go set a watchman" Most of the book was focused on Scout coming to temrs with her Aunt and the early crush she had on Hanki. Not much about the conflict she had ove her assumption that her father was or was not a racist. It did not at all with my expectations as influenced by the marketing
I am sorry I read this book it has destroyed my love of To Kill a Mocking Bird,
did not get LARGE PRINT and my mom couldnt read them ..... I should be refunded
Although thought provoking as a novel it fails. A good editor would be helpful.
This was a fast and pleasant read. Interesting take on the 1950's in the South.
So timely for today. A great read with lots to say. I wish there were a sequel.
It was disappointing to kill a mockingbird is my favorite book I expected more
tedious to read.  Didn't finish reading.  Not as good as to kill a mockingbird
Just plain disapointed--I had such high expectations---did not even finish it.
Must know history of first book to know these of adult age are the characters.
Somewhat boring . Expectations were too high because of To Kill a Mockingbird.
The style and tone did not keep my attention as well as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Interesting to see why Lee was told to develop the character of a young Scout.
Was a little disappointed.  Good story but no "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Many of us knew we should leave well enough alone and enjoy our memories of Finch, Scout, et al. I guess we just hoped there could be another wonderful novel lurking in the background. It wasn't awful by any means.It just wasn't To Kill a Mockingbird and wasn't written with the finesse of the first novel. There are many thoughts to digest, enough for a discussion group, but not enough for any comparison.
I actually did not enjoy this book.  I read it through to the end only for historical interest, and out of respect for Harper Lee.  I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird just before reading this. I understand that Go Set a Watchman was initially rejected by the editor and the Harper Lee's rewrite came back as To Kill a Mockingbird, which I loved.  This story was disjointed, and the ending left me dispirited.
I'm currently reading Mockingbird for the first time  ( was schooled in Canada) after reading " Go Set a Watchman".  Did Harper Lee really write those 2 books?  very different styles : Mockingbird is a  delightful  read; the other book though interesting is definitely run of the mill.  It was certainly a " tour de force" for Lee to produce a masterpiece from such a mediocre manuscript?
Boring
To Kill A Mocking Bird was more fluid. I questioned where the plop was going.
Nothing close tp To kill a mockingbird.  Maybe my expectations were too high.
Dragged on.  Bored with it.  Didn't finish it. Liked mockingbird so much more
I'm glad her publishers had her write TKAM first. It was a bit disappointing.
Excellent read, nothing can compare to To kill a Mocking bird,but great read.
I liked it, because it continues the story of Scout, I was sorry Jem  passed.
Not as good as To Kill A Mocking Bird.  Lot of the same dialog in both books.
Amazing, amazing, amazing companion to To Kill A Mockingbird! The grit and conflict captured is beautifully written, and there is no way you will not be able to finish this wonderful book..or stave off needing to read it again. Instant classic.<br/>My only concern is that Hollywood will try to make a movie of this, and it simply can't be done in light of the first film. I'd rather it be left alone.
Disappointing.  Did Harper lee really write this?
It was good, but the original publisher of To Kill a Mockingbird knew what they were doing.  In this book, Scout as an adult is much too "preachy" and not very likable.  Harper Lee was much more effective combating the prejudices of the 1960's by using the story of a lttle girl.  The best parts of this book were Scout's flashbacks.  Glad I read it, but very glad she published TKAMB instead.
Glad I read this at my current age of 24. I remember reading To Kill a Mockingbird as a kid and thinking to myself what a hero Atticus was. I think what Go Set a Watchman shows is that its okay to sever those idolization of our elders and investigate a world that is completely our own. It has reinforced the way I see the world and allowed me to understand how those below and above me have as well.
Better than I'd expected, based on early reviews.  I never had thought of Atticus in Mockingbird as an untouchable idol (though I confess that it's been years since I re-read the book).  This book certainly was not as well-written;  where's Truman Capote when you need him?  But I thought it was honest about the times in which it was set, and Atticus exonerates himself, to some extent, at the end.
sorry to say that this book is not even comparable to To Kill a Mockingbird.
was really expecting this to be up to the standards of Mockingbird - did not
Boring and untimely. Not surprising that she chose to closet it for so long.
Liked but didn't love it,was always going to read it because it's Harper Lee
Liked it, but To kill a mockingbird was written so much better than this one
It's alright but please don't compare it to "To Kill a Mockingbird"!
Wasn't as good as first and found it a bit hard to follow. Still a good read
Very slow moving.  It took 2 weeks to get through the first 1/3 of the book.
I received the book the day it came out and have not been able to finish it.
A little slow in the middle, but it has a lot to teach you about growing up!
After reading Go Set a Watchman twice, I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  Revisiting the characters of To Kill a Mockingbird was wonderful, but the subject matter was darker than I expected (although Mockingbird was dark as well).  I would hope that at some point someone could combine the novels with Mockingbird inserted at the appropriate times.  Still a good read, and though-provoking.
I am a southerner and proud of it. This book gives more insight into what true southerners feel, and the conflicts they have had to face, than most Americans understand.  The story is honest and very genuine in portraying  many issues that are still timely today.  It tells the story in a very believable way.  One of the best books I have ever read and should be an award winner.<br/>Nancy Case
Harper Lee has the ability to tell it like it is about growing up in the South.  She has captured the time perfectly and been boldly honest about the prejudice and racism of the time.  Her writing style is amazing and I love every thing about this book
Since I had recently read, To Kill A Mockingbird, this book had me reading Mockingbird in my head as I read it.  I enjoyed every bit and tried to read slowly to make it last.<br/>As I began reading, it bothered me that so many idiots put down the book. I think they only read parts and conspired with others to be negative.<br/>This book is like a ribbon closing up a hole with a knot and bow.
Although the news media has written/spoke extensively on this, the book should have a forward or introduction explaining the back story and putting the events into historical perspective. It starts slowly, but explodes with disturbing dialogue about race relations in the late 1950s South. Although written before To Kill A Mocking Bird,  "Go Set A  Watchman"  reads much like a sequel.
liked, but not as well as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Loved Lee's to Kill a Mockingbird! Was great to read this as an accompaniment. I'm about 4/5 through, and so far I've enjoyed it. Certainly, it's a good read, and would recommend it to anyone who loved TKAM! It is interesting to visit with Scout now as an adult in her 20"s who has left home, matured, and returned to struggle with the racism she encounters there during this later decade.
I like this book, thus far.  My initial reaction when I heard about this "new book" from Harper Lee was one of joy that she had written another book.  And, I must say, it is a fairly good "page turner" book for me.  I don't have a clue if all the rumors being thrown around are true; I pray they are not. But, I will read the book to its conclusion because I like it thus far..
This isn't your father's To Kill a Mockingbird and my recommendation is to set "Go Set a Watchman" back on the shelf and save your money for something more worthy of it.<br/> Slow, meandering and dull, and I find it strange that this is the prequel to Mockingbird, more like Lee is in need of money and wrote a sad sequel to the original. Too bad. I thought this would be much better
I have not read the earlier novel and plan to but did not enjoy this novel.
Of course unexpected story. I understand why this was put away for so long.
The book was boring I did not care about the characters. Very disappointed.
Okay read.  Interesting follow up to To Kill a Mockingbird but not as good.
Different from what I expected but not the horror people make it out to be.
A totally different take on the people of the south than the previous book.
Great book but by the time you are really into it..<br/>..it's at the end.
Well it is finished; Harper Lee's second book is read. Scott goes by Jean Louise throughout the book most of the time. I enjoyed when she would remember things from school and tell the sub-story.<br/>As we all do when we grow up, we realize people we looked up to were just human beings with frailties and different opinions.  In the words of Tammy Wynette, After all he's just a man.
It was more of a justification of the Southern views on race than a novel.
Sometimes disjointed and confusing.  Interesting story but needed editing.
Long anticipated ... But read more like a short story than a great sequel.
Great read, easy reading, interesting. I like it so far, not finished yet.
I enjoyed it. After all the to do made about it, it wasn't what I expected
I liked it more than I thought I would, despite Scout being a whiney adult
The only parts I liked were the flashes back to the "Scout years".
Very well written - but not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird - the classic
Kind of disappointing. To Kill a Mockingbird set the bar too high I guess.
The story doesn't start until halfway through the book.  I didn't finish.
Very disappointed  Only read half,  Scout would not have liked it either.
Didn't enjy it as much as "Mockingbird" But it was not a bad read
Excellent book! It wasn't exactly what I expected but still a great read.
To Kill A Mockingbird was a much better novel.  I was disappointed in it.
As one who spent much of the 60's as a consultant to schools in the south I believe this novel is an accurate picture of events of this time.  Good people struggling with change, community fears and hopes.  Many who believed change must come and attempting to bring others to that conclusion. The novel accurately reflects the angst of the people and the discussions  at the time
I kept waiting for something to happen.  There's a lot of good writing but way too much narration and lengthy speeches.  The author doesn't develop the characters but let's them talk and talk.  I don't think could ever be made into a play.
Liked it.  Clearly an early Harper Lee effort.
As amazingly fabulous as I expected it to be!!
A very good book! I'm glad I read it, and did not listen to some of  the negative reviews before it came out. I just wish it was longer or could have a sequel. It stands alone even if you did not read To Kill a Mockingbird.  It did bring back some of the wonderful memories of he first book even if Atticus didn't live up to his image. We have to remember the time and setting.
I waited for this book to come out and had it delivered on the day it was released. I haven't finished it yet because I want to savor every moment as this is the last of it. I have loved reading Harper Lee's original book, Just wonderful.
I reread To Kill a Mockingbird before reading this book. The writing is finer in Mockingbird, but I was not disappointed by Watchman. There is less of a story in this one and I didn't like Jem's being dead and little said of his death. It also made me more curious about Harper Lee. My next read will be a biography of her. All-in-all, Watchman is a good read, very engaging!
repeat of to kill a mocking bird. Lacked sufficient content for a novel.
Very slow reading.  Not up to "To Kill A Mockingbird" standards.
A disappointment based on her first book "To Kill a Mockingbird"
Bored thru the whole read.  It doesn't compare to To Kill a Mockingbird.
Disappointment.  Slow in spots.  Not what I expected after all the hype.
It's clear to me why this book was initially rejected by HL's publisher. It's poorly written -- the voice is grating, the philosophizing incoherent, the dialogue unbelievable, and the characters' motivations weak. I think, however, that the book can be useful as a text to instructors of literary criticism and creative writing, so I'm giving it two stars, instead of one.
Scout or rather Jean Louise returns to her hometown years after the events of TKMB took place to visit her father at a time when the civil rights movement is just beginning to affect the southern way of living. She discovers some hard truths as well  as retells stories from her growing up in a depression era small southern town. Interesting but not up to TKMB standards.
What a depressing read! We now know that Harper Lee was told to rewrite her first draft, and Mockingbird was the result. Watchman is the sad original. Watchman's final chapters are an extended polemical conversation between "Scout", her uncle Dr. Finch, and her father, Atticus. I found it shockingly racist, even though I'd read the early reviews warning me. We don't hear this kind of talk any more: "Negroes" are in the childhood of their race, you wouldn't want them in your church or schools, they aren't really ready for the privilege of voting, the NAACP is just trying to stir up blacks and are unleashing a revolution, and the Supreme Court is arrogantly interfering with Southern culture (in Brown v. Board of Education). Even Scout agrees with these generalizations; she just disapproves of the local council meetings that allow for even more outrageous racist assertions.<br/>I don't know how Harper Lee could have written a book this racist, in which there's no real black character other than the elderly maid, Calpurnia, who is a brief caricature in the book. The NAACP figure only as offstage threats to the cultured Finches and their gentle civilization.<br/>I don't find any other redeeming features: aside from a funny church quarrel over how to sing the Doxology, the episodes are mostly tedious. This book could never be published today if it weren't by the author of Mockingbird.
Very good but not u to the level of the classic To Kill a Mocking Bird.
I waited so long to receive the book and it was an utter disappointment
Lost interest a third of the way through,will try to read another time.
It's an ok book. Not great and no comparison to To Kill a Mocking Bird.
Well written but certainly not up to the level of To Kill A Mockingbird
Loved it....great lesson at the end....reviews were unfair and unclear.
Can hardly get through the first chapter! Poor and unorganized writing.
It is amazing to me how an author and an editor can take this draft, strip it to its bones, spend two years reworking it and reconstruct the most beloved novel of our times. While I found it slow in places and showing signs of a first time author, when read in the context of a sequel to TKAM, it was a moving novel-an interesting slice of 1960's southern Americana.
The novel has taut, solid writing, especially in the first half.  There is a lot of dialog and that weakens the writing in the second half.  Had it been well edited and published in the 1960s it probably would have been too avant garde.  In my opinion, the book is an interesting companion for To Kill A Mockingbird, and the two may be read together in years to come
13.99 is too much for kindle
I loved it. I read To Kill a Mockingbird earlier this year. Reading the sequel gave another side to Atticus Finch. It also explored the idea that your parents are just human. Scout's journey of realizing her dad is just human, is very heart warming. I found myself crying at the end of the book. I believe it is worth reading if you have read To Kill a Mockingbird.
Disappointing novel.It seems clear to me why it was never published,and I think someone else tampered with it too.No Mention of Boo Radley or the family?Jem's demise ?And that barely addressed?What was the point of the character of Hank/Henry?o Kill a Mockingbird and I wish they left that novel to stand alone .I wonder who is getting the proceeds from this book?
Very glad I read this book.  Would suggest people read Harper Lee's bio to help you understand the prospective she is coming from, as she tries writing this piece.  Book had potential...but did not reach it......her prose is nice in spots, but nowhere does she reach the heights of the mockingbird.  Enjoyed Uncle Jack!  Book clubs should read both of her novels.
too much telling, not enough showing after the scene in the courthouse
I so enjoyed this book. Glad I did not listen to all those nay-sayers.
I have mixed emotions about this book.  I just don't know what to say.
Another masterpiece!  Loved hearing Jarper Lee's literary voice again!
There was not a complete story. It was just a picture in time of Macon
I found the book to be better than I expected.  It could have been more polished but there were moments that had the rhythm of To Kill a Mockingbird.  The characters were multi-layered and there is a lot to think about within the storyline.  It will be a good book club selection on its own although better if compared with To Kill a Mockingbird.  Worth reading.
I am in the minority, but I enjoyed this book.  Yes, it needed editing.  And yes, it was not pleasant having Atticus portrayed as a racist.  But that was a sign of the times, as were many other parts of the book.  It really was historically accurate, even if it was grating to have Atticus shown in a different light than in "To Kill a Mockingbird".
It was disappointing to read this after loving To Kill a Mockingbird.
I wish I hadn't read this. It's tainted To Kill A Mockingbird for me.
Not normally the type of book I would enjoy but it was very engaging.
It isn't what I expected as I loved "To Kill a Mocking Bird".
Very disappointing. To Kill a Mockingbird remains the best book ever.
Somewhat disappointing, one subject but a prelude to later writing...
My sister loved it and I thought it was rather trite and not even approaching the excellence of "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I found myself impatient with the overly leisurely pace.  At the same time I am glad I read it,  if for no other reason than to have closure. I do think it a pity this will probably become required reading for the schoolkids.
Clearly it never should have been published
Thinking about this story made me realize that I was more similiar to "Scout" than I thought.<br/>Her outburst near the end toward Atticus was painful for me to read (I liked Atticus) but then<br/>I realized I needed to do something similiar when I was in my 20's in order to mature more<br/>than I did. Still enjoyed the story and the ending!
I reread To Kill a Mockingbird right before I read Go Set a Watchman and found Go Set a Watchman very interesting, especially knowing that the book had been written before the famous To Kill a Mockingbird. To me, the book was not quite as fulfilling as To Kill a Mockingbird, but it was written with great observation of real life and how things change.
It was good and disappointing at the same time.I wanted more about how Atticua asked Scout to think for herself. That was the compelling part of the story rather than what seemed to be Atticus's racism. I am not sure he was and I wanted the reader left more with the idea of his intelligence.<br/>I read it all on a long plane trip, which was perfect.
Good book. Harper Lee had a lot of insight when she wrote this novel
Like many people, I was very disappointed in this long awaited book.
Not nearly as good as her classic.  Slow to develop with no real it.
Not nearly as good as To Kill A Mockingbird, but it was interesting.
Certainly not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird,  but worth the read.
It was OK, definitely cannot compare to: To Kill A Mockingbird".
This was a very thought provoking read. She shows both sides of the racial view. She makes  us question whether we are color blind or if all we can see is color. I wish I were still teaching. This book is so deep and rich and would be so rewarding to teach. I recommend that a person go back and read To Kill a Mocking Bird before reading this one.
Some interesting ideas but poorly written.
It was a great book and really enjoyed it.
I found her previous sequel short, slightly predictable,but very well written. I am disappointed that it was never her intention to put it out  there, for whatever reason. And now has been published after she is too addled to stop it. I believe it would have been missed as another important piece of Southern fiction, written by one of the best!
Atticus as viewed by his adult daughter is not the same Atticus as viewed by his pre-pubescent daughter.  This book follows the story of Atticus and Scout; however many years, a world war, family tragedies and time have taken their toll.  This is still a major literary work, which must be taken carefully with his prequel, To Kill A Mockingbird.
Wordy  It needs editing which it got to become a much better novel.
I did not receive this book as ordered, therefore cannot review it.
Too boring to finish. My wife tried it and was of the same opinion.
I didn't like it as much as the first book, but I'm glad I read it.
Not even close to being as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Enjoyed it. But feel you need to read to kill a mockingbird first .
An interesting read. You can see why her friends told her to go back and try again, but it shows, here and there, a preview of the potential masterpiece that was to come.  The children's revival scene had me laughing til I cried. Worth reading. I suggest the you read it, then re read Mockingbird, if it has been a while since you read that one.
To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book - ever.  Go Set a Watchman continues to show Harper Lee as a thoughtful and clever writer.  I've seen some reviews that chastised how Atticus is portrayed.  I don't think that was the point of the story.  To me, it was about Jean Louise seeing Atticus as the human he is rather than a God-like idolism.
I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I loved To Kill a Mockingbird, so that made reading this a motivation. Although I thought it was a little slow in places, I highly recommend reading this book.  There was humor, sadness, intense conversation, and continued strength in the characters. It will generate powerful discussion in many book groups.
This book was published at a remarkably right time.<br/>Ayticus, although a near saint before, has some unexpected character flaws that make him more human.  His daughters struggle with changes in him make her strive towards being her own person. A new look at race relations and seeing how far we have to go, demands a close look at ourselves
With all the controversy surrounding this book, I really wanted to read it. This book is just okay. It is good to see other perspectives from Harper Lee, but it will always pale in comparison To Kill a Mockingbird.
This is the perfect era for publication of this book, I taught "To Kill a Mockingbird" for years, the characters in "Go Set a Watchman"still grab my heart in what rings true to an Alabama born woman who also went North and would go back to South Alabama in the sixties, it is a cautionary tale for our current political scene,
Go Set a Watchman is the story of the emerging and maturing relationship between daughter Scout as an adult,  and her father Atticus.  Contrary to reviews I have heard or read, racism is not the primary focus of the book, but plays an underlying role in the maturing of Scout into her own person with her own values.  It is an excellent read.
Can you return an electronic book when you find out it is unreadable?<br/>I didn't buy the book,it was a gift.<br/>It is unreadable, yes I know give it a hundred pages, but I could not get that fair. No idea where it was going, no sympathy for the characters.<br/>Why would anyone publish this?<br/>I have read better free books on kindle
While distinctly different from "To Kill a Mockingbird," this book is important to add to your repertoire. Although it was written before "To Kill a Mockingbird," it works best as a follow-up. The character of Scout is expanded, as is Atticus Finch. Critical race and gender issues of today resonant with the thoughtful plot.
To Kill a Mockingbird is my 2nd favorite book of all times.  Yes, this book has some raw moments (it was written in the 1960s) dealing with race that were difficult for me to read.  I also thought it could have used a tad more editing just to enhance the pace of the story.  But it was a good read to catch up with some memorable characters.
People may say whatever they choose about this book - I can only approach it from a very personal point of view, both as a writer and a child of the times in which much of this took place. I completely understand why Ms. Lee's publishers insisted she re-write the book into what eventually became "To Kill A Mockingbird". Mockingbird was published in July of 1960. In February of that year, black students were 'sitting in' at Woolworth lunch counters, barely two years had passed since 4 little girls died in a Birmingham church bombing. Alabama was passing laws just 6 months earlier to limit black voter registration. The worst was yet to come for the black civil rights movement. Close your eyes for a moment and imagine the public reaction to 'Go Set A Watchman' had it been published in 1960. I suspect Harper Lee would have been labeled as nothing more than a N***** lover and her name a mere footnote in history. The United States of Star Spangled Awesomeness and Perfection was a long way away from being able to hear some hard truths about their fellow countrymen. It was far more palatable for American literary consumption to look upon Atticus Finch as the white hero who nobly stood up for the black man, while the story is told from the perspective of a child. That was the most interesting device Ms. Lee used in Mockingbird - telling the story from a child's perspective. It was okay to make Atticus near perfect. I looked upon my own father in much the same way until I grew up and realized he was a very good man who was deeply, deeply flawed - in much the same way Jean Louise learns of the very human nature of her own father.<br/><br/>No, "Go Set A Watchman" could never ever have been published in 1960. The world needed "To Kill A Mockingbird" in 1960 - just as in these times of rising racial hate and bigotry, the world needs "Go Set A Watchman" in 2015. In the end, I found myself weeping to the last word. Weeping for Jean Louise's understanding of fellow Southerner Thomas Wolfe's words... "You can't go home again...", for I remember the day it happened to me. The town was there, the people were there, the familiar pace and cadence of speech - but it would never be home again for me. Why? Because I was one of the rare few who made it out into the world. Once you view humanity with a wide angle lens, one is never content to go back to viewing life through a single field lens and at home, it was the only lens they had. It didn't make them bad people. That was the other revelation that came to me on my sojourn home too. And like Jean Louise, once my father came down from the pedestal of the golden icon to become a mere mortal, I came to love and appreciate him even more - and it was a more pure and honest love.<br/><br/>I won't go into the intricacies of the characters or the pacing or whether it was a sequel or a prequel or a flashback. I won't go into what can safely be described as the dicey origins or the timing of the manuscript or anything else. I'll let others fight over the minutia. I just wanted to offer a little historical perspective of the late 50's and early 60's to some of the potential readers so they could take that into account.<br/><br/>Please, stop comparing the books. Stop worrying about the minutia. Stop trying to pigeonhole it. Read it for the love of reading a book. Read it as a grown up. Read it as someone who understands you can't go home again.<br/><br/>I'm a writer by profession. I can't afford to be so snobby about such things.
Comparing this book with To Kill A Mockingbird is probably not fair to either.  Both enlighten the other wonderfully.  But TKAMB is a children's book that adults can enjoy; GSAW is an adult book inappropriate for children (both because of certain language and because the development of thought is too complex).  Watchman is more bold regarding the issues of race and cites many things which need to be heard again today.  While the methods of racism may be different, the acts and attitudes are not.  What is amazing to me is that, what this book exposes about the NAACP is still true.  Atticus agreed with Jefferson and B. T. Washington (privileges are earned), against the ideas of the NAACP.  Scout agreed with the NAACP (privileges are not to be earned, but to be given irresponsibly to those who cannot properly use them).  This book also helps to remind people of the facts about the South, the War, etc., which most Americans no longer know (thanks in part to the deliberate efforts of CNN, MSNBC, etc.).<br/><br/>This is a wonderful book on multiple levels, not simply regarding race--Persons and methods of wisdom; growing in life, in relationships, in understanding; and much more dynamic and driving in its plot than TKAMB. I wondered, and still do, why TKAMB won the Pulitzer; but since it did, I think GSAW is much more worthy, then.<br/><br/>I add also that if libraries and schools are removing Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn because of the "N" word, will they be consistent and disallow this book?  Let's hope not.  We need reality, not protection from reality by people who feel so insignificant about themselves that they must find a personal bully pulpit and suppress the maturity and liberty of others.  I doubt this book will be suppressed, showing the suppressors of Mark Twain's works to be hypocrites.
Although I’d seen the film, I had never read the novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, until last summer, when an e-edition was made available for the Kindle. I was enthusiastic about it, I think, as any of its oodles of admirers, not only for its character-drawing and the simple heroism in a tense small-town setting (much like John Grisham’s A Time to Kill, but far better), but for its warm humor, it’s Tom-Sawyer-like small-town setting and what seemed to me a marvelous and true-to-life representation of the social stratification of a southern town in its era. There has been so much hoopla about this “sequel” which was actually the antecedent of Mockingbird that nobody knew what to expect before it was published a week ago. We knew only that the publisher had urged Harper Lee to re-write the novel so as to focus on the childhood of its heroine or else to write a new novel focusing wholly on the childhood of the heroine — which is, of course, exactly what she did. So now, in the “new” but earlier-written novel we meet with an older “Scout” (or Jean Louise, as she is now called in typical Southern fashion) who returns to her home town for a visit after living in New York for enough years to have gained a new perspective on life and society in her hometown — and to discover that she doesn’t like what she sees and doesn’t like the people whom she once loved and admired, including her father, who is, she learns, a racist. Well, no, he’s not actually, but yes, maybe he really is. It’s the era following shortly after the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education, that struck down the long-standing “separate but equal” principle allowing for segregation of public schools. I found a pretty good summary of reactions in the South in the following decade at:<br/>http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/integration-to-1963.html<br/>In addition there’s one excellent discussion I’ve seen thus far of the “new” novel and its relationship to the era in the south that it relates to:<br/>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/16/opinion/atticus-finch-offers-a-lesson-in-southern-politics.html<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this novel every bit as much as I did To Kill a Mockingbird. For one thing, there were numerous idylls of the childhood years that are warm and funny. Perhaps the most sparkling gem in this regard is the account of the three kids playing out the scenario of a summer revival service that they have just experienced: “[Reverend Moorehead] split hairs for three-quarters of an hour on the grammatical accuracy of is text (Which was correct—the wages of sin is death or the wages of sin are death? It made a difference, and the Reverend Moorehead drew distinctions of such profundity that not even Atticus Finch could tell what he was driving at.”<br/><br/>But more importantly, this is a coming-of-age novel or “Bildungsroman" in a particular setting that is particularly familiar to those of us who lived in the South in the middle of the twentieth century and experienced that particular phase of our agonizing national struggle to come to terms with all that racism entails. It’s an account of the “good people” of the community attempting to ease the transition toward some sort of meaningful racial integration by steering a middle course between a renascent Ku Klux Klan on the one side and a militant NAACP that is pushing for “revolutionary” change on the other. And it paints a picture of an altered society whose white and black members can no longer meet each other on civil terms, although they have been “family” for decades heretofore.<br/><br/>I remember my own experiences at that time as I was an undergraduate at Tulane University in New Orleans. A few like-minded “liberals” (there were those who called us “pinkos”!) and I were exhilarated by the Supreme Court decision. One idea came into our minds as worth pursuing: why not try to get in touch with some students at the two black colleges in New Orleans, Dillard and Xavier, and socialize with them? I don’t remember how we got in touch with them, but we did succeed in finding three or four pretty bright kids and we met with them two or three times. One thing we discovered, however, was that there was nowhere in New Orleans that we could go as a group to sit down at a table and share a soft drink or coffee or beer — there were no restaurants or cafés or barrooms that we could find where all of us would be welcome together. Another memory of those years was the tension among passengers on a train that I rode from New Orleans to New York City in the late summer of 1956 to board a ship to go to Germany; National Guard troops were escorting the first black students into the high school in Little Rock, Arkansas. Riots were feared and there was a lot of ugliness in the streets there and ugly talk all over the South; it was reflected in conversation among the passengers with whom I rode on that trip.<br/><br/>In sum, I was not one bit disappointed by reading this novel as a sequel to the later-written “Mockingbird”. The kind of disillusionment that it paints so vividly is one that I experienced myself as people and institutions whose goodness and rightness I had once taken for granted turned out to be less than fully admirable and distressingly disappointing. But that too passed for me and I did a bit more growing up, as did Jean Louise Finch.
The mockingbird dies again in "Go Set a Watchman."<br/><br/>In "To Kill a Mocking Bird," Jean Louise “Scout” Finch, Jeremy Atticus “Jem” Finch and Charles Baker “Dill” Harris are among the innocent mockingbirds who suffer when the cruel realities of life intrude into their childhoods after Atticus is appointed by the court to defend a Black man accused of raping a white woman.<br/><br/>The trial and its aftermath represent a defining moment for the fictional Maycomb, Alabama; establish Atticus as the watchman who sees the truth and crusades for justice; and solidifies for young Scout, her faith in a wise and loving father who can do no wrong.<br/><br/>In "Go Set a Watchman," the twenty-six-year-old Jean Louise who lives and works New York returns to Maycomb to visit her ailing father at a time when there are increasing tensions in the South after the Supreme Court’s Brown v. Board of Education (1954).<br/><br/>Lee paints a clear picture of the concerns many small town residents had about the ramifications of desegregation. Some reviewers have skewed the point of the book by looking at these not-unusual 1950s beliefs through a 2015 microscope.<br/><br/>While this makes for sensationalistic headlines, it inaccurately clouds the realities of the time period for prospective readers.<br/><br/>Scout, who is basically color blind, believes what she grew up thinking Atticus believed: “Equal Rights for all, special privileges for none.” When it comes to matters of law, he has not wavered. Daily life, though, isn’t the law to his way of thinking. When Scout discovers Atticus thinks Blacks are not yet ready for the full rights of a desegregated society, her world is shattered. The man who wants to marry her has similar views and, along with her father, is attending political meetings aimed at finding ways to fight the Supreme Court’s ruling, The mysterious wonders of her childhood under the patient guidance of her father are suddenly at risk as everything she thought was true is potentially false.<br/><br/>Lost innocence and fallen gods are central themes in this book.<br/><br/>Like many debut novels, "Go Set a Watchman" contains a fair amount of back-story of “remember-when” discussions and reminiscences. While these passages inform the reader about what was, they also slow the pace of a novel. However, readers of "To Kill a Mockingbird" will probably also find these passages nostalgic as they shed more light on Mockingbird’s beloved cast.<br/><br/>After Scout learns what she learns about her father and his colleagues, she has a decision to make. She can run back to New York filled with hatred for the family and friends who have destroyed the remains of her innocence and her childhood memories with views she abhors. Or, she can stay in Maycomb, fight for what she believes, and as a watchman tell others the truths she sees among them.<br/><br/>Harper Lee deftly handles Scout’s dilemma in a wonderful novel that will, I hope, survive the perils of the misguided critics who have been shouting that the sky is falling.
For years, Harper Lee's hauntingly powerful love story of a white, middle-aged, southern lawyer raising 2 motherless children amidst the economic depression and racial segregation of the 1930s has touched me like no other. I have seen no one combine page-turning mystery, humor, innocence, irony and the contrast between kindness and cruelty with greater depth and literary skill than Ms. Lee. Her impact on American social conscience since releasing TKAM in 1960 is incalculable. 55 years later, we are still thanking her for it.<br/><br/>When the plan to release Go Set A Watchman, actually the predecessor of Mockingbird, was announced earlier this year, no one knew what to expect. Having just completed it, I find it to be a powerful novel in its own right. However, having closely followed the news prior to the release of Watchman, I was very careful NOT to read it as a sequel to Mockingbird. Had I done so, it would have altered my interpretation of To Kill A Mockingbird and the place it still holds in my heart.<br/><br/>Although set 20 years later than Mockingbird, Watchman is actually an early draft of what would evolve into Mockingbird. It is NOT its sequel. Written in the midst of the turbulent civil rights movement of the 50s, Watchman focuses on the disillusionment of its heroine, Jean Louise Finch, upon realizing that those closest to her are not perfect; that they, too, are works in progress- generally good people but inconsistent and human like everyone else. This shakes the adult "Scout" to her core, forcing her to become her own "watchman", instead of looking to her childhood heroes to set and maintain her moral compass.<br/><br/>I did not find the Atticus of Watchman to be as dark  as early reviews indicated or as much in contrast to the Atticus we came to know and love in TKAM. I could still recognize him. His single visit to a KKK meeting was to "find out exactly what men in town were behind the masks" in order to see who he was dealing with. Still, I understand current day frustration with his desire to slow down social change. Waiting a few decades for things to simmer down was asking many African Americans to wait a lifetime for real change.<br/><br/>Presumably related to Ms. Lee's own story, it fascinates me to consider that the process of becoming her own person while continuing to cherish those she loved most led to the development of a Pulitzer prize-winning classic. This much-loved, enormously influential book that Harper Lee called "a simple love story" ultimately helped to inspire a change of heart during the struggle for civil rights in 1950s. Nothing short of a miracle, in my humble opinion. God works in mysterious ways.
I think a good subtitle to Go Set A Watchman might be To Kill A Mockingbird and Zombies. Because when you begin to read GSAW and hear the voice of the 26 year old Jean Louise, you find yourself plunged into an alternative Maycomb. And once Jean Louise follows Hank (Henry Clinton is almost a place holder for Dill and Jem, who are absent in GSAW) and her father, Atticus Finch to a meeting at the court house. Here she hears some horrible, racist and segregationist agendas, all being led by...well, you probably know who by now.<br/><br/>Calpurnia's gone, and Jean Louise's uncle, Dr Jim Finch is the sage she turns to when she's out of sorts and needs guidance in Maycomb. The last half of the novel is almost Tolstoyan, with Jean Louise getting schooled on the social class structure in Maycomb from Hank, a rhetorical lesson from Uncle Jim, and an Invasion of the Body Snatchers' feel for the reader, wondering where all our friends have gone.<br/><br/>This is not a sequel. Jean Louise is being reborn (and there are, significantly, two dunking scenes in the book), and her new ears and eyes are seeing things she has never seen or noticed before. There is talk of her color blindness, since it just the way she is. But those around her feel their way of life is in peril. The present setting is not one where common folk have black servants anymore: Calpurnia does not live with the Finch family anymore, and Aunt Alexandra is the housekeeper. The town is resisting the winds of change. And this is very disappointing to Jean Louise.<br/><br/>Please don't read this as a sequel, or even a prequel. It's the seeds of an idea that eventually became the beloved novel we all know and love. It is a rough cut of that beautiful shining diamond. It is timely.<br/><br/>I had a whole other review I had written and I typed it up and then lost all that information, so these thoughts are not quite as organized as I'd like them. But I just really want anyone who reads this to go into it knowing full well, this is a totally separate idea and story from TKAM. This is not a polished and heavily edited, revised novel. It is a beginning. The ending seems to be speeding downhill in an almost stream of consciousness manner, with Jean Louise running, not knowing where to turn, and I highly doubt the last quarter of the novel would have ended up like that in a published form originally. There would have been more fleshing out of those moments. And I think many other changes would have been made as well.<br/><br/>While this novel was clearly not truly completed, and is not a finished work, I could never even dream of being able to rival anything that Harper Lee dashed off as a rough draft. I am giving this book 4 stars. Not because it is bad, but because I feel it is incomplete. It is kernel of the whole cob of corn we got in To Kill A Mockingbird.
My initial reaction to Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman is:<br/><br/>I cannot hate it.<br/><br/>The negative hype leading up to the release of this “sequel/prequel” of "To Kill a Mockingbird" had me almost not reading this book.  However, because of my love for Scout and Atticus,  I felt compelled to find out what happens to them.<br/><br/>Yes, the novel has technical problems.  It IS clearly a work that needed more polishing before it was published.  There are long, monotonous sequences of Scout recalling her childhood that needed to be heavily redacted or excised altogether.  So tedious were these sequences that I found myself asking  “…and the point of her telling me all this is….?”  I.  Overall, the novel does not have the same clean, Spartan directional clarity of To Kill a Mockingbird.  This novel’s flow is muddy and complicated.<br/><br/>That being said, there is much to laud about this novel.  One of the strengths of this novel is in the author’s sensitive and skillful handling of Scout’s emotional and psychic meltdown when she learns that Atticus is not man she thought she knew.  I found myself tearing up as she struggles not to hate her beloved father and to come to terms with the fact that her world and the people in it are complicated and flawed.  For me, the key to understanding and embracing this novel is to remember that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was told the point of view of a child who practically deified her father.  The author tells us not to make Atticus a hero or a god.  He is just a man, flawed and imperfect, as we all are.<br/><br/>The title of the novel comes from the words of the prophet Isaiah in the Old Testament:  “For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.”  Isaiah 21:6  Uncle Jack implores Scout not to leave Maycomb, but to live there and become a “watchman,”  a much-needed moral compass for the town.  Her people need her.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have stated how much they hate what the author has done to the character of Atticus.  I would say that those readers need to become like Scout:  to put away their childhood perceptions and see how complicated and imperfect the world truly is.  Only then can we start to make changes.  Many readers, like myself, find that reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" to be a satisfying experience, but that reading "Go Set a Watchman" an unsettling one.  But then, that’s the point of the novel, I think.
I won't call this a review, because a review would be rife with spoilers, plot points, and all of the rest.  Suffice it to say, that this publication--however it came about, either as a result of Ms. Lee's own mind, or that of her money minded family's--is altogether wonderful, and timely.<br/><br/>For years now, I have touted "To Kill A Mockingbird" as having been the perfect and quintessential example of the American Novel as we know it.  There are many who would disagree with me, and you may well be one of them, but that is simply my humble opinion.  Having read much of Southern literature, as that perpetrated by William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Carson McCullers and others, Lee's original Southern Gothic has always stood out to me amongst the rest.  Everyone else always seemed to have an aim of of their own outside what I consider to be the highest aim of just telling a good story. Throw in some universal appeal and you've got something just that much more special.<br/><br/>But let's take a look at that, shall we?  Fifty five years ago, Harper Lee arrives on the scene, makes a statement and then drops the mic.  Then nothing. No follow up. Not even an unrelated title or short story collection. Just the one book. I had never considered it probable, even possible that a second Harper Lee novel (or book of short stories, memoirs, whatever) would emerge in my lifetime, and yet here it is.  "Go Set A Watchman," is at once both intriguing and infuriating.  For fans of the authors former work, consider this as sort of the alternate 1985 sequence from "Back To Future II."  For everyone else, dip into these pages and then dip into our own current headlines; riots in Maryland, the taking down of the Confederate flag in the proud Southern states.<br/><br/>I read this book in a day.  I had finished my third reading of "To Kill A Mockingbird," was basking in the moral greatness of its characters, and stepped open faced into the splash of cold water that this book truly is.  Do not take it for a sequel, but at the same time, do not take it necessarily as a disconnected work.  As with anything, race, as it is perceived, is always evolving.  Sometimes it spins its wheels in place for a generation or two.  "To Kill A Mockingbird" produced a strong dichotomy of the American perception of race, and this book takes it a step further.  It encourages--no, it forces--its readers to destroy the gods they had put in place and examine their own beliefs about race, color, whatever in the context of your own existence and upbringing.  It is brilliant, either accidentally, or on purpose, and you'd be a fool not to get it while it's on sale for less than cover price.<br/><br/>I hope I haven't spoiled anything for anyone.
I do not usually write or post reviews of books because I normally do not believe that my words can do justice to what I consider a great book.  However, due to the media and their portrayal of Harper Lee's new book, I have felt the need to write a review.  Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee is one of the greatest books published in the last decade.  It is the equal of Lee's first published work, To Kill a Mockingbird.  Before the official release of Watchman, book critics, reviewers, and television personalities were reading it before the general public.  They were writing negative reviews about this book because Atticus Finch, the father of Scout and Jem from Mockingbird who represented a black man in what has been hailed as one of the greatest court scenes in literature and film; turns out to be a typical Southern white man in 1950s Alabama.  To me, this is not astonishing nor should people be surprised about this revelation that comes through strongly in Watchman while it was much more subtle and almost non-existent in Mockingbird.  Atticus Finch represented a black man because he knew that the evidence and law would prevail.  Atticus believes in the law and justice.<br/><br/>In Watchman with the character of Atticus Finch, Harper Lee perfectly captures the white South in the 50s.  I think that the media is freaking out about this new aspect about Atticus because they have done what Jean Louise (Scout) has done which is elevate Atticus to the level of a god because of that courtroom scene.  And like Jean Louise, the media and everyone else "astonished at a racist Atticus" need to realize that he is not a god but a man.<br/><br/>The character of Scout in Mockingbird really does grow up in Watchman to fit her real name of Jean Louise.  Jean Louise finally becomes her own person when she visits her home town of Maycomb and discovers that it is not separate from the events going on in the wider world which she experiences in New York.  She goes from idolizing her father who she has thought is the measure for all her thoughts and actions in life, to a young woman who sees that the way things are in the South are wrong and need to change which is at odds with her father's thoughts and feelings.<br/><br/>A few of the reviews I have read, have called this book a mess and a poorly edited manuscript.  I wonder if they read the same book as me.  The only inconsistency between this one and Mockingbird is the age of the young white woman who had accused the black man, represented by Atticus, of rape.  (Mockingbird: she's 19 and Watchman: 14)  I was saddened to read in the first two chapters that Jem was dead, and Dill was not a main character in this book.  Harper Lee uses a different writing technique for this book which involves Jean Louise having recollections about Jem so there is some closure. In a way, the character of Henry Clinton combines some of the aspects of Jem and Dill that readers had come to love in Mockingbird.<br/><br/>For the title of this review, I used a quote from the back of the book cover.  "Every man's island, Jean Louise, every man's watchman, is his conscience."  I think this is apt when talking about Go Set a Watchman because the book not only perfectly encapsulates that time in United States history, but I think it reflects what has been going on in the country now.  I think this is why the media is freaking out about Atticus because it touches you and makes you think about not only what happened then but what's happening now and still going on.  Like Scout in Mockingbird, we were children viewing the world through a filtered lens, but in Watchman, we grow up to see the world how it really is.  I think that before you read Go Set a Watchman, you should read To Kill a Mockingbird in order to more fully appreciate Watchman. This book is truly a great piece of literature.
I understand why people are enraged over this book's publication, given that it likely came at the expense of manipulating a feeble, 88 year old woman. Like J. D. Salinger, Ms. Harper Lee could not stomach the success to which her greatest work, To Kill a Mockingbird, amounted. Lee would just as soon sit on a back porch in Monroeville discussing life with a youngster than cultivate any discussion related to her work. In her desire to disassociate herself with the success of Mockingbird, Lee clearly shows us humility in spite of what her timeless novel did to affect change socially and culturally. Lee knows rejection, especially the rejection of seeing a manuscript, what we end up seeing in Go Set a Watchman, be unceremoniously turned down. And from this spurning came the release of a piece of classic American literature. Even so, that does not make Lee's "newest" work any less desirable to read.<br/><br/>This work, another beautifully scripted coming of age tale, this time, from an adult Jean Louise Finch liberating herself of the ways of her upbringing, constructs Scout in the way Lee initially envisioned: as a strong, free-willed woman with conviction and a voice her ten year old self could not possibly wield. I understand the strife many have conveyed over the fate of certain characters twenty years removed from the events of Mockingbird, but winnowing this novel down to Lee's "mishandling" of certain characters (remember: this manuscript preceded Mockingbird's by several years) is doing the work a grave injustice, a topic, that of iniquity, that Lee still handles with grace and dignity.<br/><br/>This book does not have the resonance of Mockingbird, but then again, very few works in American literature do. Even so, Go Set a Watchman still captures Lee's lyricism, her penchant for observing and capturing family squabbles, and the sass and hospitality with which Lee can infuse in her characters. Critics have suggested this work is "a mess" and reads "like a rough draft," but these assessments are foolhardy. The writing and promise we see in a young Harper Lee still resonates from the pages. For one, Lee wished to have the manuscript published "as is," so no other authorial voice corrupted her own. Consequently, one of the novel's few shortcomings is its constant shift in perspective (from third to first person) that detracts somewhat from the reading. Although the flashbacks, from which Lee's editor and publisher told her to build the story from, are what is best about the novel.<br/><br/>This is a novel about lost innocence, about returning to a home that no longer means the same as it did from our childhoods. It is a novel of redemption and of hope, a novel that shows us how far we have not come in the name of racial equality. Clearly, as evidenced here, race relations remain murky, and so are the politics related to them. In short, it is a novel that receives my highest recommendation, and demands a re-reading, a closer reading even, of To Kill a Mockingbird.  In fact, I implore Go Set a Watchman to be read as rejected manuscript that later became To Kill a Mockingbird, and not a direct sequel to Mockingbird itself.  You will enjoy it far more given that context.
Perhaps the Greatest Footnote in Literary History<br/><br/>Harper Lee's much anticipated manuscript is now available, and is far from a disappointment. It may not be the right choice for the millions who fell in love with To Kill a Mockingbird since its publication and proliferation as "required reading" in so many American schools.  Forthright, at times eloquent, at times clunky, it records the aftermath of Brown VS The Board of Education from a distinctly unique point of view, written contemporarily.  Jean Louise (Scout) is making her yearly pilgrimage from New York to Maycomb.  As the loosely constructed narrative reveals itself, the reader begins to see conflicting points of view through Jean Louise's eyes.  As her eyes open, so do ours.<br/><br/>For those of us who have held Atticus up as a role model, sometimes the revelations are tough, though they always ring true.  But stick with it through the end, and you will find a still-admirable Atticus, even life affirming.  If edited and published, we would have no Mockingbird--only a remarkable rough draft.  As for the future, the book holds astonishingly accurate depictions of racism in the United States currently at the forefront of national debate and legislation.  If (& this is a big If due to the realistic treatment of its subject matter) it were published when written, it would be of more sociological than literary interest.  As it stands, it is both.  From now on, no educator can honestly teach Mockingbird without adding this magnificent footnote.  Mockingbird becomes expanded and enhanced through the "unedited" MS.  At times a naturalistic novel of the past, at others a scathing reflection of the present, it is well worth the short read.  It is an unpolished Bildingsroman, of the old order; and at the same time a Kunstlerroman when read in tandem.  There are moments of ironic brilliance and wit that are pure Lee--read the Watchman  for this reason alone.<br/><br/>G. K. Bridges-Tollison
Shallow.
Loved hearing the voice of someone who actually lived in the era written about. It made the read even more interesting. I rather enjoyed this book even as I struggled trying to understand each characters actions and perceptions. I did have a hard time melding the Atticus of old with the older Atticus. Especially enjoyed Scout's memories.
Not what I expected. I tried to like it. It has its moments, but the ending was so weak, I have to give it a one. Atticus and his comrades just use excuses instead of sound reasoning for their backward opinions.
I have been dodging the many news reports these last few days that wanted so badly to tell me the "surprises " embodied in this story. Unfortunately,  I did hear a newscaster say that the now - elderly Atticus Finch had become a racist. That made me wonder if perhaps Atticus had developed dementia. When Scout saw her father and her friend / fiance at that awful meeting I wondered if Atticus was somehow "undercover ", trying to understand the improbable.<br/><br/>Now I wonder at the definition of racist today, relative to what it was then.<br/><br/>A racist hates those who are different. Did Atticus hate those black citizens he saw every day? No. Did he treat them with respect? Generally, yes. Did he treat them as equals? No. Did he regard blacks as less than human? No. Did he care about them? Yes.<br/><br/> As I understood his explanation,  he saw a cohort of people of color who had less education,  less experience in the world and no reason to work within the establishment. That frightened him. That brought out the paternalism in him. As wise and fair as he was with the law, he lacked the courage to face what was coming.<br/><br/>Is that a racist? Are there degrees of racial enmity that don't rise to the level of capital - R racism? This might be Lee's message.<br/><br/>Harper Lee 's eloquent use of language and her ability to weave a classic tale of the South are so worth the time to read this book. Don't compare it to Mockingbird,  because it can stand alone. If these were the only two books Ms. Lee ever wrote,  then she has managed to<br/>produce two classics.<br/><br/>Atticus was a man of the south at a time when the south was in flux. Voting rights had been granted.<br/>A rax
Okay, Harper Lee's talent with words shown through in a book with not much of a story. I can understand why this version was turned down and the publisher  asked for a rewrite which led to her really good book, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. It was interesting to see the development of a great writer and were she started. It is worth reading.
One of the most boring books I have ever read.  Even before I got to the part where Atticus is portrayed as a racist I thought that a) her first publisher was right to reject it and b) did she even write "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Begs the question - could Truman Capote have helped her with her second novel.  Really really BAD
It was easy to read. I read it on the day of publication.  For the first 25 % I wanted to quit.<br/>After that, I couldn't stop. Because I was familiar with "Mockingbird", I thought<br/>that I had to read it. I am glad that I did. I read "Mockingbird"  the next day Amazon makes<br/>it easy with their Kindle books.
think it was released because harper lee's foundation needed cash
I was disapointed in the ending, it seemed abrupt and unfinished.
Great book, author really understands rural Southern small towns.
Such a nice surprise to find another book by such a great author.
read it out of curiosity because of all the hype. I did enjoy it.
Glad this was not her first book......felt it was hard to follow.
Did not like this book?  Difficult to read!  Would not recommend?
Reminds me so much of the sixties, growing up with my own father.
I interesting especially having lived in the south from 2978-1981
Enjoyed but was easy to put down and not pickup for a couple days
not at all like 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Points out the difference between growing up color blind with no prejudice and growing up with prejudice and trying to intellectually over coming the prejudice. I have been thinking about this book for a few weeks and think it does help to explain todays slow improvement in racial relations.
In Harper Lees new release, Jean Louise Finch confronts the realities of life that each child does when realizing that her childhood view of the world has been shaded to protect her emotional innocence.  I found this book well written, descriptive in the style of Ms. Lees attention to depth and detail, and a thought provoking read.
This was a good book, I'm glad I read it but don't understand what the "dust up" was all about.<br/><br/>"To Kill A Mockingbird" was a GREAT book and this was a good follow up.  I loved getting to know the grownup Scout and meet her love interest but this was not the book that "To Kill A Mockingbird" was.
Well it took awhile to get any semblance of a plot. I was really struggling getting through it at the beginning but have to say the ending made up for the beginning struggle. And yes it is a bit depressing about Atticus' viewpoint but in the end it didn't ruin his reputation for me cause of his love for his daughter and her views.
I thought it was a great novel and I did get some picture of what it was to live in the South.  I think that trying to keep the Black people "in their place" was pointed out.  These "White" people were afraid of losing their superiority as I picture it.  I can see why it was not acceptable literature at that time.
I'm happy to say that I finished reading Go Set a Watchman today.  I am happy that it's over because it is probably one of the ten worst books I have ever read.  If this book went to the publisher before Mockingbird I dare say that this book probably would never have been published.  Sometimes it pays to quit while you're ahead.
Giving it 4 stars because I'm mad as all heck that we find out a horrible nasty tidbit in chapter one.  She knew!  She knew what we weer going to find out and that makes me so mad... letting us embrace and feel that these characters were ours in To Kill A Mocking Bird and then to spring THAT on us?  Bad Form Harper... bad form.
This was a necessary and welcome look at Atticus and Scout. Atticus was a kind man until his white supremacy was threatened. Scout was an adoring daughter until she saw the truth of her family's feelings.
It was okay. Not as good as the original but I'm glad I read it.
Very slow and not what I expected based on To Kill a Mockingbird
It was okay, nothing like her blockbuster To Kill a Mockingbird.
Disappointing.  She can write better than this!  A real letdown.
Did not hold my interest.  A far cry from To Kill A Mockingbird.
Good, entertaining book, but no "To Kill A Mockingbird".
This book was real captivating, and I thought very well written.
interesting, though not nearly as good as To Kill a Mockingbird!
Reread To Kill a Mockingbird. It makes Watchman easier to follow
A must read!  You will see why it was not published years ago --the country was not ready for it.  Even now, the pushback is<br/>strongly felt.  Lee addresses the southern attitudes toward people of color in the 50s in all the complexity.  A very timely novel<br/>to read in the midst of the turmoil over social justice today.
This is an interesting first draft. As a retired English teacher I did not expect much, and this "novel" delivered. This appears to be a great bit of marketing. I am sure If Harper Lee was in good health she would not allow this draft to be published. It adds a little to a great novel, but falls short in too many ways.
This book was more complicated and hard to follow than TKAM, but it was still good in its own right. The entire book is a fairly large build up to the last three chapters and reading the book from a 2015 standpoint, it's rather profound. Most of my highlights came in the last two chapters. It was good and I'm glad I read it.
Counted the days to receive and read this book - Loved the book and movie<br/>To Kill A Mockingbird but not so much with Go Set A Watchmen.  I ended the<br/>book feeling empty and sorry I pre-ordered.
Writing is convincing proof that Truman Capote must have had a firm hand in the writing of Mockingbird.  Dialogue is pedantic at times, juvenile at others.  As a sequel it is disappointing - written on a forth grade level, it would never have been published if it hadn't been billed as the follow up to Atticus Finch's story.
After all the discussion prior to the book's release, I hadn't expected to like it. I didn't want my Mockingbird memory of Atticus to be sullied, especially as I remembered the courtroom of the movie version. And national commentators had also complained about the long discussions between Scout, her father and her uncle in Watchman. So I expected a boring read. However, these criticisms were the things I found most compelling and worth  much discussion. Scout's anger and disappointment with her father reflect many family relationships. Parents and children, especially adult children, may not see eye-to-eye on many issues, from politics to lifestyle. As a result criticism and judgments are tough and potentially sever relationships. Scout must to come to grips with who her father is, and always was. She just didn't know him as a child, even though she idolized him. And despite her disappointment and rage at him, Atticus still leads the way to reconciliation and love. A powerful message.<br/>Watchman is a book from a particular time (1950 or so) in the country's struggle with Supreme Court decisions,and  race relations. This is where the lengthy conversations are especially useful today. Through her characters, Harper Lee presents her view of what makes Southerners historically the way they are. Her conversations help readers better understand the South, but can also be applied to the rest of the country as we continue to struggle racial issues. So contemporary. So much to talk about!<br/>And, the book has laugh-aloud moments from Scout's past--anecdotes that may be in Mockingbird, but are worth reading again in a different context.
After growing up reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" I was extremely disappointed with this book.  It doesn't even follow the story line as a prequel, but changes the entire story background.  I feel Ms. Lee should have quit while she was ahead, and see no reason this book was ever published except for financial gain.
A disappointment from beginning to end.
It is interesting but obviously not really finished as a novel.
Should have read before  To Kill a Mockingbird, but a was good.
Now I understand was it remained unpublished for so many years.
Very slow moving.  Not sure what the point of the novel was. 😒
A reminder that publishers do know what they are talking about!
Disappointing, not at all the quality of To Kill A Mockingbird.
It's not "To Kill A Mockingbird" - so don't expect that
Very southern slow ponderous pace with thought-provoking ending
A distant second place from "To Kill A Mockingbird"!!!!
Did not enjoy as much as To Kill A Mockingbird. Wordy at times.
Loved it, but wanted more. Nothing beats To Kill A Mockingbird!
Controversy aside, this is a compelling and well-written story.
Go Set A Watchman reads like the first draft of a really great novel.  The pieces are all there, but polish and balance are missing.  Atticus and Scout become more well rounded characters, good but flawed (like most of us).  I'm glad to know them better, I only wish Harper Lee had been able to finish this novel properly.
I am glad I took the time to read this book.  It really could have used the heavy hand of an editor, but I understand why it was published "raw". I found the ending to be abrupt, and really disappointing. I was left feeling rather sad, almost numb, for lack of a better description.  But, I do recommend this book.
Don't just take my word for it, read for yourself! Atticus and Scout were very much in character! Harper Lee is amazing, she delivered yet another award winning price. I am honored to be a loyal fan.
It has been a long time since I read the "Mockingbird" so I had to do some recall to place the characters.  I found the main story to be sadly true regarding the relationships of the two ethnic groups.  The South will always be the South it still is until it builds a different respect for their fellow neighbors.
I found "Go Set a Watchman" to be a poorly written first draft of a mediocre book, so much so that I am left wondering if Tay Hohoff was largely responsible for the clean, flowing nature of "To Kill a Mockingbird." I know that there are years separating the two books, but it's difficult to reconcile the extreme differences in the quality (or lack thereof) of the writing itself.<br/><br/>The two novels will be the subjects of hundreds of dissertations, lectures, and essays, and I am looking forward to following how "Watchman" will impact Harper Lee's legacy.  I have a sense that it won't be kind.
Disappointed in the Character of Atticus Finch, he found himself conforming to the ideals of the South during that time period, instead of standing up and being a fighter like he was in Mockingbird.
This is, perhaps, THE most boring book I have read in......I can't remember when. Nothing happens, I mean nothing. No big court case, no drama. If, in fact, this was sent to the publisher and rejected prior to "To Kill A Mockingbird" it makes sense. This was a complete waste of money. Don't waste your money.
Really wonder about who wrote it; why it was published now and who is really making the money from its being published.  Atticus shows up as a man of his time and place- not the hero we loved in To Kill a Mockingbird ; Scout is redeemed.  So sad that the arguments being made in the 1950s are still being made today.
Very disappointed. At times the book read as though someone else had written it.  The time set for the book didn't match with the dialogue. The characters may have been older in "Go Set a Watchman" but you wouldn't expect them to be the opposite of themselves.  The story line was disjointed and felt false.
None of us are as good as some people think we are nor are we as bad.  The same could be said of Atticus.  Having grown up during segregation I knew these people they were misguided and ethnocentric  but still good people.  It's a must read not because of its predecessor as it carries itself under its own weight.
Glad I read it.  Read the book before reading any reviews and come to your own decision on its merits.  Makes one reflect on his/her personal views. Keep in mind the time period of the writing.
If you are looking for a book like To Kill A Mockingbird, this is not it. This book is about Scout and her struggles with change and racism. The book will explain some of what was going on in the South following the Civil War. I enjoyed the book, but it is not really a feel good book like To Kill A Mockingbird.
This reads as a draft or author's notes for a full story, not a finished narrative.  Toward the end of the book, Harper Lee pontificates from<br/>the uncle's perspective.  Scout comes off as naive and judgmental.  A coming of age story as our nation is also experiencing growing pains<br/>pre-civil rights era.
When I finished it I was disappointed and thought that It was not the best book I had ever read.  I was disappointed, I suppose, because of all the hype.  To Kill A Mockingbird was such an excellent book and I had very hogh expectations for this book too.  I probably would not recommend someone to buy the book.
Somewhat interesting. Not even close to To Kill a Mockingbird
I didn't really like it as much as to kill a mockingbird bird I thought itcwasca little slow
Not the great novel that Mockingbird was.  Not as interesting
Poorly written.. I can see why it wasn't published years ago.
Harper Lee showed good judgment NY not publishing this novel.
Agree with Harper Lee that this shouldn't have been published
It's far from the literary masterpiece To Kill a Mockingbird.
A huge disappointment. The only good character was the uncle.
I am embarrased I pre-ordered this before reading any reviews
It seems best that this came out after "Mockingbird".
I enjoyed this book...no comparisons seems to be the ticket!!
Strong YOUNG ADULT ring to this prequel-sequel - and preachy!
the book seemed to try to justify  segregation  in the south.
Not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird", easy to read.
Not an easy read nor page turning like To Kill a Mockingbird.
Interesting look at the future scout in the civil rights era.
Even though I knew this was an "iffy" choice, I couldn't not order it. This is pointless nostalgia from an older Scout. Other than some of the characters, it really has no connection to "Mockingbird". There is a lot of blather, nothing happens and if there was a point, I couldn't see it. Ship it.
It was a journey I willingly went on and the payoff was enormously satisfying. The first part is beautifully crafted even without much action- I was drawn in by imagery and the use of words. The point of the story forms a bit further in the book and by then I was fully engaged. The final third was mesmerizing.
I am from Alabama but I moved away in 1954. Harper Lee elegantly tells it like I remember it, especially the extreme Southern feelings about conflicts about States Rights. My paternal grandparents died before I was born but 7 of grandmother's siblings survived and I remember them and their stories well. My grandmothers twin sister still lived on the family farm and I remember the many stories and animosity about the Northern carpet-baggers and scalawags who mistreated everyone black and white. Before World War II there were many share-croppers (both black and white) on the old farms and everyone came to town on Saturday to barter their goods and spend what little money they had. We lived in town and I was young (born in 1934) but I remember occasions when desperate families came to our door asking if there was anything chore they could do to earn a little money. My father had an auto repair and service station and some of my best friends were black employees at the station. I learned many skills, courtesies and respects from both black and white friends and employees of my father. Reading the book brought back vivid recollections of growing up in the South. It was a really captivating read that I finished in two days finding time between various chores and the Summer visit of our children and grandchildren. I feel that every American with responsible conservative or libertarian values who reads the book can find renewed energy and expectations that Americans may wake up and join together to bring our country back to the values contained in our constitution.
This was an amazing twist on the To Kill a Mockingbird most of us have all read and loved. I highly recommend this book but i feel like the only reason this book had such negative reviews is because either people had way too high expectations or they didnt understand the type of book this was to begin with.
This reads like a draft of a book that with considerable editing would be good young adult fiction.<br/>Harper Lee's custodian and publisher did her no favors here by publishing this book.
Going further into time and reexamining life in Maycomb, Alabama and the ;lives of the residents.  Jean(Scout) has to learn to understand that things change, people change, and  she has to rethink her ideas and beliefs .  The people we place on pedestals can fall off, and when they do it hurts us not them.
This is an excellent book.  there have been negative reviews of the book, but I would ignore them.  What has happened in this book is that the view of the little girl toward her father has become more honest.  It is very well written, and makes me wish that there were more new works coming from the author.
Too long, slow and very disapointing.
Not worth the money.  Ended abruptly.
I didn't compare this to her previously published novel. I think it was an honest depiction of what many of us who idolize our parents find out when our doe eyes are finally opened, even superman isn't perfect. It was an interesting story that held my attention and moved along at a steady clip. Good read.
Decent.  I can see why it was shelved the first time around.
I expected a better read.  But Harper Lee, I had to read it.
Not quite the read I was expecting, but entertaining enough.
Just doesn't measure up to To Kill A Mockingbird in my mind.
Slow and stodgy at first. Improved later. Reads like a draft
Held my attention...but "elementary" in it's impact.
Well written! I enjoyed the story and learned a lot from it.
Ms Lee weaves a story of learning how to define yourself despite and yet because of your environment and upbringing.  Her vocabulary is astounding and challenging.  Her ability to accurately portray a community and its people is simply amazing.  Wish another four or five of her books could be found.
The New York publishers and controversy adds to the appeal.
Disappointment compared to "To Kill A Mockingbird."
I've not finished reading it yet! I'll re review once I do.
So disappointing! Couldn't finish it. And loved mockingbird
Like having an old friend to tea after a very long absence.
An excellent read.  A good glimpse of the South in the 50s.
It's reflecting life as it is in many parts of our country.
Ironic how this book was released in these troubling times.
I don't think this work was actually written by Harper Lee.
Not anywhere good as to kill a mockingbird, but stiil good
liked the story but not as good as the kill a mocking bird
I enjoyed reading the book and found it humorous as well as nostalgic and tragic in a way. I feel this is a reflection of her own relationship with her father. Although it did not have the impact as her "To Kill A Mockingbird" I am glad she wrote it and it found its way to publication.
I would doubt that Go Set A Watchman was written by Harper Lee.  Don't read this expecting to find a sequal to To Kill A Mockingbird.  This story does not compare and, to me, lacks a complete story line and character development.  Wait a few weeks and search for a used copy to save your money.
There is a lot to think about in this book.  It is not to be judged too quickly, as I fear many will do.  After you read it, talk about it with someone to flush out its themes and ideas.  If you do not have a solid knowledge and appreciation of Mockingbird, this one will be hard to appreciate.
I read some pre-reviews before reading the book, and was disgusted how today's racial values had tarnished a view of an old character.  The story is a great tale of growing up in the South with its culture, values, and history.  It is also a story of character development through perspective.
Publishing Watchman has given the world a master class on the creation of a novel.  World over Watchman and Mockingbird will be required reading in that order.  Then the discussions will begin:  how did Harper Lee get the breathtakingly brilliant Mockingbird from the varied pieces of Watchman?
Honestly, I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about so I downloaded it with an open mind.  It didn't "grab" me or keep me interested.  The best part of the book is a baptism flashback.  Very disappointing.  And I don't know why all the thousands of reviews are so tediously long.
Really good<br/><br/>I bought two
I liked this book, but I do not believe if Harper Lee was fully cognizant, she would have allowed it to be published. Why now? In 2015 when her memory and her health are poor, would she publish a book that destroys the reputation of Atticus Finch, a literary figure who towered above ordinary men, and was an iconic figure in literature?  Somebody will make millions from the sale of the book (Ms Lee is too old to get much benefit from the windfall.) But in the pursuit of money, one of the most decent men in literature has lost his place as an beacon of progressive thinking, and become a racist product of his time. Go Set a Watchman is a thought provoking book, but it doesn't stand on its own, and it will forever tarnish the reputation of a man I thought I loved because of his integrity and farsightedness. I would have preferred never to have met, the new, but not improved Atticus Finch.
Kind of boring. I'm gonna finish it. Hope it gets better.
Well written, but the overall theme was a bit depressing.
I read many of the reviews of this book prior to buying or reading it. What I noticed the most is people comparing the book, the author, and the characters to Lee's later book. And they don't really connect. As others mentioned, the was an early book, not a sequel to Mockingbird. Yes, it had the same characters, but they were familar to Lee and who she wanted to write about.<br/>With that in mind, I adored it. Yes, I did hear both Atticus & Scout's voices from the movie as I read it, but my mind did not slip back to what they were as younger versions unless Lee led us there. It described a time both familiar and not to me. I was born in the 50s on the west coast, so much of the racial changes were too far away for me to notice. I grew up knowing few blacks but the couple I knew personally were just people, not a color or different. Just a curiosity. So reading this was fascinating to me seeing the mentality and thoughts of the people living in the South.<br/>I didn't feel offended by what Atticus did as some people were and was a bit confused by all the uproar. And sometimes felt a kinship to Scout in my feelings today. Scout discovered her father, in a way many never have a chance to.<br/>But I don't think they should be compared to the later Mockingbird book. Enjoy the book for what it was and is; a window into the past. A past I hope is never repeated, even though with today's headlines, it's hard to believe some of it still goes on.
I just finished this novel and I was amazed. Sequels, even ones written first are never as good and should be never compared because it is not fair to the book or author. I think it was a brilliant book as we witness Scout maturing and coming into her own. I highly recommend this book!
I guess I was expecting more.  It was worth the read, but nothing like "To Kill a Mockingbird."  I can understand why the publishers wanted her to rewrite the story and improve on it.  Harper Lee was a very good writer. Too bad she didn't pursue her writing more over the years.
Well put together story and most believable. Not a stretch of the imagination to suspect that the story was as much fact as fiction. the story was well structured and kept the reader wanting to turn the next page.  Reading to Kill a Mockingbird first is a must before reading this book.
I truly loved TKAMB, but this one was a disappointment compared to that classic.  Perhaps I was expecting too much, and perhaps there was a reason why this book was not published until recently.  Either way, I am trying not to let my reading of Watchman taint my love for the classic.
I can see why the publisher didn't publish it the first time.  It was extremely boring.  Even reading this book forgetting anything about "Mockingbird" didn't help.  I hope this doesn't tarnish Harper Lee's reputation as an excellent author of "To Kill A Mockingbird".
Not what I expected, so I was disappointed in the story.
Good book, but I can't help comparing it to Mockingbird.
What can I say other than it was as good as I had hoped.
Good but not great. Not the same calibre of mockingbird.
Not as great as To Kill a Mockingbird, but a good story.
After all the build-up, I was disappointed in the novel.
The first few pages drew me in. I loved the idea of seeing Atticus through Scout's grownup eyes. But, there was so much tell, not show, it was almost an essay about a story. And way too pat. Didn't begin to truthfully represent the realities of being black in the south at that time.
Not as tightly edited as "To Kill A Mockingbird" but a great read. TKAM is my all-time favorite book, I re-read it every couple of years. I will be re-reading this one too.
I will not post any spoilers, but I will say there are some things in this story which disappointed me and some beloved characters not in the book. Still, it was an interesting story, and I was glad I had read it. Not a classic like To Kill a Mockingbird, but still worth reading.
As I expected, Ms. Lee's writing is wonderful!  However, I found the story in the end to be weak and disappointing.  The compromise to go back home and make weak attempts to change the culture seems implausible.  This book makes me reassess my love of Atticus in Lee's first book.
Read it straight through. She has the characters express things we as a society just can't seem to to face in ourselves. And she does it with the respect that should make us all think about what our convictions are and why we hold them. Moved me deeply. Thank you so much Ms. Lee.
Just when you think it's going to take off your slowed down to a crawl.  Worth reading, the context and finding the profound is up to the reader.  Go Set A Watchman overall challenges the sense that you have to be either for or against however it lacks the depth of true insight.
After all the sort of negative reviews I was not expecting a lot, but Ms. Lee's prose was as delightful as I remembered, her insights into the civil rights unrest remarkable for that period and her age, and the story, while not earthshaking, a good "growing up" treatise.
This will never be the classic that To Kill a Mocking Bird is but it is still a fascinating companion novel that made me cry as well as extremely angry. This story takes place 20 years after TKMB in the midst of the civil rights movement. Jean Louise (Scout) is Twenty-six and makes a journey to her hometown after years of Living in New York and is disturbed by changes she sees to her hometown, but more to the truths she learns about her own family. There is a truth that is presented in the continuation of Jean Louise's story that is not always easy to hear. It certainly is not easy for her to find her idol to be human and the reader is taken along right with her every step of the way.<br/><br/>I hated losing my own idol in this story, but the effectiveness of Ms. Lee's writing and the way she hits the strings she fully intended to hit were artfully done. Its not an easy ride and is at times not enjoyable, but it all rings truthful to the characters, and truth is often uncomfortable and upsetting.<br/><br/>So while in some ways I wish I hadn't read it, because losing idols is heartbreaking business. And for similar reasons I will likely never pick this to read again but it is a look into how a good person can have views that are so vastly different from yours and still be a good person if only a human one. And perhaps is a tale that only Harper Lee could tell with such authenticity.
A powerhouse book!  In my judgment, it should be read after To Kill A Mockingbird.  Makes more sense to read it according to story (chronologically) rather than the order in which it was written.  I would love to have seen a dozen more books written by Lee in between these two.
Amid all conflict about it, I read "Go Set a Watchman." I treated this book as if I had never read Mockingbird. Despite the mixed reviews, I enjoyed the book. Most important, it explained -but didn't justify - some baffling Southern attitudes to this Connecticut Yankee.
Wreak this, then go back and readTo Kill A Mockingbird.
Not even close to the magnificent To Kill a Mockingbird
Not as good as what I expected considering all the hype
Not the great work that To Kill A Mockingbird was......
It wasn't as good as her other.  But I really liked it.
Not as well written as expected. Story line convoluted.
Not worth picking up.  To kill a mockingbird it is not
Nothing like I expected. Did not even finish the book.
NOwhere near as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. boring!
Not a novel......just scout obsessing about her father
Does not live up to expectations, but is well written.
I bought it for a gift and haven't heard back about it
Boring end, half the book was reminiscing on childhood
Had to read it because of its historical significance.
I am glad I read it although I was not very impressed.
I enjoyed listening to the novel and thought Ms. Witherspoon did an excellent job of reading and interperting the work. I just do not appreciate some of the language used by the author.  I feel it is unnecessary to use so much cussing and does not strengthen the dialogue.
Interesting prospective on social life at the time in that area. Also, enjoyed reading about 'Scout' in the sequel and her strong personality.  I can understand why the publisher, back then, told her to write a book about her earlier life.  Great read, highly recommended.
I'm so glad MOCKINGBIRD was published first, even though WATCHMAN had been written first!  Lee captured life in the South of Scout's childhood in the former and her adulthood in the latter. What Jean Louise Finch learns about her own "watchman" is well worth discovering.
The entire point of this novel is for Jean Louise Finch to figure out her father, Atticus, is human. The rest of us need the lesson, too. No human being is perfect or worthy of God-like adoration. In that regard, it is a great read in Harper Lee's sweet, Southern voice.
This is a good read. As someone from Alabama I can see things from Scouts perspective .... Not as polite as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD,but substantial in its own right!
Loved the book. Very good writing as I knew it would be. Harper Lee should have written more books. I have to order to kill a mocking bird. Thank  You Harper Lee.
Harper Lee illuminates the old South and race and yet the whole nation still struggles with race, family and growing up. The characters are grown and it may bother some fans of To Kill A Mockingbird but it's a new/interesting Jean Louise. Enjoy the good prose...I did.
As it often happens, you finish and great book and want the story to continue.<br/>"Go Set a Watchman" is gratefully the next stage of Scout's life. The civil rights perspective for the South is portrayed with unbelievable accuracy. A great pleasure to read.
Very slow.  I never finished it.
Awful book. Hype > the book.
Found the story very disjointed.
I put it down, no comparison to To Kill a Mockingbird
Slow to start, pace finally picked up and end was goo
It was a little disjointed. Not as good as the sequel
I loved the language but I missed Jem, Boo, and Dell.
Interesting and insightful, but not my favorite book.
gift for another person, who seems to be enjoying it.
This Book has been over rated. I could not finish it.
Did not care for the story or the way it was written.
Did not care for the book...never caught my attention
Not nearly as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird"
I was very, very disappointed when I read this book.
It isn't To Kill a Mockingbird, but it is very good.
3 weeks to read. I read 2 or 3 books a week, Boring.
A fun "rest of the story" about the Finches.
I REALLY ENJOYED IT.  TOO BAD SHE DIDN'T WRITE MORE.
It was poorly written. Slow reading and wen nowhere.
It was good but not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird
Better than I thought it would be. Truly enjoyed it!
Well written but all of the story was so compressed.
I did not find the ending satisfying, but Lee did not write the book to satisfy me. The "New South" is still the "Old South," and although Scout does not like it, she sees she has some adjusting to do. Her attitude would fit in well in Ferguson.
Loved the novel.  I read it first and then re-read To Kill a Mockingbird... it had been years since I read it in school and the refresher was perfect.  Of course, the racism was uncomfortable and our take away should be to never go back to those ignorant times.
If you read this book after To Kill A Mockingbird there are to many things between the book that don't match up like the court case. I feel this book was not cross refferenced enough and I find it hard to focus and read this book when t huh ings dont match up.
A disappointment ....atticus' character is flat as is Jean Louise's...not much substance...I think today's reader is more sophisticated and like the rest of the world Harper Lee's novel will not stand the test of time like her first book...sorry,not a classic
Loved how the story combined Scouts past with her present.  Although the book itself was a bit shorter than I expected it was perfect for a rainy afternoon
Enjoyed Harper Lee's style of writing but disturbed by all the anger. What about Henry? Uncertain about the ending she wrote here. Is this what Harper Lee did in her life? Stayed in home  town but never married?<br/>Lots of questions left unanswered.<br/>N
Nicely written prose. I enjoyed visiting Scout again as a grown woman. Definitely set in complicated times. Seemed a little short to me and and not very complicated in the telling. Other characters touched on wo depth. You wonder what happens to Henry, etc.
A surprise to me after hearing opinions of Aticus in this book.  I believe I understand his ideals and understand where a lot of readers come away with different thoughts of him. You have to pay attention to his dialog, really listen to get it. A fine book.
Harper Lee is brilliant, but my heart is broken. Felt the disillusionment as keenly as Jean Louise. Becomes more a view of the Southern states struggle to preserve their way of life tha a comment on civil rights as To Kill a Mocking Bird had appeared to be.
I enjoyed the novel. Atticus seemed to me to be a shadow. Almost a foil to Scout. A completely different book. A completely different approach. It does not change my opinion about To Kill A Mocking Bird or the Atticus Finch from that novel. Worth the read.
To Kill A Mockingbird is a very hard act to follow.
haven't decided yet how I feel about it or Atticus.
Interesting to read as To kill a Mockingbird lover?
OK but not close to "To kill a mockingbird"
Would not be my "go to" book to read again.
You must remember the time and place it was written
just started reading this.  I am enjoying it so far
Interesting but no "To Kill a Mockingbird "
Not as good as Mockingbird......but very readable..
Good, but not great.  Lee does a good job of creating a feeling of time and place.  Seeing what happens to Atticus and Scout 20 years later is interesting.  The book wanders though and the story not as tight as "Mockingbird."  A good read though.
Thank goodness her editors saw the world she was trying to create and sent her back to the drawing board. A fascinating study of the writing process. I just hope it's publication was what she truly wanted and we're not reading a diary without permission.
Everyone is consumed by this idea after reading this book.  Read it again...it's wonderful in that it requires as much thought as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Readers, This is a first draft of Mockingbird, make no mistake, and that is where its value lies. Writers, editors, and historians can see what happens when a young writer is lucky enough to find just the right editor and is smart enough to let that editor draw out and shape her work. Tay Hohoff deserves the respect given to the likes of Maxwell Perkins for taking Lee's well-intentioned mix of memoir and anti-racist screed (Watchman) and forging a literary work of art (Mockingbird). And I don't doubt that Truman Capote contributed here and there as well to Mockingbird: "Ladies...were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum." There is a lot of anger against her father in Watchman; Atticus was always conflicted, but the weight of his character was put on his sense of justice in Mockingbird, whereas in Watchman his defense of a black man is a side effect of his politics. Mostly, this book/draft is boring, the childhood memories not interesting, the relationship with Hank unconvincing, and the discussions about race offensive. I'm giving it three stars for its educational value. Having lived in the South during that era, I found the accuracy regarding attitudes of the time on target and stomach churning. Plus, where is Boo?
While the subject matter  was relevant, I didn't feel there was a definite plot. It was difficult to follow at times and simply didn't hold my attention. I kept waiting for something that never happened. I do believe this was at best a media over hype.
It took awhile for the story to develop but develop it did. I thought it reviewed, rehashed, and came to grips with race relations in the 60's with to pretty deep insight. In all I liked the story but I thought it ended a little too soon. Sven Engblom.
I gave this book 4 stars because I liked the story line. The characters were descriptive and easy to relate to. This book was laugh out loud funny in places. Great read. However, I did not find this book stellar just "nice". Not bad or good just "nice"
boring
Really disappointed. If I had not read To Kill a Mockingbird, I'm sure I would not have understood the book at all. It was a wise decision for the publisher to ask Harper Lee to write a book about Scout's childhood. I'm glad I read this book, however.
A more nuanced work than " To Kill a Mockingboard" and much less one-dimensional as she sees her dad as an adult know and has to come to understand some of the accomodations he had to make in that town in that time. Beautiful ending, surprise!
From the moment that I opened the book it was like hearing from an old friend. I know there is controversy about Atticus, but I found this new information more interesting than upsetting. Overall an excellent read that was worth my time and attention.
I enjoyed this book in spite of all the controversy.  It makes total sense to me and didn't leave me uneasy about To Kill A Mockingbird. To me, this book brings To Kill A Mockingbird down to Earth and a little more realistic, as a lifelong Southerner.
could not get into it and did not finish this book
I like "To Kill a Mockingbird" much better
Somewhat of a letdown after To Kill a Mockingbird.
I loved this sequel, I just didn't want it to end.
After all the hype I found it a bit disappointing.
Couldn't get into the book at all.  Didn't like it
It's all over the place, haven't even finished it.
Not as amazing as "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Helps explain "loss of identity" of Scout.
a stand alone classic that truly compliments TKAM.
i enjoyed the book because it was so true to the time in which it was set.  There were lots of nostalgic scenes and very descriptive vignettes of life in a small southern town of its time.  The plot was almost incidental to the value of the book.
I love the complexity of the book, that is a very true portrayal of a young person discovering that the idol has feet of clay.  The only disappointment I had was the inconsistent reporting of Tom Robinson's trial.  "Watchman" should have been edited to include the outcome of the trial as it appeared in "Mockingbird".  The original concept, that Tom Robinson was acquitted from "Watchman", is completely inconsistent with that day and time and this one incongruous note prevents the two novels from making two halves of a whole as they should.  Like finding half a bivalve shell on the beach, but of the dozens of shells of the same species, none of them fit.  And remember, Atticus was appointed by the court to defend Tom, and his statement about hoping to avoid a "case of this kind" does not speak to me at least of a burning desire to defend an innocent man. He recognized Tom's innocence, but in "Watchman" is not willing to support court decisions which make that injustice less likely. He does not wish the boat to be rocked, or has forgotten that "the bill will be presented.  I hope it is not in you children's time".  Also recall that pain can deteriorate character.
This book took me back to several discussions I had with my own father during the early 60,s.  This novel explained the conflict in the two generation's minds.  I found myself wishing it had been published back then for the benefit of all of us.
The real substance of the book came far too late.
I couldn't really get into it, never finished it.
Excellent follow-up to How to Kill a Mockingbird.
Boring. Could not get through the first paragraph
Okay but doesn't compare to To Kill A Mockingbird
I coult not finish the book, very poorly written.
Worthwile read.  Good interpretation of the tmes.
what plot? there was no plot!
The book was boring - no plot
A lot of 'speechifying'; dull
There are probably many reasons why Harper Lee did not publish this book sooner.  She wasn't done with it.  I almost gave up after 4 chapters.  The story still had not gotten started.  She's trying to make some points with the book, but . . .
I enjoyed this novel and seeing how some of Harper Lee's characters were developed for her later novel. 'To kill a mockingbird' is by far the better novel, however, this book shows the path to that more mature writing style. A very good read.
Very slow beginning. Scout's disillusionment with her father is the crux of this novel, but that is not convincingly written, and in particular, shown. This is a book of dialogues, a thin sequel to Harper Lee's powerful To Kill a Mockingbird.
After reading about the publication of this book and all the commentary here on it, I now understand why Jackie Kennedy in the last days of her remarkable life  sat  in her 5th Avenue apartment with her long-time assistant  and together burned Jackie's most personal correspondence from her life. A wise woman to the last, she  understood the nature of public exposure and exploitation perhaps better than anyone else ever could .  Harper Lee should have done the same with this first novel a long time ago.  Now both her publisher and others are exploiting a first effort that when revised became a memorable classic that should never be  rendered less of a classic by the appearance now of  this flawed early effort.
I just finished reading it last night. It isn't as compelling as Mockingbird but I started and finished it in one day, so.... Deals with the emotional reactions of the rural, Southern white and to a slight extent the blacks of the era. The Supreme Court had just rendered its integration decree when this book begins.  I lived through this time of change so much of what is presented  jogs memories. Numerous of "Scout's" childhood memories are brought out as an extension of Mockingbird.  There are a few references to things that happened in Mockingbird that are diametrically opposite to what is told in Watchman. Secondarily it looks at the caste system that has always been (and still is) present in the South.  As in, "Who is her/his mama/daddy?" --"You can date him/her but you can't marry him/her."<br/><br/>I will read it again even though I didn't like it as well as Mockingbird.  Lee does too good a job of shining a light on race relations in the South prior to and beyond the legal end of segregation.  I suspect that it would have bombed in the 50's had it been released then.  She does a good  job of holding a mirror up to most of us.  The title comes from Isaiah, 21:1-11.
Much like, "Too Kill a Mockingbird"  Scott's idealist viewpoint.  Still go reading for a 67 yr old "good Ole boy", from Alabama.  Thought Notthern, folks will have total different perspective, than myself.  Will NOT, get it.
It sucked, sorry.
It was okay.  Did not find it an easy read book.
I didn't even finish it.  Didn't like it at all.
Good but not as intense as To Kill A Mockingbird
I did not enjoy this book....no further comment.
Its good but not as good as To KillA Mockingbird
A peek at the South during the Civil Rights era.
Excellent condition and definitely worth a read!
So disappointing. Read more like a treatise on how to be a racist. Would have helped to have an opening preface explaining when the book was written, how & why it was released, etc. I still love HTKAM but see Atticus in a new (ugly) light.
I couldn't put this book down. I did not read the book as a prequel or sequel - just a book. And I loved it. The characters were real and had real flaws. This book is well worth the read if you are willing to read it as a stand alone book.
I liked the tone of Scout's adult voice and the problems involved with "returning home." I did think the author included some light, almost frivolous passages that not develop the plot nor serve the more serious issues in the book.
I enjoyed this book. The complete subjectivity and obstinate opinion of Scout giving way to a metamorphosis that changed her life was inspiring. There were some very humorous parts and some parts that had me gasp and eager to read on.
A big disappointment and very "preachy"
I especially liked the cadence of the dialogue.
It was an ok read, did not live up to the hipe.
a bit disappointing. I couldn't get through it.
Good, but not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird.
Ok, but not as good as I thought it would be...
very good follow on from To kill a mocking bird
Good book, not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird
Good, but not as good as to kill a mockingbird.
Loved it after getting over the initial shock!!
Enjoyed the point of view of Scout as an adult!
Definitely not "To Kill A Mockingbird".
Not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Worth the money and wait for it to be released!
It was good, but not as good as the first book.
This book was a good read my teenagers loved it
Like the book,as usual Harper Lee is brilliant.
Good, but I enjoyed To Kill A Mockingbird more!
So far so good , I am only about half way thru.
This book could easily stand alone as an exceptional novel without the historical significance of "To Kill a Mockingbird."  However, having that novel as a prerequisite. makes "Go Set a Watchman" even more prevailing.
I thought it would never end and prayed that it would....I have nothing good to say about this book. Boring .too bad we make purchases based on author and hype. Just because a book is in the best seller list doesn't mean it is good.
This novel was insightful and delved into the many differences our history, cultures of north and south, class, race and family dynamics affect our views. I was not disappointed with the novel. I gained new perspectives on history.
A young writers first attempt at a novel, a mix of great writing, immature plot development, and an attempt to help outsiders understand where some southerners were coming from during the civil rights movement. Well worth the read!
I enjoyed this book. Don't go in expecting it to be a sequel,it is kind of it's own story even though it has some of the same characters. It hi-lights what people thought and how they reacted to situations at that time in history.
I really liked this booked. And all of the fuss about Atticus being a bigot and people refusing to read it is silly in my opinion as I think he represents an older white man in the south during a certain time frame in our history.
I did enjoy the book, but it was difficult to read. The dialog at times, was written as if you needed to be there to fully understand. I can see why this was her first book and TKAM was her second. This is definitely unpolished...
Clear and focused depicting a time and culture and practices of what once was.......may still be in certain isolated areas.<br/>I did not agree with many of the critics who disliked Atticus portrayal in this book. It made sense.
It seemed very disjointed, not very smooth transition between chapters or paragraphs. The story did delve into the truth of people, that they are inherently human and fallible, none perfect.  All in all it was good but not great.
It was a good sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird.
Seemed very disjointed and I was disappointed.
It was ok but messy towards the end I thought.
Most depressing book I've read in a long time!
This book was read as a Book Club  selection..
1st time ever finish a book and say thank you.
Great writing but did not care for the ending.
A reunion with a twist and a poignant message.
Just not up to "To Kill a Mockingbird"
Not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird"
Ok, but not as well written as her later book.
Fantastic book..... Wish she had written more.
It can't beat To Kill A Mockingbird, but I'm glad it was published and we were able to see how Mockingbird developed.  It's not a sequel to TKAM, but a "prequel."  Read it in that context, and you will find it enjoyable.
The story didn't go anywhere.  After reading it I came to the conclusion that Harper Lee didn't want to publish it.  It was a continuation of To Kill A Mocking Bird but with everyone older.  To me Scout was strange in the story,
By now, everyone has heard that Atticus Finch is a racist in "Go Set a Watchman." That is oversimplified and, in fact, given his place and time, inaccurate. He is a patient, extraordinarily contemplative, emotionally intelligent realist who, yes, perhaps, has feet of clay. However, to interpret his views from the standpoint of 2015 politics and political correctness is to miss the entire point of the book. It's historic fiction - it must be read that way. Aside from some weak dialogue and non-believable word choice and phrasing (which is what one would expect, I guess, from an unedited galley such as this) there can be no doubt that "Go Set a Watchman" will earn its place on history's bookshelf of great works, next to "To Kill a Mockingbird." Harper Lee's talent, her ability to set a scene and create a mood with just a few words, is, at times, breathtaking. The seeming ease with which she presents this story will be the envy of writers, both experienced and novice. A meaningfully good read by an astonishingly gifted writer. I am thrilled that this literary find occurred in my lifetime.
Totally enjoyed every page.
Published expressly to make a buck. If Harper Lee actually wrote this book then Truman Capote actually wrote To Kill a Mockingbird. No comparison as to the quality of writing. TKAM more like In Cold Blood as compared to this....Borrow this from the library if you must read it. Save your money...I don't believe she even wrote this. I believe it was a scam publishing job by Harper Collins.
I thoroughly enjoyed GSAW from start to finish. I avoided all the negative press and the meat grinder of the sensationalist headlines whose only objective is to come up on search engines and get clicks/pageviews that allowed me to go into this book with a clear mind. With no expectations in mind, I simply loved this book.<br/><br/>Is it on the level of To Kill a Mockingbird? Of course not. It was the best novel of the 20th century. Watchman, however, benefits from the legacy of Mockingbird in that it feels so comfortable getting back into Jean Louise's world. I loved the atmosphere of GSAW from the first page, and some of the interaction scenes had me holding onto every word.<br/><br/>I think most people who negatively reviewed this book (who didn't gain to earn money off of controversy) came in with the wrong expectations. This was the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird. Did it NEED published? Probably not. Am I glad it got released? Absolutely. Do yourself a favor and read it without unreasonable expectations and you'll find a deeply nuanced book that engenders a lot of thought and introspection.
All of my book club was disappointed in thebook.  There were events that contradicted the same happenings in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Missed Gem and Dill, and where did the uncle come from. Interesting  book but not a favorite.
Appropriate to our current debates, sort of. Excellent writing, but I kept feeling the dialogs were a little too articulate/knowledgeable for the character speaking the words. To Kill a Mockingbird expressed characters better.
After all the hype, disappointed would be the word.  When you write a book like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, it is hard to even come close to that greatness.  While the writing is good, the story line just did not hold my interest.
A Southern point of view on the state of affairs following the Civil War.  Very provocative regarding how the situation might have been handled differently.  Also enjoyed Scout's escapades while becoming a responsible adult.
Very disappointing considering the importance of her first novel.  Failed to develop characters in depth.  Perhaps, my expectations were too high.  I felt she should have given more information about Scouts life in New York.
I would recommend this book to anyone. I loved it. Hard to figure why someone with her talent did not it this book out along with To kill a Mockimg bird-they belong together. I couldn't put it down once I started reading it!
I liked it much better than I thought I would.  I feel it is important to listen to people whose ideas are different than my own..<br/>It really makes you think.  Good for a book club,  I reread "Mockingbird "first.
Beautifully written, yet it felt more like an essay than a novel.  same issues we wrestle with today, so current in many ways.  We all have to find what we really think and feel inside ourselves and listen to our own voice.
Started out very slow - somewhat interesting.
Good second novel after to kill a mockingbird
I am glad it was released; it is a fine book.
Excellent book.  Excellent service by Amazon.
Not one of her best novels....hard to finish.
Was sorry I spent 13.99 for this book.  It had a few good parts, but was mainly philosophical.  Was not at all what I was expecting.  The book needs more action.  To kill a Mockingbird- was a much more interesting book.
Dropped it after 44 pages.
Thoughtful book. Good read
Novel is not exactly the right word. It's almost a treatise on family dynamics and racial relations in the deep South in the 50s
What a disappointment. This book should never have been published. It is muddled, unfinished, weak, and disjointed. Could the author of the marvelous iconic To Kill A Mockingbird be the same person who wrote this book?
Obviously a first draft for To Kill A Mickingbird.  As an English teacher, I enjoyed noting how the themes had been honed for Lee's future masterpiece; however, this novel was didactic with poorly developed characters.
I thought this book was brilliant, even better than the original. I thought that it was right that they brought out this book, which I didn't know even existed. I am hopeful that a film adaptation will come eventually.
At how much I liked this book. It was the south at the time it was written.  Thank you to a woman who had the courage to write the times as they were and not sugarcoat history. It was a good sequel to a memorable book.
I liked the book very much. It allows us to see Atticus in greater depth than we had in Mockingbird, and we see Jean Louise learning that depth and developing an adult relationship with her father,family and community.
was not the quality of To Kill a Mockingbird
A disappointment after to Kill a Mockingbird
I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't
Not sure I agree that she really wrote this.
I very much enjoyed this story, well written
Interesting, not what I thought it would be!
I have a lot of trouble even believing Harper Lee wrote this. Atticus Finch as a racist, Jem dead with no real explanation, no ending at all, let alone a happy one. Sad to wait 50 years for a book of this low caliber.
Another, absolutely brilliant novel by Harper Lee. A terrific, masterful telling of relevant subjects for society and familial relationships, through beloved characters. I hope Harper Lee gets a Pulitzer for this one!
This novel started out strong... entertaining and captivating... then suddenly just ended!  I could not believe it was over.  This ending made no sense to me.  I am very disappointed in the editors... not Harper Lee.
This novel is so true to the time and place in which it is set; yet, it reflects so much of the present that it left me a bit breathless.  The revolution spurred on by Brown v. The Board of Education continues today.
Glad "To Kill A Mockingbird " came out first. I can understand why "they" wanted it to be published first. Go Set A Watchman--is definitely not even close to interesting, but I made myself finish it .
One needs to be patient with the story as Harper Lee has chosen to develop it, as it is a slow journey to the place that Jean Louise,aka Scout, eventually arrives.  It is a very thought-provoking journey in the end.
Lee definitely had something important to say in this book.  I wish she'd worked on this book in later years. with the help of a good editor.  It would not have worked when Mockingbird was printed, but it would now.
There was a great deal of dialogue that didn't seem to go anywhere. I never felt myself immersed in the lives of the characters as I had with Mockinbird. Maybe because I am now 50 years older. It didn't sweep me up.
Scout kicks up the leaves and the magic is lost. She learns that in this life things aren't just black and white...there are many shades of gray. She gains her conscious independence and it's not an easy transition.
I always respected Harper Lee for quitting after "To Kill A Mockingbird".  How do you improve on a book that?  Well, she could not it seems  This book was not worth the money or time.  Greatly disappointed.
Overall, I liked the book, but I did think it ended rather abruptly.  Jean Louise did rail at her family a little too much, I would have expected her to not be so unwilling to hear what they were trying to explain.
I found the ending interesting in that for me it wrapped up all the questions and concerns I had throughout the book.<br/>I cringed at some of the references but again I had to remember where the story took place.
After reading this I am surprised by the negative reviews regarding the character of Atticus. The characters are consistent with To Kill A Mockingbird, and reflective of the era and place in which the story is set.
Certainly lived up to my expectations. I enjoyed seeing "Scout" as an adult. The sequencing of the two books was proper. I plan to read a second time. I would also watch the film, if that should ever occur.
i have heard that some people were disappointed that this twisted one of our long time favorites  but i found it very interesting to dig deeper into what really can go on  when push comes to shove.  so i am a fan
It reads like Harper Lee, plunking you right down there in Macomb County, and while Atticus may jar at first, if you stick with all the reasoning, he comes through as wise and loving as ever...and Scout grows up.
Southern attitudes expressed are sickening.
Not nearly as good as "Mockingbird"
Not as great as to Kill a Movking Bird"
I enjoyed the book very much. A great read.
okay but inferior to her more famous novel.
This book was great _ It was a page turner.
I loved it.  Nearly as much as Mockingbird.
I was.. and still am.. Deeply Disappointed.
It doesn't match up to Kill A Mocking Bird.
Reconciling the characters in Go Set A Watchman with the characters of To Kill A Mockingbird was a conscious effort that consistently pulled me out of the story.  I found the dissonance between what I understood the characters to be based on the first novel, and the characters that were presented in the second novel to be a major source of discomfort because they don't truly align.  There are echoes and shadows of the familiar characters within the characters in Go Set A Watchman, but at times they feel like wholly separate people.<br/><br/>I found that if I set aside the notion that the novels are connected, if I stopped thinking of Go Set A Watchman as a sequel, and instead read it as a completely standalone novel, that dissonance disappeared and I was able to focus on enjoying the book for its own merits.  There are actually cues in the text that suggest that, though the setting, the character names and relationships are the same, Go Set A Watchman is indeed an independent story, or perhaps an alternate story.  Regardless, once I separated the two, The dissonance dissolved and the novel made more sense.<br/><br/>Reading it as a separate/alternate story, allowed me to enjoy Go Set A Watchman as the coming of age, awakening of self-identity story that it is.  While To Kill A Mockingbird explored race and class relations in the rural, 1930's South through the eyes of a child, this novel explores how a young woman is able to reconcile who she is as a person, separate from, but still connected to, the people who raised her and the place where she was raised.  Race and class are still a dominant presence in Go Set A Watchman, but not as the central theme. Rather race and class serve as the backdrop from which Scout's independence spearates, they are the impetus for her to coalesce into her own person.<br/><br/>As a story, Go Set A Watchman is interesting and compelling.  All of us either have struggled, are struggling, or will struggle to figure out who we are.  All of us have or will experience the moment of our parents and/or heroes becoming human.  Reconciling and accepting their humanness, including their failings, while maintaining our hold on their lessons and how they molded us, is a crucial moment in many people's development of their self-identity.<br/><br/>As a story, then, it is compelling.  As a work of literature, Go Set A Watchman is rough.  The beautiful prose and imagery of To Kill A Mockingbird is missing.  The seeds are there, but the language is unpolished.  The description of Maycomb in the first chapter of To Kill A Mockingbird will always stand in my mind as one of most beautiful scenes ever painted with the English language; Go Set A Watchman reads more like pencil sketch on a canvas that promises something beautiful to come.<br/><br/>The ending, too, is unpolished.  It feels abrupt and the lessons learned are told to the narrator and therefore to us, the readers.  Much of the ending feels like an explanation of the book rather than a realization of how the pieces of the story fit together as Scout begins to truly make sense of her world, and herself, and herself within the world.<br/><br/>Taken as a whole, Go Set A Watchman is a compelling, uncut gem of story, wrapped in rough brown paper, that's shaped so similarly to a gift that you loved before that you're a little disappointed when you work your way through the coarse exterior and find something other than what you wanted.  Once you get past the disappointment of wanting what came before, and the unfinished exterior, you find that you actually enjoy what you've been given and wish that it were the final polished product.
'Go Set a Watchman' is a prequel that seems entirely like a sequel to Harper Lee's blockbuster novel, 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  While I feel that I have yet to have a better read than the latter classic (and The Literary Guild certainly agrees), it is a valuable time-capsule that has been placed before us for our edification. The manuscript for '...Watchman' wasn't ever going to be discovered during any time that would be conducive for a fair grading. Yes, it is disappointing, but I feel the rich dialogue is insightful enough to demand at least one reading.<br/><br/>All the characters and setting are in place.  They are basically the same:  Jean Louise (Scout) Finch comes home for a visit, arriving from her displaced New York to find her childhood sweetheart (No, not Dill) and become reacquainted with her family. It takes place when it was written (back in the fifties) when Civil Rights were beginning to reemerge in the nation's conscience, and government would start to unpeel the injustices of Jim Crow Laws more steadily since the Reconstruction.<br/><br/>There's a lot of talk in the novel.  This is both 'Watchman's' blessing and its curse.  Very little happens.  We see and hear her connect with Atticus, her uncle, and Aunt Alexandra.  There's a mini-scandal of skinny-dipping with Henry, her would-be fiance', and there's the celebration and mourning of the changes that have come to Macomb since her childhood.  We also get some childhood recollections, but while they make some apt connections, much of the charm and magic is lost.<br/><br/>What IS valuable are the discussions career girl, Jean Louise, has with her Uncle regarding her father's revelation that he is a segregationist.  For me the import is very real.  What makes a segregationist?  Why did (and do) they resist the changes we all know so well?  It seems like we could make a caricature of the sort of person who resists the courts' and legislatures' rulings against segregation, but Lee reminds us they are flesh and blood people. (Her own relatives, for instance.)  It is sometimes someone's father who has real concerns and rationalizations--even if we don't agree with them. Scout, who has to be the autobiographical mouthpiece of Lee herself, is indignant and rails against her uncle and father with steady, but rational outrage (if you can imagine such an oxymoron).<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the lucid dialogue, happy with the after thoughts, hungry for any more elaborations of setting and characters, but while I wanted more stories and more action and more revelation, I know the burden of proof is on me.  I need to judge 'Go Set a Watchman' for what it is and not what it isn't.  '..Watchman' is first, but it seems like a supplement, a post-script, and a revelation. While I almost want to cry about the downfall of Atticus ("You don't pull the mask off the ol' Lone Ranger!"--Jim Croce once sang.) you have to admire the truthfulness, the insight, and the history.  Or to quote Jim Croce again, this novel is "Time in a Bottle," a feisty documentation of the rationales of injustice as revealed in this book.
Finished Harper Lee’s ‘Go Set a Watchman’ yesterday, then went to bed for twenty hours. (This is not a reflection on the book, just the result of having a bad cold.) Anyway, some of my friends requested that I review the book after reading it (as opposed to before, I guess), so I will do so now. (For those of you who haven’t read it yet but plan to, you should ignore the negative reviews and stop reading this one now, unless you are like me and don’t mind knowing what you’re getting into.)<br/><br/>So here goes:<br/><br/>1.)  Jean Louise (Scout) is as spunky and loveable at 26 as she was at 6.<br/>2.)  Ms. Lee actually wrote this first, it is her original vision for Scout and Atticus. It is her first draft of the story, and thus not as polished as ‘Mockingbird’ would ultimately be. (As an example of this – something I did a lot of in my early drafts of ‘Lurch’s Girl’ – she ends much of her dialogue with dashes instead of periods.)<br/>3.)  The book is divided into Parts I-VII…Not sure why.<br/>4.)  Jem is dead. Sorry to be so blunt, but he had a heart attack several years before the start of this story, and died right outside Atticus’ law office. (He does appear in flashbacks, though, as does Dill, who is alive and well and living in Italy.)<br/>5.)  Aunt Alexandra is as bitchy and snobbish as ever, and she and Scout still fuss at each other. (In a nice touch at the end, they seem to reach an understanding.)<br/>6.)  Atticus is not the God-like father figure Scout remembers, and this is the heart of the story. The scene where she confronts him in his office is classic. She definitely doesn’t pull any punches. (In what is maybe a sign of the time and place, the author has no problem - unfortunately - in having Scout herself sound a bit like Atticus in this scene. I would have edited this, except for the parts where she is being sarcastic.)<br/>7.)  The story is set in 1954, not long after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregation, which does not sit well with Atticus or most of the other residents of Maycomb. Scout is fine with the ruling, except she bitterly resents the Court forcing its decision on the South, rather than letting each state decide for itself.<br/>8.)  Scout has a childhood friend, Henry Clinton, who we never saw in ‘Mockingbird’, and they are now romantically involved even though she lives in NYC and only visits home for two weeks every year. Henry is in love with her, but she is ambivalent toward him. They have discussed marriage, which Alexandra tries to discourage because she considers the Clintons trash.<br/>9.)  Scout finds a Ctizen’s Council pamphlet among her father’s papers and reads it. She is sickened by its Klan- like rhetoric and confronts her aunt, who sees nothing wrong with it and tells her that Atticus and Henry are both, at that very minute, attending a meeting, and that Atticus is in fact on the group’s Board of Directors.<br/>10.) Scout sneaks into the Courthouse balcony – the same one from which she and Jem watched the Robinson trial years before – and spies on the meeting. She is, once again, shocked and sickened by what some of the speakers say about blacks (who were politely called Negroes back then, although Atticus and the others use a less-polite term), and runs from the Courthouse in tears. (The Robinson trial is mentioned briefly here, but in this first version Atticus won the case. To me, the ‘Mockingbird’ version was more realistic.)<br/>11.) The next day, Scout is forced to endure a ‘Coffee’, a get-together arranged by Alexandra in her honor. A group of Maycomb ladies attends, some of them former classmates of Scout and Jem, none of them anyone she cares to know now. Scout spars verbally with them, politely because of her aunt, and discovers that many of them hold the same racist views as their husbands. (In a later scene with Henry, he tells her nonchalantly that Bill – one of the husbands – is 100% correct in his views, so why shouldn’t his wife agree with him? He also says it is a wife’s duty to support whatever her husband believes, which of course Scout takes issue with.)<br/>12.) I’ll let y’all discover the rest on your own…Enjoy!<br/><br/>PS – This is not a major issue, but the new story is told in the third-person, allowing for occasional shifts in POV. Scout is mostly referred to in the narration as Jean Louise, which took me a while to get used to.
If it's true that Go Set a Watchman was written before To Kill a Mockingbird, then it's mostly a good thing that the latter was published before the former.  It's also a good thing, I hope, that Watchman was published much later.<br/><br/>Clearly, the Atticus Finch we came to know and love in Mockingbird seems totally different in the work set in a future in the South.  Many people are so certain that he's not the same man, the same upstanding, honest man, we came to love.  However, if you have any real knowledge or memory of the later South, you know what a dangerous and hateful place it could be.  It was also a place where, for generations, people "knew their place."  People lived in the same town, sometimes the same house, for those generations and to maintain their place in the community, among people one often admired, even loved, including family and friends, one had to tread lightly in order to hold onto those relationships and kinships held so dear.<br/><br/>As Scout judges her father, her uncle, even the man she thought she might marry, I grew increasingly frustrated and angry.  She was clear in voicing her view of their actions.  Disappointment and anger loosed her tongue on them.  But their responses were circuitous, round about, nebulous, never saying what they meant.  I blame this on the writer, not the characters.  Although, had they spoken more plainly, perhaps they would have been found out by their neighbors, or the book would have been shorter.<br/><br/>In the end, after all is said and done, the men in Scout's life were struggling to remain in the town and state they loved.  They struggled to come to terms with what was happening around them, events and attitudes over which they had absolutely no control.  Instead of fighting against those who held the power, they worked from within, trying to understand what was happening as it happened and lessen the impact of hate and brutality.  It was impossible for them to leave behind everything they valued and move away, even though they were surrounded by bigotry and violence.  Maybe they could make a difference from within rather than being on the outside and banging against the walls that would not give.  It was the only way they knew.<br/><br/>Watchman is an important novel, reaching back to clarify some of the life in Mockingbird, e.g., Calpurnia who took care of Scout and her brother when they were children.  It also depicts what life was like for decent folks who hate what their world was becoming, and being, in the minority, worked to somehow lessen the impact of bigotry and hate on themselves and their communities.<br/><br/>I am glad to have read Watchman.  Although it's not quite the work that Mockingbird is, it brings the lives forward and depicts what living in the South meant to many people who called the region home and couldn't imagine living anywhere else.
Readers were given 55 years to deify Atticus Finch. Over that period of time, he became a symbol of justice, goodness, and humanity. The name Atticus became shorthand for someone deserving unequivocal praise or respect, someone elevated above the rest of humankind. And then Harper Lee, yanked him off of his pedestal in 288 short pages.<br/><br/>And Atticus is a more realistic character because of it.<br/><br/>At the beginning of Go Set a Watchman Scout, now 26 years old but just as bullheaded and assertive as we left her in To Kill a Mockingbird, returns to the familiarity of Maycomb County. The undercurrent of menace that seemed to be creeping around every corner in Mockingbird is gone. The feeling this time is different. There is no Bob Ewell slinking around, hurling threats and acting like the clear-cut villain. There's no mysterious neighbor waiting for just the right time to reveal himself as the good guy. Instead of mystery and childlike ignorance, Watchman's events are colored with a certain world-weariness and disenchantment. The enemy (racial intolerance) hasn't left or even changed much, but the face of it has. It's not an in-your-face racial intolerance; it's more of an indifference to racial progressiveness that's taken hold and strangled any forward momentum that the cause might have had.<br/><br/>The book, while just as humorous and lyrical as Lee's original offering, is a different animal. Many of the same beats that she hit 55 years ago are present in Go Set a Watchman, which makes sense considering the close proximity within which both books were written. Nevertheless, the flashbacks to Jem and Scout's childhood have that vintage sense of innocent humor that never seems forced. While rough around the edges, Watchman is undeniably well-written, even if it does feel unfinished in certain regards.<br/><br/>Now, about that elephant in the room...<br/><br/>Atticus is a human being. He's arthritic, old, and, most shockingly, racist. If not a blatant white supremacist, Atticus, in a tense, cathartic discussion with Scout towards the end of the novel, reveals some rather antiquated viewpoints about black people. Nearly unrecognizable from the confident lawyer that defended Tom Robinson in one of the most famous scenes in all of literature, Atticus spouts out one demeaning or condescending comment after another. Needless to say, the result is shocking, akin to hearing the pope blaspheme.<br/><br/>But he's not the villain. He's just a man. A man Scout looked up to, idolized, and held up as the paragon of man. And slowly but surely, we get to witness his downfall, his descent from a god to a human. For Scout, it's a devastating revelation, and it cuts her to her very core. For the reader, it's the death, or maybe the transformation, of an icon. And maybe it's even more. Maybe it's a lesson that everyone has a little bit of darkness inside of them, but there's almost always more light than dark.
Harper Lee's wonderful early manuscript, now a book, "Go Set a Watchman" is about bigotry, where people with one point of view refuse to listen to those with an opposing point of view. Modernizing her conception of bigotry, we see this in the way conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats appear unable to listen to one another. Ironically, this same type of bigotry can be found in some amazon reviews.<br/><br/>My understanding of this book is projected based on my experience as an author of several books, and several unpublished manuscripts. Ms. Lee's "Go Set a Watchman," her first book manuscript, was rejected by publishers in the late 1950s. Ms. Lee was advised to make some changes, such as focusing on Scout's childhood experiences. Lee revised "Go Set a Watchman" accordingly. Some ideas and themes were kept, some edited out, and others added, resulting in the masterpiece "To Kill a Mockingbird." Writers do this all the time, particularly those seeking first time publication.<br/><br/>Yet what remained of the original "Go Set a Watchman" manuscript still had other wonderful story lines, such as the argument/discussion between the idealist Scout, now in her 20s and returning home from New York City, her father Atticus, a pragmatic southern lawyer, and her uncle Jack, a retired wise doctor. Chapter 17 is worth reading several times.<br/><br/>Is the book racist? History is racist, and this is an historical novel. Some characters are blind racists, some are strong anti-racist (Scout), and others struggle with their own racist sentiments and culture. Clearly, the novel ends with strong anti-racist sentiments.<br/><br/>I am sorry that Ms. Lee did not find the time to rewrite "Go Set a Watchman" as a sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird," and edit accordingly. Nonetheless, the manuscript/book taught me a lot about the southern perspective on states' rights versus human rights, the battle between a grown up child and parent whose consciences conflict.
I'm sure that by now, we've all heard the story of Go Set a Watchman.<br/>There was talk of a "sequel" to Harper Lee's beloved classic, To Kill a Mockingbird, and the word about town was that it was to be published (possibly) against Harper Lee's will. That her current caretaker was taking advantage of an older lady, and was causing her nothing but grief.<br/>Before the book was even published, there was an ongoing hum all across the literary world about this book, and the controversy it was destined to carry.<br/>Many of my friends told me they would not read it. No way, no how. They couldn't support a book that possibly could have been published under such questionable circumstances.<br/>Once the book started circulating around reviewers, readers became more turned off by talk of "Atticus Finch not being the man we all came to love." I won't specify exactly what the problem was, but fans were in an uproar about one of their favorite characters in literary history showing up in a different, and less lovable, light.<br/>Fast-forward a bit more to talk of Go Set a Watchman not being a sequel per se, but a rough copy and outline of what To Kill a Mockingbird was supposed to be. With the way it was skewered by its audience, if Go Set a Watchman was published back in the 1960s instead of To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee would possibly not be the icon she is today. Actually, who knows. Perhaps everyone's expectations were too high when they heard that a "To Kill a Mockingbird sequel was coming out!" Perhaps fans of the original story judged the book before they even got their hands on it. Perhaps too many people across the world were the ones that turned this story into a flop, not the author herself.<br/>But I digress...<br/>I battled with it myself for a while. Do I want to read this book, and possibly sully my opinion of Scout, Atticus, and Harper Lee? Do I want to read it and see what happens, just out of curiosity? Do I want to pretend it doesn't exist and hug my copy of To Kill a Mockingbird close to my chest, shut my eyes, and pretend that the world is beautiful place where no bad sequels exist?<br/>In the end, I figured that it was important I read the book, and form an honest, unbiased opinion of my own. I wasn't going to allow word through the grapevine to hinder my opinion of a book most folks haven't even bothered to read.<br/>I was going in.<br/>Now let's go back, 30 years later from where we last visited Scout...<br/>And that's as far as I'm going, folks. If you're curious about what happens in Go Set a Watchman, I implore you to actually read it. Why?<br/>Because. I. Loved. It.<br/>I fell so hard for this book, it completely made me change the way I view To Kill a Mockingbird, FOR THE BETTER. I can't guarantee that every reader will have the same marvelous reading experience that I had, but you most certainly will not know unless you try.<br/>I prepared myself for awful writing, a weak plot line, and for my beloved characters to turn into hideous, child-feasting monsters, but that didn't happen.<br/>What did happen? Harper Lee's characters came to life.<br/>No longer was Atticus Finch a man from the 1930s who was too good to be true. He has now become human.<br/>No longer was Scout a wide-eyed little girl, just learning about the cruelties of the world. She has now become a woman, wise and powerful beyond her years, and won't stand for anything unsavory.<br/>No longer was Maycomb County the County you knew when you first picked up To Kill a Mockingbird. Maycomb County is now an entity you would see through the eyes of a grown up Scout.<br/>Go Set a Watchman made To Kill a Mockingbird real. Go Set a Watchman is the other half of the story I didn't know I needed in my life until now. It packs such a powerful punch, I felt breathless when I finished the last page. Then cue wracking sobs that coursed through my body for the next two hours.<br/>I don't know what the critics of this book found when they opened it up...I don't know what readers read that turned them off so, but I'm glad I didn't have that experience. I'm glad I was able to go into this book with an open heart, and an open mind, and take something beautiful and meaningful from it. (And in my opinion, some of the negatives that were taken from this book wouldn't have been negatives at all if the critics actually finished the book.)<br/>In my opinion, this book was cursed from the very beginning. It didn't have a chance.<br/>As I said, not everyone will have this experience. You may read this review, pick up the book, and curse me for misleading you. (There's honestly nothing I can do about that!) But this is what I took from Go Set a Watchman, and I regret nothing. Absolutely nothing.<br/>Go Set a Watchman was everything I could have wanted (and much, much more) in a "sequel," "rough draft," or whatever you want to call it. I am fully aware that I am currently, and possibly will forever be, in the small percentage of people who actually like or even love this book, and I've come to terms with it. It's not the first time one of my favorite books has been raked over the coals.<br/>This book left an impression on my soul, and I will hold it close to my heart wherever I go.<br/><br/>So, readers, I implore you. Please read a book before you carve your opinion of it in stone. No good will ever come of that. If I had listened to all of the negative gossip and reviews of this book, I never would have had the extraordinary reading experience I just had. So please, think before you read.
This is a review of GO SET A WATCHMAN: A NOVEL by Harper Lee.  Mine is the CD edition read by Reese Witherspoon produced by Harperaudio in 2015.  The set consists of six CDs which run for seven hours.  Reese Witherspoon does a great job reading a text which is, at times, very complex and highly nuanced.  Her performance contributes a lot to this work.<br/><br/>Harper Lee was a young woman during the mid 1950s when she wrote this book and that was its appeal to me.  Lee grew up in a small town in Alabama and her book opens a door on what it was like as the great civil rights movements of the next decade began to take shape.  She's great at describing details and recreating the details of what it was like in during those years.<br/><br/>Her protagonist, "Scout,"  a young woman much like Harper Lee I suspect, returns to home to her family from New York City.  She's educated, insightful, and outspoken, and she idolizes her father,  Atticus Finch, a local attorney.  She recalls how her father had the courage to represent a young black man charged with raping a white girl.  Finch not only got his client off (because he had only one arm, hence lacked the capability to use the degree of force needed) but avoided being lynched himself.<br/><br/>"Scout" idolizes him until she sneaks into a Ku Klux Klan meeting where he, and most of the men in town, are listening to a racist rant from a visiting Klansman.  The spectacle of her beloved father sitting passively among a bunch of Klansmen devoted to stopping racial integration at any cost turns her world upside down.  I suspect it had that impact on a lot of people.<br/><br/>Scout finally learns something that would have been obvious to Southerners in the 1950s.  You can be a racist and support separation of the races without hating black people.  Atticus, like a lot of people educated to believe in "scientific racism," concluded that blacks, as a race, were inferior and needed help from whites.  This was the "white man's burden" of Kipling's time and Atticus shouldered it with the best of intentions.  That's why he'd defended the hapless black youth accused of rape.  That's why he was decent to black people.  He wasn't a bully or a thug.<br/>Scout finally saw her father as a man of his time and that's the value of this book.<br/><br/>It shows a dimension of the Old South that "Mississippi Burning" and the rising tide of the civil rights movements of the 1960s all but swept away.<br/>This is a complicated, subtle plot, and it will be difficult for younger listeners raised in an age of Political Correctness to comprehend, but it's worth the effort.  If you're interested in the South,  Civil rights, or the fifties you'll learn a lot from GO SET A WATCHMAN.<br/><br/>I did, and that's why I gave it five stars.
I really hated to see this book come out with all the hyper and noise.  It made me really scared to read the book.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a first book for Lee, and all like all new authors, she is finding her voice.  The beginning is pretty rocky, but she finds more assurance as she goes along.  Ignore what you have heard, read the book with understanding it was a first book, also keep in mind today's politically correct mindset, was different then.  A good measure of how we have grown and attitudes have (hopefully) changed.  Just read it for yourself.<br/><br/>***** Be warned *****  my view of Go Set A Watchman contains SPOILERS, but I couldn’t see how to express my thoughts without touching on a few points (many already discussed in the countless reviews before the book hit the shelves).<br/><br/>I finished Go Set a Watchman this morning and have so many thoughts about the novel.  For one, I think the media flap over Atticus being less than a paragon was hardly more than the publisher sending out PR stories to up their sales.  At some point they took a look and saw presales were not hitting the big money mark that they had greedily anticipated, so they set out to create a mountain out of a molehill; with the help of a few reviews of outrage, they fueled the sensationalism-hungry media and social networks, the pursuing flap drove everyone out to buy it to see for themselves.  Well, perhaps there is a lesson there – never truly judge a book by its cover – or rather, we need to pay smaller heed to the fray and just read it for yourself.  You might be surprised.  I was.<br/><br/>I went in to buying the book feeling concern for Harper Lee.  Had she been taken advantage of?  Did she even pen the book?  Some of the circumstances of the “finding” of the novel have been called into question by various sources.  This came on the heels of Lee having to sue to get her rights for To Kill A Mockingbird back from the nephew of her former agent, that she had been duped into signing them away, even an investigation into concerns of abuse of the beloved author, who had trouble seeing and hearing and no champion to protect her.  It was a murky whirlpool of speculation that saw the book making it into print.  I know one thing without a doubt –– Go Set A Watchman was penned by Harper Lee.  The book is hers.  Unpolished in places and dealing with a period of growth for the nation, it wasn’t a pretty picture she painted, but it was an honest one from her stand point and typical for the era.  But beneath the shaky start to the book, you hear Lee’s beautiful prose ringing clear, especially when you go through the flashbacks of Jem, Dill and Atticus.<br/><br/>There is a tendency to see this book as a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird.  It begins with a grown up Jean-Louise Finch returning home for her annual visit to Maycomb, Mississippi.  Atticus is now aging, nearly eighty-years-old, and fighting to retain his pride though crippled with rheumatoid arthritis.  He needs Jean-Louise home, but is too proud to ask her.  Instead, his sister (which we met in To Kill A Mockingbird) is there to help him through his everyday life.  Jem is gone, lost to a sudden heart attack – the same thing that had claimed their mother when Jean-Louise was too young to recall.  You have a sense throughout the whole story that Scout hasn’t truly grieved over the loss of her hero brother, hasn’t been able to let him go.  It gives you a sense that he is still alive for her, as long as she keeps him locked in the cocoon of childhood memories.  Dill is spoken of, but never plays a role in the book outside of flashbacks.  You sense a detachment from her beloved childhood friend, which mirrors Harper Lee’s own estrangement from Truman Capote (the model for Charles Baker Harris).  And beloved Calpurnia, who served as mother to Jean-Louise, is now retired.  Their reunion is bittersweet and tears at the heart.  Other characters from To Kill A Mockingbird are scattered about, lending an instant familiarity, but their roles are changed in various ways.  Walter Cunningham, who got her in trouble with that “dumb lady teacher”, is no longer that poor little boy who pours molasses all over his plate, the son of the man who works off his entailment by bringing nuts to the Finch house early in the morn –– the only form of payment he can afford.  Instead, Walter owns the Maycomb ice cream parlor, built on the land where Scout’s old home once stood.<br/><br/>In the first few chapters you hear a young writer struggling to find her voice.  The first three have a flat, detached feel to them, almost another voice, almost like Lee was trying to sound like an author rather than be one.  The harder she tried the farther she got away from her own natural magic.  Other times, she’s dead on target and straight from her heart.  As the book progresses you are treated to remembrances of Jem, Dill and Atticus.  Oddly enough, there is no mention of Boo Radley.  There is a mention of a trial, an echo of Tom Robinson’s, but this young black man, accused of rape by a white woman, lost his arm to the sawmill instead of the cotton gin, and this time Atticus saw him acquitted.  Seeds planted that would come full force and be the center of Atticus’ great journey in To Kill a Mockingbird.  All these changes see Watchman a sequel, and yet not truly a sequel.<br/><br/>You quickly sense there are two voices struggling within the character – Jean-Louise in the present, but also Scout who never truly went away.  She has moved to New York, tried to be worldlier.  Instead, she just put a veneer over the shy, tomboy that never quite fit in.  It’s that duality of the book, which took a few chapters for Harper Lee to master.  Through the unfolding of the story, we learn Jean-Louise is really just Scout in an adult’s skin.  It’s the battle between who she thinks she is, and who she truly is that causes most of her misery.  She still sees the town and Atticus through Scout’s eyes.  Following Scout’s recollections as she grew we learn, while horribly bright and encouraged to read about everything, she is quite backward about life in general –– terrified she is dying when her first period comes, which evolved later into nearly nine months of wretchedness after she mistakenly thinks she’s pregnant from French kissing Walter Cunningham.  Currently, she loves Henry, the boy next door, but she’s not in love with him.  In many ways the young man, best friend to Jem, has stepped into Jem’s shoes for Atticus.  What to do?  She hates the town she grew up in with a passion, yet loves it and wants to cling to the past with equal measure.  She’s horrified Atticus could have ever attended a KKK meeting, but in Jean-Louise’s simplified view of life, there are no grays.  It never occurs to her Atticus was a man who moved through Maycomb, handled legal matters, dealt with judges, lawyers, politicians and businessmen, and it was vital for him to know which ones hid behind a mask.  Scotland has a saying, you hold your friends close, and your enemies closer.  Atticus was merely following that sage adage.  However, Jean-Louise cannot see beyond the surface, only that Atticus had done something that went against everything she believed he was.<br/><br/>As we grow our perceptions of the world changes.  We learn, accept, reject and are changed by the various trials and tribulations.  Jean-Louise didn’t change.  She was still Scout inside, still clinging to her childish views of life, her hometown and the people she loved.  Much like Lee herself.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is a worthy companion to the later To Kill a Mockingbird.  It’s different in many ways.  It’s a first book of an author, and showcases the shining talent of that writer finding her way, of becoming a wordsmith that would go on to turn out a masterpiece.  I think it’s an example, showing any author how to take their novel and go back and do second, third or fourth drafts to take a good story and make it something special.  Some of the writing, where Jean-Louise is examining the views on race relations of the period, Lee wanders between a Joan of Arc mentality to mounting a very preachy soapbox.  Much can and will likely be made of her simplistic views of the period, of good and evil, of the town’s resistance to the coming end to segregation.  For those too young to recall the ugly face of history, you will probably judge the book harsher than those of you who lived through the upheavals and changes and understand the complexities first hand.<br/><br/>Frankly, I was scared to read the book after all the hoopla in the media.  I so loved To Kill a Mockingbird that I feared this book would destroy that love somehow.  She says Maycomb had once been told it had nothing to fear but fear itself.  I supposed I should have recalled that line.  In the end, I laughed, I cried, and I was sad when the book ended.  And extremely sad such a wonderful, wonderful writer never penned more books for the world to enjoy.  I loved this book almost as much as I do To Kill A Mockingbird.  Harper Lee has said she is Boo.  The summer we started so long ago has ended and Boo has finally come out.  When considering this book one needs to recall what Lee wrote about Atticus saying never judge someone until you’ve climbed into his shoes and walked around in them.  That is good advice about reading Go Set a Watchman.
Scout Finch is  back, some 20 years after the events of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, but if you're expecting a sequel, this isn't it.  The book does a brilliant job of illustrating how children often place their parents on a pedestal, which they cannot possibly hope to live up to.  The entire message of the novel (as referenced by another reviewer) can be summed up by the following passage:<br/><br/>“As you grew up, when you were grown, totally unknown to yourself, you confused your father with God. You never saw him as a man with a man’s heart, and a man’s failings—I’ll grant you it may have been hard to see, he makes so few mistakes, but he makes ‘em like all of us. You were an emotional cripple, leaning on him, getting the answers from him, assuming that your answers would always be his answers.”<br/><br/>Considerably darker than TKAM, this is not a novel designed for children, and it graphically reveals thoughts and prejudices of the time, the message of which is as pertinent today as it was back when it was originally written.<br/><br/>It isn't TKAM, but it stands alone on it's own merit.  I appreciated the frequent flashbacks to Scout's childhood (some of which are identical passages to those found in TKAM), and those unique to GSAW stand alone on their own merit, with the same "flavor" as those Ms. Lee  penned in TKAM.  I like it, and as others have mentioned, it really enhanced my appreciation of the strong character development in TKAM.  GO SET A WATCHMAN adds to the depth of character as we are led to recognize that--like Scout--we can't hold on to those memories of the past through the rose colored glasses of childhood.  Reality comes to the fore eventually, and we all must accept that our parents aren't perfect, but realizing how "human" they are ultimately draws us closer to them.
Go Set a Watchman is the recently published sequel to the timeless, Southern classic To Kill a Mockingbird. Jean Louise Finch (Scout) is returning home to Maycomb for a visit. Jean Louise lives the single woman lifestyle in NYC which is viewed with admiration or consternation by the citizens of her hometown. No one is more frustrated with Jean Louise than her Aunt Zandra, the pinnacle of Southern manners and womanhood. Even though Jean Louise is a grown woman, the two are always exchanging verbal insults. Atticus Finch although physically frailer still has a sharp mind.<br/>Jean Louise views Maycomb with a mixture of gratitude, pride, and relief. Gratitude and pride for her upbringing as a Finch and a carefree childhood, yet relief that she doesn't live permanently in Maycomb and succumb to the small town's stifling expectations and unwritten rules.<br/>Her peaceful visit is ruined one muggy Sunday when she discovers that her father and almost-fiancee, Henry Clinton, are participants of the Maycomb Citizens' Council (the Klan). This council, made up of the county's most respectable and influential men, is also a racist organization that is dead set against forced segregation by the government and views the NAACP with disdain. In that moment Jean Louise's world crumbles: her father, the hero, the teacher of all things moral, has been ruined in her eyes...<br/><br/>My Facebook feed and email inbox was flooded with reviews for Go Set a Watchman in mid-July. I purposely did not read any reviews because I did not want my experience reading this book to be influenced by others. I enjoyed the book for the most part- the flashbacks were funny and enjoyable. But once Jean Louise discovers the council the book goes downhill from there. For the last fourth of the book Jean Louise is angry and shows it in very dramatic ways and I felt that Harper Lee let that drag on too long and then apologies were done lickety-split and the book was over. I don't think this will become a classic like To Kill a Mockingbird but it will be debated about for years to come.<br/><br/>***You can read more of my reviews at www.thesouthernbookworm.blogspot.com
Here's how to like this book:<br/><br/>1. Go into it reading it for what it is, which is not To Kill A Mockingbird. What it IS is a charming book that's somewhat chick-lit with a smattering of civil rights stuff meets the south c. 1966, with a theme centered on seeing one's hero as human for the first time.<br/><br/>2. Consider that this book is written the voice of a female writer and female protagonist - okay, same thing for TKAM, but I am of the opinion that Truman Capote (who was the real-life "Dill" in TKAM and Harper Lee's longtime dear friend) wrote TKAM and put Harper Lee's name on it. If you question this, read this book and also watch Breakfast at Tiffany's and lets talk about Truman Capote's characters and how they compare to those in TKAM.<br/><br/>3. Understand that this is a young woman's attempt at her desire to write a novel. It reads like a first draft/first novel of a wanna-be writer, though is better than pedestrian: the Scout-Henry relationship is charming, the nostalgia of dressing properly to even leave one's home is charming, the polite dialog (until Scout pops a breaker in the last chapter or two) is charming, and there are cute scenes such as a flashback to a high school dance she attends wearing falsies to give herself a bust in her new dress and a ladies luncheon her aunt organizes that showcases some cute stereotypical southern women, especially of the era.<br/><br/>4. Know that (probably because Harper Lee may not have written TKAM) the characters in Jean Louise's Maycombe world are not the same characters in this novel. Jem is dead now, there is only one mention of Dill and it's a brief memory, Calpurnia is old and has just a slight presence here, There's a new uncle that's almost too much like Atticus - who is not the Gregory Peck character we all loved and for whom the onlookers at the trial in the film all stood as he walked by. Henry is a new character who's been part of Jean Louise's life since childhood, and the aunt who is in the novel TKAM is back again in this book, nagging at Jean Louise as she deals with the frustration of trying to make the young woman be more the southern lady a Finch female should be.<br/><br/>Pick it up and read it as just a book you discovered, and go in without expectation. It's a charming, entertaining read, though gets a bit too philosophical, didactic, and magic-mentor-revelation-esque in the last two-three chapters.
Do you know what a devil’s advocate is? If you don’t, here it is: One who argues against a cause or position, not as a committed opponent but simply for the sake of argument or to determine the validity of the cause or position.<br/><br/>That’s what I think Harper Lee’s “Go Set a Watchman” was, a devil’s advocate written to add some reality to the complexity of racism in the United States that has become too much of a black and white issue when in reality there are many shades of color at work.<br/><br/>When the sequel of “To Kill A Mockingbird” came out, the first thing I read was one or more of the politically correct mobs lashing out when they condemned the book because of an early scene in the novel that depicts Atticus Finch as a racist, but I didn’t let that stop me from buying an audio version of the book on six CDs at Costco, and I’m glad I did because the story in this novel offers a brutal reminder that hot-button issues like abortion, school reform and racism can’t be dealt with in a 14-second politically correct sound bite by one side or the other. Reality is more complex than simple and often ignorant thinking.<br/><br/>After listening to the novel, Atticus Finch turns out to be a complex individual and I don’t think he was the kind of racist that fits the stereotype that so many love to hate. He didn’t belong to the KKK. He was not a white supremacist. In fact, Atticus didn’t’ even own one of those white cloaks with hoods that have holes cut out for the eyes and mouth.<br/><br/>Instead, before the end of the novel, we learn that Atticus might believe in separate but equal, but he would also be the first one to put his body between a fire-breathing racist lynch mob and an African American the mob wants to hang from the nearest tree, because it’s obvious Atticus still believes in justice and equality for every person but maybe not everyone’s definition for what that means. Right or wrong, I don’t think Atticus deserves to be condemned. Reserve that anger for those who bomb black churches, murder minorities for just having a different shade of skin and/or block the right of minorities to vote.<br/><br/>I taught “To Kill a Mockingbird” in high school, and I’ve seen the film a number of times, so I was ready to read about the characters who were 20+ years older, and I was not disappointed. The audio book is read by Reese Witherspoon, and Jean Louise Finch—Scout—reminds us that she was a child once when she takes readers on journeys back in time to when she was a child and then an adolescent becoming a young woman. I think Witherspoon’s voice is exactly what we would want Scout to sound like as a young woman in her twenties.<br/><br/>Instead of jumping blindly on the politically correct bandwagon that defines what racism is, read this book and do what it was designed for: weigh all the factors and think for yourself. Then judge individuals like Atticus on an individual basis and not a blanket indictment written by an often angry and mindless mob.
** spoiler alert ** I have to admit I wasn't as crazy about this book as I was To Kill a Mockingbird, mostly because the Scout in this story is far too naive for her age. Though that's really part of the story isn't it? A young woman grows up and realizes the world is harsh and the people she loves are flawed just like everyone else. Yes, Atticus Finch was a racist. Why was everyone so surprised by this? Remember that in the first book, we were seeing him through the eyes of his daughter who looked up to him. He was perfect and noble and righteous because Scout saw him that way. Now we view him through Scout's adult eyes - and he's not so perfect anymore. Still a good book, though the random third to first person shifts were mildly annoying, and I wanted to smack Jean Louise for being so naive. Also, did anyone else notice that this wasn't just a story with an undercurrent of racism - but also blatant sexism? Jean Louise may not be a racist, but she's definitely not doing herself any favors by submitting to the gender role she once fought. More than once Jean Louise was like, "I don't involve myself in the affairs of men..." The subtext being, "Because I'm just a stupid woman."<br/><br/>So I think part of the book was that the reader wasn't supposed to particularly like Jean Louise either, because in this book she is flawed by being the stupid, helpless "girl". A far cry from how the reader saw Scout as a child - a tomboy who refused to conform and grow up to be the naive, stupid girl. So I love the contrast where everyone turned out to be the opposite.<br/><br/>Let's recap:<br/><br/>Atticus Finch:<br/>To Kill a Mockingbird - Advocate against racism<br/>Go Set a Watchman - A racist<br/><br/>Jem Finch:<br/><br/>TKAM - Alive<br/>GSAW - Dead<br/><br/>Jean Louise:<br/>TKAM - Tomboy, no manners, will not grow up wearing dresses or doing men's bidding.<br/>GSAW - Wears dresses, doesn't concern herself with the affairs of men because it's not a woman's place, does men's bidding, and submits to a beat down by her uncle.<br/><br/>Uncle Dr. Finch:<br/>TKAM - The fun uncle Scout and Jem love.<br/>GSAW - A woman beater. Yeah, I know he only hit Scout once, but seriously -- when is physical violence against a woman EVER okay? Even if she's acting like a twit? This wasn't a man smacking a child's rear end due to bad behavior. This was a grown man smacking a grown woman across the face because she was upset about her father and fiancé revealing their racism.<br/><br/>Calpurnia<br/>TKAM - A loving mother figure.<br/>GSAW - A bitter old woman who has given up and decides white people aren't worth it (and can you blame her?).<br/><br/>While it still wasn't as good as To Kill a Mockingbird (because we all prefer happy stories instead of stories where we learn everyone is a dumb jerk), it was still a good book for precisely that reason -- because it shows the nitty gritty of the human condition. And quite frankly - humans suck. Harper Lee captured that perfectly.
With all the controversies surrounding the publication of this novel aside, I admit that I began reading with some trepidation and skepticism – given the negative press at the time of release. However, I have walked away feeling as though I have bumped into an old friend that I hadn't missed, but was equally happy to see.<br/>Rather than classifying it as a sequel (which it can't be, because it was never meant to be as such) I see this novel as a companion. The slightly boring relation with familial traits.<br/>Had it been published prior to Mockingbird, this work would have been a mundane set of events and recollections about growing up, with little to no significance rather than what it is: A historical companion to an iconic piece of literary genius.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is particularly fascinating for the fact that Scout grows up and sees the world through adult eyes now. The novel is essentially about realisation. The realisation that her (Scout's) father is not perfect – a common happenstance that comes with growing up (for some of us).<br/><br/>After all the years I invested in reading the story of Scout, Atticus, Jem, Calpurnia in Mockingbird, I am not sad to have read Watchman. In Watchman, many of the characters have been enriched by Harper Lee and I with them.<br/><br/>I found some negatives: There were a few repetitions of some anecdotal accounts; and the anecdotes were not as cursive as Mockingbird; chronology felt somewhat stilted; there were a few issues with phrasing; the tempo was slow in places, but picked up at the end (the best section to my mind are the last 30–40 pages); and it lacked profundity regarding certain areas where I thought there should have been more emotional input invested, considering who the subject at hand was, (I won't say, just in case you wish to read the novel).<br/><br/>However, on the positive side: Let's not forget that this novel was published as it was left 60 years ago, without any revision or edits by Harper Lee, at her insistence, apparently. And then if we consider that it is the first draft of her first work, I have to admit that I am impressed.<br/><br/>In many ways, it made me think on a deeper level about Mockingbird and how it arrived to be the novel I have read so many times. I enjoyed the realistic shift from, the idyllic world of childhood, to the reality of adulthood.<br/><br/>I did come across a few nice sections of prose which I would like to share:<br/><br/>“I guess it’s like an airplane: they’re the drag and we’re the thrust, together we make the thing fly. Too much of us and we’re nose-heavy, too much of them and we’re tail-heavy—it’s a matter of balance.”<br/><br/>“I am their blood and bones, I have dug in this ground, this is my home. But I am not their blood, the ground doesn’t care who digs it, I am a stranger at a cocktail party.”<br/><br/>“You said, in effect, ‘I don’t like the way these people do, so I have no time for them.’ You’d better take time for ’em, honey, otherwise you’ll never grow.”<br/><br/>This is a good read but not a great one.<br/>The fact is that you don't need to read this book. But if you do, it means you've grown up along with Scout and the memorable characters that Harper Lee has created. You just need to ask yourself: Do I want (or need) to grow up?<br/><br/>Question: Has it changed Mocking bird for me... forever?<br/>Answer: Amazingly, NO. It changes nothing because Mockingbird is...well, simply Mockingbird.<br/>Nostalgia had me edging on 4 out of 5 Stars, but there were too many little niggles, so 3 Stars it is.<br/>However, 3 stars is really not that bad for something that wasn't meant to be read, and sat gathering dust for nearly 60 years.<br/>Sergiu Pobereznic (author)
"WATCHMAN" DO?  IT DOESN'T READ LIKE THE SAME SOUL AND SPIRIT; IT DOESN'T READ LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN A "DRAFT" THAT A WRITER WAS TOYING WITH IDEAS.  AND, IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT HARPER LEE EVER GAVE PERMISSION FOR THIS "BOOK DRAFT" TO BE PUBLISHED.  THERE IS NO WAY TO CLEAN UP OR CLEAR UP THIS MESS.  THERE SHOULD BE "LAWSUITS" TO COME AND SOME OF THE FANS of LEE & "MOCKINGBIRD" WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.  "IT JUST ISN'T FAIR" SOMEONE WROTE; "IT JUST ISN'T FAIR TO FANS TO BREAK THEIR HEARTS BY STOMPING ON THEIR HOPE AND JOY.  WE ARE IN A NEW COURSE TOWARD A NEW REALITY.  WE WERE HOPING THAT A NEW SKILLED-WRITTEN VERSION OF SOMETHING CLASSIC AND AMERICAN WAS FORTHCOMING FROM THE SOUL OF OUR BELOVED HARPER LEE WHO IS 89 NOW AND NOT ABLE TO SAY MUCH ABOUT THIS; HER SISTER IS DEAD; THIS DRAFT WAS PUBLISH SOON AFTER HER DEATH...SO UNSCRUPULOUS IT IS.  I AM SO SAD OVER THIS ICONIC WAYFARING.  JUST TRULY DISGUSTED."  I  share kinship feelings with this poster.<br/>  Here we are again like Jesus...betrayed for a few pieces of silver.  I dare they mar Harper's career and standing.  Can we get by this?  I know I want a refund?  And while I'm on the subject...my mind has made a connection: I/m still suffering from ICONIC-FESTURING fever.  Really...truly...my mind came to rest from its downtrodden spiral to a place marked in me called:  "Dr. Huxatable".  That's right.  In the world of our dreams, emotions and feelings...in the divine, our icons are like: Atticus Finch, Scout and Jem, as well as:  Miss C, the housekeeper.  Atticus' world worked right because she was there and Scout felt her loving care.  ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN MURDERED, SLAUGHTERED, DAMAGED and may never be restored for some people.  Maybe when they watch the movie they have in their library they will get over this fervor and loss.  But it is definite a loss and it is definitely a lot of damage.  CAN IT KILL GREGORY PECK'S performance of "Atticus Finch"--I hope not but our minds will have to work hard to get over "WATCHMEN"...the book draft that was published by what feels like shisters.  We adore Gregory Peck for "Atticus" and we just adored Bill Cosby for "Cliff Huxtable".....even as adults we want to cry over this destruction.  But "realists" will scream at us:  "THOSE ARE CHARACTERS, THOSE ARE CHARACTERS....THEY ARE NOT REAL...THEY ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE....DON'T YOU GET IT?"  Yes.  We get it.  These characters inspired us; left our hearts warm and polished our times coming up.  We loved them.  We adored them.  We loved the way they made us feel much like Santa Claus and the bunny at Easter.  These characters change our anatomy when we think of them, we feel them in ways we love to feel.  AND SOME JERKS GO AND PUBLISH "WATCHMAN" TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT MADE BY THE FANS AND PURCHASERS OF "WATCHMEN" THINKING THEY WERE GOING TO GET ANOTHER SAVORING PRECIOUS ICONIC MOMENT.  INSTEAD THEY ARE MADE ILL BY THIS WHOLE DARN FARCE.<br/>  REVIEW:  I had a hard time while listening to the audiobook version and I had a devastating response over the four engaging days.  I had to stop each time and go do something to try and relieve of the dread.  That last disc had me wanting to go get stuff to do a binge.  But I fought off that urge and finished the audiobook and went to WIKIPEDIA to see if they had information about this product.  And they have a very nice article of information telling you all about this farce and depletion of an icon. [IT WAS A DRAFT, NOT A BOOK.  WRITERS WRITE ALL KIND OF STUFF, IDEAS, VISIONS, QUESTION--HYPOTHESIS--BUT THESE DRAFTS ARE NOT MEANT FOR PUBLICATION.  IT'S LIKE THESE TWO BOOKS COULD HAVE COME TOGETHER BUT "WATCHMAN" NEEDED TO BE EDITED TO FIT "ATTICUS'" iconic status and place in American literature.  What a shame!!!]  HARPER LEE's protector is gone and the vultures came in to pick her carcass while she is still alive.  I hope nobody tells Harper what has happened.<br/> "MOCKINGBIRD" DID FEEL LIKE HEALING TO A LOT OF "AMERICANS" BUT WHAT WILL "WATCHMAN" FEEL LIKE AND DO FOUR OUR BASIC SENTIMENTALITIES?  --MO
This is a very difficult review to write for me.  Although I gave the book 4 stars the book itself was tangled and really needed some fine editing.  The book was a wonderful start at a novel, but it fell short on being a complete.  Of course there is no way to not compare it to Mockingbird because some of the characters are the same, just at different points in life.  Certainly I see the spark of greatness in those chapters that flashed back on the narrator's childhood and I can see why it was suggested to delve more into that portion of the narrator's story.<br/><br/>The book as it is struggles to include its characters.  They are just shadows that come in and fade out of the story while we contend with the shock and dissolution of the author/narrator.The main focus is what is going on in the narrator's mind and how she is struggling to grasp her new reality and her old idolatry.  On many levels the narrator is not grown woman at least not by today's standards.  Of course we are supposed to be viewing a woman of the 50's, but a forward thinking woman of the 50's.  It works if one believes that even though Atticus is not color blind he has raised a color blind daughter.<br/><br/>Much of the literary references and specific political conversations should have been removed.  What got lost in the argument for or against 'states rights" would have been better spent allowing Scout and her Father to find some common ground.  I would have hoped that since she did not run back to New York that part of the story would have been developed, if the novel had been better edited instead of dropped.<br/>I think this novel could have been great if the author had developed it earlier instead of waiting until she was 89 years old.
I didn't know what to expect when I started reading Go Set A Watchman.  I didn't want to set my expectation so high, based on my love of To Kill A Mockingbird, that I couldn't enjoy the book for what it is/was.  I enjoyed the story because it revisited Mockingbird and drew out the character of the community from Scout's perspective as a child and because it reflected the attitudes of most of the people in the south at a time and place of uncertainty.  Being a southerner I understood Harper Lee's perspective perhaps more than a person who had not been exposed to the southern way of life during the 50's.  While Scout and Atticus agreed that blacks were not equal to whites intellectually, their attitude reflected that of many whites at that time, southern or not.  What I took from the book was this:  Atticus believed deep in his heart that all people were created equal and should be treated completely equal, period!  Harper Lee's perspective on the war between the states reflected the heart and soul of the south and the pride that southerners feel to this day from the sacrifices made by the poor and hungry men who fought the union when it  had depleted the south of it's ability to sustain itself financially. Ms. Lee states that at the time of the war only 5% of plantation owners owned slaves, that the majority of slaves had already been freed, thus,  suggesting that the war was more about the economy that the issue of owning slaves. Overall I enjoyed the book and would recommend it.  Every person will have a different point of view but it seems like I attached to the issues that she addressed that correspond to the current events at the time of the book's release.  Ms. Lee's ability to tell a story remains second to none.
Interesting use of well known well loved characters. It treads similar ground of Mockingbird without Scouts child eyes that are now matured. Maybe the former is what made Mockingbird such a grand experience.
The worst. I threw it out.... In the trash
wonderful story , just like the first one!
Interesting novel but quite controversial.
Finally- a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird
Hard to get into. Not as good a her first.
Excellent read and very thought provoking.
Worth the read but Mockingbird was better.
wordy...preachy....poor character building
Eye opener on life & culture at that time.
There is a conversation or 2 in this book!
I am rendered speechless. Simply Amazing! Harper Lee has a way with words and it was a pure pleasure reading this novel.
This was the novel that Harper Lee wrote before To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the latter is a more polished work this one gives the reader some insight into the racial climate of the south in the 1950's.
There was an awful lot of ballyhoo about it being racist. I did not find that. Just a perspective by the author that reflected on the times, it is almost historical in nature viewing society as it was then
This book is not about anyone's racism. It's all about the gifts and goofs we get from our parents. Loved it for that!
This is an excellent book in it's own right. I would not compare it to To Kill a Mockingbird. Although I think you should read To Kill a Mockingbird first to understand the development of the characters.
It was good, but it didn't hold my interest like "her "To Kill a Mockingbird."  I think I was expecting more than the book gave.  I will listen to it again and see if I really missed anything
Not a recap of "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Definitely an adult view of racism and family dynamics.  It provoked many emotions and added a rounding out of the characters.  Read it with an open mind.
Masterful storytelling. As climactic as To<br/>Kill a Mockingbird but in a much more personal way about Jean Louise. The manner in which the two novels interweave is brilliant. I would highly recommend.
Amazing! Go read it now!
Not what I expected, but so much more. I am a little bummed at no mention of Boo, but a wonderful book none-the-less!
Heard bad things, but it was a good read.
A disappointment compared to Mockingbird!
book gives the reader a lot to talk about
not what I expected but it was an OK read
Overall, a very good book. A bit cerebral
Can't believe that Harper Lee wrote this.
Good writing.  Lame plot.  No conclusion.
Very slow reading not worth all the hype!
Very slow start.  Just got to keep going.
EARLY WORK WITH A STYLE NOT YET DEVELOPED
Not as good as I expected from Harper Lee
Among the best novels I've read recently.
IMHO maybe it should not have been found!
I found this book to be a witty and deep study on growing up.  It touches on hero worship, bigotry, ignorance, tolerance, intolerance, life in a small southern town.  A lost treasure found and enjoyed!
Some of the terms and references that the author used may have been more common when the book was written. Just a little difficult to understand some of her terminology. Nice follow up to the original.
To Kill a Mockingbird was one of my favorite novels.  This was not.  I guess I understand her reasoning for writing this story but without giving anything away, I'd have been better off not reading it.
I found this book engaging although it lacks the depth and breath of "To Kill a Mockingbird". After this earlier book was expecting more but I found the plot development rather limited and narrow and character development very wanting. As an African, the manner in which the issue of race relations in the US is dealt with in this novel left me cold and empty inside. I am not sure of the author's position on the matter but she seems to justify the anti-Black stigma with a narrow-minded and shallow approach to what is a complex and convoluted issue. No book ending has left me as much disturbed as this one. Looking on as an outsider I am hardly surprised at the exploding racial tensions in the US at the moment which is sad given the fact that the US touts itself as the paragon of human rights and democracy. Cry the Beloved Country. The encouraging ray of hope is that President Obama has sought to confront the issue of race with candor and honesty - God Bless him!
Hard to put into words the emotional journey this book takes you on.  Classic Harper Lee, you finish a little wiser.
Having lived in the south and north, I think Ms. Lee has illuminated with dialogue between her characters the truth behind our prejudice. At that time Mockingbird was her choice. Watchman reveals why.
Knowing this was actually Lee's first attempt at a novel, it is a solid effort, but not the home run of To Kill a Mockingbird. You can see how she improved her writing and characters from boo to book.
I enjoyed how the characters evolved and the relationships.  We read for book club and had several people who not like the way Atticus was portrayed, but I think the ending resolved that issue for me.
Great book!  Recommend everyone read it.
Just OK, nice writing style but sloooow.
Of course not To Kill a Mockingbird, but overall it was a good read. Almost scary how some of Atticus musings about the government back then can so appropriately parallel what is happening today.
So current in my life. Where to be? What to tolerate? When to open your mouth? Wonderful and soul searching. It is a call to arms for southern women who know better - to speak up. Thanks Ms. Lee.
I loved this book.  It was a perfect follow-up to the great "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Although it has been reported that it was written before Mockingbird, but it was perfect for a sequel.  Those with the negative ratings sure haven't read the same book that I did.  The book does not leave the same feelings others have of Atticus, that I have after reading this classic.
i was very disapointed.
Worst book I ever read.
Not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird, but, then again, few books are. It's an enjoyable read, and worth the time I put into it. I sure had a different view of Atticus when I finished it, though.
I don't know if it's because I compare this to "To Kill A Mockingbird" or it's just not a good book.  But I am very disappointed with it.  The media build-up may also have played a part.
First draft, with sparks of brilliance. Lay off Atticus. He was a man of his time and place. Scout was a whiner.
An unpolished manuscript with a delightful sprinkling of brilliance. Insightful portrayal of life in the South and further facets of the characters of Scout, Atticus and Dr. Finch. A good read!
Way too much time spent on her father's and boyfriend's participation in the town "committee". Scout seems too immature and childish. Her pouting is tiresome. Not much else to the story
Learning who we are in this world is a constant challenge for all of us. Set in the heart of a southern culture with all it's conflict, Harper Lee does a masterful job of defining emancipation.
I was extremely disappointed with this book. Not sure what I expected but it went no where at first and then took an unexpected turn and a whole bunch of rhetoric at the end.  A waste of time.
A reminder that To Kill A Mockingbird was about a child's viewpoint on things.  The young adult grappling with racial issues, and family, are quite different, and not necessarily predictable.
A satisfying, and somewhat surprising companion to To Kill A Mockingbird.  It is a good read and an honest presentation of the struggles associated with culture and becoming one's own person.
This is actually her first book written, but is more like a sequel to "To Kill A Mockingbird".  I Loved It!!!  There is a lesson in this book.  I believe that everyone should read it.
If you want to read about Scout's childhood memories, this is the book for you.<br/>The "race" issue is an afterthought at the end of the book, which does not have a good conclusion.
Even though it was written first, it must definitely be read after "Mockingbird". You must have formed an opinion of Atticus for this book to be meaningful. And it is, on many levels.
Simplistic at first glance, at first read, but complex in its delivery and worthy of multiple reads. Beautifully fleshed out, a painterly and tactile essence of the old south brought to life.
Way to political. Again the white race.
bit of a let down after the  first book
Harper Lee is an artist with her words!
This book is in need of a good editing.
Great book and really worth the read!!!
It's no To Kill A Mockingbird. Too bad!
Not as good as the first. Kinda boring.
this no "To kill a Mockingbird"
Terrible shouldn't have wasted my time.
Very good book. Insightful to that era.
Good read. A little slow in the middle.
Its a decent storyline but un-eventful.
is not "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Was good, but definitely not memorable.
I found this book lacking in "meat" but because I lived through the times discussed in the book it was a delight to see the impressions of the day from a variety of different angles.
I thought it was good.  I do not think it was racial as some people think.  People have to remember the South in the 50's and the 60's. I lived through those years so it was hard in everyone
This story is set in the 60's south and is about the civil rights start. It's just ok. Good story about different generations seeing the segregation from different eyes.  Not a barn burner.
The book was good. To Kill A Mockingbird is my most favorite novel ever  This one seemed to end like it wasn't finished. I was disappointed but glad to see what happened to the characters.
This is a much more adult book than Mockingbird.  As someone that was around in the early sixties, I found the distinct Southern views enlightening.  I will always remain a Harper Lee fan.
Very good, but not as good as Mockingbird.  Required closer reading and more  thought.  All characters except her uncle were not fully developed.  Needed another 20% to reach Mockingbird.
Very good book, it is hard to put down
Seems like appropriately timed release
Well written but not very interesting.
Not as good as to kill a mocking bird.
A little disjointed, but an easy read.
'Go Set a Watchman' does read like an early draft which could benefit from good editorial support, but it also comes across as a potentially great, influential book. I agree with the critic who lamented that the original editor's response possibly deprived us of several more books by this amazing writer.  Great as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is, it is sad that these two will be our only books by Harper.<br/><br/>As a recent American, I feel I have a much better understanding of the Southern viewpoint after reading 'Watchman'. This book sent me off to research the Tenth Amendment and has given me a better understanding of where some Southern politicians are coming from. 'Mockingbird' brought the geography and culture of the south vividly alive but 'Watchman' helped me understand why the Civil War happened and why even today the Confederate flag is held sacred by many who are not racists.
Very disappointed in this book.  To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books and was really looking forward to reading this.<br/><br/>This book should have remained unpublished
I wish I had not read this book.  It is very loud, and the writing is poor.  It somewhat ruined Mockingbird for me, which is one of my favorite books.  I did not like the book at all.
Really disappointed in this effort.  After the brilliance of To Kill a Mockingbird, this was a total dud.
So disappointing.  Just proved further that Atticus wasn't the do-gooder so many readers thought he was.  I can barely express the many reasons I did not like this "pre-quel".
Entertaining.  Not "TKAM," but still entertaining and enlightening, nonetheless, in continuing the story TKAM starts and providing greater into the charters lives and psyches.
Interesting story but a bit dated.  It should have been published and read before Mockingbird.  If Harper Lee were not the author, chances are that it would not be a best seller.  RGB
Harper Lee is a fine story teller.  This book inspired me to start reading Mockingbird. It's a raw look at what we were/are and what we should be. Was very tempted to give it 5 stars.
Harper Lee has given us another great novel and one last chance to visit Maycomb and many of it's beloved inhabitants. As with many people, I was initially turned off when I heard that Go Set had portrayed Atticus as a bigot. I love TKM so much that I knew I had to read this, so I soldiered on. I am so happy that I did. When I finished, I realized how fortunate I was to have the opportunity to be touched by Harper Lee's simple eloquence and profound thought. It took a lot of courage to write this book and to portray many of the characters as Lee did. However, what I know of Harper Lee, it's not surprising that she did it and didn't flinch a bit. I believe that this book was written after TKM for a couple of reasons. First, there is little character background, it's written as if you already know who all the participants are. Second, and most important; is that it follows up on the theme in TKM, that bigotry will die in stages and not all at once. In TKM, after Tom's trial, Miss Maudie speaks to a dejected Jem about the progress of racial equality in the South, she says "...Atticus Finch won't win, he can't win but he's the only man in these parts that can keep a jury out so long in a case like that. And I thought to myself,well, we're making a step - it's a baby-step, but it's a step.". In this great book, Miss Lee tackles the fall of God's, the slow demise of bigotry and the question of "can you really go home again"? She does it in a way that only she can and if you loved TKM then you will love this book too.
An utter disappointment. I wish I could get my money back. Harper Lee's To kill a Mockingbird is one of the greatest American novels ever written. This falls short on so many levels.
Good but pales in comparison to TKAM. Almost seemed like two different writers. If this was truly written before TKAM, Ms Lee really improved her writing skills in her second effort.
If you read this book expecting To Kill a Mockingbird, you will be disappointed.  And the pre-book hype paints Atticus with a very broad brush without  really explaining the character.  Having lived through this time in a similar setting, it felt familiar to me.  Scout, all grown and gone to the city, has never let go of her hero worship of her father.  Finding him participating in a meeting that was building racial barriers, along with the man with whom she was considering marriage, rocked Scout's world.  Then visiting her cherished Calpurnia and not being received as expected, Scout began to doubt everything she thought she knew.  The fact was that times had changed and relationships that had been loving and accepted and uneventful had changed too.  Scout's life in New York was vastly different than tiny town Alabama, and she had not been part of that change, so the home she in which she found comfort was no longer comfortable and she found it difficult to acknowledge the changes herself.  Atticus didn't like the changes either, but understood that he had to be a cautious observer and participant in subduing potential violence.  He was being a peacekeeper in a very difficult time.<br/><br/>I have read To Kill a Mockingbird almost annually for many years and it is by far the better book.  However, this book shouldn't be discounted and the racial hype is unfair.  I enjoyed the book and will probably reread it at some point.  I don't see a movie in it, though I imagine there is someone out there already working on it.
enjoyed the story but was unhappy about the way things were back in 1960's but I lived through that.  I think this was true to how people talked around me but I felt like Scout did.
If you read Mockingbird or live in this part of the world, you'll be familiar with places mentioned. Other than that, it's just a story. I would have no interest in reading it again
Harper Lee has said many, many times that she wrote ONLY 1 book. No sequels,prequels etc. This seem to be ghost written by a person with a different agenda that Harper Lee would have had. I don't believe for one minute that she wrote it. I think her agent had a huge part in the writing.
Jean Louise Finch is twenty six and returns for a visit to her hometown from New York City where she has been living.<br/><br/>None of the characters are likeable.  My favorite is Dr. John Finch, a retired physician, who seems to have common sense.  He is knowlegeable and well aware of what life is like in smalltown Maycomb, Alabama.  He tells Jean Louise people are the way they are, it's human nature to be so.  Jean Louise won't listen.  She is hard headed, judgemental for someone so young.<br/><br/>Atticus is a segregationist.  His daughter is sick when she finds out.  She has always adored her dad, looked up to him, wanted to be like him.  Now she practically hates him.<br/><br/>The characters all seem to be playing parts, trying hard to fit in to get along with others.  They don't seem to know who they are anymore.  Need to be agreeable, need to be liked, need to get along with their peers.  But who if any of these folks are for real?  None of them know themselves.  Everything has always been the same in this little town.  Atticus's way of thinking shocks Jean Louise who is no longer in touch with her background and feels she does not belong to Maycomb, has no more home, no place to come back to.  But she won't change, doesn't agree with former friends and relatives. But should she if she feels their ways of thinking and living are wrong?<br/><br/>Dr. John Finch sits back watching what is going on around him.  Despite all the negative reviews there is a lot of truth in this book.
this coming of age story is beautifully written, and while Atticus is not the same man we met in Mockingbird, his reputation in this reader opinion was not to greatly tarnished.
Very good read; keep in mind this book was written first so some of the references to the story don't mate up with 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. But I did enjoy it. Scout is a champ!
I had a totally different opinion from that of the liberal left reviews that preceded my reading. Everybody should have the opportunity to make up his or her mind independently.
I couldn't put it down, read until I finished it, made me feel like I was right there following Jean Marie around, I really wish Miss Lee had written more books. It was amazing.
I<br/>Interesting to place Scout's voice in the first person in To Kill a Mockingbird, then switch to third person in Go Set a Watchman.  Perhaps the omniscient author voice allowed the details to be more objective in this story.  Jeanne Louise remained true to her quirky, non-conformist self by not doing what we wanted her to do---marry the man who has loved her so long.  Watchman's style had a more mature ease about it, and many passages made me laugh aloud, which did not happen in Mockingbird.  The specifics of the Christian character of Atticus were more clearly spelled out in Watchman, so that we even better understand his desire to live in the public arena as he did at home.  Is there by some miracle a THIRD book about Scout's later life???  What a gift to get to read these two marvelous pieces of Southern American literature together!
Power with disappointments. A must read with the first novel to see the evolutionary growth of human beings in context... black and white shadows and shades of gray in between.
I thought that this was an intense look at the characters southern town and her family that we did not see in To Kill a Mocking Bird. Scouts hard look at her father was amazing
Harper Lee's new publication, "Go Set a Watchman", is a curious prequel/sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird". Narrated by "Scout", now grown up as Jean Louise, Lee attempts to tell the story of Atticus Finch in his declining years and to explain how he turned out feeling the ways he did. The problem with the book is that Atticus only appears in force at the end, and by then his story has largely been related by his brother, Uncle Jack. Attempts by the author to explain away his positions as being a reflection of southern attitudes in the 1950s fall short. The Atticus from "To Kill a Mockingbird", is largely gone, replaced by someone whose reconstituted views don't seem real. It's as if the narrative in "Go Set a Watchman", tries to add two and two to get four, but only arrives at three. A disappointment.
Loving this book. As an English teacher who has talk "To Kill a Mockingbird" for years the authors style is familiar and the story line expands the character of Scout.
Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird
very disappointing to say the least.
Thought provoking and wonderful read
Interesting but not a future classic
Boring..cannot believe she wrote it.
A little slow but thought provoking.
Makes the times easer to understand.
Great writer. Wish she had done more
Disappointing book. Cannot be compared with author's other book. sounds like she needed money so used this book to ride on the coat tails of " To Kill A Mockingbird".
So many people are unaware of how intense the basis can be. People are mourning the result of Atticus Finch. The real hero in Mockingbird and Watchmen was and is Jean Louise!
A much-awaited novel that treats themes of race and class in the south. Harper Lee is an excellent writer. However, it is not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, in my opinion.
After reading To Kill a Mockingbird, had to read this one, enjoyed it very much.  Truly a tale of our past and present times with racism.  Recommend this book wholeheatedly.
The crisis in this novel was such a let down compared to To Kill a Mockingbird.  Scout stayed true but Calpurnia and Jem roles were sad in that the were pretty non-existent.
Read this - it's not just about Atticus being in favor of segregation - it's about fathers and daughters and our roles in the world.  It's about families and relationships.
Very superficial piece of writing. I  re-read To Kill a Mockingbird just before reading this, and it is as if it was written by another author. I'm sorry I wasted my money.
A very poorly written story.  Very disappointing and would not recommend it.  I was 3 quarters of the way thru it before I could tell  where they were going with the story.
Wonderful development of characters we have known for so long.  It it 1950's South up close and very personal. Wonderful mood and sensitivity to a time that many remember.
It is a great book and excellent reading, when I heard about it on Fox and began reading it, was nervous about certain areas where it is dark and scary, so taking it slow.
I wanted this to be as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  It is not even close.  Do I feel differently about the characters in this later time? No, because people change with the politics of their world.  My problem with the book is how confusing it is.  Sometimes I felt like pages were missing.  The conversations were convoluted as well.  I have a Kindle copy, so it is possible that there are problems.  But I think, most likely, that it is just not a very good book.
Very Dissapointed!!!
I was hoping that it will be better
More heavy handed than Mockingbird.
Meh, meh, meh; not what I expected!
Little story...a lot of philosophy.
Just finished reading Harper Lee's second novel (or her first, depending on who you believe) "Go Set a Watchman" which has been the subject of much controversy this summer.<br/><br/>First, I must say that I am disappointed in the number of reviewers who felt it was their job to reveal so many details about the storyline. Had I read the reviews before I read the book, I would not have had the pleasure of being strung along with Jean Louise towards her awful truth. Shame on the spoilers.<br/><br/>I also am not impressed with the publisher's choice of paper or typeface. It seems like Harper Collins rushed to print as cheaply as possible. Even if the manuscript is inferior to it's predecessor, it deserved better.<br/><br/>As for the story itself, I found the characters' arguments in defense of their racist beliefs convoluted and outrageous. That's not to say Ms. Lee failed in that respect because I find the arguments convoluted and outrageous in real life, too. I think she captured them perfectly.<br/><br/>But, what struck me the most was Ms. Lee's description of Scout's utter devastation when her identity and her belief system were shattered. I felt her heartbreak as surely as if it were mine, because, just like anyone else who loved the younger version of Atticus, it was my heartbreak, too. It was worth what it took for me to get there and I'm glad I got there without the help of those reviewers.
I did not enjoy this book. I felt like it was just "thrown together" when it was written. It was hard to get into and hard to follow. I would not recommend it.
It isn't To Kill a Mockingbird. This is like reading the rough draft of a great novel. I'm glad I read it. I'm glad the publishers pushed Harper Lee into writing more.
I loved this book. I know that it wasn't originally meant to be a sequel to Lee's "Mockingbird", so I went into it with an open mind- which I recommend doing.
Lot of controversy about this novel.  You need to wade through the first 120 pages, but the rest of the book is worth it.  I loved it.  I'm so happy it was published.
Lee Harper should never have released this book.  It was not her best work and her the characterization of Attticus was as a much better man in To Kill A Mockingbird.
Would highly recommend!  Answers questions about Atticus and makes him an actual southern human  He is seen as more complex than the perfect father in Mockingbird.
My thoughts on Go Set a Watchman are similar to many other readers. I went into with the idea that it wasn't actually meant to be a sequel, because she actually wrote it first. As a sequel, I don't care for it much, but there was some merit to the story. The story itself is not as polished and lacks a sense of completeness. So while I really can't call it a "first draft," it certainly is an early evolution to the story. The best parts to me were when Scout was thinking about her childhood with Jem and Dill - the take on a tent revival was quite humorous. The saddest thing to me was not the attitude of Atticus, but rather Calpurnia's reaction to Scout - that hurt more than anything else in the entire story, because she basically helped raise Scout, but I haven't seen many readers mention that, so maybe it was just me.<br/><br/>I think perhaps had Harper Lee re-visited this story sometime later, but given it new characters and changed some of their background and revised, this could have been a better story on it's own, with no connection to To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm not as disappointed as other readers seem to be, and it didn't "taint" my view of Atticus of To Kill a Mockingbird, nor did it lessen my love for it in any way. It was a fascinating look at how one writers craft and story evolved and for that, I'm glad that I read it.
Book was a good read and a different viewpoint 're the South and integration. It deserves to be read and discussed, and not as a sequel or prequel to Mockingbird.
Throughly enjoyed the story and the great writing of Harper Lee.  A timely theme with the relationship between father and daughter being the spark that I enjoyed.
Worth reading but disappointing in comparison to TKaM:  a grilling of Jean Louise (by her uncle) diminishes HER and elevates Atticus's role as a closeted racist.
Scout as a grown-up is much different than Scout in Mockingbird. Makes one realize how much influence our parents and surroundings can influence our adult lives.
While not as great  or as action-packed as to Kill a Mockingbird, this book may provide a more realistic version of racial attitudes in Alabama in the mid 1950s.
Approach this work with an open mind.  Leave your assumptions about Jem, Scout, and Atticus at the door.  The reader that can do this is in for a literary treat!
Very well written. The subject matter is controversial but describes the thinking of many people during those years. I found it very interesting and fast moving.
I was disappointed after all of the media blitz on this book.  Couldn't compare to "Mockingbird."  It's as though two different people wrote these books.
This book had a little bit of everything in it.<br/>Southern humor, childhood memories, love and respect. The book had a lot to say, I thoroughly  enjoyed it.
I guess it is expected to compare this with her first book.  It did not hold my attention for a good while.  Although I have been a Southerner for my entire life I never found race equality this difficult.  I was raised to respect blacks according to the character they showed in life.  The same applied to whites.  I have never said the "N" word because it shows bad character to purposely offend someone.<br/>I have to give it a three because I don't agree with her about life in Southern towns. Part is true but most small towns were very prejudiced against blacks.  Now we have come a long way and we are seeing a lot of prejudice against whites.  I hope we will eventually consider ourselves just Americans who are in the large melting pot of mixed races.
Should never have been published.
I felt the book to be rather dull
Not too bad but not great either.
Still relevant to today's society
Enjoyed the different perspective
not nearly as good as Mockingbird
Interesting ideas. Worth reading.
It was very insightful after reading "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I received a very different perspective of Atticus and Sport.  I really liked the book.
A great read. Very well written.
Couldn't get into it. It was ok.
Choppy. Not what I had expected.
Sorry I didn't listen to may heart instead of my head. To Kill A Mockingbird was , and still is, the best book ever written about the South at that time.
I enjoyed "Go Set A Watchman" almost as much as I enjoyed "To Kill A Mocking Bird."  I hope she has another "hidden" manuscript.
While this is not To Kill A Mockingbird, I didn't expect it to be so I was good with it.  It was a quick read, but I found myself enjoying it very much.
Finished rereading TKAM yesterday and read/skimmed through GSAW today. Mockingbird made me cry (again) and re-realize what a great book it is with wonderfully developed characters, illustrative descriptions, and the suspense of a small sleepy town as seen through the eyes of a child. GSAW makes me understand why Harper Lee's editors told her to try again. She did and she produced a brilliant lasting novel in TKAM. GSAW is an interesting, worthwhile read as a backdrop to Harper Lee's writing TKAM. I wouldn't say it is a great book, but if you love TKAM, it's interesting to take a look at GSAW. And I still love the characters in TKAM even knowing where they started out in the author's mind and ended up on the page.
Frankly, disappointing. I now know why her publisher told her to go back & write another book. It was a God thing that resulted in To Kill Mockingbird.
I love To Kill a Mockingbird and re-read it every year, so I was hesitant to read Go Set a Watchman. Now that I have finished it, I am glad I read it.
Putting the book in perspective, it was quite interesting. As a rough draft or as a beginning of To Kill Mockingbird makes the book more interesting..
A learning experience on dealing with,understanding and  loving others who think differently and the real reasons while we are trying to move forward.
Enjoyed reading this book. It helped to explain the difference between forming an opinion on your own, and having one formed for you by your parents.
Excellent. Very realistic for the era.  Shows that overprotecting children from discrimination issues can result in emotional distress later in life.
It was not what I expected!  However, Ms Lee is such a superb writer that I could hardly put the book down.  Certainly a riveting and revealing tale!
Growing up is hard for anyone!  Growing up the daughter of a widower, in the South, in the 40's and 50's is almost impossible.<br/>Enjoy both books!
This book is full of surprises and so unexpected from her famous book 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. I love the way she defines each character and allows us a good look at what the South once was...I recommend this book to anyone that loved her book 'To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>This will leave you in deep thought of what we have been through and still going through in the USA and racial injustices, but it is not slanted to one side, you can easily see why the South thought as they did, as humans we are always afraid of strong changes and this book points out just how fearful we can be.<br/>I highly recommend buying this book.<br/>Thank you Miss Harper Lee for writing another book of extraordinary times.
After all the reviews and hype, I guess I expected a more compelling story. I found it a bit boring and could never relate to any of the characters.
ARE YOU SERIOUS? That was it?  I was so anxious waiting to read this book. I imagined it to have more promise, oh my, what a let down. Linda Lehmann
Read it immediately after purchase.<br/>Now ready to do a re-read for my book club...taking notes.  So glad it was published.  So relevant for today.
I feel it was somewhat contrived and proved nothing. After all the hype, I was disappointed.<br/>I still treasure, "To Kill a Mockingbird."
TOO WORDY and boring in places.
Too much dialog; not much plot.
I prefer Killing a Mocking Bird
Very disappointed in this book.
A great book, great story line.
Very draggy not much of a story
To Kill a Mockingbird is better
disappointed in the story line.
She wrote an excellent book.  I can see why she withheld the manuscript from publication,  The culture is too pc to accept the nuance of the times.
I loved the book! It was really interesting to see how Scout had grown into a lovely young woman. Great story line. Would recommend it to everyone!
I really loved the early chapters in this book, but by the end, I'm not even sure what point was being made. I don't know. Then it just ended.
Did not think it was comparable to Mockingbird. The story was a bit lame and it got to be a bit philosophical in the discussions with Atticus.
It was such a horrible book. No continuity or plot. Just ill written. I do not recommend. If zero stars could be given, I would give it none.
Bought for daughter who  want to review the book because she is a reading specialist teacher in middle school. She said it was disappointing.
was prepared not to like it as much as "To Kill a Mockingbird"  It was amazing - made me think more than any book I have ever read!!!
Wonderful book! Really much better than I thought it would be after reading the first few chapters. It gains momentum with every turned page.
Thought it was terrific I interesting travel  of life father and daughter and changes times with race as background<br/>Enjoyed it very much
I like Watchman.  I do.  Because I have done the same thing.  I mean, I've written one story, thought, "Hey, I can do better than that," and taken the same characters, the same plot, the same setting, and written a completely different story.  I can see why my beloved Miss Lee never published Watchman until now.  It is not as good a story, and it doesn't send quite the same message.  It is not her best. But it is probably not her best because she was telling what really happened, not a poetic and almost allegorical perception of it.<br/><br/>Mockingbird is poetic.<br/><br/>Watchman is a rant.<br/><br/>What so many worshipers of Mockingbird don't seem to grasp is that Mockingbird is not a defense of African Americans.  It is not a story about racism.  It is a story about a child growing up in an odd and curious culture, a culture with deep, mysterious roots, myriad unwritten rules, and dangerous, even fatal, consequences, trying to find her own way, trying to find some answers.  Watchman is the same story, but there is a lot more ranting, particularly from the almost unbearably self-righteous Jean Louise, and although the point of view is moving and poignant, the novel itself feels somehow contrived, too careful with the planning, and there are clear attempts, with the narrative and structure, to sound just a bit like the (mostly) male stars of the Modern Period of American Literature. It is the work of an apprentice, a novice.<br/><br/>I grew up in the South, and I have lived here all of my life.  I have never encountered an Atticus Finch a la Mockingbird.  But I have known dozens of Atticus Finches a la Watchman.  Political racism I always called it.  Or perhaps economic racism would be a more accurate term?  It’s not about whether somebody’s ancestors came from another continent.  It’s about the defense of a way of life, economy, security, right or wrong.  Their philosophy might be, “I might not like it, I hate looking at myself in the mirror some mornings, but it’s mine not to like, and no matter how ridiculous I look running around in white sheets or how much self-respect I lose slapping the hell out of my kinswoman, I WILL preserve it.”<br/><br/>And really, that slap thing?  That is SO Glenn Ford B&W; matinee, in a bad Ted Turner week.  Everybody knows that a slap upside the head doesn’t bring a Southern gal to her senses or become resigned or apologize.  It makes her take her shot gun out of the closet, and make sure it’s loaded.  For bear.<br/><br/>In Mockingbird, Scout is real.  In Watchman, she is not.  In Mockingbird, Atticus is a contrived hero, a symbol.  In Watchman, he is a man I’ve known all my life.  Fought hard, too.  Better the enemy I know than some straw man, bumper sticker attractant.<br/><br/>But I expect Miss Lee knew.  Which is why it took her so long to write Mockingbird.  And why she took so long to allow Watchman to be published.  Both novels are about truly hard ways of life, on all sides, and ask truly hard questions, in a culture where even asking the questions were a perilous thing. No bumper sticker approach will work here.  Stop trying.  You can't label this.<br/><br/>No really good writer wants anybody else to read her notes, her pre-writing exercise.  Watchman is great as a study of pre-writing.  The first attempt.  And then the epiphany of a writer:  I can do better. I can tell it better.  I can send a better message.<br/><br/>How often do we get to see that? Put the two novels together, teach Watchman and then Mockingbird.  This, THIS is how we teach writing. And, for that matter, reading.<br/><br/>And it is wonderfully ironic that it reads, right now, in 2015, rather like bad fan fiction. Hmmm...hello?<br/><br/>Still, I am grateful to have this insight into Miss Lee’s writing process, sparse as it is.  Many, many people should read Go Set a Watchman, not for the scandal (remember, these are FICTIONAL characters), not for enlightenment about racism and economic paranoia in the South, but for a really good audio-visual of the writing process, of the evolution of thought and the human imagination.
I'm southern and an activist. In 1956 I was at the Univ. of Ala. and joined with other like minded young people to ridicule, the administration, get the rioters expelled and debate the main one over the student radio and tear him to shreds. We also threw paint (sign in concrete so could't  uproot it) over " The Klu Klux Klan Welcomes You to Tuscaloosa" sign so at least you couldn't read it.<br/><br/>I am southern. I was at the U of Ala. in 1956 when Autherine Lucy entered as the first black student in a southern university after the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. The Board of Education. A bunch of us circulated a petition to get the rioters expelled and succeeded in getting their main leader ousted. We debated him on the student radio and had a cartoon published in the student paper ridiculing him. We drove out one night and threw paint over the KKK welcomes you to Tuscaloosa sign (set in concrete so couldn't uproot it.) We were way ahead of Harper.<br/> My family were racists as were all our families, but two years after Brown we were determined to see it implemented. We were not where most of us are today, but like Atticus we believed that segregation was wrong.<br/> Now comes Harper Lee. First, she writes poorly. That demeans us. Her style demeans us. We are still considered backward, uneducated and<br/>childlike by our Northern detractors. Well, there is some truth in that. The whole fight to keep the South as we knew it has come out of fear, poverty, and the humiliation of the Reconstruction: our Versailles.  This novel only confirms the low opinion that the nation has for us. I left the south after college, never to return. I was ashamed of it. I went to Chicago and found virulent race hatred there. The lie of southern race hatred as a southern phenomenum is perpetuated in this novel. In the south we were paternalistic, maybe even less respectful than out right hatred, but it<br/>I am a southerner. I was at the U of Ala. in 1956 when Aurtherine Lucy entered after Brown (1954). A group of us circulated a petition to have t he riot leader expelled. We debated him on the student radio, did a cartoon of him in the student paper and made a laughing stock out of him. We threw paint over a KKK sign welcoming people to Tuscaloosa (it was in concrete so we couldn't uproot it). So we were a bit further in than Harper. Racism is universal. It is destructive of our souls. It is perhaps more prevalent in the South but when I went to Chicago it was even worse. Our paternalistic form of it allowed me to know a number of black women who taught me a lot about pride, perseverance and love. They were all servants, because we wouldn't let them rise. But the young college students who worked for us were rising anyway. At Alabama, we never even got to meet Aurthurine Lucy before she was expelled for criticizing the administration (I wonder why!),  but we had gotten the riot leader expelled.<br/> Harper's book makes us all look dumb, racist, and literarily pathetic.<br/><br/> After two chapters, the style was so cute that I needed to give up to restore my sanity. I'll give my copy to the library, where doubtless, dozens of people will morn for the old Atticus. I never even got that far. Racism is an irrational fear of the other. A need to have someone who, no matter how mean and stupid you may be, will always be "under" you. The whole nation suffers from that disease, not just the South. We don't need Atticus. We need to just look in the mirror to see the disease in ourselves. Only then can we begin to heal.
I think this book was more about Scout's realization that she has different opinions and beliefs than Atticis than about him being a racist.
Interesting and easy to read.
good reading, but over hyped.
It was ok a bit disappointed.
Really disappointing. Turgid.
Good but I liked TKMB BETTER.
I enjoy Ms Harper Lee's book.
Great story, but predictable.
Did not enjoy this book at all.  I loved To Kill A Mockingbird.  Sounds like someone got the idea to make money off of Harper Lee's name.
Since I always finish a book no matter how good or bad, I read the whole thing.  I was bored out of my mind.  Couldn't wait to finish it.
No it's NOT Mockingbird, & yes, Mockingbird made a better, more straightforward story.  However, Watchman does represent the very confused, irrational emotions that shaped & still shape the views of Southern whites who grew up in the so-called Civil Rights Era.  As one who grew up in the South at that time & had family members on both sides of the segregation issue, there was a certain bitter, dismayed sense of deja vu in the dialogue among the characters. Many so-called moderates of the era like Atticus became much less so as their sense of white privilege was challenged. The political realignment of Southern whites & indeed many non-Southern whites in the nearly 60 yrs since Watchman was written reflect the emotions that run so very deep. it's very hard to accept that the child not the adult Scout was colorblind given where & when she grew up & to where she returned.  The strength of family ties ultimately sends her back home & helps her make peace w/ the segregationists who surround her.That is tragic given the weight of history, but one can only hope that she could persevere in maintaining more amiable relations the African-Americans in her midst.
Don't buy this book thinking it will be a good read. I was very disappointed, waste of money, made no sense, no point, poorly written.
I didn't think the book was very good. It was very preachy on both sides of the civil rights issue and the character Scout was whiney.
Beautifully written. I finished it way too quickly. A different view of Atticus but once again he is teaching his daughter about life.
Best book of 2015........superb accounting of the South "in the day" .......as well written as possible by a celebrated author
My rating vacillated between a 3-4 and the reason is I expected much more from Harper Lee, although that is not to say that this novel wasn't interesting. The story as it reads seems to not have been Lee's final draft as it seemed to need something more, such as a clearer picture of the characters and a well-developed plot along with some clever sub-plots, which I would expect from her. And that's where it left me wanting... Having read the book and viewed the movie, "To Kill A Mockingbird" numerous times over the past 40 years, this is where Lee's drawing upon her own life as illustrated in her first novel really came to life for me and I so enjoyed the nostalgic bent lent to her second novel.  Atticus, Jem, Scout, her aunt and the whole town come back to this reader and I am back in that small southern town where justice was once served and compassion given. Scout's sense of innocence and naivety is once again challenged when she returns to her hometown and life is never what it appears to be.  If you are a Harper Lee fan then DO read this book - you'll enjoy the trip back in time and the surprises the story unfolds.... ;)
So not what I hoped for. A lot of political rhetoric and monologues. Could not wait to see if it would get better but it just didn't.
Disjointed a lot until you understood the flow. Well written and quite moving. There was a great lesson to be learned by Jean Louise.
Great story about growing up and seeing your parents as people and not gods, however it broke my heart to see what became of Atticus!
I know that some have panned the book: Atticus being racist, too preachy in the second half, but I really enjoyed Scout (I still think of her by that name) and empathized with what she was going through.  I grew up in the South and once I became an adult, realized I couldn't live in the racist environment of the South back in the 1960s and 1970s.  As you learn later in the book (after Scout sees Atticus in a racist meeting), Atticus is less a racist and more a product of the time and environment.  I still think To Kill A Mockingbird is the better book, but Go Set a Watchman explores the South of the early 1950s, shortly after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs the Board of Education.  The only inconsistency between the two books is the outcome of the Tom Robinson trial -- in To Kill A Mockingbird, Tom is found guilty and in Go Set A Watchman, he is acquited.  Considering the feelings in South at that time, the guilty verdict is more realistic.  I wonder if given the chance before publication, Harper Lee would have changed it so the two books are consistent (and yes, I think Atticus is consistent between the two books).
Reading what I was able to get through of Go Set a Watchman, I'm reminded of the old contraversey that Harper Lee didn't write To Kill a Mockingbird. The magic was completely missing from Go Set a Watchman. It did seem as if a different authors wrote the two books.<br/><br/>I can see why Harper Lee's sister prevented this manuscript from being published and it would have been better had those who took advantage of Ms.Lee to publish it had not done so. Shame on the publisher's greed, and whoever allowed this book to be published, they have done a disservice to Ms. Lee and the forever wonderful, To Kill a Mockingbird.
Please do not believe the pre hype on this book!  Take the time to read it cover to cover and when finished you will enjoy the read!
You can definitely tell that this was her REJECTED first manuscript to the publisher. It contradicts TKAM on more than one occasion.
Great plot. Sometimes hard to follow due to literary meandering so, but characters were well developed and the plot resolved nicely.
LONG AGO, Harper Lee established herself as a writer who delivers a story that transforms you to another time and place, as in her first novel, To Kill a Mockingbird.  So many have commented that in this book, she changes the philosophy of Atticus Finch regarding racism in the South as seen through the eyes of his daughter, Scout.  Why all the stir?  People do change opinions as they grow older.  They sometimes see a bigger picture; and sometimes their vision narrows.  Whatever her intent, the author provides a novel that picks you up and moves you back in time to a tumultuous period  in our nation's history.  Perhaps you have to have lived back then to appreciate it.  We've gained so much, but we've lost a lot, too. Scout was privileged to grow up in a more innocent time; thus her great shock to see her father apparently change his mind about the Black and White beliefs of that day.  At any rate, Go Set a Watchman is a quick read; an easy read; and a charming reminder of Youth's inability to see the color Grey.  I recommend the book for the history lesson alone, but there's a lot of humanity packed in its pages, too.
In Go Set a Watchman, you get the Jean Louise that you grew up with, the same person you were able to identify with from a different era and cultural background. She's been through it and spent time away in NYC, but Harper gives you the same Jean Louise that you've come to know. She is spirited, naive and stubborn as usual and in GSAW, she's on one of the biggest elbows of her journey of self-discovery in her life.<br/><br/>Jean Louise has always stood up for what she beleives in, or for what Atticus has expressed and she has subsequently adopted and become congruent with. She's mirrored her father's conscience ever since she was a child, her belief system tied and bound to his. In To Kill a Mockingbird, you find traces of Jean Louise's constant habit for validating herself and belief system against Atticus' actions. A quite secure and well-loved little girl who's also always noticing the nuances of her father's (Atticus) behaviour only to verify her own father's consistency as her underlying reason, her 'life guide' and her unwavering cross. He (Atticus) is but a man, but a forgivable man of beautiful humility.
I read Go Set a Watchman almost as soon as it arrived on my Kindle, having pre-ordered it and having reccently re-read To Kill a Mockingbird in anticipation.  I'm writing this within a couple of hours of finishing Watchman, having taken the time to read some of the early reviews (which I'd studiously avoided before Watchman arrived).  These are my initial reactions, to give context to what follows.<br/><br/>My first reaction is that this is an early draft of what might have been a very good or even great novel but instead became raw material for a different unambiguously great novel.  But do not make the mistake of thinking that Watchman is related to Mockingbird except as raw material and as a literary artifact.  While some of the characters may have the same names, some similarities in characterisation and character history (along with very important differences) and so on, these are two different novels about different characters and, most importantly, Watchman cannot reasonably be seen as in any way a sequel to Mockingbird.<br/><br/>As a novel, by itself and not considered in relation to Mockingbird, Watchman has its problems.  I found the pacing uneven, the transitions between its mostly third-person narration into occasional first-person passages jarring, the didactic nature of some of its set-pieces ill-conceived and the character of the adult Jean Louise strangely variable and occasionally shrill, histrionic and annoying.  That makes me sound like I didn't like it, but I did.  I just think it needed work.  Quite obviously a lot of work was done - so much that it was transformed into a completely different novel, with the original not seen until now.  The original was set more contemporaneously with time of writing and addressed up-to-date politics at the time it was written. After suitable work it might also have been a very good book, though how good it is now impossible to guess.<br/><br/>To now mention the obvious (without any more spoilers than are out there in public) the Atticus Finch of Watchman is different from but not unrelated to the Atticus Finch of Mockingbird.  The latter, of course, is a far more admirable fellow.  There are flashes of the less-admirable Atticus in the Mockingbird character, but more nuanced and much reduced.  However, the less-admirable Atticus is not entirely the racist monster some reviewers have painted him.<br/><br/>He is a believable and in some ways admirable character, perhaps more of his time, less hateful than other racist characters but both racist and anti-democratic nonetheless.  Something that shocks his daughter, with that shock providing much of the narrative drive of the book (the rest being on the themes of coming home a misfit, coming of age and scales lifting from the eyes).  Some of the events in the book (for example, Atticus joining the KKK and attending a single meeting) I think are deserving of a closer reading than some of the reviewers seem to have given them, perhaps out of shock at the thought of a racist Atticus Finch (note: not the same character!)<br/><br/>As to Watchman as an artifact, illuminating the development of To Kill a Mockingbird and of Harper Lee as a writer, well, I expect a great deal of no-doubt well-thought-out analysis will be produced.  I have some of ideas of my own in that regard.  But I've not had time to think them through and so I think I'll spare anyone the burden of reading them, at least for now.  Still, they did lead me to rate this as 4 stars, although as a stand-alone work I think Go Set a Watchman is worth roughly two and a half.
This book is a literary curiosity. Presented as a lost manuscript, it is closer to a first draft of what later became the seminal classic To Kill a Mockingbird.  As such, it is well written and deeply interesting. Harper Lee wrestles with the topic of racism in the South, but develops what have become long cherished characters differently to get her point across. It is not the great work of literary achievement that Mockingbird is, and cannot help but suffer by comparison.  Nevertheless it is a good read - better than many recent books I've encountered - and for me is made more fascinating by the comparison..
A beautifully and poignantly written " coming of age of a mind" journey that is totally relevant in today's racially divided world.
I didn't bother to finish it. After reading half of it I still didn't know where this book was going. A bit of a fraud, I would say
I expected more character development from tkmb. Jem and the neighbors were barely mentioned and Atticus was portrayed differently.
Ordered for my mom who's a Harper Lee fan. She was done reading it within 3 days of getting it. Need-less-to-say, she enjoyed it.
All readers of American literature should enjoy this.  A haunting description of a small Southern town & family with intricacies.
The ending is charming... 😅.  Well written, catching and truly telling of a Daugthers blind love for father and family. Telling.
It was a good, easy read but definitely not Go Kill a Mockingbird.  It did NOT have a "Hey, Boo." moment.  Gld I read it.
Go Set a Watchman is not a prequel or a sequel. It is a separate book. I was disappointed in the story and character development.
Follows closely in the steps of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and continues the excellent writing and stories from Harper Lee.
It is a good post history look at the characters to How To Kill A Mockingbird and insight to the principal people in both books.
Very Well written...Harper Lee is a wonderful author....to bad she has only written two books...We need to hear more from her...
Harper Lee lead a very interesting life. She was raised in the Deep South where there was such prejudice and separation of classes of people. I loved how the Watchman was quoted so often throughout the book, which by reading this book you will come to understand what that means. I loved the back stories of her childhood were brought to light that we didn't get to hear from To Kill A Mocking Bird. This story has plenty of heartbreak and laughter through it. I love how we got to see her relationship with Henry, Her Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack! She may not have seen eye to eye with her father and so many issues that were happening and did happen in Maycomb County. None the less she loved her father through it all. It was heartbreaking to hear about what happened to Jem. There was so much that Scout didn't understand or could see clearly when she came to visit but her Uncle Jack helped her see a different way to look at things of life in Maycomb. I loved the end. I loved how everything came full circle. "Every mans an Island, Jean Louise, every man's watchman, is his conscience."
A writer in The New Yorker dismissed this book as merely a vehicle for didactic debate, and a thin excuse for a book publisher coup.<br/>He was wrong. It's way more than a cheap followup.<br/>Yes, there are a few absent-minded repeats from To Kill A Mockingbird (the opening description of Aunt Alexandra uses the same words), but first of all this return from the future shows how carefully Harper Lee examined her earlier masterpiece and identified its faults.<br/>For instance, she wrote of the children's play acting in the first, without saying what they did. In this she fills that space with detail.<br/>More importantly, of course, in this book she explodes the myths of childhood and reveals the underlying racism of a society that was comfortable with its delusions.<br/>That causes a lot of pain, not just for the book's characters but for a generation of Americans who were blind to what any outsider could see.<br/>Lee has traversed the ugliness of The South with clever analysis.<br/>Given recent ructions over the Confederate flag, it seems her insights are as up-to-date as ever.
The timing couldn't be better to deliver its message to the world of today. With the controversy over Marriage Equality becoming federally regulated and the confederate flag being taken down, it carries the message I've been trying to tell my daughter when we hear about people trying loopholes to legal discrimination. "Everyone gets to have their say. If what they are saying is blatantly ignorant, why would stop them from saying it?". Harper Lee has done it again. Two complete works of powerful understated genius is more than anyone can ask of anyone. I'm glad the world got to see this.
I had to read it, but in relation to her classic it was inevitably a let down. There were glimmers however of what was to come.
A worthy successor to To Kill a Mockingbird. Decades later, but Harper Lee's writing style is like a taste of summer, long ago.
I really liked this book.  Loved the fact that the author went back and forth in time and brought more depth to the characters.
If I could give it 3.5 stars I would. This felt like an incomplete book you have to guest for yourself what happens with Scott.
Predictable, uninteresting.
Did not live up to the hype
Was ok, a bit hard to read?
Great character development
A sad but really good story
Excellent! We must all go set a watchman. Wonderful story. Feels like going home and it is both comforting and uncomfortable.
The writing of this book does not compare to the excellence of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD by the same author.  Nonetheless, it is worth reading.  I enjoyed seeing an older version of the main characters from that book in this one, and seeing what becomes of them in their older years.  There has been a lot of fuss in the publicity about Atticus being a bigot, but little praise that I think is deserved, in the descriptions of the other characters as they matured.  Perhaps this is because this book was written before the more famous one.  I don't think that should make it less worthwhile.
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my favorite books of all time. I love the dynamics of the relationship between Scout and her father, Atticus Finch. Harper Lee was able to build on the foundation established from her first novel reflecting the character development in a beautiful way. I've read reviews criticizing this book for destroying the heroic portrait of Atticus Finch and eroding the adoration of his daughter, but I see it as an extraordinary coming of age story about Jean Louise. When faced with the humanity of her family and childhood community, questions about racial equality and women's freedom surface. It seems that these had always been personal convictions rather than family values. She has to decide if she can accept the people she loves most, despite their conflicting persectives. She misses the feelings of belonging her small town provided her with, but doubts their ability to accept her because of her progressive views. In the end, she emerges with an identity all her own forged by the very people she shares a history and possibly a future with.
Waste of time.  Wondering if this was published and promoted just for the money.  Further research might prove it's a fraud.
I was disappointed, but I may have had too high expectations. It was rejected and maybe it should never have been published.
Well perhaps there are some issues with grammar etc but this was her first book. I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>I think most people are writing reviews have not even read it.<br/><br/>Atticus is human. The south of the sixties was a different place. I wasn't there so I can't call him a bunch of names. I was there in the 70's and 80's as I was born and raised there.<br/><br/>I know Scouts crushing feelings when she found out that her father wasn't the wonderful person she believed as a child. That is devastating at any age but as we cross from childhood into adulthood, we all experience it. Some worse than others. The south being the bible belt, there is nothing worse than finding out that fine upstanding church member who has been chastising you for all your wrongs IS really no different. Just a hypocrite in the worst of ways.<br/><br/>I question the timing on the release of this book given the turmoil the south is in at present. But I am better for having read it even though there is a question of whether she ever wanted it published.<br/><br/>I think we missed out on many great books by Harper Lee through the years and for that I am sad.<br/><br/>The last few pages will make you think...if you decide to read it as the definition of bigot is discussed. Who is the real bigot if you go by the dictionary definition? Maybe you all should read it instead of posting reviews saying you are not going to and check the definition of bigot for yourselves?
I enjoyed reading Go Set a Watchman.  It was a little different than what I expected but it was very thought provoking.  I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird before I read this one and was glad I did.  I loved Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird.  She was so open and receptive to things in her town. An inquisitive child that we all loved.  I did not get the same feeling in Go Set a Watchman. I think it is important that we remember the times these books were written.  Atticus remains my hero in both books.  It all made me wonder if Harper Lee really intended this book to be published.
if the "N" word offends you this is NOT the book for you.  Tedious.  Overwrought.  Tiresome.  At best it is a novella... or an overdone diatribe.  Makes me sad after all my high anticipation.  Thank goodness there was TKAM to redeem Ms. Harper.  I'm from Alabama and this novella makes me a bit embarrassed.
I got this book as a birthday gift.  I was not sure how I would feel about a book that everyone was saying had made Atticus a racist.  Thomas Wolf said it best. "You Can't Go Home Again." Jean Louise came home expecting to find the childhood home of Scout and since nothing and no one stands still she was hurt to find that the people she loved and worshiped were no longer there.  Had this book been published first we would not have understood her hurt and disappointment.  There would not have been a father who was her hero, and a vision of black life in the south through the eyes of an innocent like Scout.  The story of an adult child seeing a parent for the first time in a realistic way is better understood because of "To Kill A Mockingbird." I did not give it 5 stars because it felt incomplete.  Jem is dead and we don't know how or why.  He was a very essential part of the story and so you want to know what happened to him. This is not a stand alone book.  If you don't know TKAM, the story is just another story with no real purpose.
Considering ‘Go Set A Watchman’ was written more than half a century ago, there are many topics still relevant today; which in my opinion makes Harper Lee near genius for such timeless material.<br/><br/>GSAW is good as a stand-a-lone novel, with ‘To Kill A Mockingbird’ as the back story, it’s excellent.  Much in the same way the stage production of ‘Wicked’ is a great play; it’s even better knowing the story of ‘The Wizard of OZ’.<br/><br/>“Go, set a watchman, Let him declare what he sees.” – Isiah 21:6 (NKJV). As sure as time, history is repeating itself (page 197).
I expected a better novel.
I was very disappointed 😌
Good read, drags in spots.
Very goog and easy to read
Great for group discussion
Not relevant to our times.
This book disappointed me.
The book is disappointing.
Great writing, great story
Not as good as Mockingbird
I think it was Uncle Jack who said, "A novel must tell a story."  I could not agree with a statement more.  "Go Set a Watchman" did not tell a story. In fact, it seemed to be a bit of propaganda, supporting "Southern tradition" and the 10th Amendment, translated to "We are forward moving, holding on to the notion that African Americans are backwards, lacking understanding of the Constituion or anything else noble and worth living for."<br/><br/>This is far from the well written classic which it is either a prequel of a sequel.
Didn't put it down. I love reading her descriptions and her explanations of circumstances in life. She is a true author.
This was an amazing book. Even better than "To Kill a Mocking Bird."<br/>I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone!!
Like Mark Twain's "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," this novel has the power to tell the truth.  When Huck discovered "you can't pray a lie," he foretold what Harper Lee reveals to us about Atticus Finch, that he is a good man with human failings who understands more than many would like to believe, the truth about the South of decades ago as well as today.  This book takes away not one whit from the Atticus Finch of "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Rather it makes him more believable and more human.  Gregory Peck could play this Atticus to equal effect.
Not a very organized thought pattern. Ended abruptly. Can see why she went back to revisit just one time frame in TKAM.
Not up to the Mockingbird standard.  Harper Lee preaching.  Scout totally unbelievable in her interaction with Atticus.
It's not hard for me to  reconcile the Atticus of "Mockingbird" with the Atticus of "Watchman". My dad was born in 1914 and was very progressive for his generation.<br/>.  One day, I was actually shocked to find he drew the line at interracial marriage. This was well after "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner". I don't remember him raising an eyebrow at that. Anyway in this instance it was me interested in someone not of our race. He thought it was unfair to the children. Of course I saw that as a cop out, but I was too stunned to argue. That's how cool I thought he was and I didn't want to know how cool he wasn't.<br/>.  At length, I identified strongly with Jean Louise's world rocking revelation when she saw her venerable daddy's blind spot.<br/>.  I enjoyed this as much as "Mockingbird" not because it was as well written or as important but because there was a lot of humor ( considering the subject) and Identified with Scout growing up to find her world was never RIGHT  side up.
Not that impressed with this book. Just okay and I cringe writing that since I absolutely loved To Kill A Mockingbird.
I am not really sure how I feel about this one.  I finished it a week ago shaking my head and wondering what happened.
It brought back many memories from my childhood being raised in the south. It was very enteraining. Very well written.
Parts were very troubling
No To Kill a Mockingbird.
A very disappointing read
Pretty much disappointed.
It was worth the wait. 😉
I thought it was amazing!
So glad I read this book!
I will leave the technical reviews to others more learned and sophisticated about writing, and say simply that I loved the perspective of this book and that I think it happened as it should that Go Set a Watchman was published after To Kill a Mockingbird.  To those who complain about the iconic Atticus Finch having feet of clay after all, I'd simply say, grow up.  This is real life in the mid 20th century southern states and many other areas of the country.  Real life can be a big, messy, beautiful learning experience... If we are lucky!
I have mixed feelings about this book. Harper Lee can write, that's a fact. The three best parts for me were the childhood memories of African explorations, the Revival and the Falsies. They had a genuineness about them. I can't accept Atticus as a state's rights advocate. I don't think it rings true to his character. I am still weighing it all in my mind. I am not impressed at eliminating Jem from the story either, but he would never have joined the citizen's council. .Maybe in a few years we can sort it all out. Worth reading, though.
It brought a roiling feeling of familiar pain to my mind and then brought me around to the realization of the truth!
I was surprised by the this book because the plot was more multi-dimensional than the first.  More food for thought!
I was disappointed.  I expected it to be as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  Only because of the reviews.  It wasn't.
After all the hype watchman was a disappointment.  It was thought provoking but could have been written much better.
Just not up to snuff, when you compare it to To Kill a Mockingbird. It sort of felt like the book was not finished.
This is a story about a daughters separation struggle to become  more individual in adulthood from her adored father. Reality is  one dimensional for this young  woman.She is  very reactive and outspoken. .She has not  learned to contain feeling reactions and empathize with others, and express a  difference of opinion tactfully.  However the  situation is especially difficult  because she  is a  motherless  daughter and this is  a small Southern town set in its ways .It  seems to be  placed in the 50's..The racial  bigotry is still very strong but covered with shallow politeness.She  grows up racially color blind and angry about all  injustices toward woman or people of color.<br/>I was relieved when she  felt outrage about some things but  the  story gets  a bit tiresome after a while in my view.However she comes through and sees her father as a  loving  kind  principled  man again.The resolution of her dilemma is a bit rushed for my  judgement,but it  is still a good story.
This book is getting poor reviews and I don't understand why. First of all you can't forget that this book was written prior to the completion of To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is important to keep that in the back of your head throughout your reading experience. I can see why some people are disappointed by the change of character by Atticus, but if you read the actual novel you learn why this development took place, remember when we were taught by one Atticus Finch to step into the shoes of someone else before judging them? That applies to fictional characters too. Besides this aspect, the book was phenomenal. You delve deeper into Jean Louise' personal life, while reuniting with the characters we grew to love in To Kill a Mockingbird. I competed the novel in 3 days and it was absolutely one of the greatest reads I've had in a long time. Give it a chance before believing these unfavorable remarks made regarding it. Thank you Harper Collins publishing for releasing the book.
It was like putting on a pair of old shoes but going home is not the same.<br/>Too bad Harper hasn't written more
An enjoyable reading experience. Can't put down. Made me want to re-read To Kill A Mockingbird after so many years
Uh.  Just average. Plot was very superficial. You can almost skip to the second half of the book and miss nothing.
I was expecting more from this novel like a courtroom drama with a twist. The ending left something to be desired.
This is a true look at a small Southern town during the 1960's.  Scout is an adult home for a visit from NYC.  She is shocked at what she once thought was true, was just her childish fantasy.  It is heart breaking for her illusions to be shattered. I thought it was another insightful look at race relations then and applicable today.  I'm glad the manuscript was discovered and published.  Congratulations Nelle Harper Lee on another insightful book.  We are lucky to have been able to have read it.
Did not enjoy this book.  Would not rate it any better than fair.  Not in the same ballpark as Mockingbird.
I had just finished rereading To Kill A Mockingbird. This was great to read the "Rest of the Story"
Very thought provoking.
all a bit boring really
I couldn,t get into it.
Enjoyable and authentic
A different perspective
Great historic insight!
terribly disappointing.
I really wasn't a fan of the novel. I can't really explain why without going into spoilers.
It was not edited very well and tended to ramble in places. I was disappointed in the book.
It was enjoyable read. Different from the first book, but the characters seemed more human.
If you've always loved TKAM you'll read this no matter, but if you wish to keep loving that book, you'd be better skipping this one.<br/>It's not well written, preachy and really changes those characters you loved.
While not as poetic as To Kill a Mockingbird, this book was nuanced and thought provoking.
I quickly ordered "Watchman" during presale. I was completely ready to start reading the book when it arrived. As others have stated, this is very believably Harper Lee's first novel. Not bad, could definitely use some editing. I, as others have also stated, believe making a stand alone novel of a blip in "Watchman" allowed Harper Lee to fully expand her view in writing. One thing I heard, and I do hope it is true, is that an editor did not touch this novel (at least in recent years). This provided what I believed to be an very candid view of the South and the entire country during the turbulent beginnings of the civil rights movement. I believe "Watchman" showed many people wanting and supporting change, but in a manner differently from many accounts.
This read like a character development manuscript not a novel.  After 92 pages I gave up.
Reading the first 25 pages of this book made me feel as though I were sinking into an easy chair and reminiscing with a friend I hadn't been in touch with in years.  It felt like coming home, and for that I was grateful.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised at the revelation of Atticus Finch's actions, but the passages where he explains how he sees his world are startling and eye-opening.  I found plenty to think about, to question, to recognize from my own wonderings and to ponder for days afterward.<br/><br/>The revelations mixed with the recollections of childhood and teen days in Alabama made a great read for me.  Don't compare it to To Kill a Mockingbird--think of it as a To Kill a Mockingbird reunion.  And you honestly never know quite what you'll get at a reunion!
I thought it was a great read.  I was as disappointed as everyone else about the betrayal of values of a certain character, but I understood that his betrayal was the only betrayal readers of TKAM would truly feel as deeply as Scout did. It was the only effective way to get the message of the book across: "Go Set a Watchman," or set your own conscience, do not tether yours to anyone else by holding them up as being infallible because their conscience may not always be in line with yours. I loved the flashbacks and the character development throughout the book and found the internal dialogue/struggle very captivating.  The only critique I have is for the writing as a whole, but that's to be expected when you publish without allowing editors to work their magic.
Best read of my life!  So thought-provoking, and especially being published the summer that the Supreme Court undid the legislative efforts of the14 states still trying to recognize marrying according to its more traditional meaning.  Harper Lee's Jean Louise could walk off the page into today's talking head TV programs in which the folks whose view is in ascendency won't even listen to any expression of concern as to how some modicum of religious liberty can be upheld for dissenting wedding photographers or the like.  Think about those who, because they support the new thing, equate their thinking with the entirety of broad mindedness and so rule out any conflicting views or concerns.  And think then about what is bigotry, as Jean Louise must in the climactic scene.
I was a kid during this era, while not living in the south I lived in Utah that was segregated, then moved to Seattle' central district, that was not.  I hoped for a different ending because of how many of our attitudes have changed since then.  Since the author was old enough to be my parent I get her color blind; in their minds position.  As the song in South Pacific states " you have to carefully taught "  As long as there are humans, there will be prejudice, todays generation is much more open then mine and the authors, lets hope ( in our country anyway ) that it continues to improve. This is a good period piece which reflects the attitudes of the time.  I believe it should be on the must read and discussion list for high school literature.
On the plane yesterday, I finished the long-awaited second book from an author whose singular work shaped much of my world view. The below quote, spoke deeply into my own journey toward Wholeness, which of course centers on embracing both my and others' humanity--including those who I sometimes slip into casting as my enemy.<br/>“She saw her old enemy’s shoulders relax, and she watched him push his hat to the back of his head. “Let’s go home, Scout. It’s been a long day. Open the door for me.” She stepped aside to let him pass. She followed him to the car and watched him get laboriously into the front seat. As she welcomed him silently to the human race, the stab of discovery made her tremble a little. Somebody”<br/>― Harper Lee, Go Set a Watchman
I have not read other reviews and am not surprised that only about a third of the readers rated it very high (5*).<br/>I read Mockingbird a long time ago and did not re-read it prior to Watchman.<br/>The books stand apart and may be read separately, or in tandem, if one has not read either.<br/>Watchman is very human and attempts to tell the story of the beginnings of the 'new South' and the protagonist, Jean Louise, is a masterful creation.<br/>Atticus's downfall, if that is what it is, is sad.<br/>Jean Louise's coming of age and her words defending humanity, in her conversations with uncle Jack and Atticus, make the book worth reading.<br/>If you don't like the N-word, don't read the book. I don't, but read it anyway, and am gratified I did.
Very disappointing!
I was disappointed.
Fair read have read
Not what I expected
Nothing good to say
Very disappointing.
Did not care for it
Criticized quite extensively in the literary press for confusion and a sense of after-the-Lord-Mayor's-show, this is, rather, an excellent attempt at an adult novel, wrestling in a more realistic fashion with the complex topics affecting the US South in the twentieth century. Where "To Kill A Mockingbird" created a self-enclosed world where the issues were simplified into oppositional social forces, with an ending that was satisfactory, while refusing to be completely satisfying, this is an "open" narrative, that leaves the reader as wounded as is Scout, the protagonist, with the childhood illusions of TKAMB stretched and torn, but something more substantial, and ultimately braver and more ambitious, in their place.
After reading this book it left me wondering who wrote " to kill a mockingbird ?
I found it to be disappointing<br/>I didn't think there was much in it of substance
Enjoyable reading.  Scout as an adult is just as entertaining as she was as a child.
I think the book was too drawn-out; it took forever to get to the actual plot/issue.
Very well written. Several important lessons to be learned. Atticus is still my hero
Very disappointed with this over-hyped novel. Writing was juvenile as was the story.
Tension rises in a southern white family when a member living in New York decides to challenge southern customs in dealing with black people. Eventually through family pressure by a very savvy uncle her attitude toward their ways moderates. Being one of the family turns out to dominate.<br/>I think this is a very emotional and realistic situation which makes this a great book.
I have caught glimpses of many unflattering reviews about this book. About the questionable way it came to be published. About the "quality" of writing. And so on. I think it is a beautiful story about a young woman becoming her own person. I very much enjoyed the story and the way it made me consider varying ideas abouts the rights of individuals, bigotry, and reconstruction.
I love To Kill A Mockingbird,  obsessed really.  It is one of my favorite books of all time.  Go Set a Watchmen (GSAW) is not To Kill A Mockingbird (TKAM).  I knew it wouldn't be when I heard about it and pre-ordered it.  I enjoyed it, it will sit on my book shelf, and I will most likely read it again every once in a while.  However, I won't own 4 different copies of it like I do TKAM.  In TKAM the theme was a child's love for her father.  In GSAW her love is still there, she just has to grapple with her parent being different or choosing something different from herself...much like many of us do with our own parents.  We must stop positing the two books against each other, they are different, so what, it's ok that they are.
I enjoyed this look at Scout as an adult.  It seemed true to the time it portrayed.
No real plot that compared to her other book.  Totally different and disappointing.
A wonderful story of the south that adds depth & richness to the mockingbird story.
There is much discussion today of racism and where its beginnings lie. This is a mediocre novel, if you read for story-telling alone, and it hangs on knowing "To Kill a Mockingbird" with its varied cast of characters. But I find it an excellent treatise on race relations in the true South of years ago. More than a look at the complexities of a bi-racial history, it touches on the classism that exists even today with some of the distinctions of family history and crossing cultural lines that many folks outside the South fail to understand fully. Like Atticus Finch in this novel, racism and bigotry need to be broken open and have all the insides spilled out for us to better understand and correct on a human level.
It was wonderful to see a more complete look into Atticus Finch, and how one's perspective changes of people we know and love  from a six year old to a young adult of 22.  I thought it rounded out the people in this story.  We see our parents as such pillars when we are young and then as we grow up we see other aspects of them that may differ from our original perspective.
I confess that I found the story slow until 100 pages in, when it picked up a bit. I skipped many many pages to get to the end. I do believe the positive editorial reviews here on Amazon capture the essence of this book. It's a worthy story, worth telling and worth reading. The style and pace slogged, i.e. it was slow and heavy reading. But at the end, it packed a punch.
Was very skeptical about reading this book, from all the reviews. I enjoyed knowing what happened to the old characters I feel in love with from To Kill A Mockingbird. We all grow up and with it we look back and realize who we are because of the people who nurtured us and events that left there marks. This book put it all in  perspective, we are all just "human beings".
The story told here is timeless. As long as there is racism, there is a need for this story to be told. The characters I loved in To Kill a Mockingbird are still here and are still lovable despite their ingrained racism. Atticus remains as a calming and sensible presence. Scout is all grown up and still has the ideals of her childhood. It's part of who they are and part of who we are, whether or not we admit it. This book is needed, especially now, to show how it was and why such attitudes still exist. I hope the message is heard. We don't need to keep on with the old "traditions." We need to make new  ones and reading  this book should be a tradition. It may have been written first but its time has come.
Did not like the book.  Read about 1/3 and put it down.  Just was not interesting.
Lower class whites are to be segregated instead of blacks, who are mostly ignored.
Story line was ok.
Loved the book!!!!
Always good author
Too many conflicts
IT'S JUST OK.  JRH
I have been waiting my whole life for this follow up novel and didn't even know it. Incendiary. Traumatic coming of age story of a young women establishing and finding her own identity amidst the smoldering embers of an old south about to go up in flames slowly molting into a reborn Phoenix. I need to read To Kill a Mockingbird now.  Brilliant. Timely yet timeless.
They should've left Atticus and Scout as they were.<br/>This book wasn't needed.
Not even close to "To Kill a Mockingbird." I was definitely disappointed.
Despite some of the negative reviews, I wanted to read this novel. I loved To KIll a Mockingbird, but read this with reserve. Word of mouth was that Atticus Finch was a racist in this novel, which I found troubling, especially compared to him and kis high moral characted in TKAM. I won't give away any of the polt or themes. Though this book may not be 100% "politically correct" for 2015, I think it reflected the era in which it was written and I found the characters to be consistent with them in TKAM. This book is an easy read, but also thought provoking. I had my husband also read it and he thought it was excellent and that the "racist" comments weren't justified. Great book club choice!
I picked this book up during the week it was released.  Not sure what to expect, (I'd heard many warnings) I dove into it.  I found many of the side stories charming and enjoyable in and of themselves.  I was also fascinated by the main focus of the book,  which I believe is the universal tendency of humans toward frailty.  In To Kill a Mockingbird Harper Lee created an illusion of perfection surrounding Atticus Finch.  Here she plays the reluctant iconoclast,  revealing that TKAM was truly the perspective of a young girl growing up with a fantastic father whom she mistook to be a perfect man.  I loved the way that this book dealt with the reality of the realization that good is a long way from perfect.
Easy reading. Could feel what it was like to live in the South during the 50's
Beautiful, why haven't we seen this before now! Excellent writing, obviously!
After reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" this was a huge disappointment!
I felt I was reading a rough draft or an unfinished book.  Very disappointed.
Very disappointing.  Dialog is awkward.
very little drama
Not a great book.
Disappointing....
Interesting read.
I love Harper lee
Ok. But not great
thought provoking
very dissapointed
so disappointing.
Very good reading
Easy read. So-so.
Thought provoking
Thought provoking
Interesting views
Lost me at points
the wife loves it
A little slow at first but gets better, interesting thoughts on segregation.
Could sum up the whole meaning of book in 2 short sentences. Not a favorite.
I wasn't sure whether to give Watchman 4--or 3--stars.  Parts of this story were elegantly written, while other parts seemed a bit clumsy.  It was a thoughtful book about racism and paternalism in the South in the 1950's, yet I felt Scout gave up some of her principles at the end.  The ending was open to interpretation, so other readers might argue that she chose to live up to her principles.<br/><br/>This is not as good a book as To Kill A Mockingbird, but neither was it a waste of time to read.  We tend to think of coming of age stories as being about adolescents, however Scout was still coming to terms with societal issues in her mid-20's, as many of us did.
Absolutely nothing like To Kill a Mockingbird. I also can't imagine that this was written first as there are many references to events in To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was very racist and disturbing with not much of a plot. Even poorer and  less fortunate whites were referred to in derogatory terms. Don't waste your time on this book.
Having heard the pre-release moans and groans over Atticus Finch's true character, I found the novel to be more about a young woman "growing up" and seeing the reality of the world around her. Those who say this book absolutely ruined To Kill a Mockingbird for them, I'd have to say they had not read this book with an open mind.
A moment of American history, the early sixties, is captured brilliantly in Go Set a Watchman. As preposterous as Atticus thinks it is that Zeebo could become an elected official, we all know it happened and are indignant that Hank was taken under wing and mentored. They both should have been and Atticus should have known it and all the rest of the 20/20 vision that is so easy in hindsight.<br/><br/>Novel is written in a local time and place vernacular which readers won't all be familiar with. It is very funny. Scout can't be elected because she has been seen naked too many times but behind the scenes she represents an important subsection of the times.
Very slow and not that inspiring. I couldn't keep interested. Sorry Harper!
waiting for a story to develop..never happened....a lot of hype for nothing
I'm glad I reread To Kill a Mockingbird before reading this book or I might have put it aside after a few pages.  Don't make judgement until you've finished every page.  This book was written in the late 50s - early 60s at a different time, but Harper Lee had an amazing understanding of the lives and politics of the South at the time.
loved TKAM but did not like this book.
Yes, Harper Lee has a superb gift of the English language and great literary knowledge. I adored "Mockingbird" and waited with bated breath for the release of "Watchman" which I pre-ordered as soon as the option was available. BUT.....Now I understand why people asked Ms. Lee over and over "are you sure you are consenting to have this published?" Her writing is still vivid and colourful and emotive, with a gorgeous turn of phrase; this is, however, obviously the work of Ms. Lee in her younger years (she still rambled terribly and needed a good concise editor). That being said, I still would have enjoyed the book.....the rambling isn't the point. The point is.....I GET THAT PEOPLE IN THE FIFTIES/EARLY SIXTIES WE NOT EDUCATED ABOUT EQUALITY. I GET THAT PEOPLE USED TERRIBLE PHRASES AND HAD AWFUL IDEAS ABOUT "THE OTHER." BUT IS THIS A GOOD TIME TO BE PUTTING THAT OUT THERE?????? The things that characters in the book said about people of colour were truly cringe-producing, and I had horrible visions of Dylann Roof in my head. Finally, my heart broke when I became disillusioned in Atticus Finch. I felt like I had become disappointed in a flesh and blood person whom I had looked up to always. It was painful enough to make me wish for that hackneyed old ploy of authors who regret their own plots and characters---I wish Jean Louise "Scout" would wake up in the train as it's pulling into Maycomb and realize that it's all a terrible dream.
I can see what I imagine the editors saw in this book which aided Ms. Lee in crafting the changes that produced "To Kill a Mockingbird." There are some good stories within the stories, and the depiction of the South in those days is accurate and heartbreaking. To try and hype the book by calling Atticus racist is pretty low. We were all racist and had to learn together from within how to cope with the new world in which we found ourselves. The father-daughter relationship was powerful and dynamically important. Sad that Scout resorted to rants, but she got where she needed to get in the end.Not a particularly enjoyable book, but I am glad I read it.
Huge disappointment
It read like a rough draft.<br/>When I finished it, I was still confused.
Atticus is a man of his time period but one with hope for change/humanity.
This is a weird review since I was so looking forward to the book but I honestly don't know or can't say if I liked it or not. It was pretty predictable, and none of the characters, even those we have known and loved for decades, were even remotely likable. I think just about every person on the planet thought Atticus was the closest thing to perfect in our minds. That being said, the book elicited a physical response from me: I felt Scout's betrayal and disappointment when she found out that Atticus was not a perfect man. Even if I'm not crazy about aspects of a book, if it can get a visceral reaction out of me like that, then it IS a good book.
Very well written and very interesting sequel to To Kill A Mocking Bird.  The only parts I did not like were the long drawn out explanations of the beginnings of the civil rights movements.  These parts were very well written, but not interesting to me.  I lived through those times and have had my fill.  I thought the story ended rather abruptly and to my sorrow.  The characters are protrayed very well, TKAM children grown up and going their own ways.  This review is my personal view, however, I highly recommend this book, especially if you ever read TKAM or saw the movie.  Harper Lee is a brilliant writer and I wish she had written more books.
I understand the idea of this book. To Kill a Mockingbird it isn't, neither was it meant to be. It's the adult section of the original TKAM, and therefore, a letdown for most readers, I think. That's clear.<br/>Flannery O'Connor, in her letters, called it a children's book, and in a very real sense, she was right. In contrast, Go Set a Watchman is very much an adult book because of its realistic stance and its portrait of Atticus -- our knight in white. The fairy tale is over and it's 20 years later. Realistic but a dull read, I'm afraid. Too much talk. Not enough action -- even mild-mannered action. I hate to say this. I so wanted to love it.
In Go Set a Watchman, we meet Jean Louise, the 8 year old "Scout" we knew and loved in To Kill a Mockingbird, as a young woman with a successful career in New York. When she returns to her home in Alabama to vacation with her aging father, Atticus, she sees him and the people in the community through her eyes as adult. Her Uncle Jack, a wise, but rather eccentric country doctor, guides her through the journey of reconciling her previous childlike perception of her father with one that is, in-truth, more real. Jean Louise learns that every man's "watchman" is his own conscience.  There is no such thing as collective conscience.
Harper Lee is now 89 years old.  This is NOT a sequel, it is the work she was writing when as a young woman she was re-directed by her publishers to change it to what became TKAMB .  It is what it is because it was put aside.  It is not a newly written 'novel'.  Some confused detractors would benefit by reading about Ms. Lee on Wikipedia at the very least.  I grew up in the South during the 1950s and most of the 1960s and I can tell you it was a very unsettled era.<br/><br/>I'm sorry this was brought out now.  I don't believe Ms. Lee was aware it would be published.  I don't think doing this to her will help her legacy in any way.  Too sad.
The publication of GSAW is just the most shameful act of exploitation of Lee's legacy by both Harper Collins and her supposed 'friend' and lawyer.  Do we honestly believe Lee wanted this draft of a novel published despite maintaining her literary silence for 55 years? I think not.  Disgraceful!<br/><br/>http://wp.me/p6keYm-o
It is obvious why this book was not published during the height of TKAM popularity; it is poorly written on too many levels.  It appears that that HL did not have the years of scrubbing that an excellent editor can provide and which is evident with TKAM.  Unlike TKAM, which is worth re-reading, this one I will chose to forget.
I was disappointed. Not only the subject matter but the disjointed prose.
I am about fifteen percent into this book and do not intend to read any further...Boring  does not begin to describe it...I wish to have a refund  peg92bruce@aol.com
Without giving too much away, let's just say Scout is a fully grown independent women living the dream in Manhattan who goes home to help care for Atticus, her now elderly father. This is a book of many layers, what our preconceived notions of our parents, childhood friends and even beloved former caregivers are, especially in the deep south of the early 1960's when people of color still had to watch their every move and avert their eyes to the white population in self-defense against a racist society.<br/>A marvelous read, much overdue. I couldn't put it down and was a bit sad when it ended. (A really great book always does that to me)
I completely enjoyed Harper Lee's original book. I loved seeing the woman Scout had become. She, just like myself, had an idealized view of her childhood and the people she grew up with.  Sometimes we do tend to put those adults we admire up on a pedestal, when in reality, they are just doing the best they can like everyone else.  Atticus is true to his nature and handles Jean Louise with a calm and steady approach, just like he always has.  Getting to hear how the characters from To Kill A Mockingbird have been doing all this time was a treat.  I loved this book.  I was excited to read another Harper Lee book & this did not disappoint.
It's hard to believe that this was the first work of Harper Lee.  I can definitely see why her publisher was interested in Scout as a child.  There are some unanswered questions about her relationship with her father growing up, although Ms. Lee does a nice job of glancing backwards to Scout and Gem's childhood.  If you are looking for a plot driven book, this isn't it.  This is all character driven and I would include the town as part of that.  She makes me want to re-read "To Kill a Mockingbird" again, not because I long for that book over this one, but because this book makes me want to understand her childhood more as well.
I read the book in one day & enjoyed it but not as much as to Kill a Mockingbird. However question that this was written in the time before Killing...<br/>Two things that I question:<br/>The reference to a sale tax. I don't believe anybody had a sale tax in the 1940's.<br/>When they cranked up the baskets for the senior dance. In the 40's & 50's the baskets in high school, especially in small rural areas, were affixed to the walls of the gym & couldn't be raised. I grew up in the time & played basket in a high school gym similar to the setting of the novel.<br/>I understand but not agree with Atticus position because of the time.
I wanted to read the book because I always loved "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I always liked the character "Scout".  It really didn't say what happened to her brother, Jem though except that he had died.  I particularly liked the scene where Scout fights with Atticus and they really have it out.  She is really mad and ready to leave Maycomb forever but doesn't because she talks to her Uncle Jack and has a change of heart.  She feels bad for all the bad things she said and name calling she called Atticus.  Atticus did tell her he still loved her.  I think she will stay in Maycomb and live there until her family passes.
I find it hard to believe it is the same author as To Kill A Mockingbird
this is a fine book. Atticus Finch is fiction and belongs to Harper Lee. She can do whatever she wanted with him.<br/>Kids see their parents differently as adults as opposed to when they were kids. Atticus Finch was a product of his times.<br/>Remember Sam Ervin the hero of Watergate was an ardent foe of civil rights.
Go Set a Watchman was wonderful. Before reading it I reread To Kill A Mockingbird and enjoyed it so much I was hesitant to read Go Set a Watchman. I had heard some stories that Harper Lee did not actually write To Kill A Mockingbird and I was worried I'd be disappointed. Well I feel certain both books were written by Harper Lee. I grew up in the south during the 50's and 60's and I understand why the editor did not want to publish Go Set a Watchman and asked Harper Lee to go back to when the children were young. I don't think that Go Set A Watchman would have been as well received. I am so happy that the story has now been told.
Did not like it!
Slow, slow, slow
A disappointment
Loved this book.
So disappointing
So disappointing
Not my favorite!
Enjoy this book.
Excellent story.
Bought as a gift
All the hype that preceded its release led me to expect more substance.
excellent perspective...but a difficult book to publish when written...
Excellent read.  No disappointments.  Ms. Lee maintained her standards.
I found it interesting that in to Kill A Mockingbird, you saw Atticus and this small town through the eyes of a white, innocent child, and in Go Set a Watchman, you see the same person and town through the eyes of an educated woman who had been influenced by a  progressive urban setting.  I felt Scout was unfairly critical of Atticus.  With all her education, Scout didn't understand what it took for her father to represent  the black defendant.  She felt he was continuing to carry on the town's same old values and customs without understanding some of the changes that might come that the town's people didn't want to see.
With the start of the book I thought no wonder 'To kill a mockingbird' was the better story because this story seemed tame. But when Jean Louise exploded with her enlightened opinions of her father and life in the place she grew up after her life in New York, I was blown away. Harper Lee is profound in her writing.
This book was written before TKM and wasn't published until recently because some of the family thought it made Atticus look bad.  Well, it did and it didn't; Atticus was a man of his times in many ways and the family didn't want it published.  Whoever it was died recently so the author published it.  TKM was written from the point of view of a 10 year old; this book was written by a twenty-something woman who had live in NYC for several years so naturally it was from a different experience.  I recommend this  book ; it was well written and I'm sure it will be better received now than it would have been in the sixties.
I prepared myself by reading To Kill a Mockingbird - which I am glad I did as it took back into this world. I love this book-truly a gift. I could not put it down - I was born in a small town in S W Georgia in 1954 and she brings us brilliantly into that era of growing up in the South. Thank you<br/>Martin Cowart
Harper Lees, Go Set a Watchman doesn’t come close to reaching the literary heights of TKAM. But it’s left me thinking, inwardly debating about so many decisions made in the world.<br/><br/>Many people it appears have been left disappointed to their own hear-says of this book, but if you read it with an open mind (and try not to compare it too much to TKAM) I think you’ll be surprised. It was a wonderful story, filled with a range of ideas and opinions that are great to sink your teeth into.<br/><br/>"Prejudice,a dirty word and faith a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends."
A sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee moves forward 20 years as she develops chosen characters fully.  Many of her most intriguing characters were conspicuously and sadly omitted.  Driven by deep spirituality and conviction, Harper Lee brings the reader into this era of extreme racial tension to a point where it is palpable.  Some biblical diversions, familial and geographical descriptions were a bit too wordy.  Overall, I enjoyed the book, but certainly not as much a its predecessor.  A worthwhile read, especially under the circumstances in which the manuscript was found many years after the author's death.
DID NOT LIKE TOO MUCH. Almost like a documentary. Interesting, though.
Very worthwhile read.  Definitely of interest to any Mockingbird fans.
Well it was ok. I expected to be a little different,  but it was okay.
Amazing author for the time period. I wish she would write more books!
Good. It's natural to compare it to the original Mockingbird. But literally is quite different. Like watching a sequel to The Wizard of Oz, or Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, this book will never be as wonderful as the original. But it is not without merit. Though the characters are similar, they are twenty-six years older, and different of mind and sensibilities. For all intents and purposes, they are different characters. Took a while for the story to unfold, could have used a little more wrap up at the end, but the "working out"  of the main conflict was interesting, relevant and insightful. A good read.
I'm not one of the many people that have read and reread To Kill a Mockingbird a hundred time; I read it once in high school. So I can't say how well Watchman relates to Mockingbird. However, I liked the nostalgic tone of the book and the style of writing. The characters felt very much a part of the world they were set in. I wasn't overly fond of the political aspect, but it wasn't a huge deterrent.<br/><br/>I listened to the audio version and I think Reese Witherspoon did an good job narrating. She captured the nostalgic tone of the book wonderfully, but some of her characters started to sound the same.
Was very disappointed - after the marvellous To Kill A Mockingbird!!!
Go Set A Watchman; is one book I could not put down.  Loved the book!
I loved it. It was so great to go back to Maycomb County for a while.
Very slow moving and very repetitive. Would not recommend to friends.
Seems like edits from To Kill A Mockingbird or a rough draft of sorts
While to "Kill A Mockingbird" was warm and fuzzy and I love the characters, this book is so true.  I think this book leaves us with so much to think about.  If most of us are honest there is a little of Atticus in us, especially if we lived through those times.  So thank you Harper Lee for making remember.
This is an entertaining quick read that defines the culture of the small-town Deep South after WWII. I thoroughly enjoyed the conversational  tone in which much of the narrative was written. Scout's unspoken conversations with herself about some of the awkward situations she is encountering are priceless.
I loved To Kill a Mockingbird and thought that this would be awesome. It is by far the worst book I have ever finished reading and I still hated it. I kept thinking that it would pick up but it never did. It was just all over the place and never went anywhere. Please don't waste your money on this book!!
I never thought that I would read another book by Harper Lee. That in itself was a thrill!  To Kill A Mockinbird is still my favorite novel.  I see some negative reviews. I have to disagree, much as Scout disagrees with her dad in the book.  This book was written in the mid 50s and if you watch the news, it is so relevant to our times today.  I loved revisiting the characters in Mockingbird. Some of Scout's memories are laugh out loud memories. You have to remember this book was written in the 50s and put yourself in that period of time. There is a meaning to this story for all, "your conscience" is a driving force in your life.  Harper Lee is a very wise woman.
I found this novel to be a captivating read, but a difficult one to think through. With all the hype about Harper Lee's age and her wish (was it forced?) to see this book made public, I can't evaluate it with the usual critical metrics. Will 'Go Set a Watchman' become part of the Southern literary canon? Surely, yes, just as every last work of Ernest Hemingway and Mark Twain has found its path to market.  Is it a truly great book?  No, I can't bestow on it a fifth star. Perhaps the patina of a few decades more will help deliver this novel to high school classrooms and the bucket list of must-reads.
Well written narrative, engrossing story.  Preferred to Mockingbird.
Really enjoyed. Could not put this down. Became part of their lives.
Good to get reacquainted with characters from To Kill A Mockingbird.
was disappointed in the book, nowhere near as good as the first book
Enjoyable book, but not nearly the quality of "Mockingbird".
In this sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, Scout returns to Maycomb in what appears to be the late 50s or early 60s to find everything changed for the worse.  Racism is rampant, as the locals declare war on the NAACP and what they see as its interference with local matters, including her father Atticus, whom she used to revere.  Her relationship with the black nanny who raised her has become cold and distant.  The book's sense of loss is tempered with her funny and endearing memories of growing up in Maycomb.  Ultimately, she must learn to accept her father's--and her hometown's flawed humanity.
Wish it had gone beyond a racist anecdote of Southern conservatism.
Fairly tedious.  Original publishers were right in turning it down.
Nice work to "come out of hiding" after all of these years.
Explains a lot to those not understanding the old south and racism.
Harper Lee didn't disappoint. I've been waiting for this for years!
It was a bit slow in the beginning but built up in the second half.
Couldn't finish
Ended abruptly.
very disjoined!
Loved the book.
not a good book
I expected more
Excellent read.
An apologia for southern racism and "state's rights" wrapped in sentimentalism about white "gentility and how life used to be." Very disappointing.
Great to read a book that was never supposed to be published.  After reading it I can see why there was a second "draft" that became To Kill a Mockingbird.  I thoroughly enjoy the book, but there was no building of a plot like in Mockingbird.  This time Scout is 26 years old and has returned to  her hometown only to find she is now looking at it from a 26 y/o woman's perspective.  When she was younger, Atticus could do no wrong.  Things have changed.  I like to think of it from the perspective, that she discovers there is no Santa Clause, Toothfairy or Easter Bunny in Macomb.
I have read a lot of reviews about this book - some of them full of outrage and condemnation.  What I would urge everyone who reads this to understand is that it is a period piece - the language and thoughts are true-to-life for a Southern town at that particular point in time.  It's what people knew and how people were.  It does not reflect today's feelings, attitudes, or language.  Harper Lee is such a gifted writer.  I just re-read To Kill a Mockingbird for about the fifth time and her writing and ability to capture that specific time period is amazingly accurate and true to life.
think it was published just for the money.  It does nothing for mr
blah, blah, blah compared to To Kill a Mocking Bird.  disappointed
Interesting but I can't say I would recommend it.  I can see why her publicist, upon reading it, made the recommendation to rewrite it through the eyes of the eight year old Scout.  The first third is tedious and uneventful and when a conflict actually appears, the resulting development and "resolution" is at worst confusing and at best unsatisfying.  Since I don't want to spoil it for those who plan to read it, I won't say why I felt it so.  I guess if you're curious to read another work by the author of such a brilliant and iconic classic, just lower your expectations.
Wish I.had listened to more of the reviewers more closely...awful.  waste of money.  Left readers up.I the air about anything that was to.follow.
Sequels often disappoint. That Atticus Finch is no longer heroic as he was in the masterful 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' should not be the sole reason for disparaging 'Watchman.' If you want to learn more about the Finch family and being 'Finch' in Alabama, you will find this novel fascinating. That Scout has grown into a bitter, unlovable (although not unloved) woman may be surprising. The book looks at class and race in the old South with unflinching examination. The books challenges Northern assumptions about the South. Perhaps you have to live there to understand its premises.
This book is almost prophetic.  Mrs Harper Lee's insight made this book come alive.  I'm amazed how timely it is with the state of racial unrest in America  today.  Hopefully, those t that read it will have a greater understanding and appreciation for Southerners and our sense of heritage.
I read this book only because I thought it would be interesting to see how Harper Lee developed the classic and perfect book, To Kill a Mockingbird. You can see the seeds that would develop into Mockingbird. It was also interesting to visit the characters at a different point in their lives. It clearly is not polished and did not go through reworking with an editor's eye. We can be thankful that her editor suggested she go back to a summer when Scout and Jem were still children. Happy to have read it, certainly not the same caliber as Mockingbird but interesting nonetheless.
I had to force myself to finish and the ending just sort of quit.
Loved it as much as "To Kill a Mockingbird", if not more!
My wife read this and was disappointed.  She said it did not come close to To Kill a Mockingbird. It just didn't have the writing quality. I have only read a part of the book.  The second paragraph of the book says the pilot on a plane flew through a tornado.  Silly fiction, I thought.
The book was very readable and everyone I talked to enjoyed it.
Very Disappointing!  This is a boring read and none of the characters are like able.  The first editor's advice was good to not publish and it does an injustice to the great book "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Shame on the publishers for caring about money more than quality.
review ** spoiler alert ** I loved it! First of all, I know some are shocked and are shouting about Atticus being a racist. Relax people. Let's remember this was written BEFORE To Kill A Mockingbird. She was developing her characters. But that being said, I have never read a better factual description of those times anywhere. I was born in the Deep South in the late 1950's. I understand these people. My generation was the first to experience integration. I am so thankful for that. I'm a much better person for it. Scout is a much better person for it. That's the lesson here. Harper Lee presents life in her Alabama as it was then. You can't look at it under our ridiculous age of polical correctness and rewriting of history. Atticus is still principled but is a product of that time. Was his way right? Maybe not for us as we look back. But he raised a child who became a force for what was right. Don't look at this book any way except as an expose' of that time and place. And then appreciate where she took Atticus from there. And appreciate where I came from and how far my children grew past me. Put aside your political moral indignation and appreciate the truth of this book, it's time and place.
I feel so disconnected from the voices of the characters in this novel. Atticus Finch especially. It's hard to believe 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is written by the same author. The vapidness of this story almost diminishes 'TKAM's' importance in literature. Very disappointing.
Loved this book. Harper Lee actually wrote this before she wrote To Kill A Mockingbird. It was interesting to see how Scout turned out and to follow Atticus in his later years. Ms. Lee is dead on with her interpretation of the south and segregation. I found her portrayal of how the south handled segregation and their reasoning for doing so interesting. What I mean is considering this was written so long ago she was ahead of her time in understanding the ramifications of the north forcing integration on the south, and it's subsequent ramifications.
As a lover of To Kill a Mockingbird, I enjoyed learning the origins of our favorite characters. Although this book is placed a couple of decades following TKaM, Harper Lee first conceived her characters in this book. It was very interesting to look at how she envisioned Scout's childhood and how she polished the characters to be more meaningful in her second creation. It is no wonder than she wanted to keep this book buried, because it ultimately will always remain a draft, but I'm glad to have read it and I encourage readers to keep an open mind.
This book is a perfect example how a wonderful editor can guide an author on how to take a diamond in the rough and turn it into a real gem (To Kill A Mockingbird).  This book has some wonderful bits and passages.  It shows that Harper Lee was indeed a treasure as a writer and had she written more would have surely turned out more classics.  That said, this book reads more like first draft than a well edited work.<br/><br/>Even though the book as a whole is lacking, I'm still very glad I purchased it because some sections were utterly fantastic.
The dialogue is very dated. Not what I expected. Disappointed.
I see why Harper Lee did not want to publish this first novel.
Interesting. Different time, different feel, but well written.
A wonderful look back to a time and place that few of us knew.
having trouble getting into the book. Like Mockingbird better.
Very disappointing. To Kill A Mockingbird was her best effort.
Very good read. Keeping in mind Harper Lee wrote this book before "To Kill A Mockingbird," it is great to see how Scout had grown up and how her views on life, relationships and family had developed. It makes you rethink the definition of bigotry and cements the belief in the actual fairness and belief in the law Atticus lives by. It reminds us how life and community relations can change in less than one generation. One must remember the time this book was written and do not judge it, and the descriptive verbage used by today's standards.
I found this story to be compelling and incredibly relatable. It is important to be able to recognize both the values we share in other people as well as where our thoughts and beliefs do not align, and Go Set a Watchman follows that identity struggle. I love thatI happened to have had similar experiences with cognitive dissonance before reading this book, though I wonder what it would have been like to read this as a 15 year old, before going through major identity changes. Well written, easy to read straight through, and very thought-provoking!
A novel one would never expect as a follow up to "To Kill a Mockingbird".<br/>The only way to read this novel is to try and forget the other. Of course, this can't be achieved. As a novel standing alone, it read slow, the reader taken back in time, to a small southern town about to blow from the ever present under current of the times. A complete 180 of Atticus, the man long cherished, and well loved, who is nearly unrecognizable until the end. The reader waits, impatiently until the end to see sparks of the beloved hero .  Well worth the wait.
This is a beautifully written book. It is the story of a coming of age, in which an adult transitions from parent hero worship into the reality that we are all human. Atticus is a brilliantly developed character that continues his development from To Kill a Mocking Bird. Scout evolves and is even more interesting because of her growth. The story accurately captures a time of great social change and the reasoned responses of intelligent people. The use of language is wonderful. It needed to be brought to the light of day and is a wonderful read.
Excellent.  It is readily apparent from reading it that this was indeed Ms. Lee's first draft of what eventually became "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Same theme of racial injustice, and even a reference to Atticus' legal case at the center of "Mockingbird."  You get more character development for Scout and are introduced to others who were not prominent features (if they appeared at all) in "Mockingbird."  Several hilarious scenes from mishaps in Scout's youth.  Very satisfying read.  Makes you wish Ms. Lee had written more.
Didn't like it
Enjoyable read
Great story - but seems as though it was published unedited -
It did not have the impact I expected, but is relevant today.
Good thing i had read "To Kill A Mocking Bird" first.
an different perspective from a grown up child to her father.
I thought this was a thought provoking read.  Excellent read.
It was as good as TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD. Ending was hurried.
Tedious, wordy & disappointing
This sums up the book for me:  "Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common:  they both begin where reason ends."  I find this funny to say - it was a simpler time.  Was it really?  I enjoyed revisiting these characters, to see how Jean Louise has matured.  She does find out her beloved father is a Segregationist which is a dirty word but she must also have faith that her father, as always, will do what is right and just.  I did enjoy the book but it certainly was no "To Kill a Mockingbird".
I really thoroughly enjoyed this book, but I really didn't read it. More, I digested it in little bits. I wanted to hate Atticus, but at the same time one has to try to realize the time frame this was all happening in .Very well written, the same lilts and jolts as in "To Kill A Mockingbird." As well as a few extra things thrown in. Unlike some, I found this to be truly enjoyable and well worth the little effort (if you can even call it "effort,") to read. Very happy I purchased it, and happier that I got right into it.
There has been much discussion about the feeling by many that this book casts Atticus as a bigot.  I don't believe this is true, rather it is revealed that he is still honest and honorable, but he is prejudiced about black people.  This book is much more profound, I believe, than To Kill a Mockingbird.  I read the latter just before the new book and found what I believe is one continuity error, but otherwise it flows well from the first (published).  I'd really like to read about what happens to Jean Louise (Scout) after the new book.
Brilliant Books in Traverse City, Michigan, has said that its “dozens” of customers for Go Set a Watchman are owed “refunds and apologies” over the way the novel has been presented. “It is disappointing and frankly shameful to see our noble industry parade and celebrate this as ‘Harper Lee’s New Novel’,” the bookseller writes on its website. “This is pure exploitation of both literary fans and a beloved American classic (which we hope has not been irrevocably tainted)."  I totally agree!  Would love to see Amazon adopt the same policy regarding this so-called book.
I enjoyed reading more about Scout Finch and Atticus, two of my favorite literary characters. Their personalities match perfectly with To Kill A Mockingbird. The book looks deeper into their characters and shows a more complicated side of Atticus. Although I am grateful that this book was discovered and shared with world, it feels like an unfinished book. It either needed to go through a few more revisions, or was better suited as a short story. Either way though, in spirit it stayed true to the characters in To Kill A Mockingbird.
Interesting twist on To Kill a Mockingbird. Lessons learned!
Beautifully written. Not a classic but throughly enjoyed it.
Not a complete work and poor reflection on a literary legacy
Did not appreciate the way the author destroy the characters
I reread To Kill A Mockingbird and felt it was equally good.
the to kill a mockingbird was better but this was also good.
Did not compare with To Kill a Mockingbird, but a must read.
The book was not in the same league as To Kill a Mockingbird
I enjoyed this, despite all the hype and negative reviews .
Love this book!  I am reading it again (which I rarely do).
I enjoyed the sequel to Mockingbird<br/>Highly recommended
A great read.  I enjoyed it as I did To Kill A Mockingbird.
It definitely evinces the style and world of Lee's Mockingbird, but I question the necessity of the book at all. Also, it cannot stand alone-you have to know Mockingbird to understand this text. I can see why it was rejected by publishers her first go around
This book was pure torture for me!  Only read it because someone gave it to me, I prefer to remember Atticus as the good and righteous man he was in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Sad to think that people were actually so narrow minded, I found it very disturbing!
I was thrilled another novel by Harper Lee was coming out, that I pre-ordered this. Then came all of the terrible reviews once it was released, and I didn't even want to read the book. Finally I did and I loved it! Sure, it may burst a little bit of a bubble about Atticus Finch, but it's real- the complexity of racism and living in the South, the complexity of growing up and learning about the weaknesses (and strengths) of your parents. It wasn't as well polished as To Kill a Mockingbird, but it has as much heart.
Fabulous book!  A must read for fans of her previous book!
It was a struggle to read it. Don't bother. Needs editing.
Interesting look into the past, not up to her other novel.
I loved this.  A worthy companion to To Kill a Mockingbird
The timeliness of the racial issues is quite remarkable when one considers today’s state of affairs in our country. The book is well written. It would certainly be marvelous as a theatrical production. I'm sorry there will not be another Harper Lee book.
I loved this book - basically because it's set in Alabama, where I grew up.<br/><br/>I thought the writing was really evocative of the era then - 1950's Jim Crow south.  Not a great time in our nation's history.  I really identified with her because I also left Alabama to try to make my fame and fortune in Manhattan.  It's the truth, no matter how many people say that it's full of racism.  That's the way it was then, and I'm still thinking that it hasn't changed much.  Outwardly maybe, but inwardly, notsomuch.
I love it because it is Ms. Harper Lee's book. I wish Atticus wasn't what he is now. I wonder since this book was penned first if Ms. Lee made Atticus so lovable in TKAM because of how this GSAW book was treated and not published. Maybe she felt she had to make Atticus a hero in the next book. I have mixed feelings and admit I haven't finished it yet. I wish Ms. Lee would consent to discussing this book with someone well trusted like Mr. Charlie Rose. I would think a lot of questions could be answered politely.
Good read, and I didn't think Atticus deserved the bad rap he's been getting in the press. I happen to like to 10th Amendment and a lot of what Atticus says makes sense, even though it's not PC today in the post-civil rights era. However, I do see how someone could get the wrong impression, as did Scout, if they stopped reading at a certain point in the book. The reasons for Atticus's actions are spelled out later. It's not on par with To Kill a Mockingbird, but still a good story and a thought-provoking read.
I really enjoyed this novel. While Mockingbird is a better, more complex story, Watchman put polish on a few of the characters. It showed us that people are complex, even people we've known our whole lives. I think many people have certain feelings about Mockingbird and can't reconcile how they feel about the other facets of these beloved characters. I love them, warts and all. It was an enjoyable read where I got to hang out with old friends again. My only criticism is that I wish it could have been longer.
Takes the reader on a remarkable, soul-searching journey.
horrid waste of time....re-read TKaM then watch the movie
Too preachy !  No wonder no one would publish it earlier.
I was a little worried to start this book after hearing all of the reviews and pre-publication publicity. I almost didn't read it but decided to give it a try. You could tell this was Harper Lee's first attempt at a novel, it was a little clunky in some points but overall the theme of Scout as a woman going back to her hometown was conveyed well. Without giving too much of the plot away I encourage anyone who is on the fence about reading this to give it a try and form your own opinions, I am glad I did.

Having grown up in the South and moved to the North, I read this book on a recent trip back home. As I talked with old friends and parents, I can say that many of the current social issues of our time closely track the book. Also, the wonderful characters in the book are so recognizable to me. The book is not about whether or not Atticus is a racist. It is about the complexity of the time, and the South, as well as the destruction of our heroes. I just wish our media did nuance rather than sound bite.
I now understand why Lee was asked to re-write this version and then later produced To Kill a Mockingbird. TKMB is much better than this novel. This novel has some "okay" sections; however, I found it rather disappointing. Your favorite characters from TKMB are very different in some cases, mostly Atticus, and some are even missing! I am an English teacher and plan on only using some sections to teach the theme of  loss of innocence and compare how this theme differs between the two novels.
This book has gotten a wide range of negative reviews from a clumsy first novel to disappointing.  But it's worth reading and reflecting on the amazing process of revision and the brilliance of Lee's editor who told her she could do better by focusing on Scout...other editors might have made what's here into an OK novel that spoke to a certain time and place rather than asking for the hard work of rewriting to create the masterpiece Lee eventually wrote with a message of timeless appeal and beauty
After To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee deceives greatly
Made me love Harper Lee even more. Great book and twist.
Loved the book. Well written. Thought it ended abruptly.
I loved the book...could not put it down until finished.
Loved the writing style, but the story slowed dramatically after the first few chapters until Jean Louise watched her father at the citizens committee meeting.  Then the pace picked up again.  The vocabulary, sentence construction, etc. are excellent, although the conversations with her Uncle Jack can be a bit difficult to follow since I wasn't always sure who was speaking.  But that may just be me.  Once I got through the middle of the book, I loved it again.  I would recommend it to a friend.
Definitely a first draft, the book could use some serious editing. I was quite distressed at the racial bigotry, although I suppose that was common in the pre-Civil Rights era. I realize bigotry will always be present, but it seemed Scout was too easy to shrug off the KKK, and  the uncle's violent knocking her around--I guess to "knock some sense into her" was appalling. On the other hand, Lee's writing is remarkable, and this could have been a much better novel had it been well edited.
While many will rate this book in comparison to To Kill a Mockingbird, I don't believe that is quite fair.  You have to give credit where credit is due and rate this as a first novel by a promising young writer.  I really enjoyed this, even if I found myself comparing them while reading.  I found this book very intriguing, and enjoyed the struggle of and older "Scout" to come to terms with the changing times.  I wish Harper Lee had continued writing and given us more wonderful stories!
How many times did I put the book aside? Why? It didn't read as Ms Lee. However, I very seldom leave a book unfinished regardless of how poor the writing or storyline; I must read to the end. This was no different...until the last third. This portion should be required reading. I didn't want it to end. The tone  became Harper Lee at her best. It meshes with the voices, personalities, and passion of her characters in "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Five stars for the conclusion.
I think Harper Lee was correct in her decision to publish to kill a mockingbird first and only. It was by far the superior work. It would have taken away from it to publish this one back then but I'm glad she gave it to us now. It wraps the story up. What I didn't like about this book was Its tendency toward preaching. To many long blurbs about the racism of the times and why it was wrong. I guess it was pertinent to the time it was written but sounds dated and weird now.
Not another masterpiece but certainly worth the read.
Takes a long time to get to the purpose of the story.
I loved this book and gave it to my daughter to read!
Not as good as the book, as usual, but very enjoyable
I am glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews and read. I thought it was a great sequel. I have read To Kill a Mockingbird so many times and always enjoy it. Harper Lee was an awesome writer. I wish she had written more books!
I was very disappointed with this book.  I can't believe it was  published.  It did nothing to add to the legacy of Harper Lee.  In fact, it made me question the fact that Harper even wrote TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD.  I now believe that if Harper Lee wrote TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD, she had a lot of assistance.  We will never know the truth, but there be a good reason that Ms. Lee never wrote another novel.  GO SET A WATCHMAN may represent her true level of talent as a writer.
I enjoyed this sequel for To Kill A Mocking Bird that takes place in the early 60's. Jean Louise is no longer Scout the Tomboy, she is a mature adult living in New York City. Her return to Maycomb is welcomed by Hank her boyfriend the lawyer, and her father Atticus. Jean Louise has difficulty fitting in to Maycomb  because the southern town has stood still, while she has expanded her horizons in New York. You'll enjoy reading this book and learning about the time period.
Really shouldn't have been published.  Editing is not good, it is surely a first draft, boring, no character development.  Don't buy.  It will not be a collector's item and maybe spoils it for some who love To Kill a Mockingbird.
I liked it but not as much as To Kill A Mockingbird. It seemed like Go Set A Watchman was written by two people. When there were flashbacks to Scout as a young girl, it was in the style and tone of Mockingbird. When it was in the current time, it had a different tone to the story which I didn't find as good as Mockingbird. Was Atticus really that much of a racist or was he participating in the meetings so that he was always in the know of how other people in town felt.
donot go into thinking this is as great as t o  kill a mocking bird.  it certainly devalues some of the lessons I did learn from that.  and I did learn, I might have been ten. and mockingbird helped to set my whole social thinking and my morality.  this book is about womans rights which I equaly agree with.  it is worth the read, sometimes I was confused, sometimes I cried because I was not.  thank you harper lee for giving me one more book to make me a better person.
Timeless reality of racism, but with a touch of humor in all the right places.  This book is a perfect conversation starter, as it will really make you think about how many we ways we have and have not changed over the decades.
Relationships between fathers and daughters are often awkward but this one takes the cake. Unbelievable that this story was written 60 years ago and that our country is STILL fighting injustice. Why have we not learned anything
disappointed
It was good.

Excellent!!!
Not engaging at all, very dry and boring throughout.
So great! Harper Lee doesn't know how to disappoint!
Wonderful! I don't know anybody who hasn't loved it!
An honest interpretation of southern life in that era. Jean Louise finds out Atticus isn't the God she thought he was, but don't we all have the moment when your parents fall off the pedestal we put them on as young children.
I thought this was a decent book by Harper Lee. Probably not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird", but worth the time to read it. I like her style that keeps me interested and turning pages. The "controversy" over the lawyer character and his racism is overblown in my opinion. He still shows integrity and intelligence and some common sense even with his racial animus. Wish Ms. Lee had written more than these two books since I do enjoy her style.
After reading some of the reviews, you could come to the conclusion that Atticus is a racist and bigot.  I came to a different conclusion.  If you understand Dr Finch's explanation to Scout, I believe it sheds a different light on the reasoning for Atticus'  involvement with the"county council".  His (Dr. Finch) helping Scout understand why she believed as she did.  Dr Finch, in a way, becomes the"hero" of this novel.  Anyway, I think it's a very good read.
Thoroughly enjoyed the writing style and now am even more anxious to reread "To Kill A Mockingbird ". Relevant in so many ways to taday's struggles with racial issues and also the bonds that exist between Father and child.
I enjoyed reading about Scout in her young adult life just as I enjoyed her as a child in To Kill a Mockingbird.  She is a spirited and opinionated young lady with spunk!  This story deals with the racial issues of the south and now that is she is grown up, she obviously sees the world different than when she was a child.  A struggle to understand the way her family and town thinks, she holds firm to her beliefs.  I really liked her character most of all.
Liked it. After all the hype I wasn't sure I would.
This book does not compare to To Kill A Mockingbird
A wonderful novel written from Scout's perspective.
Typical story of the south.  That's the way it was.
Of course it didn't equal Mockingbird. It didn't have the caliber of Mockingbird.  Overall I see it as a good introduction to writing. It was her first book and most likely the publishers didn't feel it was commercial enough. Was it lost or rejected? I'm going to reread her discussion with Atticus. In Watchman it was the Uncle who set things straight. I liked what he said about Watchman being a man's conscience. I see Donald Sutherlin playing that part.
Can you say ghost writer? The last few chapters are written in a very different style. Very disapointing.
I am disappointed in this book. My hero has clay feet. I am glad to have read TKAM first, because if this had come out first I would have missed a great book. I am happy to say that TKAM helped to shape my moral balance towards acceptance of others based on the person and not their race. I did like that fact that Jean Louise has also taken that lesson to heart, just not quite sure I would have been able to see my father brought down to a mere mortal.
This is without a doubt the most thought provoking book I've read in a long time. I think it should be required reading for everyone. And it must be read to the end. No quitting because some (many) parts are offensive.
I read it with some trepidation because I hold "To Kill a Mockingbird" so dear to my heart. Having grown up in a small town in the south, I though some of the insights into the historical/cultural/political make-up of small towns, in particular, were spot on. I liked it more than I thought I would by the time I finished, even going back to reread certain parts.  So once again, I find it is better to read something and make up your own mind.
Adjusting to the adult version of Scout takes a bit of energy, but worth the effort.  This is a jump ahead after the antics of a tomboy in To Kill a Mockingbird. She has a very strong intent and moral code, and struggles with what she sees in her home town and family changing. She struggles to keep her beliefs unchanged, though, and nearly forsakes some important relationships. It's more a story of the evolving South, and those who grew up there.
Almost as good as "To kill a mockingbird"!
I found the book very interesting and a good read.
Disappointing rationalization of southern bigotry.
Tough read.  Atticus Finch is a difficult to like.
Wow what surprises very thoughtful and eye opening
This was fantastic!!  I would read this again.....
IT IS GOOD BUT NO "TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD"
I don't think "Go Set A Watchman" was as spell binding as "To Kill A Mocking Bird". However, "Go Set A Watchman" brought up some interesting thoughts about the causes for racial tension between Whites and Blacks. We are so "politically correct" conscious now that I thought this book brought up some opinions that have been at the back of many of our minds for sometime, due to recent reports of violence in the news.
While waiting for this book to become available from the library, I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird. Many reviews of this book have not been positive, criticizing Lee for the way she portrayed Atticus. I disagree. He is revealed as a compassionate, intelligent man of conviction who is also human... One who loves his family very much. The young Scout from Mockingbird truly grows to be her "father's daughter" in this story. I enjoyed it very much.
To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book of all time.  There is no way this book is written by the same author.  The characters make no sense and have no connection to the original.  I was so nervous to read this book because of how much I like Mockingbird.  After reading this, I don't see any relation between the two and it didn't change my feelings for To Kill A Mockingbird.  I would not recommend this book at all - this book is a farce!
to kill a mocking bird is my favorite book.  I could not wait to start to read this I am only about 50 pages in but it is so boring I will probably never finish it.  sorry harper lee I did love the mocking bird tho
A remarkable re=introduction to Atticus Finch and his daughter "Scout".  Lovers of Atticus, especially those who saw Gregory Peck's interpretation of him, will be disappointed to discover that while he may be a great lawyer he is also a realist with regard to his position in a deeply segregated small Alabama town.  Harper Lee gives us much more insight into the entire Finch clan and the book has, for me, a very satisfactory ending.
I did enjoy reading this book. However, I do not think this book was ever meant for publication. But there are many issues that resonate today. I did have to go back and read Mockingbird, because as this was written before Mockingbird, and we all know the movie so well, I had to put this book down very early on to re-read Mockingbird. There are differences that were making me think I was losing my mind..so I went back to read Mockingbird.
It's a good thing the editor of Mockingbird advised her to write the background to Watchman, and published it first. I would not have enjoyed this book otherwise. Watchman touches on issues that we are still dealing with today - will we ever change? It touches on heroes and disappointments, and how to deal with them, how to move forward with our own lives. I do recommend this for reading, but only if the reader has read Mockingbird first.
Found it difficult to put down, kept my interest.
I was very surprised. This is a really good book.
Awesome. Perfect match for To Kill A Mockingbird.
One of the best books I have read in a long time.
This book ruined my life. Definitely a good read!
Fantastic book!!! I will forever love Harper Lee.
I liked this book but felt that it was too short!
I read that lots of people were returning this book to stores.  My guess is that they were disappointed that it wasn't the same as To Kill a Mockingbird in innocence.  People grow up and so did Scout and, although we may not like everything Harper Lee has to say in this book, it's of its time and portrays society as such.  It's part of history in the way of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.  Don't blame the messenger.  She did a good job.
Absolute disappointment !!!. In TKAM Jem was coming into his own and i was longing to read more on his character development, Atticus who was the eptiome of kindness, morality, justice and humility did a 360 without any sort of explanation and suddenly all his morals are questionable ??? Somebody or bodies saw an opportunity to capitalize on TKAM and did just that. Felt like i lost some brain cells after reading all 278 pages !!!
Better written and a more complex message than TKAM. Thoroughly enjoyed the story, highly recommend!
I liked this book a great deal.  There are some wonderful descriptions of life in the South, and a child's interpretation of adult subjects.  This story is a great counterbalance to To Kill a Mockingbird; that period in history was complex and so were those who lived it. If you loved To Kill a Mockingbird, don't be hesitant to read this one.  It's a wonderful story of Scout's coming to understand herself and the world she came from.
This is a good read as long as you force yourself not to use it to change your perceptions and feelings towards the characters in To Kill A Mockingbird. Read it as a separate entity. It is basically an essay on the feelings on prejudice in the south during that period of time. I enjoyed it - but it is NOT even close to the literary work that Mockingbird is. Perhaps that is why Harper Lee chose not to publish it all those years ago.
Went into reading this book after hearing terrible review.s Did not expect to love it, like to Kill a Mockingbird, but did like it.<br/>Understood the way people felt in the South, mainly from Atticus's brother, when talking to Scout. People are upset feeling differently about Atticus after reading the book, but that is why I think Harper Lee went back to write, To Kill  a Mockingbird, not knowing anyone would ever read this book.
I was so disappointed. To Kill A Mockingbird was my favorite book. This is a poor attempt at trying to resurrect a best seller. Poorly written, has little connection to TKAM. The story is unbelievable. They made Atticus a racist. Just a lousy, lousy book. Wish I would have got it at the library. Since I paid for it I felt like I "had" to finish reading it. If you loved to Kill a Mockingbird you will hate Go Set A Watchman.
I enjoyed the read. It is evident that an editor was not involved and I believe that is good since she is no longer with us. It needed to be published just like it was written. Back in the early sixties life and thoughts were much different, especially in the Deep South. I thought the uncle did something that was out of character but back then, it could have happened. I didn't enjoy it as much as her other book but I did enjoy it.
A major disappointment.
So as a huge fan of To Kill a Mockingbird, I couldn't wait until Go Set a Watchman came out. For those interested, it actually happens chronologically AFTER To Kill a Mockingbird. It follows Scout into adulthood as she comes back to town. There were moments where I wasn't sure how I felt about the story, but the ending really cinched it for me. I'm not going to ruin anything, but I think most fans of the original will be pleased.
I thought this book was a fine companion to "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave a more complete picture of the main characters of both books.  The criticism by some readers of Atticus Finch is unwarranted, in my opinion, as it shows that a good person is not perfect, just as in life.  I enjoyed the dialog about the racial tensions of the times and thought Harper Lee captured the arguments on both sides of the issue well.
I loved the book as I did "Mockingbird".
Great follow up to "kill a mockingbird".
Not as good as  To Kill A Mockingbird, but good.
Having read To Kill A Mockingbird years ago, I was very excited to read Go Set a Watchman because I really enjoyed Harper Lee's style of writing and storytelling. I loved that many of the memorable characters from Mockingbird were in this book (not that you need to read Mockingbird first - it is good as a stand alone book). Excellent read!<br/><br/>"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite book, so when I heard about this one on national news I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! Such an amazing story of a grown-up Scout coming into her own. A great read!
I read this book as soon as I got it. I liked it almost as much as To Kill a Mockingbird. It would make a great movie! Thank you to Harper Lee. Maybe they will find a third book. That would be awesome too.
To Kill A Mockingbird was, is, and always will be my favorite book of all time. Go Set a Watchman took me back to Maycomb County where Scout grew up. It was a little disappointing what happened with some of the characters, but thus is life. I felt that disappointment and crash into reality with Jean Louise as she finally understands that her Atticus is just a man, although an extraordinary one, and has to deal with how things are there in Maycomb and to understand how he, in subtle ways, really is standing for his beliefs. Jean Louise sees that she can have a different viewpoint than Atticus and still look up to him. I enjoyed seeing Uncle Jack and Aunt Alexandra playing a big part in her journey. Would have liked to have seen Ms. Maudie and Boo make an appearance, or at least have found out their whereabouts. All in all, an excellent read. You won't regret reading it.

I loved it.
Great story about tolerance. Accept people for their beliefs without violence.  Harper Lee saw what society was going to turn into. People hating each other because they don't agree about the same things
I really liked this book and it fits perfectly into our crazy world right now. We all can have our opinions and yet live with each other and our assumptions are most often not a reflection of the truth.
It was a pull at your heart strings kinda book.
A book for right now!  Loved it.  A must read!!
Very excellent story but such a great author. So glad it is now in print. To have a continuation of such an iconic book is awesome. She brought you right down to Alabama with her. So ahead of her time.
Had heard the scuttlebutt about Atticus, the bigot.  I was ready to read and consider.  So glad I did.  Its not TKAM, but I enjoyed it.  The flashbacks to Scouts childhood had me roaring with laughter.
"To Kill A Mockingbird" is legendary, a classic book and classic film, and it is probably not possible to read this "recently discovered" manuscript without comparison.  My goal was to read GSAW with an open mind and to approach it as objectively as I could.  Surprisingly, it was so much better than I expected. Yes, it has boring sections ( mostly the "present day" sequences) and the final 50 pages are quite preachy on the issue of civil rights. But the positive outweighs these objections. The flashback sequences are mostly delightful and some are downright LOL funny. Yes, the writing isn't as smooth at TKAM, but there is no doubt that Harper Lee was already a good writer. So, if you loveTKAM and can read GSAW with an open mind, I give a strong recommendation. ( check out the audible book read by Reece Witherspoon. FABULOUS ! )
I'm sorry I wasted my time and money on this book.  No way would it be a best seller, and I'm not sure it would even be considered good enough to publish if it wasn't Harper Lee's long lost novel.  Why destroy the heroic Atticus Finch by making him a bigot in his letter life?  I will never be able to think the same of him again.  Sometimes it's best to let sleeping dogs lie, and this is one of those times.
This is a good, but not a great book.  The furor over the downgrading of Atticus Finch from saint to human is revealing about our culture.  Apparently, we cannot hold two contradictory views at the same time, e.g. that Atticus was on one hand a good and wise man and on the other a man who by current, liberal standards was a racist.  We can do it with George Washington, an actual slave owner, but not with Atticus.
A 1960s treatise on racism. Terribly outdated.
Don't go by the reviews. This is a great book!
Excellent read, well written and introspective
Interesting companion to "Mockingbird"
An excellent book.  I'm really glad I read it.
NOT IMPRESSED BUT LOVE  TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD
A little slow.....no comparison to Mockingbird
I enjoyed it as much as To Kill a Mockingbird.
needed some editing, seemed like a first draft
I found it to be a fascinating and revealing look at the seemingly racist Southern attitude about their history and their interpretation of "the war between the States." I have always dismissed it as sheer stubbornness, intractability,and for some it probably is. But Atticus lays out reasons that FOR THE TIME had some validity, though our Scout wasn't of a mind to give it the time of day. Interesting....
A good story, one that reflects on history as well as today's society. The narrator, now an adult, looks back at her childhood. The book challenges readers to evaluate the contrasts between yesterday and today----the strong feelings associated with race and class systems then and now. It does not diminish Harper Lee's success earned in her first book; nor does it disappoint, despite what some critics have said.
"Watchman"  is a worthwhile read. You get a snapshot of southern racial mentalities of prior generations (and some today). You get an empathic sense of change that time brings (you can never go back "home") to an idealistic innocence, a look at a child's worldview corrected by time, by real-world social changes, and by early adult insight and confirmation. A southern view (mostly ?). Nostalgic.
Having read to Kill A Mockingbird many years ago I thought it was interesting to picture Scout and the rest as grown ups. After reading this book I think that the Truman Capote theory ( that he wrote or collaborated Mockingbird) makes sense to me. I was disappointed that Bo was never mentioned in this story as he played such an integral part in her first book. Racist.?..well consider the timing on this story.
Anxiously awaited, the novel “Go Set a Watchman” by Harper Lee is one of the most eagerly sought after books of 2015. Not since “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” was released has a book received more pre-orders. “Go Set a Watchmen” was met with much excitement, however the reaction to the novel has been mixed at best and controversial at worst.<br/><br/>“Go Set a Watchman” is the sequel to the American classic, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” a novel in which an astute lawyer in 1936 defends a black man wrongly accused of sexual assault. Throughout the novel the lawyer's daughter and main character of the book, Jean Louise, comes to view her father Atticus Finch as a champion for racial equality and for justice. The book has been hailed as a pinnacle of the civil rights movement, with themes such as the coexistence of good and evil and the destruction of innocence as its focal point. It has been taught in classrooms around the United States for decades, a focal point for American literature that all students must read.<br/><br/>Enter “Go Set a Watchman.” Over a decade has passed since the famous trial, and Jean Louise is now twenty-six years old. She returns to the small town of Maycomb from New York, only to find that her hero, Atticus, has made what seems an inconceivable turn of events and become a racist, contrary to everything that he has taught his daughter in “To Kill a Mockingbird.” The book's theme centers around the idea that Jean Louise has used her father as a moral compass, a “watchman” of Maycomb, and now that her disillusionment has been lifted can see her father as a regular man for the first time instead of an idol.<br/><br/>“Go Set a Watchman” was originally the first draft of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and was set aside by Harper Lee after multiple editors and agents rejected the draft and asked her to revise. The draft was found nearly fifty years after the publication of “Mockingbird,” and HarperCollins proudly introduced this book as being unedited when published.<br/><br/>“Go Set a Watchman” clearly shows why first drafts should never be published. The book slowly meanders here and there, sliding in incidents from Jean Louise's childhood that are unrelated to the plot until, finally, the earth-shattering revelation comes when Atticus Finch reveals that he has attended KKK meetings, is for segregation, and against rights-advancement for African-Americans. Jean Louise rightfully declares that her father is a hypocrite and vows never to see him again, until her Uncle Jack physically abuses her and forces her to drink a glass of strong liquor, manipulating her into believing that it is somehow okay for her father to have these immoral ideals.<br/><br/>Characters should have multiple facets of their personality. The more contradictory a character is, the better developed. However, Atticus Finch's complete turn-around from the first book to the second makes no sense. You cannot have a character switch from day to night with no build up. Readers were as shocked as Jean Louise when Atticus revealed his true feelings, but for different reasons. A pinnacle for civil rights, who is actively defending African Americans in court, cannot go to anti-negro meetings in his free time. He has to have adequate reasons. Atticus Finch's overall argument is that African-Americans are not ready for full rights, and that he as a white man must protect his heritage. It is an argument which, for as good of a lawyer as he is, falls flat to even the most uneducated reader.<br/><br/>The book's theme is on point, in which Jean Louise comes to realize that her opinions are different from her father's and she can now stand on her own two feet as an individual instead of a copy of her father. This important character growth is shattered, however, when at the end of the novel she decides to return to Maycomb and accept her father's racism and prejudice against her own ideals for no apparent reason other than he is her father. A sad ending to a book that, otherwise, could've had a powerful impact.<br/><br/>“Go Set a Watchman” had potential, and could've been a successful follow-up to “Mockingbird” if it had more development. However, in what seems like nothing more than a money-grab by HarperCollins, it is a confusing and inadequate supplement that makes its predecessor completely irrelevant.
This novel gives the southern view of the nature of the Civil War, Emancipation, and the planning flaws which have led to today's civil unrest.  Had this book been released first, not many would have given a second thought to reading about Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird.  It will be difficult to read for Black America and those intimately involved in current racial issues, but if you can finish the book which is filled with the N word and racist views, the ending gives a stunning depiction of how the process used in emancipation failed to prepare the slaves for independence and self-support and how the views of the northern states and the southern states differ on civil war issues.  America would not have understood the Atticus Finch in Go Set a Watchman and probably would not have wanted to read To Kill a Mockingbird, had Go Set a Watchman been released first.  Scout has the perfect perspective to explain why.  Scout's anger is a depiction of the anger and disappointment still ripping the racial currents in America today.  Atticus Finch, his brother Dr. Finch, Calpurnia and her family, and all the other characters set the stage for the explanation of "why everything is not always as it first appears" offered in the final chapters. Dedication is needed to read through anger to the end and ultimately understand the fears which beset the south after the civil war, how the flames of anger and hatred spread, and how the well-intended actions of some were misinterpreted. Very thought provoking in retrospect.  If you substitute the un- or under-educated, misdirected youths of today (any race)  emancipated at age 18 (or even before) without proper preparation, you begin to see an analogous anger-pattern developing.  Amazing foresight by Ms. Harper Lee in my opinion.
Here's the thing: This book is great. Same writing style as To Kill a Mockingbird, same characters, same everything. The only difference is everyone is older and Uncle Jack gets some attention. Make decisions for yourself about this novel, though. A lot of people like it, a lot more hate it. For some strange reason, people believe Atticus to be a racist in this novel, and it is off-putting to a lot of readers. I would argue that our former hero is not acting the racist in this story.<br/><br/>Atticus has not changed any since To Kill a Mockingbird's timeline. He's still the absolutely logical thinker, fair to all, and wants to see the best for Maycomb. Scout has gone to her given name of Jean-Louise, and it seems she has changed a bit more than her go-by name by the time we get to see her. She's gone to New York and has come back enlightened far beyond anyone in her old, stuck-in-its-ways hometown. It's almost culture shock for her, and her eyes are opened to a lot more things. Considering both TKAM and GSAW are from her point-of-view, it is easy to view other characters as different than what they actually are.<br/><br/>Now, back to Atticus. Atticus does not have a problem with black people in Go Set a Watchman. He has a problem with putting someone with no experience in a position that requires quite a bit of experience - which is what the NAACP was trying to do. Atticus has no issue with having black people go to law school or learn a trade and be put into a position once they have received the same training that anyone else would receive. Readers have just assumed that, since the one up for mayor (or governor - I can't remember) is an inexperienced individual, Atticus hates him and doesn't want him to be in that position because of his skin color. Jean Louise even has those thoughts, but Atticus explains it to her - and in that explanation, we see that Atticus has never been anyone other than Atticus.
When I pre-ordered this book I was unaware of all the progressive bigoted left wing dismissive hate. I remember taking my nephew to the annual spring production the city of Monroeville, AL puts on with real actors as a “To Kill a Mockingbird” play. I told him he’d first have to read the book (his first). He read it a week before & we had a splendid time in Harper Lee & Truman Capote’s hometown, also home of my first cousin Dr Tim Jones who along with his wife was brutally murdered in ‘In Cold Blood’ style by their disturbed adopted son about 8 years ago. So ‘Maycomb’ has a special place in my heart.<br/>To be frank, I usually have 2 or 3 unfinished books in my Kindle library at all times and would, without exception, select Watchman when it was time to sleep. 2 or 3 pages and ‘poof’, I was out like a log. Then about half way through the book a light went on in my head, this was not a piece of rambling short stories about Scout and outtakes from Mockingbird  pieced together to make a few bucks off an old lady’s publishing estate. Harper Lee knew exactly what she was writing about and masterfully displayed all our human flaws & expectations we have for our heroes.<br/>Atticus has grown to wise old age of 72, living through the reality of dealing with the rapid cultural changes whites and blacks were dealing with in the first half of the 20th century. Ultimately he is the same honorable man as he was defending an innocent black man in the original novel. Scout or Jean Louise Finch is still one of more irresistible charismatic females in all literature. You will have all sorts of leading ladies to play her part running through your head. But that movie sadly will never be made because of the New York/Hollywood snobs who think all white Southerners are and should forever remain the stereotypical racists they have created in their little brains.
It's hard to know how to approach Go Set a Watchman, really. I mean, let's set aside the complicated question about whether this should have been published for the time being; while it's a legitimate question to raise, the fact remains that the book is out, one way or the other. And it's undeniably a book that needed some work; whether it's a first draft of the story that would eventually lead to To Kill a Mockingbird or a follow-up or some hybrid of the two is hard to say; there are some elements that definitely suggest the "first draft" idea (most notably a brief allusion to the Tom Robinson case which strongly implies that the case originally played out much differently in Lee's mind), while much of the book simply doesn't work as anything other than a long-delayed sequel to the book. Indeed, the entire premise of the book - in which a now grown Scout (Jean Louise, these days) returns to Maycomb and is forced into realizing that her father isn't the man she thought he was - almost feels like a response to Mockingbird and the sanctification of Atticus Finch. Whatever Watchman is, it's without a doubt a flawed piece of work. It's uneven and piecemeal, peppering its length with wonderful stories of Scout's youth that never quite come together into a whole; moreover, while To Kill a Mockingbird handled its themes gracefully and lightly, Watchman gets heavy-handed and didactic, especially in the final few chapters, which become little more than dueling monologues. And yet, for all that, I still quite liked Watchman, which responds to the childlike simplicity of Mockingbird by reminding us that life isn't all black and white, and that the myth of the "great white savior" is just that - a myth. Watchman is an angry, frustrated book, and it's hard to imagine it coming out back in the 1960's; even today, it comes out swinging and doesn't hold back, and if it occasionally goes a bit heavy on its points, it's still a rich response to those who've argued that Mockingbird presents a man so good that he couldn't be real. Indeed, for all the controversy about how Lee has changed Atticus Finch, it's hard not to feel that this is indeed the same man of Mockingbird, only seen through the eyes of an adult, not an adoring child - and that the feelings of shock and betrayal that seemed to be everywhere on the release of the book mirror Scout's to a T. No, Go Set a Watchman isn't To Kill a Mockingbird...but honestly, did anyone really expect it to be? Instead, what we got is something undeniably flawed, but more complex, more adult, and less comforting...and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Do I wish Go Set a Watchman had been edited and revised a bit more? Without a doubt; there are seeds in here of an astonishing companion piece to Mockingbird, one that could have held its own, but they're covered by the early efforts of a writer who was still finding her voice (and doing it well). But even in this form, Watchman is a fascinating and complex follow-up to the book, and if it changes the way we think about Mockingbird, maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing. Maybe there's something to be said for realizing that the world's a more complicated and difficult place than we thought it was when we were children, and that realizing that is part of what forces us all to grow up.
There has been a great deal written in recent days about this novel,the sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, and the fall from grace of one of its main characters Atticus Finch.I find thatthe worst written is not true. Harper Lee is alleged to have written this yarn before she wrote Mockingbird and wrote Mockingbird when her publisher rejected Watchman and asked her to sharpen her pencil with respect. This she did admirably and the resulting To Kill a Mockingbird is an American classic. Easily one of the top ten novels ever written. How does one top that?<br/><br/>But as Flannery O'Conner observed Mockingbird was told from a child's viewpoint and many of its observations and conclusions were childlike in nature. The young Scout grew to idolize her father Atticus as did we all along with her. He was everything a father should be and we all admired him so much that we, along with Scout, made him more than human; an alabaster saint.<br/><br/>For the setting of Go Set A Watchman we must jump forward 20 years to 1954. Scout is now a single adult Miss Jean Louise Finch of 26 years and a college graduate working in Manhattan. She has returned to Maycombe for a 14 day vacation with her family. Nineteen fifty four was the year of Brown v. Board of Education. The US Supreme Court in essence legally and suddenly put an end to segregation throughout the land. And nowhere in this great land of ours was that decision more keenly felt than the deep south where the progress of the black population had been slow and grudgingly permitted by the white state and local governments. Now faced with the prospect of perhaps having government headed by black citizens who had little idea of how government runs and voting citizens who had no concept of the responsibility of a voter in choosing the right candidate, fear gripped the white population. They saw the beginnings of a new "Reconstruction" and immediately formed citizens committees to, at best, try and at least delay the effects of the court's decision until black citizens could be better educated about their new freedoms and responsibilities. At worst the fear mongers and white supremacists spewed hatred and the Ku Klux Klan wandered about with ropes and burning crosses.  This is the world that Jean Louise is thrust into with no suspicion that even her own family is not immune.<br/><br/>The tale is told once again from Jean Louise's point of view and begins innocently enough with Scout renewing her old friendship with Henry Clinton, her childhood chum, boyfriend, and now father's law partner. The story progresses though some romance and character introduction. And the characters are here some slightly cracked and others completely eccentric like Jean Louise's Uncle Jack Finch. Missing are Dill who is wandering the world and Jem who has suddenly and unexpectedly dropped dead on the steps of the courthouse a few years before. Things in Maycombe seem pretty much the same as Jean Louise remembers. She muses that some things change, but not in Maycombe. All of her old memories are intact. But about midway through the telling something happens to shatter Miss Jean Louise Finch's illusions. She suddenly realizes that no one, including her sainted father, are who she thought they were. It begins with Scout observing Hank and Atticus taking an active part in a Citizens Council meeting at the courthouse where some ugly segregationist language is used and racial hatred is freely cast about. Jean Louise cannot believe her ears as she sits in exactly the same seat she sat in 20 years before watching her father defend Tom Robinson from a trumped up rape charge.<br/><br/>The remainder of the story concerns itself with Jean Louise coming to terms with what she has seen and heard  particularly from her father. It is a well told story and Harper Lee's voice is plainly heard in the words and paragraphs. It is not as compelling a story as Mockingbird, but fairy-tales are always more compelling than true to life stories. It is a worthy sequel to Mockingbird for it brings the fairy tale home to reality and a young woman home as her own person. Although I was somewhat dissatisfied with the ending, I do recommend it. It is a snapshot of a southern community in 1954 America full of characters we know who are finally human beings. We have come a long way since then but still have a long way to go.
Go Set a Watchman and the Cultural Competence Continuum:<br/>Like Scout, I mean,  like Jean Louise, I too wished J.L. had found Atticus and Hennry with “sleazy women” as she painfully put it. That is, if Harper Lee’s only wish about Atticus was to “reduce him to the stature of human”.  But Jean Louise’s birth in her DES-illusion was my own required disillusion as well.  I can now see the somewhat-maniqueistic literary tendencies in  How to Kill a Mocking Bird, given from a sort of childhood perspective, even if I still think that Harper Lee’s 1960 Pulitzer novel was excellent.  I wonder if Harper Lee was not ready to publish Go Set a Watchman because she was already thinking about a third novel.  She gave birth, in Go Set a Watchman, to a young Jean Louise who found herself at a different stage in the cultural continuum than her own family and the members of her childhood community.  I wonder if a third book would have given permission, not only to Jean Louis, but also to Atticus, and to the community, to move in the cultural competence continuum.  After all, realities that are legitimized through deception, or pseudoscience, at one time or another are debunked by scholarly research.  While the common attitude, legitimized by the most powerful institutions once declared that the earth was flat, and later on, that it was the center of the universe, our 21st Century fellow human beings would look at us strangely if we asserted such notions.  While certain bigot attitudes, reinforced by beliefs or even pseudo-science, cannot easily be changed, laws can protect individuals from hateful acts, and education can unmask deceit.  As a reader, I was reminded of the importance of getting off one's self-righteous-horse and of  the need to continuously reflect about one’s own fragile place in the Cultural Competence Continuum. Cultural blindness, where Jean Louis seemed to have stood, might sound very righteous, --and yes, it is much above cultural destructiveness or cultural incapacity--  but it is certainly not at the level of true cultural competence. Perhaps, this is one of the reasons that I wonder if Harper Lee was thinking about Go Set a Watchman as an unfinished story in which her characters, influenced by their environments, might have later moved on or regressed int he continuum. Of course, if the situations she described in Go Set  a Watchman, were a thing of the past, her book would not be so relevant today. This is a time we do need to Go Set a Watchman over our own attitudes, and to remember what Dr. Finch said:  “The time your friends need you, is when they are wrong…”  --Somehow I believe that if Jean Louis had had a grand-child, he or she might be uttering lines such as: “Grandma, if you really believe that All lives matter, then you would understand why Black lives matter.”  Of course, that is just an speculation.
With “Go Set a Watchman” Harper Lee is well on her way to getting a second Pulitzer. I know everyone wants a longer, more detailed review and I wrote one but I deleted it this morning. You need to experience this book on your own. This is literature – the story of human experience, and I will not deny you that experience.<br/>I know you’ve heard a lot of things. Things that scare and disappoint you. Things that will shake your belief in one of literature’s greatest heroes. You should be scared. Jean Louise is scared. However, understand that these are the same characters – Atticus, Scout – older and set in a time of huge upheaval, but the same characters that you have known and loved. They are complex and drawn from reality, not cartoon characters battling over a throne.<br/>Lee experiments a little with style: it is told in close third person that slips from time to time into first person and back again, she presents a coffee klatsch in the form of a cut-up, but still there is the humor, charm, and humanity that is the mark of Harper Lee’s works.<br/>The book is set nearly twenty years after To Kill a Mockingbird, and Jean Louise is returning to Maycomb from her life in New York to the family and the home that shaped her. This is the time between Brown v Board of Education and Rosa Parks’ famed protest on the bus when the South was in the midst of a painful birth. It’s not a coincidence that the other community in Maycomb County is Old Sarum named after the medieval English city in Salisbury. In many ways, the Jim Crow South, with its land barons and serfs, is a salty preservation of the Anglo-Saxon civilization of the Middle Ages. Whereas English society evolved over centuries, the South had only decades.<br/>Today we view racists as obtuse Boss Hogs with barbecue sauce stains on their seersucker suits, or violent dupes like Dylan Roof, but in reality, they were community leaders and educators; they were smart, compassionate, and friendly folk who were blind to the dangers of their own intellectual bigotry. And sometimes they were reformers. Before you judge Atticus, look at Jean Louise. This book was written at the time in which it takes place, and while Jean Louise is portrayed as a progressive, her thinking, which is binary and paternalistic, is shocking by today’s standards.<br/>This is the story of a child finding her own conscience and her place in society. This is the story of how Jean Louise became the mature woman who told us the story in To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/>Deny this story and you deny yourself one of the greatest works of this century precisely because it was written in the last.
For decades TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, the book and especially the movie romanticized a character in ways that most of us would like to see.  I liked the book, and LOVED the movie.  But I was never fooled (even at a very young age) as to why Atticus did what he did in defending a black man in the segregated South in the 1930’s. Believe me it was not because he “loved” black people, but in my mind I felt that he loved his profession and took it seriously and doing what he thought was right for his chosen profession in upholding the LAW (as it was supposed to be). Of course my then childish and disillusioned mind thought that maybe a part of him knew that black men were always going to get a bad rap and he had to do that one thing that one time.<br/><br/>In the new book ,Go set a Watchman, I was not at all surprised to see that he attended Klan meetings or that he might have made racist statements. In the 30’s in the Deep South (and beyond) it was what they did. White’s had no love for black people and even less for a white man who defended one.  It shows how quickly people will turn on their own when they do not “conform” to their way of thinking.<br/>The movie, played by an excellent with almost Godlike persona lulled everyone into thinking what we might LIKE to believe; and until the new book it worked. However, I don’t see why people are so up in arms about it when it was the way it was back then, yet there was a “white” man willing not only to put his career in jeopardy but the safety of his family and employees as well,<br/><br/>Could this have really happened? Probably not, but like the bible story of Sodom and Gomorrah, if there had been ten just men (people) in the city it would have been saved.  But alas you know what happened with that theory.<br/><br/>We all read the original story, saw the move and had a hope that in reality there might have been just one man like Atticus Finch.
Reflections on Harper Lee’s novels - Spoiler alert, if you have not read these books and do not want the plots spoiled, I will spoil them here.<br/><br/>Well, I chose to read Harper Lee’s works in chronological order. I think I made the right choice. It was good to have Scout’s childish perspective and focus on a certain life-defining episode of her youth as the background for Jean Louise’s coming of age story.<br/><br/>Harper Lee took a few pages of her first work and turned them into a compelling, fully fleshed out story of childhood innocence disturbed by subtle yet turbulent reality. The account of childhood in small town Alabama with the underlying racial and social tensions puts us there, in the middle of this placid surface, this languid recounting of summer play and childhood imaginations ruled by the somewhat abstract, quite benevolent and highly principled Atticus Finch.<br/><br/>The Maycomb of “To Kill a Mockingbird” is a tightly controlled universe where everyone knows their place. We accept the dictums of the time. The blacks live where they live, the white trash are just that but they are not all evil, and the servants, as seen through the eyes of the child, are there to serve but also to police and mete out reprimands or sage advice as needed. There is the required crazy person that must be present in every Southern novel. And, somewhere, in the very vague background are the local politics which will intrude in the idyllic, drowsy pace of life.<br/>Of course, the idealization of Maycomb, of its inhabitants, of the unimpeachable Atticus, rest on that childish platform. If we look at it from the perspective of “Go Set A Watchman” we can see that this view of Maycomb as a place of seeming harmony, with well working social structures - this view of Atticus as a paragon of virtue and integrity - could not survive the sober scrutiny of adulthood intact.<br/><br/>I can see why Mockingbird is such a beloved novel – in simple terms it is about doing the right thing even if you know you can’t win or change the world. This is the lesson. Atticus defends the black man accused of rape, stands up to the lynch mob, and forces his children to take insults with dignity. Wow, daddy is Gregory Peck at his best.<br/><br/>And yet, very subtly, the image starts to blur. It is almost like you can see the palimpsest of Watchman in Mockingbird. Atticus Finch holds a seat in the Alabama State Legislature to which he is constantly reelected. Would he have the support of his constituents if he did not uphold the status quo? He is assigned the Robinson case, he did not ask for it. He goes along with his sister’s prohibition of the children going to a black church. He tolerates the racism of others. He jokes with Scout that if women served on juries, trials would never end. Ultimately, he goes along with not investigating a murder.<br/><br/>Fast-forward, or rewind, to the Watchman universe- Jean Louise (formerly known as Scout) has graduated from college, is living in New York and comes home for her yearly visit. What do we learn right away? Her father is suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and cannot pick her up because he can’t drive to the train station. He relies on her boyfriend, an up-and-coming lawyer who has become like a son to him for day to day work. He is somewhat henpecked, somewhat tolerant of his sister’s control of the household and we soon learn that she is there because he needs her to take care of him.<br/><br/>Then we have the town of Maycomb, where the tensions are no longer simmering, they are at the forefront of activity. The white folks are pissed off about desegregation, the black folks are openly showing their distrust, the Citizens Council is hosting the Klan, and the boyfriend is deemed trash by the social powers that be.<br/><br/>From the moment that Hank picks her up we understand that she is seeing her hometown with different eyes - with eyes that have been cleansed of childhood cobwebs. Still, she is in denial about the one constant in her life. She thinks Atticus is in better shape than he actually is. She very slowly starts to come to grips with his frailties as she observes how his rheumatoid arthritis keeps him from doing simple things like tying his shoe laces, and also makes him dependent on others for rides to work. This coming to terms with his physical limitations is well crafted. It leads perfectly into the moment when, sitting in the same courtroom gallery where, at the age of six, she watched Atticus defend a black man because it was the right thing to do, she now watches him join forces with the height of Maycomb’s racist establishment. The stage where he became her guiding light, her moral compass, is the stage where he falls from grace. As she watches him introduce the speaker from the Klan, shake his hand, and offer him a platform to share his views, the scaffolding that has held Atticus up for the past 20 years comes tumbling down.<br/><br/>Jean Louise’s reaction is extreme; all is lost and she no longer has her rock. Her hero plunges off the pedestal. Up until this point, the narrative is solid, if somewhat predictable. She confronts her father and falls apart. She wonders what, if anything, about her life is true. She sees Atticus as a racist and feels deceived. The confrontation is realistic. He is who he always was and he knows that she needs to come to terms with it. As Atticus, the perfect Southern gentleman, would, he is gracious and understanding while, at the same time, completely comfortable with his world view. The blacks are backwards children who should trust good white men like him to make the world a better place for them. He and his peers know what’s best. Jean Louise feels betrayed and goes on a rampage of blame. Can a visit to her childhood maid set things right? During this visit, where she is treated politely but given no trust or warmth, Jean Louise finally realizes that her childhood memories veer into the realm of fantasy.<br/><br/>The rest of the novel is a mad dash through denial, acceptance, self-awareness and absolution. Atticus emerges once again as the paragon of parenthood. He is proud that she has become her own person and not just a follower of Atticus. Jean Louise realizes that she is still part of the system she abhors and makes peace with her role in the drama of racial relations in Maycomb. In the end, she realizes the status quo is a bad thing but, what are you going to do?<br/><br/>This is the part of Watchman which would have benefitted from careful and thoughtful editing. It is too rushed. A scene where she visits her uncle for a session of gnashing of teeth and pointing of fingers reads like a something out of a cheap melodrama leading to the clichéd “slap this woman so she will cease her hysterics” moment. This is followed in quick succession by the scene in which Atticus is proud of his daughter for becoming her own person and she realizes he is still her hero.<br/><br/>I am saddened by two missed opportunities in these last few chapters.<br/><br/>This is a coming of age novel where the heroine must lose her childhood innocence, realize that her father is not perfect, separate herself from him and become her own person who must somehow reconcile her idealized parent with the real human being. In Mockingbird the ground is laid for this process to take center stage. The loving attention to Scout’s inner landscape is missing for Watchman’s Jean Louise. I personally feel that the process of seeing the feet of clay and learning how to love your imperfect parent, while setting different standards for becoming the best person you can, is an amazing and fulfilling process. It can lead to a rewarding and loving adult relationship with that very important person in your life. It paves the way for learning how to develop mature and satisfying relationships with your lover/spouse/mate. It creates a blueprint for building positive relationships with your children. I feel that Harper Lee could have written that if she had had some good guidance.<br/><br/>Another missed opportunity is the one to explore how a person who is working through their own racism can live in a racist society. Ursula K. Le Guin explains this beautifully in her review of Watchman. For me, these are the important questions - How do you love people who are racist? Where do you draw the line? Will you live in a state of constant confrontation or will you let some things go? Is this right or moral? Where are you willing to compromise your values? Can you fit in and still hold your principles? Are you ashamed of your loved ones? Can you be a teacher and a guide without alienating them? Can you serve a higher purpose while maintaining your affiliation? When do you call it quits?  How do you love the victims of racism? Can you be truly their ally without becoming their “savior”? Can you ever see them as they want to be seen or respected as they should be respected? Can they truly love you? Are we deluding ourselves when we think that our servants, nannies, maids, could love us while they left their children behind, while making the difficult choice required to put food in their mouths? Could they stop themselves from loving the innocent child who will eventually become their oppressor?<br/><br/>This exploration could have been the lesson of this novel. I wish the original editors had asked Harper Lee to write both novels, I wish the original editors had taken the time and effort to work Watchman to its potential. I wish we had seen Harper Lee’s tremendous talent truly applied to a novel that could have taught us so much. That said, I do not regret having Watchman in my literary universe. The ideas, the passions, the archetypes, haunt me. This novel offered me some space for reflection and introspection. I can truly recommend it.
Being thoroughly familiar with Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I knew many of the references and the backstory, and I felt at home with the narration even though Scout is nearly twenty years older now. She makes it clear that she's witnessing the same town and some of the same people from her youth, but through the eyes of an adult with some city-life experience. She seems to reconnect with the man destined to be her beau and with family members, some of whom played smaller or no part in MOCKINGBIRD. However, when Jean Louise discreetly attends a meeting, hears the words of a guest speaker, and notes the presence of certain people among the audience, her world shifts irrevocably. Jean Louise spends the rest of the novel trying to make sense of the way of Maycomb County life, and the people who live it there. In that search, she encounters both the blatant prejudice remembered from her childhood and the unexpected slap of enlightenment. To the reader who had learned to admire the morals and ethics embodied by a pillar of the community as presented by Scout as a child, the truths revealed to Jean Louise the adult are difficult to accept. In some cases they almost ring true, and in others they deflate the nearly godlike personas of at least two of the main characters. In effect, it brings Jean Louise's - and our - super heroes down to earth with their previously undetected flaws intact. We're left with the understanding that you don't have to agree with someone else to treat him well, that people aren't obliged to live up to your image of them, and that compromise can include biding one's time in the name of doing what one thinks right for his own community. It's not as strongly climactic as Boo Radley rescuing Jem from the murderous Bob Ewell and perhaps after reading and loving TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I may have wanted a different path, a different outcome for this novel, but the lesson still holds value.
Great
The literary world dropped its jaw  because in the span of two weeks a new book was published by two of America's best women writers: Harper Lee and Shirley Jackson. So the first:<br/>  "Go Set A Watchman" was written by Harper Lee before "To Kill A Mockingbird." As the story goes, her publisher advised her to turn back the clock by twenty years and write a book from the view of a little girl. The same characters, just the 1930's. So "Go Set A Watchman" went into a safe deposit box and Harper Lee's "To Kill A Mockingbird" changed the world.<br/>  As if to say that all things return, "Go Set A Watchman" is just as topical today as was its partner in 1960. This brilliantly crafted masterpiece tackles the issues of civil rights, State's Rights and the coming of age of Scout Finch, now Jean Louise Finch, who has come home to Maycomb from her life in New York at 26 to see the truth and hypocrisy of her town, her friends and, most painfully, her beloved father, Atticus Finch, all of whom have joined forces to fight the recent Supreme Court's Brown vs The Board of Education; to keep the NAACP away and less government telling them how to live.  The abolishment of segregation. Jean Louise is appalled and speaks her mind, toe to toe with all and-in a dazzling denoument,  Atticus. The danger to write these characters into corners was everywhere, but Harper Lee brilliantly moved the story with grace and dignity down to the last, moving sentence.<br/>  Jean-Louise is more than shocked at the war she's stepped into. She's betrayed. We take this emotional journey with her as she openly speaks her mind to her family, learning as she goes. The flash backs to her teen years, the internal thoughts of a ladies coffee, the mourning gathering at Calpurnia's house-the woman she loves who raised her- her Uncle's lofty lectures and her Aunt's lectures about a young lady's decorum in society. Aunty's gay son is glossed over with mid century Southern grace. Don't ask; don't tell.<br/>  Don't ask don't tell doesn't work with skin color nor with gender and both these issues are in place and on fire with Lee's "new" book. One wonders if Lee was asked to put this aside because it would've created more controversy than "Mockingbird." To have published "Watchman" in 1956 would have created the sort of anger and shock depicted in "The Help." In 2015, this 60 year old book will generate a LOT of debate. The possibilities are remarkable.<br/>  That one author should change the world with a single book is a wonder. To Kill A Mockingbird, Confessions Of Nat Turner, Catcher In The Rye, All Quiet On The Western Front, Of Mice And Men. It's nothing short of a miracle that sixty years later Harper Lee should do it again.
When you study the literature of any turbulent times, WWII for example, you have to study it from three angles to ensure that you get a full picture and adequate understanding; works contemporary to the events, works that were written after a good 20 years and ones that are from an even much longer distance. The latter would be a historic analysis.<br/>The reason that is, is that the first gives one a full reflection of the emotional experience, but lacks the deep understanding that comes from self analysis with a clear head. That is provided after a good couple of decades and that is what "Go Set A Watchman" provides. The genius of Lee, in my opinion, lies in the fact that she could see with such clarity so early on. This is what I thought of, when the publishers would have advised her that the readers, and probably rightly so, wouldn't be ready for that novel now. She ended up writing the most amazing "emotional narrative".<br/>Today, the reader should be more appreciative of a more analytical work, though not inferior in literary quality. I can think of no better time than now, when the conservatives are going through a crisis of sticking to the same old knee jerk reactions to liberalism and the liberals at a complete<br/>loss of understanding, resulting in the worst bi-partisan politics the country has ever known, to have a wise insight into the reasoning behind both sides' actions.<br/>"To Kill A Mockingbird" was the easy black and white (pun not intended) story. It was easy to know which side you are on. "Go Set A Watchman" is more challenging in that regard and in doing so, it is more "Real" and much more rewarding.<br/>One sentence that stuck with me most, is "YOUR ENDS MAY WELL BE RIGHT (...) BUT YOU CANNOT USE PEOPLE AS YOUR PAWNS. (...) HAVE DONE SOME LOVELY THINGS FOR THEIR LANDS, AND THEY SLAUGHTERED TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DOING THEM."<br/> As the ideas in this novel reach beyond "Racial issues" and hold true to all conflicts, so does this statement serve as a benchmark to the red lines that should be set for the impact of every clash of ideologies.
As an expatriate Southerner I have always felt that "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a fairytale. I never knew anyone like Atticus Finch as portrayed in Mockingbird, and as I have grown more racially aware, I felt it missed a central point: that the heroic figure was not the attorney but the defendant. When I learned that Harper Lee, at 88, had agreed to publish this manuscript, I was distrustful. She had refused for years to release it, and now having read it, I see that it is still raw, needing a lot of work with an astute editor. It might even have been written as a series of linked short stories. And certainly at her age she was in no way able to do the necessary rewriting. But now we have it, and I am happy that I read it, because it lifts my opinion of Nelle Harper Lee as a person if not a novelist.<br/><br/>Towards the end of "Go Set a Watchman", we see the argument of white gentility during the period after Brown v. Board of Education in its attempts to mediate social change—not to give into white savagery or to civil rights activists as portrayed here as the NAACP. It was (and still is) the argument that black Americans are children, one step above savagery, and that they must earn their place in white society. Perhaps Lee's editor didn't know what to make of this in the late 1950s, but in the 21st century we can see (along with Jean Louise Finch) that it was a racist, reactionary ploy to deny personhood to African Americans to whom so much was owed in South Alabama.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have pointed out, this is not a polished, finished work. Yet I gave it four stars because I believe it is important social commentary. I truly hope that Harper Lee has not been manipulated and exploited,and it is my fondest wish that she has agreed finally to have her say about white supremacy and personal responsibility. She was a lot smarter and more perceptive than we knew.
Few books are met with the fanfare that arose when HarperCollins announced this novel was being published this summer. I ordered it as soon as I could, but was prepared to be disappointed when I heard the early reviews. Atticus Finch is one of the most respected, admired, referred-to characters in American Literature. To hear that we (who love To Kill a Mockingbird) are going to be introduced to a more complete picture of this beloved character that is not flattering was reason enough for me to delay reading this book as long as I did. That was a mistake. Not reading this brilliant novel as soon as possible is to deny one the joy of discovering that “more to the story,” when the story is as great as TKaM, cannot be a bad thing.<br/>Whoever wrote this novel did not do so in the 1950’s. This novel is too contemporary (in language, culture, mindset) to have been penned before TKaM. Were it not for the present issues around race relations and equal rights for all people, this book would lack the power it possesses in addressing, from the voice of a trusted writer, how everyone must stand on their own two feet and live out the values they have found within themselves. This message is a difficult one, it seems, to comprehend in this present moment and is even more difficult to walk in; particularly when those values are in direct opposition to those one was taught as a child.<br/>The heart of the story is foreshadowed on page 11. Jean Louise (a.k.a. “Scout”) and her beau Henry are riding in a car with:<br/><br/>“Power Steering? Automatic transmission?” she said<br/>“You bet,” he said<br/>“Well, what if everything shuts off and you don’t have any gears to shift. You’d be in trouble then, wouldn’t you?”<br/>“But everything won’t shut off.”<br/>“How do you know?”<br/>“That’s what faith is. . . .”<br/><br/>The remainder of the book is playing out Jean Louise learning, when everything she thought to be steadfast, immovable and inviolate turned out to be only smoke, false promises and chaos (or “everything shuts off”), what faith truly was. Until faith is fixed from the values and morals one has developed apart from one’s parents/teachers/mentors, then it is void of meaning and strength. Once, however, that “faith” arises from one’s Core-Being, it no longer needs to be defended but must be openly lived.<br/> This is a book that may become a classic due to its association with TKaM. It is a book that takes the reader back to the moment they learned that Santa Claus does not live at the North Pole, babies are not brought by a stork and their parents possess marvelous traits and habits alongside some hideous character flaws. After the shock of such discovery wears off, the individual finds life changed but somehow more full and their place in that altered reality more fully theirs.<br/>There is much more adult language in this book that ever thought possible in TKaM (if it was a movie, it would be rated PG-13), no sex but frequent use of racial slurs to the point I became nauseous. I expect most who read this work will find something by which they will be offended. By its end, however, the reader will reflect and find that those moments of offense were rooted in some bigotry or prejudice too long denied and not confronted.  That is reason enough to read this book.
With all that's been said about Harper Lee's new (second? First? Found? First draft?) book, Go Set a Watchman, it's been hard to form a fully realized opinion. Even before I had opened my copy, social media exploded with denunciations.<br/><br/>Still, with that depressing prelude--who wants to read something that is the subject of a public pillory?--I read it anyway. To be honest, I was disappointed. I passed judgement on the novel as a mishmash of ideas, heavy on dialogue and light on action. Worst, it committed the cardinal sin of messing Atticus Finch, a character I cherished.<br/><br/>In short, my knee jerk response was not very different from anyone else's.<br/><br/>And yet, since finishing a week ago, I haven't been able to let the book go. There was something unsettling to me about how blithely the publication of the novel had been perceived as a greedy money grab by the publisher. The book isn't horrible, though it is a little disappointing, but the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to understand what I had read. A friend opined that in future years the two books (To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman) would be read together as part of literature classes, and it got me wanting to understand better.<br/><br/>And so, I've begun to evolve my opinions about Go Set a Watchman. It is better--no, it is more nuanced--than I initially judged it. More, Atticus is perhaps more nuanced than To Kill a Mockingbird. It is without a doubt worth a read.<br/><br/>Review: Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee<br/>Harper Lee<br/>A little about where the book comes from. According to the publisher, the book was found in Lee’s archives, where she had forgotten that it still existed. In a press release from HarperCollins, Lee explained:<br/><br/>"In the mid-1950s, I completed a novel called Go Set a Watchman. It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel from the point of view of the young Scout. I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told. I hadn't realized it had survived, so was surprised and delighted when my dear friend and lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it. After much thought and hesitation I shared it with a handful of people I trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication. I am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years."<br/><br/>Needless to say, there are plenty who doubt the authenticity of the statement or Lee’s willingness to step into the spotlight. New Republic’s William Giraldi is typical of this group:<br/><br/>"Those crafty touches—“much thought and hesitation,” “my dear friend,” “people I trust”—are trying a tad too hard, wouldn’t you say? The spotlight-shunning Lee is “amazed” that she will once again be subjected to a freshet of attention, the very soaking she’d organized her life to avoid. The only thing amazing here is the expectation that literate people would be hoodwinked by attributed language that bears hallmarks of subterfuge."<br/><br/>To_Kill_a_MockingbirdYeah. No pulling punches there.<br/><br/>Denunciations range from accusations that her agent/attorney bypassed Lee (plenty of snarky comments about the corporate greed of publishing CEOs), that she is too old and senile to know what she's doing, that the book was never really lost in the first place, and, finally, that publication is a coup due to the recent passing of Lee’s longtime caretaker and counsel.<br/><br/>It doesn’t hurt that since Lee had a stroke in 2007 she is said to have trouble seeing and has almost completely lost her hearing. From there it’s not much of a leap for naysayers to dismiss Go Set a Watchman as the greedy exploitation of an aged and famous writer.<br/><br/>The problem? For every denunciation, there is also evidence to the contrary. No less than the New York Times quoted family and friends from Lee’s community that claimed that they had seen her recently and that she was a spry and alert as ever.<br/><br/>"Other people who have seen Ms. Lee more recently say that she is physically frail but completely lucid. Mr. Nurnberg described her as “feisty” when he visited her this month. He said that while she was “indeed hesitant” to publish the book, she had been persuaded by a close circle of people who had read it and assured her that it stood up to her monumental first book.<br/><br/>"Wayne Flynt, an Alabama author and historian who has been close friends with Ms. Lee for more than a decade, said she was as sharp as ever when he visited her on Monday, quoting lines from “Macbeth.”<br/><br/>"“I don’t think that anybody that says she’s demented has been to see her in the last 10 years,” Mr. Flynt said. “The problem may be that almost nobody goes to see her, almost nobody gets in. She’s such a private person.”"<br/><br/>zeplinstumblrcom (1)Nevertheless, as Jonathan Haidt argues in The Righteous Mind, we are not scientists seeking truth, but lawyers seeking supporting evidence of our theses. Or, as the slightly more well-known Taylor Swift puts it, haters gonna hate.<br/><br/>People find the evidence to fit the thesis they want.<br/><br/>In practice, it didn’t take the internet long to jump to absolute dismissal of the entire book. Reducio ad absurdum: the book is an absolute mess and, according to all too many folk who have yet to read the book themselves, should not be read.<br/><br/>To be fair, the one person I know who did read the book was disappointed. Writers don’t tell him how to do his job, and so he won’t tell writers how to do his, he said.<br/><br/>Fair enough. He read and evaluated it for himself.<br/><br/>Which leads to an important point: the difference between reading and passing judgement versus taking your opinion from what the internet mob tells you. Doing the homework--reading the book--is just too hard.<br/><br/>This isn’t an idle gripe, either, or me playing a book snob card. Taking the judgments of the social media jury cum mob as legit is a real and harmful effect on the intellectual life of the average American. American intellectual life shouldn't be rooted in the ivory towers of higher education. On the contrary, healthy democracy sees the working class self-informing and educating, reading and discussing. Sure, elite academics, intellectuals and writers have a place, and I don’t mean to diminish their role. But regular people need to participate, need to engage, and need to decide for themselves what is worthy. If we only “reshare” across social media ad infinitum the gilded opinions of those smarter than ourselves, we are not only selling ourselves short, but also reducing our ability to pass informed judgement.<br/><br/>Go read the book yourself. This is Harper freaking Lee we’re talking about. Even if the book is a failure, the woman produced what is arguably the most famous, most loved, and most memorable American novel of the last century. Something can be learned from such a mind. There'll never another To Kill a Mockingbird, but something can still be gleaned from Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>So...what about the book itself? A failure? A first draft? A worthy successor to Lee’s legacy? Let’s look.<br/><br/>First off, caveat: as a book reviewer: I’m no Allan Bloom, James Wood or Adam Kirsch.<br/><br/>Take this with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>From the minute I started Go Set a Watchman, I quickly fell into the writing. Lee’s style is as drawling and comfortable as the accents of the Deep South cast that fills its pages. And yet, the dialogue is often trite, the story jumbled, and the plot occasionally incongruous. Overall, it still feels like a first draft…which is exactly what the Lee’s editor thought when Lee shopped it around mid-century New York.<br/><br/>And yet, there’s more to it than can be dismissed with vague complaints about the destruction of the Atticus Finch character as a bigot (Michiko Kakutani says that readers will be shocked by Atticus’s “affiliating with raving anti-integration, anti-black crazies, and the reader shares [Scout's] horror and confusion” and indeed, initially at least, this was my reaction). Sure, there is racism, but it's more the McGuffin of the story, as Jason Pettus portrays it in his review, than the theme.<br/><br/>So back to my experience. After flying through the first two-thirds of the novel, I got bogged down and slogged through to the end.  Go Set a Watchman takes place decades after To Kill a Mockingbird and indeed, it is the flashbacks in the book that Lee cribbed for the earlier published novel. In this iteration, Atticus has grown old, joined the local citizens committee that is synonymous with the Dixiecrat groups of the era that passed Jim Crow laws, forced legislatures to raise the Confederate battle flag over state capitals, and generally were responsible for much of the racism that seems so out of place today. Still, his racism feels circumstantial, a factor of his era, and if he is a bigot, he is the outlier among his people, making the best of the bad.<br/><br/>And yet, there’s something in how Atticus is portrayed that falls short of the poisonous bigot that arm chair liberals denounce. Atticus is just not that simple, though it took me a bit of time to put my finger on why. Pettus’ review, again:<br/><br/>"[T]here were plenty of reasons for Southerners to get behind racist organizations like these back then besides just pure racism; take Scout's enlightened fiancée, for example, who joins the citizens' council for the same reason he might join the Rotary Club, because he's a rising young lawyer and to not do so would damage his career. Or take Atticus himself, who as we learn by the end of the book hasn't really changed his stance towards black people from how he felt twenty years ago -- his joining the citizens' council has almost nothing to do with hating a man for the color of his skin, and almost everything to do with his obsessive belief in state rights versus a big federal government, and with his personal identity as a Jeffersonian liberal who believes that people need to "earn" the privileges of a free democracy by being informed, conscientious citizens who contribute to the greater good, not to have those privileges ram-rodded down everyone's throats by a meddling organization like the NAACP."<br/><br/>Atticus’ concerns aren’t about racism so much as the interference of outsiders who don’t know or understand the local nuances, let alone have a vested interest in the future of the communities they parachute in to change. Atticus is concerned about the impact on the Constitution, on personal liberties, etc., in the “noble but misguided name of forcing "equality" on a situation that politically and economically can't handle it, complaints that even the urban liberal Scout sometimes agrees with over the course of the book[,]” argues Pettus.<br/><br/>Yes, Atticus still behaves like a racist but, and this has been largely ignored, he would still be the first to defend a black man falsely accused.<br/><br/>Which is entirely consistent with Atticus Finch that we all know and admire. If Lee has a theme here, it may be that life is much more complicated than the more simplistic black hat/white hat world she portrays in To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Could Lee have released the Go Set a Watchman right now for reasons other than the money (and let’s just all agree that the publisher doesn’t need other motives)? Could she be looking back at her legacy, recognizing that the simplistic morality of To Kill a Mockingbird is an unsatisfactory depiction of her view of the world?<br/><br/>Judge for yourself. Pick up Go Set a Watchman, read it and consider if it isn’t more about the complexities of human relationships, of memory and of the passage of time than about racism and justice. It may not be the book that I wanted or expected, but I wonder if perhaps the judgments levied are perhaps too simplistic.
Yawn!
What a sad day when the best hero of all time is destroyed by his own creator! Atticus Finch made us all wish that we could be better people. And that the world could become a better place. We didn't need or want him to be less than that. Yet the author, whose book To Kill a Mockingbird, is my favorite book of all time , has written an Atticus bereft of humanity and integrity and bound by the same racist ideology as all ignorant people. Did Harper Lee need money? Is that why she let greedy people convince her it was a good idea to publish her first book which, at the time, she was wise enough to set aside for Mockingbird, a truly gorgeous piece of literature?. I'm a writer. I would rather die in poverty than kill my character. Most of us will never get close to creating an Atticus. Scout at least remains true to form as an adult come home for a visit from New York, where she lives and works. Everything has changed, all the most important people in her life have changed, as well as the world she grew up in. She has to come to terms with the changes while holding close her own beliefs, inspired in her youth by the now unidentifiable Atticus. . The adult Scout is not very interesting. She speechifies a lot. As does Atticus, her uncle and Henry, also destroyed by Lee. The only parts of the book that remind us of Lee's brilliance are the flashbacks to Scout's childhood which retain the sense of place and the fullness of character and the magic of childhood on every page of Mockingbird. Fortunately, I can choose to ignore this book and keep Mockingbird and the world and people Lee created in my heart. The only and probably worthwhile reason to read this book is to see how far Lee had to travel as a human being from being a racist or at least susceptible to the thoughts of her time and town and create an Atticus Finch who stood for and eternally will stand for the very best in all of us. For that journey and for Mockingbird, I will applaud Lee, despite this obvious misstep.
I very much appreciated the content and issues raised in this novel and the timeliness of the prose written fifty years ago and yet we continue to struggle with so many of these racial issues today. Harper Lee had keen insight and wisdom on the conflicts in the South when she wrote this book. There were Southerns who embraced the forthcoming changes and there were white Southerns who adamantly opposed integration, the mandates by the government and the expanding influence of the NAACP. I was struck by the wisdom she brought forth in this book and the issues we are facing in 2015 with taking down the Confederate flag and the killing of seven innocent black citizens in Charleston, South Carolina.<br/>Scout struggled with the racism she saw in Atticus and Hank Clinton. She had seen a new way of looking at the world after living in New York City. She was always color blind and the newfound racism in her family and the cold shoulder she received from Calpurnia after Zeebo killed Mr. Healy forced Scout to see the world through a new lens. Her Uncle Jack Finch requests Scout to remain in Maycomb, Alabama because the community needed her courage, strength and insights to help bridge them into the new world order.<br/>I identified with Scout and her recognition that she probably never fit into Maycomb. She had always been an outsider. While it was home, it no longer was home. She had transcended the local world even when she was a child.<br/>I think other readers have overblown the concern that Atticus is a racist. First, this is fiction so get over it. Second, Lee addressed the issue quite well. Uncle Jack stated to Scout that Atticus would stand by the law no matter his personal beliefs. To me, Atticus then took the high road. He put the law over his personal prejudices. It explained why he defended the black boy in "To Kill A Mockingbird." I found this twist on Atticus's persona to be an interesting plot twist.<br/>I just finished reading "Something Must Be Done About Prince Edward County" where the public schools were closed in the 1950's so the whites wouldn't have to integrate their children with blacks. I thought of the two books and thought Attitcus would have defended the federal law even though he may have disagreed with the NAACP's role in pushing for integration and his own personal beliefs for Scout and the children of Maycomb. I admired this in Attitcus because he upheld the law which is his responsibility as a lawyer when he took his oath.<br/>Very thought provoking book with a message which withstands the test of time.<br/><br/>"Had she insight, could she have pierced the barriers of her highly selective, insular world, she may have discovered that all her life she had been with a visual defect which had gone unnoticed and neglected by herself and by those closest to her: she was color blind."<br/>"Why doesn't their flesh creep? How can they devoutly believe everything they hear in church and then say the things they do and listen to the things they hear without throwing up? I thought I was a Christian but I'm not. I'm something else and I don't know what. Everything I have ever taken for right and wrong these people have taught me-these same, these very people. So it's me, it's not them. Something has happened to me."<br/>"Blind, that's what I am. I never opened my eyes. I never thought to look into people's hearts, I only looked in their faces. Stone blind...Mr. Stone. Mr. Stone set a watchman in church yesterday. He should have provided me with one. I need a watchman to lead me around and declare what he Seth every hour on the hour. I need a watchman to tell me this is what a man says but this is what he means, to draw a line down the middle and say here is this justice and there is that justice and make me understand the differences. I need a watchman to go forth and proclaim to them all that twenty-six years is too long to play a joke on anybody, not matter how funny it is."<br/>"Now at this very minute, a political philosophy foreign to it is being pressed on the South, and the South's not ready for it-we're finding ourselves in the same deep waters. As sure as time, history is repeating itself, and as sure as man is man, history is the last place he'll look for lessons. I hope to God it'll be a comparatively bloodless Reconstruction this time."<br/>"The white supremacists are really pretty smart. If they can't scare us with the essential inferiority line, they'll wrap it in a miasma of sex, because that's the one thing they know is feared in our fundamentalist hearts down here. They try to strike terror in Southern mothers, lest their children grow up to fall in love with Negros. If they didn't make an issue of it, the issue would rarely arise. If the issue arose it would be met on private ground. The NAACP has a hat deal to answer for in that department, too. But the white supremacists fear reason, because they know cold reason beats them. Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends."
I played the prosecuting attorney in a Richland Players production of "To Kill a Mockingbird". It was my character's task to prosecute Tom Robinson, a black man, for the alleged rape of a white woman. Never for a moment did I like what I was doing but I was doing my job just as Atticus Finch, the defendant's lawyer, was doing his. Both men were loyal to a fault to the principles of law. Now we know with the publication of "Go Set a Watchman", Harper Lee's until now unpublished work, that there was more to Atticus than meets the eye (thus the title "Watchman" I think), just as the Prosecuting Attorney Mr. Gilmer may have been more complicated than the task he was about to perform for the court.<br/><br/>One might argue the publication of “Go Set a Watchman” was simply a publisher’s ploy to extract more money out the reading public while destroying the good reputation of its hero Atticus Finch and abusing its creator, but I see it differently. I see “Go Set a Watchman” as the real story in Harper Lee’s elegant and courageous story of people and family in her life and her coming of age and maturity in a prejudiced and segregated south. “To Kill a Mockingbird” was a child’s fantasy of a father who became the keeper of morality in the small town of Maycomb, the hero of course to the segregated black community…”Stand up Scout, you’re father’s passing” says the Rev Sykes.<br/><br/>But Atticus as we learn in “Go Set a Watchman” is more complicated than that, sharing prejudices of superiority and fears of black assimilation that are common to Maycomb (and much of our country still). It is, I believe, a much more believable story for this reason and more compelling in its reality despite the literary quality of its predecessor “To Kill a Mockingbird”.<br/><br/>I have no proof only an instinct that the first error was the publisher who diverted Harper Lee from publishing her first story because “Watchman” would not sell as well at the time. The times kept calling for a “white hero” to save the “black man” so we all could feel good about the guilt we have for so long tried to repress over the legacy of slavery. “To Kill a Mockingbird” served the reading public nicely in that regard. Now we finally may have some traction on that collective guilt and acceptance of ourselves for our ambivalence and lack of courage to speak out against the injustice and immorality of racial prejudice. It only took a young 26 year old woman, Jean Louise Finch (Scout), returning home to her family to reveal the truth. Her journey will enlighten you.<br/><br/>The Confederate Battle Flag is coming down in some places now but it needs to come down to a greater extent in the collective heart and soul of this nation and its people.<br/><br/>Do read “Go Set a Watchman”! It is powerfully written and consequential, speaking directly to the reader’s life and experience. It may change your outlook.
This is a very complicated  review for me to write. First of all I almost refused to read this at all because, like many other "To Kill  a Mockingbird"/Atticus Finch fans, I was at first devastated  by  the thought of Atticus  as a racist. I was afraid the Atticus Finch legacy would be ruined for me. Furthermore, I question whether Harper Lee truly wanted this to be published or if this is just an example of a publishing house taking advantage of her situation in pursuit of the big bucks.  However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted to read this from the perspective  of reading the earlier, UNPUBLISHED  draft of what would ultimately become an all time classic. So I approached this as though I had just stepped into the Bizarro World in which Atticus Finch is a segregationist and Jean Louise Finch is all grown up...<br/><br/>So first I am going to attempt to review this book in a vacuum, as if it is a one-of-a-kind novel that was accepted for publication from the get go...and of course in an alternate reality where there is no "To Kill a Mockingbird".  This is a book about Jean Louise Finch, who, after returning for a visit to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama in the aftermath of the Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, is shocked to find that her father, Atticus, and her childhood love, Henry, are both involved in racist activities while her nurse and caretaker from her childhood, Calpurnia, will have nothing to do with her.  The writing itself flows nicely, although the most interesting sections are those that take us back to Jean Louise's (aka "Scout's") childhood and to some brief references to a court case from those years when her father defended a black man falsely accused of rape.  However, these and other anecdotes about Scout's youth, were often lightly connected to the central plot and seemed more like literary padding  ...  or perhaps the seeds of another story just waiting to emerge.  The overall themes revolved around racial issues of the time and a young woman's grownup disillusioned understanding of her father and her hometown, leaving the reader wondering if this young woman will be courageous enough to stick to her convictions in spite of all this.<br/><br/>So now I step out of the Bizarro World and talk a bit about two different versions of Atticus Finch. In many ways the Atticus of "Go Set A Watchman"  was a more realistic mirror of the times the book represents. Here we have a lawyer willing to defend a black man....but only so the case won't "get into the wrong hands", in this case meaning the NAACP. He fears the results of desegregation and has ideas that would label him a white supremacist, albeit a non-violent one.  This was probably  the way many southern lawyers thought at the time. However, sometimes society needs larger than life hero, and in 1960, with the Civil Right Movement marching forward, Americans needed such a literary icon as Atticus Finch to make us understand injustice and inequality  in a way that had never been done before. That's the Atticus Finch of "To Kill a Mockingbird."<br/><br/>There's another major difference between "Go Set a Watchman" and "To Kill a Mockingbird".  While the unpublished draft  is a book about racial tensions and Scout's grownup understanding of her father, To Kill a Mockingbird  is so much more. Yes ... it is about racial inequality but it is also a book about accepting  those who are different . Boo Radley's story (which is not mentioned at all in "Go Set a Watchman") is as important as that of Tom Robinson because it transforms what otherwise would have been a primarily race novel into a novel about what it means to accept differences amongst all people.  Whether you are a falsely accused Tom Robinson or a misunderstood  Boo Radley, you are a human being and want to be treated as such. This is the message conveyed by Harper Lee through the book that was actually  published  in 1960 ... this is why it is that story that has endured throughout the decades.<br/><br/>Ok, so what about the legacy of Atticus Finch?  Does "Go Set a Watchman"  change this?  In my opinion, the answer is a resounding "No."  Remember that "Go Set a Watchman" was never going to be published and Harper Lee diligently went about the challenging task that all good writers face of re-writing and editing her original manuscript until it was transformed into an incredible literary work. The creative talent she put into developing Atticus Finch's character and thus creating a fictional hero is evident in "To Kill a Mockingbird" and therefore that is the Atticus who I'll always know and love.
This book was a fascinating read. I re-read "To Kill a Mockingbird" directly before starting into this one, so it was easy to see how the story morphed over time. There were some descriptions and anecdotes quoted verbatim in both books, for example, and some of the character timelines didn't quite match up. There was the obvious contradiction of the Robinson case, which had an entirely different set-up and outcome in "Mockingbird" than is described in "Watchman," and the Radleys are noticeably absent from even a passing reference. Dill, Miss Maudie, and Miss Rachel are barely mentioned, and Stephanie Crawford and Heck Tate are also missing. Uncle Jack seems to be almost a completely different character, though his eccentricities are described as being more recent than the events of "Mockingbird." Calpurnia deeply surprised and disappointed me. The love that she showed for the Finches even above some of her own friends and family in the first book would, I felt, have led to a different outcome for her in "Watchman." The character of Hank seems to have come into their lives the year after "Mockingbird," which makes perfect sense with the timeline, and of course, the biggest character omission was Jem, who heartbreakingly died several years before this story takes place. He's mentioned frequently in flashbacks, but his adult presence is sorely missed. And lastly, a particular racial slur was used liberally by the characters in both novels, though in "Watchman," Scout claims that she'd never heard the word used by anyone in her family or close acquaintance until recently. Again, that directly contradicts the other book. These points are minor, however, and the overall story is a good one.<br/><br/>With the current political climate in the United States, this book is very timely with its message that you can't legislate acceptance and approval; its Libertarian reading of the Constitution (especially the 10th Amendment); its disapproval of federal and judicial activism; and the main theme of treating everyone with civility and respect, even with you fundamentally disagree with their opinions. That's the true definition of tolerance. Certain segments of the population these days (on both ends of the political spectrum) are insistent that the word means support and approval, but it doesn't. It means to tolerate something you don't agree with, and tolerance is the main thread tying both books together. Atticus spends much of his dialogue in "Mockingbird" making that exact point, and it was made here again just as forcefully, though in a different way.<br/><br/>The writing isn't quite as refined as it is in "Mockingbird," but it's still very solid, especially when taking into consideration that it was the first draft of Ms. Lee's first novel. Her talent is undeniable, and I thoroughly enjoyed my trip back to Macomb. It was also interesting to see Scout as an adult. She's immediately recognizable, with many of the very same character traits she exhibited as child, and her preference for wearing pants over dresses. A quick editing job or a possible rewrite would have cleared up all of the minor discrepancies and tightened the writing, but I understand why that simply wasn't possible. I'm grateful to have the book in any form, but if you're reading the books one after the other, even the small issues will be noticeable.<br/><br/>In short: a very solid, engrossing effort, and well worth the read.
Jean Louise Finch, AKA Scout, returned to Maycomb County, Alabama, for her annual summer visit and it doesn’t take her long to scandalize the place.  Aunty Alexandra is aghast over the gossip flying around town that Jean Louise and childhood sweetheart, Hank, went skinny-dipping at Finch’s Landing.  Atticus Finch, now in his seventies and plagued by arthritis, with his fabled even demeanor, observes that her dress is wrinkled from recently drying.  After church Atticus and Hank head for downtown to attend the Citizens’ Council meeting.  Jean Louise is dumbstruck.  She sneaks into the colored loft of the courthouse, as she had done so many times, and eavesdrops on the proceedings.  Dumbstruck turns to horrorstruck when she hears the rantings of a white supremacist who her father had just introduced.  The turmoil of the birth of the civil rights era is Scout’s coming of age moment and not in any happy way.<br/><br/>If Harper Lee were not a great writer she should still win acclaim for choosing great titles.  Go Set a Watchman is of course the long lost sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, but it is not quite on par with that sixty-year-old classic.  Although oozing with wisdom and elegant phrasing, some parts are dense and obtuse.  I found myself rereading passages, and more than once, failing to grasp the intent of the words.  A few sentences I just did not understand at all.  Whereas To Kill a Mockingbird is written in first person, Go Set a Watchman is an odd mix of all three persons, sometimes within a single paragraph.  This reader, at least, has the impression that this manuscript was rushed to publication and that it would benefit from more judicious editing.  Nevertheless, it is a vital piece of work not to be missed.
Great
The Internet is ablaze with criticisms and accolades alike for Go Set A Watchman. Was the manuscript newly discovered or long buried? Bear in mind the book was a prequel in thought and sequel in publication to the Pulitzer Prize winning classic To Kill A Mockingbird. If you do, you will understand much of the hullabaloo gracing our computer screens.<br/><br/>Read it for what it was intended to be—a rough draft for a yet-to-be-developed stunning book.<br/><br/>If you read it, you will find:<br/><br/>• Characterizations, but little character development.<br/>• Setting in the Deep South with much dialogue, but little plot development.<br/>• Socio-political commentary on the tempestuous nature of the 1950s in Scout’s beloved Maycomb, Alabama.<br/>• Diatribes by a twenty-six year old main character, whose viewpoints were influenced by her experience in the more progressive north during her college years.<br/>• Disappointment in seeing Jean Louise’s precious father, Atticus Finch, in his later years, with perspectives mutated from those he held when he raised her.<br/><br/>That being said, Atticus Finch, at age seventy-two, has a wider worldview, a greater understanding of how slowly society changes. He lives his life simply and with integrity. Knowing he can’t change all the wrongs amidst the races, he tells his grownup daughter, “Every man’s island, Jean Louise, every man’s watchman, is his conscience.” And thus, Harper Lee arrived at her title.<br/><br/>Even geniuses need preparatory work. I can picture Harper Lee sitting across her editor’s desk awaiting comments on her first manuscript. I can envision that editor saying to her, “May I suggest you write this from the viewpoint of Scout as a youngster…and make it into a story this time.” The result was a Pulitzer Prize winning classic.
I know that there has been some controversy about this book. I can see why, but I wonder if everyone had been required to finish the book before commenting on it if there would be less of it. Since the book is written from Scout's perspective, the reader, like Scout, does not fully understand all of the reasons that Atticus does the things that he does until they are explained very near the end of the book. Some may argue, with good reason, that he is still wrong. Scout certainly does. But how many of us are perfect? How many of us would like to have all of our actions and motives for them argued on a national stage? Atticus is human with human failings. Okay, actually Atticus is a fictional character. But how many reviews have you read where the reviewer complains if the characters are one dimensional. That the bad guys are pure evil with no redeeming qualities and that the "hero" has no flaws at all? Harper Lee's characters are certainly well rounded with good and bad qualities all mixed up together.<br/><br/>I do not think this book would have been so controversial if it had been published at the time it was first written because generations would not have read about and known Scout and Atticus. In fact, if you have not read To Kill a Mockingbird, or at least seen the movie, you may have trouble following and understanding the book. I can't say for sure since I have both read the book and seen the movie more than once. The book is a little unpolished. More than once I wondered if a paragraph or two might be missing. But I could hear Harper Lee's voice in the writing and it reminded me how much I liked reading To Kill a Mockingbird. Especially how much I liked reading it for the first time. In fact I intended to re-read it before starting this book but did not. I will, however, do it now.<br/><br/>There are flashbacks and memories that Scout has of herself, Dill, Jem, and Hank during and after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird. These are the best parts of the book although that may be because I liked the first book so much. I laughed out loud several times during these flashbacks. I do wish that the book had told more of what happened to Jem and Dill in their later lives but they are not really central characters of this book so I can understand why it did not. But, like old friends, you hope to hear what they have been doing since you last heard news of them.<br/><br/>Back to the controversy. I am not an English teacher, and I realize that this may be unreasonable to expect, but I would love to see both of Harper Lee's books studied back to back and I would love to listen too, and even participate in, a discussion comparing them and trying to understand them together.
I had a hard time deciding between 3 stars and 4. But saying "It's OK" just didn't feel right, so I'm going with "I liked it." I'm not going to rehash the controversy about whether or not Atticus disappoints and whether or not this destroys one of the most important plot points of a major American classic. What I am going to focus on is what the book actually is. It's clearly an early (if not a first) draft of a first novel by a clearly talented writer. Harper Lee's voice comes through clear and strong here, and, as anyone who has read Mockingbird knows, it is one of the most distinctive voices of 20th Century American literature. I'm sorry she decided not to go through an editing process prior to publication of Watchman. I think with a good editor, it could have been a fine book - if not up to the standard of Mockingbird, at least on a similar level. But the book needs a strong editor's hand. It lags in many places. It's difficult to follow in places. References are at times so obscure as to be incomprehensible. Jean Louise is alternately languorous and shrill. I'll also say that I miss Jem and Cal, though.<br/><br/>The other reason for 4 stars instead of 3 is the utter delight at seeing the small little kernel of Mockingbird that a brilliant editor saw and then helped nurture into one of my favorite books of all time. Seeing a great American novel in those 2 or 3 paragraphs and then helping Ms. Lee expand them is, perhaps, one of the greatest services an editor has ever accomplished for American literature.<br/><br/>In all, I liked the book for what it was - the story of a young woman coming to terms with the fallibility of her idolized father and adored childhood friend, and her perceived betrayal by her town and, perhaps most cruelly, the woman who raised her. But had this book not led to Mockingbird, Harper Lee would not be the icon of the American literary canon that she is. She would be a footnote instead of a shining star.
To Kill A Mockingbird has always been one of my favorite books. I read it every few years and have since the 6th grade. I also love the movie. When I heard a previously unreleased manuscript by Harper Lee was being released I had a few turbulent thoughts. The first was that it was fake and the second was that it would screw up my opinion of the first book. I don't think it is fake. The tone is too consistent and the conversational style and wording is also spot on. But it does change the way you perceive the characters and for that reason I wish it had not been released.<br/>Go Set A Watchman was obviously written 50+ years ago. You can tell the PC police have done some editing, but because the time frame the book was written in it is littered with derogatory terms about blacks. I don't expect a book from that time frame to be cleaned up, because let's face it, racism was horrible back then. Doesn't make it acceptable, but it does make it consistent with that time frame. However, what I do not like is that in bringing the characters forward in time, Scout is now 26, Atticus 72, the author actually demotes the integrity and nobility of the characters by their statements and behavior. From my understanding Go Set A Watchman was actually written first, but Harper Lee's agent wanted her to explore the flashback sections of Scout's childhood more than the older version. So To Kill A Mockingbird came about and created a version of southern childhood we have all grown up with. Go Set AWatchman has now torn it down. I don't hate the book, but I don't admire it. I don't like the reduction of the characters to less admirable people. All told I think Harper Lee's legacy would have been better served without it. Because now the nobility of her characters is tarnished and the cold truths of her first novel have become merely figments in her second. It's better to be a one book wonder than a two book disappointer.
The Enigma That Is Atticus Finch<br/>by Don Sugg<br/><br/>“People generally see what they look for and hear what they listen for.”<br/>― Harper Lee, To Kill a Mockingbird<br/><br/>Although not nearly as artfully crafted as her classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee’s 1957 first novel, Go Set a Watchman, contains flashes of why she is considered by many to be one of the premier twentieth century American novelists. This newly published novel had been rejected for publication until Lee re-wrote it from the perspective of Jean Louise, not as an adult, but as a child ranging in age between six and eight. To Kill a Mockingbird, subsequently went on to become one of the most widely read and deeply beloved American novels and films of all time, read and viewed by millions of students and adults alike. In Watchman’s first chapter, Lee immerses the reader in the same small, imaginary, and seemingly bucolic town of Maycomb, Alabama, in a manner that even the most ardent of Yankees will embrace.  However, as one might suspect, there is something rotten in the town of Maycomb.<br/>Although Watchman focuses on the same characters we learned to love in Mockingbird, albeit twenty years later, the public reaction to it has been dramatically different. Despite there having been more pre-publication anticipation of Watchman than any novel since the Harry Potter series, there has been widespread indignation and gnashing of teeth by Mockingbird fans who, upon reading Watchman, discover that their sainted hero, Atticus Finch, turns out to be a far more complex, three-dimensional human being - one with warts, secrets, prejudices, and all. One couple, who had named their son Atticus, actually went so far as to have his name legally changed after they read Watchman.<br/>The great Canadian author, Robertson Davies, once wrote “You never read the same book twice”.  This is certainly true of To Kill a Mockingbird. Taking the opportunity afforded by the publication of Watchman to revisit Mockingbird from an adult perspective and engaging in a careful, more critical reading, the reader may well come away with a very different view of Atticus Finch.  Looking beyond the naïve perspective of his adoring daughter, Scout, and closely examining the more subtle facts of the story, we can see what a flawed man Atticus actually is - both as an attorney and as a father. Of his three criminal cases mentioned in the book, his first two ended with his clients being hanged. In the third, his client, Tom Robinson, is wrongly convicted of raping a white woman and subsequently commits suicide-by-cop.  Even though Atticus knew full well that Tom could never receive a fair trial in racist Maycomb, he negligently fails to file a pre-trial motion for change of venue. Upon being asked why, he simply mumbles an inaudible response. On cross-examination, he never asks Mayella about sending her siblings away so that she could seduce Tom, nor does he call any of them as witnesses to corroberate Tom’s story. Despite complaining in his closing argument that the prosecution provided no medical evidence that a rape had been committed, Atticus himself fails to produce any medical testimony regarding Tom's disability. Instead he relies on a cheap and ultimately unconvincing courtroom stunt that could easily have been faked. Although it makes for a compelling visual image in both the book and the film, it simply doesn’t pass for good trial practice. Thus despite Atticus’s claims to the contrary, the only apparent issue available to poor Tom on appeal would seem to have been ineffective assistance of counsel.<br/>Atticus also proves himself to be an even worse father than attorney. Although the rest of the town attends the school pageant, Atticus selfishly and neglectfully refuses to escort Scout, electing instead to stay home and pay Jem to take her in his stead. He does this knowing that Bob Ewell who had threatened revenge on Atticus for his defense of Tom Robinson was openly accusing Atticus of getting him fired from his WPA job. Ewell had also recently attempted to break into Judge Taylor’s house and repeatedly harassed Tom Robinson’s widow, Helen. Had Atticus taken Scout to the pageant himself, Bob Ewell’s attack on Jem and Scout likely would never have occurred. Even after the attack, Atticus shows no remorse for his poor decision. Incredulously, Atticus, an experienced criminal defense attorney, actually encourages Sheriff Tate to bring a homicide charge against Jem for killing Bob Ewell. He does this despite the fact that Jem’s diminutive size and broken arm would have logically precluded him from having committed the stabbing. Why didn’t Atticus wait until Jem had regained consciousness and gotten his version of the events?  When Boo Radley carried the injured and unconscious Jem home, why didn’t he even ask Boo Radley what had happened?  How was Jem rendered unconscious after he had supposedly mortally wounded Ewell? Why was Atticus so willing, even anxious, to bring Jem to trial for the death of the very man whose testimony convinced the jury to find the innocent Tom Robinson guilty of rape?  The obvious answer to these questions is that the seemingly wise and virtuous Atticus had such faith in the judicial system (despite the fact that it had convicted the innocent Tom Robinson), that he was convinced that a jury would see that Jem acted in self-defense and acquit him of any wrongdoing.  But if we are to accept this as true, where was Atticus's faith in and devotion to the law only moments later when he was more than willing to be complicit in withholding material evidence that it was Boo Radley and not Jem who had in fact killed Bob Ewell?  It begs credulity to think that Aticus might share Sheriff Tate’s concern with protecting Boo Radley from the ladies of Maycomb bringing him cake to the extent that he would be willing to jeopardize his own son’s life and liberty. Was he more apprehensive of the impact that the appearance of a cover-up of a crime allegedly committed by Jem would have on his own reputation and political career than he was for Jem’s wellbeing?  The often overlooked beauty of Mockingbird is the fact that for the careful and thoughtful reader, these remain open questions.<br/><br/>In Go Set a Watchman, Atticus is again shown to be a flawed hero. However, this time the moral imperfections of his daughter, Jean Louise (Scout in Mockingbird), are likewise brought to light. In the end, both characters' bigotry is exposed. But even more importantly, so is the bigotry of readers who fail to recognize that Lee is again challenging them to walk in another's shoes. But whereas it was relatively  easy for the empathetic reader to walk in the shoes of Tom Robinson or Boo Radley, here Lee demands that readers take a more uncomfortable walk in the shoes of mid-twentieth century southerners, people who see their culture, values, and customs being decimated by the likes of the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education and an army of invading northern NAACP attorneys. Atticus recognizes full well both the need for and the inevitability of change. He simply objects to how the changes being rammed down their throats by what he sees as arrogant and equally bigoted northerners.<br/>Lee’s call for tolerance and acceptance in Watchman brings to mind President Abraham Lincoln’s then nearly century old admonition to a war-torn country at the end of his Second Inaugural Address:<br/>With malice toward none, and charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. (emphasis added)<br/>Of Mockingbird, Flannery O’Connor observed that “for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is."  But critic Stephen Metcalff was not only a little kinder, he was a little closer to the mark when he stated that “To Kill a Mockingbird is a type of literature Americans are most comfortable abiding, because it makes them most abidingly comfortable with themselves.” Go Set a Watchman provides no such comfort for its readers, which likely played a role in the book originally being rejected for publication.  Rather, Watchman provides a rude awakening for those Mockingbird fans who share the younger Jean Louise’s blind adoration of Atticus. Here, when Jean Louise proves unable to walk in the shoes of Calpurnia, the black servant who had raised her as a child, she is then shocked and emotionally crushed by Calpurnia’s rejection of her offer to have Atticus defend her grandson and Calpurnia’s ability to only see “white folks” when she looks at Jean Louise. In a similar manner, Lee holds up a mirror to those readers who rather comfortably felt able to walk in the shoes of a Tom Robinson or Boo Radley by laying bare their inability to take a little stroll in the shoes of an aging, flawed, and yes, bigoted mid-twentieth century southern gentleman. I suspect that despite its relative lack of literary artistry, Ms. O’Connor would be far more pleased with Watchman than she was with Mockingbird.<br/>Just as the adult Jean Louise learns to look beyond her idealized childhood image of Atticus, Lee demands the same of her reader.  Accordingly, it would be a mistake to simply dismiss Watchman as yet another bitter coming of age story with the adult child suddenly recognizing the previously idealized parent’s imperfections. Jean Louise comes to terms with her own frailties, imperfections and character deficiencies by way of learning to appreciate this more fully human Atticus Finch.  By virtue of Atticus’s unconditional acceptance and even celebration of the development of his daughter’s independent mind - in spite of the bitterly scathing and venomous personal attack she levies at him - the Atticus of Watchman proves to be a far wiser, loving, and indeed more heroic father than Scout’s naïve childhood image of him that was shared by most Mockingbird readers.<br/>Clearly, Watchman is not a book about redemption. However, when it is read together with Mockingbird, the two books combine to provide a powerful insight into not just the necessity for but also the difficulty of attaining tolerance, acceptance, and ultimately reconciliation - on both individual and cultural levels.<br/>Unfortunately, after having their saintly image of Atticus Finch shattered, I fear that far too many teachers who have for years or even decades devotedly taught their students to emulate his seemingly uncompromising virtues will refuse to accept the fundamental truth of a flawed Atticus as revealed by a careful reading of Mockingbird in conjunction with a reading of Watchman. They will reject the opportunity to use Watchman to teach their students just how profoundly difficult wrestling with ideas and beliefs that conflict with their own can be. In doing so, they will deny their students a unique opportunity to develop their own more informed, open-minded, and tolerant worldview, one which is required to deal with a world populated by people who are far more complex than the cookie-cutter characters presented by Scout’s innocent and youthful perspective in Mockingbird. For such teachers, walking in the shoes of another applies only to those whose shoes already fit their own feet.
While most readers, held their breath in anticipation of Harper Lee's second novel,Go Set a Watchman, it did not reach its full promise. Many wondered how the independent spirit of Scout would develop as she grew up. While some guessed (perhaps from snippets of pre-publication press) that their hero Atticus might be shown to have clay feet, some disappointment ensued with the depth of racism in Atticus' character, and satisfaction ensued in Jean Louise's independence and abandonment of the southern lady code of ethics as espoused by Aunt Alexandra. Yet one must accept the basis of the story: strong racist feelings in the South at this time. Most southerners, even the most enlightened, like Atticus, believed Negroes to be inferior in every way, and that civil rights for them must be postponed, perhaps forever. One wonders how the trial of Zeebo, grandson of beloved Finch housekeeper, Calpurnia, will end. After all, he had killed a white man even though the victim was drunk and apparently walked into the path of Zeebo's car. Will Atticus' love of the law extend to the spirit of the law, or will white jurors sentence the hapless Zeebo to prison?<br/>While the book treats the same characters as To Kill a Mockingbird, they could well have other names. There is not much connection to the Atticus and Scout of the former book, except perhaps Jean Louise's obstinance,  In Mockingbird, Atticus was enamored of justice. In Watchman, he is enamored of the law--a disappointing bit of character development in my view.<br/>I suppose one question readers had going in was would Lee's writing be at the same level of excellence in this earlier book as it was in Mockingbird? I found the second half of the book slow going with its long conversations with both Atticus and Dr. Jack trying to calm Jean Louise into understanding the southern point of view regarding Negroes. I thought the dialogue somewhat confusing and the arguments not very lucid, putting the brakes on the tempo of the many flashbacks recounting the childhood adventures of Scout, Jem and Dill as well as the present<br/>escapades of Jean Louise and Henry.  However, I was intrigued by the character of Dr. Jack and his place in the Finch family. Does Ms. Lee have another book in her? If she does, I hope it features Dr. Jack.<br/>All in all, Go Set a Watchman is worth reading as an accurate picture of race relations in post-World War II America. I can imagine it in many book clubs this season perhaps reading it first and Mockingbird second.
I'm not gonna lie. This was for many reasons a painful read. I got it on Kindle, and let me say first off, that Reese Witherspoon does a masterful job. I have loved TKAM since I first read it (on my own, not a school assignment) in the late 60s/early 70s. I also loved the movie, which I considered to be that rarest of all movies, that was absolutely as good as the book. I was rightly concerned about ruining my TKAM experience, by reading this book. And absolutely, it was the letdown I feared. And *sigh*, I'm okay with that. I have read of the controversies associated with the publication of this book, and also read that these controversies were painful to Ms. Lee, and that she did indeed wish for and look forward to, the publication of GSAW. I am above all things, grateful for Ms. Lee's courage for publishing this book and being willing to stick her neck out to be stomped on, since I'm sure there will be many who will do just that, for so many reasons. Since this is a review, I will say that this book is a fascinating read, just to see the talent of Ms. Lee growing and blossoming within her story. She is at her best, when she writes about what she knows, and one thing she really knew was childhood, and feeling on the outside of the whole Southern Lady thing. And she knows the South. Love and romance--not so much, which her character Scout even admits to herself. The hard, Hard, HARDEST thing about this book by far, is the unflinching portrait that Ms. Lee painted of the South, including the letdown she experiences with Atticus. Hard for her, hard for me, it will be hard for all of us who have loved and even idolized Atticus for being a man of courage and integrity. Interestingly, I had just reread (that is, listened to) TKAM, and in listening carefully, I admit that I heard the hints of paternalism in his racial views of society and was disconcerted by it, and could finally understand those who object to TKAM for those reasons. It was dismaying to me to recognize that it had taken me this long in my life to get that aspect of the book, which has made it controversial. But rather than reject the book, I believe that this makes it an accurate reflection of the issues. It serves as an accurate historical perspective. What is only hinted at in TKAM comes through loudly and clearly in GSAW. The realization of her father's views, and Calpurnia's, is childhood's end for Scout, and for readers, and it is a devastating blow--I confess I cried real tears. It is painful reading. But it is honest, and accurately portrays the South. I am really of the opinion that you cannot understand the South if you haven't lived there. I had the opportunity to live there for just over a year in 1989-90, in Augusta, GA. That by no means makes me an expert, but at least I was able to see that I had never understood anything about the South before. I was astounded to observe the racial tensions and divisions that still existed. At the church I attended the white women sat on one side of the aisle of our bible study class, and the black women sat on the other. It was a voluntary segregation, created and perpetuated by whom, I did not know. When chatting with a white person about the Georgia schools, on more than one occasion, that person would look quickly around the room to be sure we were alone, and then say to me "We USED to have good schools, you know-- before the busing." It felt to me like the Civil War happened yesterday, and the South had not yet recovered from it. Twenty years later, a friend of mine from the Western States, by coincidence, moved to that same town in Georgia. In talking with her, she made the same observations that I had made, so I was not alone in feeling that. I digress here, to show that the South is a deeply complex entity, and is still to this day, grappling with racial issues. When I consider Ms. Lee's courage to open this world to view, when she did--ie. BEFORE the Civil Rights era was in full swing, I am proud of her integrity and desire to expose even her beloved Atticus to world view. She is telling it like it was, and if you want to have a prayer of a chance of understanding that world today, you have GOT to understand where they have been. And this book does that. It tells it like it was, for sure. If it hurts, well then good. It means we've come forward a ways down the trail. But there are STILL racial issues and bigotry in the world today. If the book can get us to look at ourselves, and understand anything about our own prejudices, well then it will have achieved something truly great. While it was great to read more details and experiences of Scout (and I loved TKAM so much that I shared it with my children, who loved it, as evidenced by the fact that I have a grand daughter named Scout, and another named Harper), whom I so loved for her scrappy independence, but this book has merit as its own book, for what it offers us about coming of age, and truly growing up, and hopefully rising up and beyond the culture we've been given, and helping humanity takes its next step forward. Thank you Nelle Harper Lee, for that courageous gift.<br/><br/>P.S. I notice that my review isn't coming up as a verified purchase. I bought it from Audible.com and downloaded it to my Kindle. I pre-ordered it, so it appeared at midnight of July14th.
I deliberately avoided reviews of this book and the controversy surrounding it.  I am glad that I did.  I also tried to judge it separate from To Kill a Mockingbird.  I think this should serve as a primer for everyone who did not grow up in the 60's when the civil-rights movement was starting.  After reading some of the reviews it is clear, at least to me, that many would like a revisionist history where brave white men of The South stood shoulder to shoulder with their Negro brethren against the ignorant segregationist crackers. The fact is that they felt their very existence was threatened and that integration was being forced upon them by the north, including the NAACP. They also felt that Negros were not ready or capable of self-management and had a fear that they would become the minority. Yes they were racist-sincere in their belief that the white race was superior and the black inferior.  Given this fact it is not surprising that Atticus Finch is one of them, albeit a less strident one. In fact the premise of the story is Jean Louise's (Scout) disappointment that her father is not the perfect man she expected him to be.  Yes, there are some flaws in this book and I suspect that more editing went into it than they let on but it is a powerful read with a message.  Those who criticize because it doesn't meet the fantasy they had in mind after To Kill A Mockingbird, need to understand that this is the way that it was, not as we would like it to be. I especially regret that some choose not to read it because they have preconceived notions of what they expected.  Scout's uncle: "The white supremacists fear reason, because they know cold reason beats them.  Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common:they both begin where reason ends."
If you keep your expectations in check,  you might enjoy this book.  I read this book with low expectations.  Assuming what I had heard about it was true, this book was written first and rejected.  This leads me to believe that very little or no editing took place before it was published and that this is pretty much the draft that was written, submitted, and then rejected.<br/><br/>On her editor's advice, Harper Lee wrote another book focusing on the childhood of her protagonist because these stories, from Go Set A Watchman,  relating to her childhood were the parts that stood out.  This book really focuses on Scout as an adult realizing that her father is not a perfect person and that her own view of the world is unique.  I also think it was a question of whether to work within a system and to know your opposition rather than to fight it head on.  Even though Scout thinks she understands what has been going on in her hometown and the south, she really doesn't.  She hasn't been paying attention to the civil rights movement and the animosity present between races on her return home for her annual visit shocks her.  Much like current times, she doesn't try to understand what led people to this place only to judge (correctly) that it is very wrong and some of the people that she loves and admires most are part of the problem.  Trying to come to terms with this sickens her.<br/><br/>Parts of this book are absolutely great.  Parts are boring. Sometimes the flow of the story isn't very good. The questions and problems are relevant today.  People can argue about this until they are blue in the face but my opinion is that it is neither great nor awful.  It is good and could have been great had more attention been paid to it with a good editor around the time it was written.  I think that the five star ratings are too high and the 1 star ratings are just silly. I really think it should be rated between 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 stars if one stays objective. I usually read a book or two, sometimes three, a week and this is a lot better that much of what is out there at the moment.  If nothing else, it is interesting to see the thought process that lead to one of my favorite books, To Kill A Mockingbird.
iNTERESTING LOOK AT THE SOUTH AND TWO VIEWS.
She does explain the complexities of racism.
Fortunate Lee didn't publish this one first!
I had hoped to love it...but I didn't. After reading both the book and articles about the release, I felt like this was nothing more than a publicity item. It felt incomplete, like the "rough draft" that it was. I had just re-read To Kill a Mockingbird and there are many descriptions that were used in that book. I don't feel like Harper Lee really meant for this to be published as it is.
There's some crudeness here, and a lot of the minor sins of youthful writing, but as a companion piece to MOCKINGBIRD I think this is of enormous value.  The paradox of small-town life is here, and a vivid sense of what it feels like when the moral polarities of your world shift on you.  It's particularly valuable for the conversations it is triggering.  Delighted Lee authorized its publication.
I wasn't fond of the beginning of the book.  I thought the wording was beyond average language for the time.  The lessons learned later in the book by "Scout" as an adult looking at her father finally as an adult was worth the read.  Thank goodness an Uncle was the person to bring reality to the forefront.  You will see the lightbulb in your brain light up and get the lesson in the end.
It wasn't super well written. It is definitely not To Kill A Mockingbird good.  The final act is the only interesting part and it took so long to get to. Despite this, I am glad a read it.  Despite switching between first person and third person narratives, I got something out of it.  It tried to tie up the loose ends too quickly.  The book represents exactly how people approach racial issues.
I actually liked it and surprised myself. Atticus turns out to be a flawed person just like the rest of us. There were places that needed editing for clarity,but I recognized Harper Lee's exquisite prose and loved it. I related so well to the hypocrisy of the times, knowing some things were wrong but feeling helpless to change them. I thought Lee did a masterful job of describing that feeling.
Just left me wanting more - had to re-read TKAM before opening this one, and really can't imagine one digesting this 2nd book without having read her magnificent 1st.  Only downer was to see a major, positive character from Mockingbird, turn out to be not quite what we might have thought or hoped for, after the1st book. Disappointing surprise, BUT didn't distract from the author's brilliance.
I had looked forward to reading another Harper Lee story; however, I found the story to be lacking in character and plot. Scout appears to be the same emotional child but in an adult body wrestling with her relationship with her father and those around her.  The best character was Scout's uncle.  All in all, this was a chance to read and enjoy the rhythm and dialogue of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.
Harper Lee is ten years older than I; therefore, I believe we think about alike. This book helped me realize human relations have not improved as much as I think. Actually, I believe we showed more civility years ago, witnessed fewer murders, & were not as hypocritical of our fellow man. I understand why Scout experienced the turmoil she did in the midst of the people(black & white) she loved
NO SPOILERS HERE- Here's a brief review from an ordinary reader. I don't claim to have read all of the "classics", nor do I have extensive time to devote to reading consistently. I read this book having no expectations. No pre-judgement was there before I started.<br/><br/>The book is written in a relatively slow pace so it may not be for impatient readers. The main character is Scout and it is about her thoughts after going home. Harper Lee does a fantastic job at allowing you to  understand her point of view and emotions as Scout interacts with her hometown. The way the novel ends makes you think and will leave you wondering about what you would do.<br/><br/>I could easily see this book being taught in academia, and if I still were in it, would have loved to study it.
Worth reading for a greater insight into a favorite book but also a complex period.  Expresses ideas that continue to have an impact.  Not a perfect book but interesting and disturbing.
This is not a sequel.  The only similarity to TKMB are the names.  The voice are too different for Atticus and Scout, especially Atticus. I'm glad this wasn't published before.  I'm glad TKMB was the end result of Ms. Lee's work.  I think if she would have changed the names, it might have worked as a separate novel, but as a sequel, no! The only purpose I find for this novel, is to show us how TKMB came into being.  There are two very different themes in the books.  That's why I believe GSAW was a forethought to TKMB. The comment by Uncle Jack at the end has no purpose. Many of the arguments by Atiicus and Uncle Jack do not make sense. This was just a way for the publisher and lawyer to make money.  It should have stayed in the box.
Like everybody else I re-read TKAM before reading Watchman.  I find it hard to believe that Ms Lee segued from one to the other without some help.  Truman Capote perhaps?  I do not feel that Atticus was racist, just a true Southerner trying to cope with a new world.  That said, I enjoyed Watchman and Scout's flashbacks.  Sure wish they would find the other book she was supposedly writing!
I had been told there was controversy over this novel.  Having read it:  I could see where that would come from.  I am a huge fan of Harper Lee - all of her 1 book - so wasn't not disappointed by this one either.  I would caution:  it's set in Alabama in the late 50s, early 60s right during the civil rights movement so the views and the opinions are very much of that place and that time.
If you are or make yourself familiar with the views of MANY concerning the Civil Rights movement, you won't be disappointed in this book. What perfect timing for this book to appear. I love the language of the writing, the struggle of the author and the route each character chooses to face the world and it's changes. So happy this book finally arrived in my time and I will read it again.
I gpt this book for my Mom and she loved it
Very good, but different that previous book
Started off slow but a good read after all.
Did not hit any highs roe me. Dissapointed.
Not surprised author didn't want to release
Such a great book love it thank you so much
I'm sorry about two things: I'm sorry that this book isn't longer and I'm sorry that readers have only two books by Harper Lee. I surely do wish she had been writing all these years!
I was somewhat disappointed in this, but being a contemporary of the author and a southerner I probably understood Atticus' outlook better than  most younger people do, however looking at it from the standpoint of the present I do not agree with it now.  I do think that many of his arguments  have been proven to be true and justified and that is unfortunate for both blacks and whites.
I started reading this with some trepidation because of other reviews I had read.  It does come as a shock to learn how attitudes have changed over the years with the Finch family.  It also is relevant to today's society in a surprising way.  Harper Lee makes the reader take a long, hard look at him/herself and one's own attitudes, and beliefs.  Very interesting and thought-provoking!
Zero stars
I liked it
Great book
Uninspired
Okay book.
Okay read.
must read!
Excellent!
Excellent!
Great read
I gave it five stars because it's Harper Lee!  It was so great to see how it turned out for Scout and Gem and all of the clan.  Okay, it's not exactly TO Kill a Mockingbird but it was better than a lot of books!  Maybe she never felt it was ready to print and they rushed it along with their lousy editing.  Maybe her other book had her finishing it off better.  But it's worth reading.
Go Set a Watchman is a very good read, very typical about thoughts and ideas and ways of small town southern way of life.Very good read very similar in feel to Go Kill A Mockingbird
I found it to be very well written and the characters' voices just as I had remembered them from Mockingbird. I found it poignant and it reminded me of when I began to realize the adults I had looked up to as a child were not perfect. It is also a very timely description of benevolent racism and why it is so insidious and dangerous. I'd recommend it to anyone who liked Mockingbird.
Her writing is sumptuous.  I enjoyed the book very much, but was disappointed by the abruptness of the ending.  I realized, after some thought, that Ms. Lee intended the reader to decide Scout's future.  Interesting, because I grew up in the 50s and went to college in the 60s and 70s in the Deep South.  I had to make Scout's choice too--many times.  Hate the sin, love the sinner.
There was something lacking in this novel.
A good follow up to To Kill A Mockingbird.
A bit slow in beginning but  I did love it
Disrespectful of essence of first book!!!!
The book is chock full of erudite high tone quality adjectives describing small town, Deep South events and characters actions. Very little in the Deep South drawl and accent. It is tired and anti climatic because the trial never happens nor is it used to make the book's primary point. Jem is MIA. Atticus is KIA. Scout never grows up...are we to believe all women are like that?
I love Harper's style of writing and the richness of her language.  This novel, though, is too complex in its construction for many casual readers.  The memories of Scout's childhood still appeal, but she is far too verbose in presenting the differences between her views and those of the remainder of Maycomb's inhabitants. It is not of a "To Kill a Mockingbird" stature.
This book is a snapshot of an era.  When I heard rumors that Atticus would be depicted as a bigot, I was disappointed.  Thank goodness I read the book, anyway.  Without spoiling the plot, let me just say that the depth of each character, the many facets to the issues presented, and the way that the characters interact cause me to want open the book and read it again and again.
I enjoyed Harper Lee's depiction of Southern culture in this novel, Go Set a Watchman. The characters, so many years older in this novel, seem nearly unrecognizable from those we loved in To Kill a Mockingbird. However, Lee develops many of the same themes in this novel, and it delivers a powerful message. I was disappointed with the ending which seemed abrupt and unfinished.
It seemed like a diatribe defending the South's position on slavery and the Civil War. I didn't feel that it related that much to "To Kill a Mockingbird"<br/>in that it didn't include some of the main characters from that with very little explanation of what had happened to them. While Scout appears to still be a "rebel, the endingseemed contrived. I was disappointed.
After the first negative reviews, I hesitated to buy this book.  However, I found the book very reflective of the 50s, and the characters very believable.  Enjoyed it very much.
The book really made one think about the underlying thoughts going on in the community.  There were many segments from To Kill A Mocking Bird which is not a surprise since this is is a prequel.  I really enjoyed the writing style of Harper Lee and wished she had written more books!  The theme of the book centered on choosing to be part of the solution or part of the problem.
The book started off a little slow and I didn't think I was going to like it. I'm now a little over half way through and can say there are some big surprises and it's definitely improved. It's one of the few books that has brought me to tears (little tears, not overly emotional crying). having read TKAM, it's interesting to read this book and see where the characters end up.
This is not a particularly good book, and it certainly is not the prequel to To Kill a Mockingbird.  Sadly, it is an affirmation of the sad truth that racism is not new and neither are Atticus and his feelings about Negroes.  In fact, if he appeared in the street or courtroom of just about any place in the country, he'd fit right in. How ironic this book was just discovered.
There was an excellent reason Harper Lee declined to publish Go Set a Watchman for so many years-- it isn't really very good. This novel was the prerequisite for To Kill A Mockingbird. Watchman is a first draft, nothing more. I can praise the editor who saw some hints of brilliance and encouraged Harper Lee to go back and focus on the truly live scenes where Scout is a child. Watchman is the raw version where the reader is told, but seldom shown, what was on Lee's mind. Watchman is dated where Mockingbird is timeless. It is a cudgel, where Mockingbird was a soft leather glove. I've often wished there were more books from Harper Lee, but this is more like the pickings from her old trash can.
This book was very disappointing and was overly marketed. After reading the entire book, still could not understand what the moral of the story is. Very disjointed, and boring.
I don't think this book would have been published were it not written by Harper Lee and a companion to her iconic To Kill a Mockingbird.  It reads with glacial slowness and would probably not appeal to anyone who hasn't read the first book.  That said, it's a most interesting companion to the first and would do well with book groups addressing both books.  Scout grows up!
That pivotal moment in time when we all discover everything we thought is just not as it always seemed. The author skillfully describes the gut-wrenching realization that things are never exactly as we saw them through our child's eyes. The moment we rail and fight not to grow up. Then figure out we must find our own way or will never be happy.<br/>It's everyone's story.
The author worked hard to convince us that the South did not have to have segregation.  It was the Federal Government that was causing all the trouble.The white southerners  were afraid that because the blacks were in the majority, and they were stupid,  the blacks would vote to oust the white state and local governments.  Interesting book from the Southern point of view.
I was disappointed after all the build-up
Great story with well defined characters.
I was totally surprised that she wrote this book before her first novel.  the characters, other than the daughter were totally complex.  I was quite surprised at the ending.
I think it's important to read this book but it's really just so so. Very timely, odd considering the manuscript was recently found, in re racism in the South particularly.
I will be honest, I sat down and read this from cover to cover in one day. The book takes some beloved characters in some new, unexpected directions. I would recommend reading "To Kill a Mockingbird" first if you haven't. This really helps when Lee mentions characters that were main figures in TKM but are passing references here. All-in-all, an amazing book.
I read some of the reviews in advance, and I concur - it's not a worthy sequel to TKAM. Even if you ignore that fact, the book is a ponderous piece. Perhaps I need to read it several times to appreciate it (I had to do so with TKAM), but I've got better things to do with my time. Like write Amazon reviews.<br/><br/>Save your hard earned cash and read something else instead.
This book was amazing. It's relevant to some of the things that are going on in our world today, and leaves you re-evaluating your morals and beliefs. Loved, loved, loved.
This book is very weak, poor character development, slow to start, lacks meat. When the book ended, I was shocked, it just left readers hanging. I was beyond disappointed.
Despite What the News says I LOVE IT however you must read to kill a mocking bird first. It has Scout all Grown up brings in full of new surprises.  Don't want to spoil :)
Many reviewers seem to have had a knee-jerk reaction to this novel, comparing it to "To Kill a Mockingbird" mostly unfavorably.  I read this novel determined not to compare it to Harper Lee's classic tale about young Scout and the lessons her father Atticus taught her. Though it's clear that Lee wrote about the same characters and themes, this novel is an obvious first attempt to share the story with readers, taking it in a different direction.  "Go Set a Watchman" is told in third person limited point of view through an adult Jean Louise Finch's actions, rather than the first person child's voice of TKM.  Lee's rich prose is present but not polished, her humor sparkles and made me laugh out loud a couple of times, and her description of Maycomb brought the Alabama town to life with more realism than most of us wanted.  Atticus taught young Scout to walk around in someone else's skin before judging them, so I took this approach with this novel.  People (including literary characters) are not perfect and a rite of passage is often that we learn those who raised us are more complicated than we realize when we are younger.  Such is the case of these beloved characters.  I recommend this novel but keep an open mind.  Harper Lee told a story that readers of the early Civil Rights Era may not have wanted to hear but time has passed and opened our eyes to the world.  It's timing is interesting with the recent unrest and Supreme Court decisions.  The lesson is the same--walk around in the person's skin before you judge.
Atticus is not a racist.  He is just caught in the times.  The south had been living with a set of rules for whites and blacks when all of a sudden those rules were pulled out from under both races. The NAACP from one side and the KKK from the other.  Scout represents the new thinking<br/>Atticus believes in the law and in individual people.  He will come around.
Revisiting Scout, Jem and Dill in the flashbacks was delightful. There are some excruciatingly funny parts ( a relief from the racism!) Atticus a racist- well he always was. He was a lawyer first, but he did live in Alabama! Reading GSAW made me decide to take the Implicit Association Test (Implicit.Harvard.edu). Go ahead take it and find out if you are a racist!
I enjoyed this very much. I don't remember reading Mockingbird but I'm sure I did in school way back when. I do remember the movie. I know there was a lot of controversy about Atticus being racist. Our feelings for him were shattered just as Scout's idol ideal was shattered. Don't we all experience that with our parents and/or other childhood idols. Such is life.
Well-written.  Good grammatical construction.  Although I don't doubt that the original draft preceded "To Kill a Mockingbird", it was easy to detect where certain parts had been re-written to include references to the characters and plot of "Mockingbird".  However, those references do not detract from the story which is, all-in-all, a good read.
Excellent, too bad this is the last one!
Very satisfied with service and quality!
It was okay. Didn't live up to the hype.
I read To Kill a Mockingbird right before I read this novel and I can see some similarities. I also read a few reviews about this book before I read it, but I think one has to bear in mind that it was written many years ago and is just now being published. ai personally enjoyed it more than the original, especially the last chapter which really makes you think.
The book was not one that hooked me at the beginning.  I had to struggle to connect with the characters and story line.  However, once I got over that initial hump, I was hooked until the end.  Yes, it was hard to see the real Atticus, but that is something we have to deal with in real life. This book has lots of life lessons that made it well worth the read.
... whose pockets are filled with challenges and questions. Powerful and nostalgic - fall in love with Scout all over again. She returns home and shares memories with the reader catching us up to present day in the wistful way that Lee lulls her readers. Stories of falsies and teenage angst make us giggle and sigh. Aunt Alexandra hasn’t lost a step in castigating Jean Louise, and Henry’s tender ministrations only endear him to us at a deeper level. However, the reader soon feels Lee’s sting with the same burn Uncle Jack brings to Jean Louis's cheek, forcing her and us to tackle tough issues.  The notorious crusader for racial justice and father figure to all, Atticus Finch is on a council tasked with preventing the forced racial integration being dictated by the courts. He believes that neither race is ready for integration and is of a mind to slow the court approved vehicle of progress. Kicking and screaming as only Scout can she fights to find a way to digest life as this god-like figure makes an apparent fall from grace.<br/>  In a fashion we could only glimpse at in her previous novel, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Harper Lee challenges humankind. “Go set a watchman,” she cries - decide who you will be in this world and what you will bring to it. And when the next generation examines us, “let him declare what he seeth.” The beauty and depth of her charge will be celebrated for generations for we are only beginning to understand her grasp of our humanness when it comes to accepting and embracing change.
To kill a mocking bird has always been one of my favorite books. It was very hard ar first to get used to Scout being an adult,<br/>At one point I was sorry I had even started the book, and just had my memories of how the first book ended.<br/>But, I am so happy I finished this book, Harper Lee takes you to a time and place in our history and makes you really think.
OK!<br/>not as interesting as I thought it would be....Had I read it after "To Kill a Mockingbird" I might have liked it more that would have been a long time ago. At this point in time the primary story drages...The characters ate tired.. With all that said it should be required summer reading for everyone entering their second year in high school.
I am completely taken aback by some of the negative reviews this has received.  The majority are founded on nothing more than comparison to its predecessor, TKAM, which is clearly an American classic from a brilliant writer on themes that are timeless.  That said, this book, while perhaps not as polished, is exceptional in its own right.  If read in the context of the early 1950's, by a woman author no less, any intelligent reader would recognize how brave this novel, in its original state, really was.  She addressed both gender equality and racism without being heavy handed or trite.  The character of Atticus Finch in this version had some racial views that are certainly controversial today, but in the 1950's were actually tame.  In my opinion the conversation toward the end of the novel between Atticus and Scout is brilliant and really requires the reader to put aside their personal opinions and really understand the heart of the conversation.  It is uncomfortable and can definitely seem offensive in our modern world, but taken in context of the 1950's, this is a very thought provoking dialog, and Scouts ultimate conclusion would have been radical at the time.  I think perhaps many readers don't understand that this book was written when it was, and before TKAM.  Or they just missed the point.  Either way, I hope new readers can read these two stories together and discuss/debate the merits of each.  It would be a great English Lit exercise that would elicit fascinating and passionate conversation.
I was born, 1944, Wilkinson County, Mississippi.  My wife, 1942, Calhoun County, AL.  When we were growing up in our respective birthplaces, the Klan all but ruled not just our counties, but surrounding counties as well.  My grandfather strongly opposed the Klan and, for that reason, he carried a pistol and slept with a shotgun for 25 years.<br/><br/>My wife and I both were greatly influenced by our maternal grandfathers, both of whom were grocers, and both of whom would be considered racist by today's standards.  Both were fair men who treated fairly everyone they met, black or white.  I recall one very old black woman telling me -- when I was 10 years old:  "You know why all us black folks trade with yo' granddaddy?  Because he don't cheat us."<br/><br/>My grandfather's guidance was simple:  "Treat everyone you meet like they are Jesus."  Neither of our grandfathers wanted school desegregation but that's the way things were then.<br/><br/>We read Watchman for what it is:  The continuation of a coming-of-age saga.  Young, starry-eyed Harper Lee goes to New York, works as an airline ticket agent and writes in her free time.  She was introduced to other writers, editors, and publishers by her childhood friend, Truman Capote.  She goes back home where she finds her father, the rest of her family, her friends, and her hometown dealing with the coming of a new age and the end of an old age -- something that we Southerners AND OUR NATION are still wrestling with right here in 2015.
Go Set A Watchman is not the equal of To Kill A Mockingbird. It leaves Atticus' and Hank's characters undeveloped. And the novel's ending leaves the reader wanting. It does set the scene for Mississippi race relations in the 40's. Lee describes the fears and prejudices accurately while expressing her own outrage of the same. Worth reading as a period piece.
Not as upset about the revelations on Atticus as the reviewers prepared me for -- the developements were believable for that time period in history. Nice to see Uncle Jack teaching Scout a lesson rather than the other way around in Mockingbird. Certainly no comparison to Mockingbird -- makes one appreciate the good sugestion that Harper Lee followed up on.
Certainly an interesting picture of the time period.<br/>Scout really came alive to me.  Loved her visit to the Methodist Church.  How dare they change the Doxology.
I know there has been a lot of contraversy about the book ruining the character or Atticus but I do not agree.  When you consider the times and location I think Atticus was a very normal man.  The difference is that Atticus was dedicated to his profession and was determined to uphold it to the best of his ability. Please give this book a chance and enjoy.
Worst book I ever read. Hard to follow scenes. Character development lacking.
To say that this book is a sequel to Harper Lee's well known novel "To Kill A Mockingbird" is not entirely true. What I love most about this book is if you've never read "To Kill A Mockingbird" you wouldn't be lost. Its a book that can stand on its own and still give you insight to political issues and relationships we can, in some way, relate to without feeling lost and in the dark on who the characters are.<br/><br/>I enjoyed how Harper Lee brought Scouts past out as memories and flashbacks which kind of tied everything together. Right when you think why is it going back to her childhood it all makes sense. She uses this technique to describe the essence of the characters and it helps the audience to not only understand who they are but to imagine who they are as if they were right in their own living room.<br/><br/>I read "To Kill A Mockingbird" again, for the first time since middle school, before I read this book.  Reading both novels now as oppose to when I was much younger, makes me look at them and the times they were set in in a whole new light. I understand it and respect the novels so much more now.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this book and any other book Harper Lee has or will publish. I read this novel in one day and couldn't seem to put it down, I know I will be re-reading this book in the near future. If you want a book that keeps you at the edge of your seat and gives you some history lessons you may have never learned or merely forgot, look no further.
There are many truths displayed throughout this novel. Learning to love despite a different view from those closest to us is truly life's greatest trial and triumph.
I had to admit that the book gave me the same joy that to kill a mockingbird did. I'll say no more than the twist in the story kept my attention right up to the end!
Not quite on par with "To Kill A Mockingbird" but very good reading nonetheless. The hard thing to keep in mind as you read this book is that even though it's a sequel, it was written BEFORE "Mockingbird" when things were quite different than now. The main characters have changed as well, which adds to the feelings of confusion at times.
Almost as good as to Kill a Mockingbird
I was glad to see Scout really grow up.
Just another was for someone to earn more money.  Poorly written garbage.  Does not even approach the depth and integrity of the first book published.
I am happy I grew up with the version "To Kill A Mockingbird" as Atticus remains heroic. In this book, he is a man with great character facing some of the times most trying prejudices and changes thrust on people with his back ground. I recommend it for reading as one view, that does not acknowledge that there is another side or different view
I wasn't impressed by the first few chapters, but the writing definitely got better and Ms. Lee got her message across.  The reader has to be open minded and take into account that the story takes place in the deep South at the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.  Not as well written as "To Kill a Mockingbird ", but better than I expected.
A close look at the South going through change that they weren't ready for.<br/>Ms. Lee took a look back and reminded us how hard it was for the Southerners to come to grips with the new South.<br/>Anyone who grew up during this time can look back at what was happening around us with a little more understanding of how we had been and what we became.
Is Atticus a racist? I don't care. The characters were developed more deeply in my knowing them form Harpers first published works.  This book was more jumbled and the story jumped about a bit too much, but it was a good story. I'm thankful Harper wrote, To Kill A Mockingbird, I enjoyed it much more than this Watchman.
Easy to tell the story was written by the same person who wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Also pretty easy to tell this was written first.  Style is not quite as good as in "To Kill a Mockingbird" but still very good.  Would recommend reading them in the order in which they were published, even if you have read her first one already.
Scout's inner turmoil doesn't carry the same intrigue as the twists and turns of TKAM. Ms Lee gets a little too absorbed in obscure references and vocabulary for most readers and it just doesn't seem appropriate in a book meant to explore the basic struggles of a small southern town and a daughters idolizations of her father. Glad I read it though !
It didn't seem to have much substance.
I had a little trouble getting into the book at first.  I was distracted with some of the things happening.  Coming from the south and being raised by a southern father a lot of these things were discussed in my house and  in fact some word for word.  I liked it but not nearly as much as "To Kill A Mocking Bird" that one is my favorite.
Terrible.

This novel is interesting to compare Harper Lee's writing style, but is obviously a first draft.  I'm surprised Lee let it be published.  It isn't a bad read, although not close to being in the league with To Kill A Mockingbird.  It does give you some idea of Scout's honorable beliefs as an adult. I recommend reading it for the above reasons.
Really enjoyed the book.  It reminded me of how things were in the South during the 60's and how people used different methods to help the south accept integration and the changes that were taking place during that time.  Also showed how laws can't change people's hearts and that not much has changed in the way people think and feel today.
This book is about Jean Louise(Scout), the grown daughter of Atticus Finch.  I enjoyed Harper Lee's use of flashback to her childhood that showed her development into adulthood.  She is strong willed & stuborn.  The surprise ending was great.<br/>Eventhough I gave GO SET A WATCHMAN 4 stars, TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD is still her best work.
This was just as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird". I loved the way this book tied into the past of Mockingbird. It is amazing the ease with which this author brings characters to life.  Like Mockingbird I could NOT put this book down once I a started it. Hours could go by and I wouldn't realize it - that's how captured I was by the story.
Best thing about the book is thinking through Harper Lee's take on Southern mindset around race relations after WWII.  Book can get a bit tedious, especially at the beginning.  But the rationale of Atticus Finch regards blacks, however repugnant one might feel about it, is interesting to mull through.  That makes this book a worthy read.
Thin gruel compared with Mockingbird. I enjoyed the discussions about Southern rights, because many feel that way today. But the ending is contrived and wraps up with the lame plan to separate Jean Louise from Atticus' influence. I only read this because of my esteem for Mockingbird. I'm not sorry I read it, but it was a poor companion.
A real let down after her other book.
I liked to kill a mockingbird better.
Very disappointed with the storyline.
So disappointing!
Wonderful book.  I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird before reading Watchman.  Refreshed my memories of the characters.  Both books should be required reading.
Awesome book that opens up the South during the Civil War period.  I read a few reviews briefly before reading although I had it the first day of release and found the criticism to be biased and based on liberal thought processes.  Is it as good as "To Kill A Mockingbird", no. Is it an excellent novel of the old South - yes.
Was as well written as "Mockingbird". Brings us an aging Atticus and a mature modern Scout. It gave me a Northern liberal an inside look into the Old South at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement.One has to remember that this book was written prior to 1960 by a Southern woman of that time and that is reflected in the book.
I have to be honest, with all of the media hoopla I expected so much more from this book, however I was disappointed. I do give credit that the author actually made Atticus more 'human', unfortunately to only receive criticism from the media. This was simply a novel that brought To Kill A Mockingbird back to life, with some twists.
What if Atticus becomes more of a 'bigot' in his old age?<br/>What if Scout becomes Jean Louise in young adulthood who starts to smoke and drink and curse like a Southern sailor who has moved to NYC?<br/>What if Jem dies young of a heart attack just like his biological mother but keeps coming back in flashback scenes that seem like discarded edits from TKAMB?<br/>What if Boo Radley totally disappears from the face of the earth, kind of like Robert Duvall did?<br/>What if Calpurnia didn't really 'love' Scout when she was taking care of her when she was growing up?<br/>What if the book explained what the 10th amendment was?<br/>(I thought it was the one that abolished slavery - but that was the 13th...)<br/>What if the Civil War ended like over 100 years ago and they took all of the confederate flags down...?<br/>What if Scout / Jean Louise was actually HL's alter ego?<br/>What if people actually read HL's book instead of relying on seeing the movie to get the storyline?<br/>What if the storyline was actually developed?<br/>What if Jean Louise was an NFL scout who spent most of her time outside of NYC evaluating potential recruits from the U. of Alabama, or Auburn, or UAB, or ...?<br/>What if Jean Louise remembered the southern 'golden rule' - "... shoot all the blue-jays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember, it's a sin to kill a mockingbird ..."
I was pleasantly surprised that I was thoroughly unable to put down this book.  Scenes from To Kill a Mockingbird were going through my head the entire time.  Just shows how the two novels are tied together.  Either way, the book was an engaging and interesting study of human nature and emotions in mid-twentieth century America.
To Kill a Mockingbird has been my favorite book for over 40 years. I first fell in love with it at 12 years old and continue to read it every year or every other year while finding new meaning in something I may have missed before. I was so excited for a new Harper Lee book and boy, was I disappointed. These characters were not the gentle human beings I fell in love with. Jean Louise was screeching harpy, Atticus was a ghost, and her uncle was a long winded boring nutcase. This attempt at a book was a blasphemy to the original work of art. Made me wonder if some of the rumors were true about Truman Capote writing the first book.
It is fascinating to read this after To Kill a Mockingbird.  I knew the overview, but hearing such words coming out of Atticus' mouth was still a bit shocking.  I wish Harper Lee would discuss this.  Did you totally reconceive Atticus for TKAM, or did you have these revealed attitudes in mind?  Now I need to reread Mockingbird.
Haper Lee is magnificent what a book. She describes the complex characters superbly. The reader understands very well why the publisher would want her to look back to her childhood and write a book that would sell better. Along with Falkner a must read for anyone wanting to understand and gain insight to the soul of the South!.
It had been many years since I read To Kill a Mockingbird,,,but I picked up the thread quickly. the first third red like a "first book", but it improved. I almost wonder if it was perhaps rejected by many publishers because of the time in which it was written.....and stuck away in a drawer for 40 years.  Just a thought.
The reviews, when the book first came out, indicated that it was disappointing, and focused on the revelation that Atticus was, after all, a racist.  I think those reviews totally miss the point and the message. To me, Harper Lee is describing the fears and uncertainty of the Southern people, at a time that was at the threshold  of major change from the roots and traditions that had been comfortable for so long. Lee reveals Atticus as paternalistic toward the black population--his image and values as a fair and caring human being, were not, in my opinion, tarnished. Rather, the book, in the final analysis, portrays him as a human being with concerns that were real for many responsible Southerners, influenced for generations to believe that the black culture was "behind" for all the reasons that slavery had been allowed to be established and flourish in the first place. The daughter's rage and sense of betrayal, as well as her father's response, and the input of the two relatives, were all evidence of masterful writing, in my opinion.  I do not see the two books as companion pieces, but rather, as two separate works, each portraying an important set of subjects, circumstances, and insights. The media's description of  Atticus as an influential "Klan member" seems such an unfair distortion, and influences the potential reader in a negative way.
Wonderful book!!!! Loved every page.
Not what I expected, poorly written.
Long awaited, it did not disappoint.
I was very disappointed in the book.
Damn good story, sucks you right in.
THE REVIEWERS HAD IT RIGHT - THIS IS NOT READY FOR PUBLICATION, BUT THE SEEDS OF A GOOD BOOK ARE THERE AND APPEARED IN "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD."
Some parts were difficult to follow and the characters were not always well developed.  It was obviously written by her younger self and hard to imagine her writing To Kill a Mockingbird in such a deep and poignant way from the way this book was written.  I'm glad I read it from the literary exposure, but not my favorite book.
Watchman was a good read, although no where near the calibre of Mockingbird.  I enjoyed seeing Scout come to terms with the realities of the Deep South in the 1950's.  Personally I found the ending to be rather abrupt and unsatisfying and wishing Lee would have taken the story further. She could have done so much more with it.
This probably the best book I've ever read.  And it from what I've read about it, it was written After "To Kill a Mockingbird."  Harper Lee just didn't like all the publicity and drama she had to go through; she was an introvert and liked her privacy, thus she didn't have it published, however it was.  I'm glad it was!
I just finished reading Go Set a Watchman and I highly recommend it. It’s not about the broken dreams revealed in the racial civil rights battle. It’s about Alabama in 1954 after the Supreme Court ruled that “separate-but-equal” facilities for black people were not equal at all. And it’s about the South, the widely acknowledged testing ground for racial civil rights. Blacks and whites knew their “places” before President Lincoln’s emancipation proclamation in 1863 and the War Between the States. Freeing of the slaves completely changed the culture by removing a major boundary, and each person’s “place” changed, creating complete chaos. State and local governments couldn’t enslave black people again so they established new boundaries by closing doors to blacks. “Places” in the new culture were learned again by both blacks and whites. The Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education greatly stirred the culture and its “places” causing chaos to erupt once again. Fortunately “Go Set a Watchman” shows both sides of the racial civil rights issue. Scout’s father acknowledged the problems, was trying to reason his way through the chaos, and Scout condemned him. I loved it when Scout’s uncle called her a bigot. She believed she was completely right and was intolerant of another’s opinion. That’s the definition, and bigots come in all colors.
Interesting look at Harper Lee's Interpretation of the southern mind in the 1950's. Atticus remains a fighter, but, this time, without a courtroom as his stage. Scout, as a liberal adult from the north, cannot integrate what she sees and hears in this new South, with what she was taught to believe.  GSAW was worth reading.
As many people are disappointed with the discoery that Atticus Finch is a segregationist. I don't find this novel as fast moving or interesting as To Kill A Mockingbird. I would like to see Harper Lee write on other subject matter because I love her style of writing and I was so excited to see some new material out by her!
I loved TKAM, but this just pales in comparison. Yes, I know this was technically written by HL first but it's just not good. I found myself waiting for something to happen to get a plot going but there's nothing. I will say one thing though that is not a spoiler, Atticis is NOT a racist in this book. It is explained by other characters why he is around the People that are. All of those articles that tried to say he became a racist later in life are WRONG!! They clearly did not read the whole book. I will forever love the characters of Atticus and Scout but this book is really just slow, uneventful and boring.
Can't believe how relevant esp. For when it was written!  Amazing read.  Wish Harper Lee had written more.  Don't know how anyone couldn't like it.
I grew up in the South. It brought back many memories (good and not good). I treasured some of the descriptions of the area and times in that local area. The stereotypes of the ruling generation of elders brought back many memories. I questioned why I did not dare to disagree or challenge. Thank you for publishing this.
Watchman would not have had the impact in the 50's that it will have today. Mockingbird was for then, Watchman now.  Harper Lee is a genius, to think Watchman was the first, lay in a bank vault for over 50 years, and is so relevant to today as Mockingbird was to its' time. Now the story is complete. Having lived in Southern Alabama as a twenty something during 1961-63, and then moving back to NYC with a young family, Watchman hits home. Yes, I am now and have been a Texan for over 30 years. We all need to have our watchman surface, hopefully this book will assist. God bless Harper Lee and God bless America.
Very disappointing in every regard.
I did not care for the book at all.
Another great book from Harper Lee!
A waste of time.
I had to read this book undisturbed. I must reread Miss Harper's first book (which was required for most of my generation), to fully understand the entendres.<br/>I enjoyed this immensely! I also understand so many of her references to 18th century authors thanks to the internet and instant research while reading it.
Even though not on the same literary level as To Kill a Mockingbird, I found Go Set a Watchman to be an interesting portrait of the times. The writing was honest and low-key. The purpose seemed to me to just give a brief glimpse into the South with its habits and customs and flesh Scout out as a more mature character.
I found it very idisturbing to learn the facts about the substance of what young Southerners learn at home and in school about they believe is the inate  inferiority of African American people. I found myself to be as angry as Jean Louise as I read the book. All Americans need to learn the facts of Southern culture.
Did not enjoy.  Could not keep my attention.  Really disappointed.
The story is informative about the clash of cultures between those that still lived in small southern towns and those who left and returned.  It also explores the conflicts within the people of those small southern cities.  Scout, who has left and returns, narrates how she discovers the real feelings of the Finchs.
I hadn't read To Kill a Mockingbird in decades so it took me a bit to get re-used to Harper Lee's way with words but once I did, the story flowed. The human failings of iconic hero/father/lawyer of her first book is hard to digest but all in all, a good read and the adult Scout is a force with which to be reckoned.
Parts of the book shine, but unfortunately, I think it reads like precisely what it is, the early draft of a great work.  In her earlier years Harper Lee refused to release this and I think she made the right call then.  With her talent, I think it could have been developed into an amazing sequel but this isn't it.
Totally happy with this purchase!!
Most boring book I have ever read.
Confusing to relate to mockngbird.
I noticed quite a bit of the book was Scout recalling her childhood.  Therefore, it repeated parts of "To Kill A Mocking Bird".  I enjoyed reading it because it reminded me of my childhood summers in Georgia with my aunts.  It was a quick read.  Entertaining but no where as wonderful as her first book.
It's not a perfect book. It gets a bit didactic at times, but all in all it's rich with poetic language and vivid descriptions. In terms of viewing the way things were and how people thought at that time in Alabama it's like discovering a long-buried time capsule. I just wish Harper Lee had written more books!
"Go Set a Watchman" is a propitious, thoughtful work describing the enlightenment of a young adult faced with the Truth about the paradoxical nature of humans. With humor and pathos, Lee perfectly illustrates the necessity for individuals and societies to GROW UP and surrender the immaturity of narrow-minded idealism that ignores the narrative of history and the reality of psychology. Scout's antagonists provide the voices our nation currently condemns, at its peril! Convictions are not mutually exclusive! Motives matter! This book is a painful reminder that we have refused to learn our lessons from the 1960s, 1860s and 1760s. When will we finally "set a watchman" to guard future generations from repeating our national folly? Truth is not always easy, but it is necessary to our moral survival. This book is sheer brilliance, and yes, the final, grace-filled pages made me cry. If you reject it based on the infantile rantings of bigots and their ignorant devotees who are afraid to face their hypocrisy by actually reading the book, I pity you. If you are close enough to borrow my copy, I will lend it, gladly. My name is inscribed proudly inside the front cover. Better yet, buy yourself and your posterity a copy before it is banned by the politically correct cabal.
I have never written a review of a book before but I love this book.  So much wisdom for such a young author.  I believe the critics of this book are unfair.  I also believe this book will also become a classic.  Like many good books the story comes together in the final chapter or two.  So it is with this story as well.  The rest of the book is a journey to the final two chapters but without the journey, the finale would make little sense.<br/><br/>Harper Lee took over a year to write this and to race through it would seem disrespectful.<br/><br/>Many passages worthy of quoting.
What a waste of time! It's sad that the reputation of Harper Lee will now be forever sullied by this piece of crap. And no one should confuse the Atticus Finch of this hare-brained mess with the character of the same name in To Kill a Mockingbird. I'm sorry I read it.
I know that many of you are worried that Harper Lee hadn't wanted to publish this for so many years that perhaps publishing it is somehow desecrates her legacy.  However, she wrote this book first, before To Kill a Mockingbird.  Much of the outline of Mockingbird is present in this book.  Her editor encouraged her to rewrite the book into Mockingbird.  Mockingbird is the better book.  But Mockingbird is a book about childhood innocence.  Watchman is a book about adult disillusion.  The Civil Rights movement has come to the south and stirred up some racism that had almost lain dormant.  Scout, still color-blind as an adult, can't understand why so many of her childhood loved ones respond so badly to the changing times, including her beloved father.  In the end, Harper Lee is less interested in race relations than she is adults coming to grips with the flaws of their parents.  Atticus appears to be lightly racist in his old-age and Scout has a difficult time accepting any flaws in her beloved father.  In many ways, this has the makings of a great book, exploring themes and topics that Mockingbird did not.  And the writing remains excellent.  I take off a star because I'm not sure that I'm completely sold on how the book ends -- though that is growing on me as time passes.
The writing style is classic Harper Lee. There's no one like her. But this is no"To Kill a Mockingbird". Although it's well worth the read, especially for the Scout, Jem flashbacks, there are differences in character, especially that of Atticus. And the last few pages unsettled me considerably. No spoilers!
Very easy reading. Finished in 3 days.  Very easy to understand. Enjoyed going back to Scout and her surroundings. Gave it to my son to read
I had hoped this would be just as good, if not better than "To Kill a Mockingbird" but I was disappointed - until the ending.  The truths revealed at the conclusion made the effort it took to finish the book worth it.  Read the book for what it is worth but don't compare it to Ms. Lee's epic novel.
Okay, however, I did not really think that it made a very good follow up to her first book (which I understand may really have been her second) .  The writing was terrific as before, but the way Scout's uncle explained things made little sense of the whole situation. Believe me I lived through those times.
Views of Attticus Finch are portrayed with brutal honesty. It changes the reader's understanding of this character. Anything more would be a spoiler alert. Skip this if you want a simple hero. Not one with feet of clay, defined by racial attitudes of his day. How will teachers teach To Kill A Mockingbird?
Nelle Harper wrote the unexpected.  Beyond the publicity and punditry, she gave us a work of the heart.  A swirl of strength and fragility.
Tedious!
just ok.
Whatever
Authenic
Just meh
Finally!
Ok read.
loved it
I enjoyed the book but thought it took too long getting to the meat of the story.  It didn't keep you engaged as did the Mocking Bird book.  But when the end came it was very provocative.  It all made sense and I did not feel it a bit racist as some have said.  I thought it unfolded in a rational manner.
I was a child in the 50's and 60's and have the child's perception of those years. Both To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman effortlessly express the times yet encorporates total area ideas and the steps in reconciling their emotions. We all need to set a watchman in the times we are experiencing.
In my opinion, Go Set a Watchman, is by far a greater book than To Kill a Mockingbird. In this book, Harper Lee leads us inside the complexities of the main characters; their societal norms; the good and the bad that is in each of us. I have heard some complaints aboutit, but I would recommend it highly.
I was eager to read Go Set A Watchman, after hearing about the "new" Atticus Finch's positive stance on white supremacy, figuring that this had to be an aberration of an otherwise good man. It's no aberration. Really, what's awful about the book is the absolutely superficial way that Lee writes about Atticus and Jean Louise. Their opinions aren't given any substance, they just exist as a given. Why is Jean Louise so surprised by Atticus' attitudes?  She believes it's because of the liberal way she was parented. But Atticus is a white supremacist, so where are the complex dynamics that allowed this to evolve? The writing is stiff and predictable and aside from the fact that i was curious about how To Kill A Mockingbird came to be, I wouldn't have continued reading.<br/><br/>The beginning developed slowly and introduced Jean Louise and Henry, her beau. By the middle, when Jean Louise is shocked to discover the hateful feelings inside of Atticus, the novel devolves into a rhetorical questioning of Jean Louise's beliefs along side those of generations of white<br/>Southerners. I felt preached to rather than witnessed the characters' personalities unfold. If  Harper Lee hadn't written this, I doubt it would have gotten the readership it has.
A coming of age story. I'll bet this was part of the original To Kill a Mockingbird but separated out for length and market at the time. So glad to read this. Paired with the title of her biography "I am Scout" it was a great addition to the whole narrative. The movie To Kill a M...is also good.
What a powerful story - obscure literary regencies aside. I'm glad this was published but also glad that To Kill a Mockingbird came first.
A real coming of age story. I respected Atticus just as much by the end. A wonderful father. I'm glad I was not scared off by the reviews.
I'll give the book another read in a few months and hopefully I'll find it better than my first read. Perhaps I expected too much since I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" in my teens and it provoked considerable thought especially for a young person growing up in the north during the 50's and 60's.
boring.  I didn't even finish it.
I am a huge Mockingbird fan.  I was very skeptical about this book and how it would live up to the first.  I thought it was great.  The charactors were just as engaging and real as they always were.  It is hard for me to believe that this book was written BEFORE To Kill A Mockingbird.  But I loved it.
I read this book because so many others around were "afraid" to read it. I enjoyed it tremendously. I disagree with many who think Atticus is the usual southern man at the time of the book. I believe Harper Lee saw him as a whole man, thoughtful, sincere, kind and hopeful for equality of all.
Very insightful look into changing times in the heart of the South from the young and the old written of course by a woman who lived it.
So many times I have heard folks says, "Atticus is just to good to be true".  In this book there is a real message to be found..
I really wanted to read it.  It wasn't as bad as I had heard.  The N word I did find offensive.  I was surprised to see that is this day and time.<br/>Interesting to see Scout all grown up and kept thinking of Gregory Peck as her dad.  He was special.  Like the brother.  Good character development.
To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my two favorite books, and Go Set a Watchman is almost that good<br/>It was not at all what I expected.  I was bordering angry at Harper Lee in the middle of it.  But, the more I've thought about it after finishing it, the more I've liked it.  Very thought-provoking!
Harper Lee wrote Watchmen before she wrote Mockingbird. She accuses her father, Atticus, in her first book, and within the same story, she grows up and accepts him for who he is. And then, perhaps out of the guilt of almost wanting to destroy him in Watchmen, she completely exonerates him by presenting him as the idealistic southern gentleman who defies prejudice and lives his life true to his principles. But we learn now, years after first reading Mockingbird, that Atticus's  principles originate from those of justice and not necessarily from principles of humanity. Lee  had to  grow up to discover her separateness from her father in order to honor him in Mockingbird. Did this honor emerge from her true understanding of the schizophrenic leanings of the south, or from her guilt over having lambasted Atticus in Watchman? Go Set A Watchman is a thoughtful, coming of age novel of deep psychological depth, great storytelling, and character development. The best part is its teaching the reader what bigotry really is and asking the reader, particularly the ones of the liberal color-blind variety, to ease up, listen to the other side for understanding as to why men do what they do, and to open his or her mind to all points of view.
Expected more.  After Scout's shocking realization, it takes only a couple days and slaps to readjust her thinking?  Nonsense.  People take years to reconcile their childhood perceptions to adult realizations.  I don't think Jean Louise's progress from one mindset to the next was fully fleshed out.
No, I was not a fan of this book. Yes, of course hopes are high because of To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>For starters, Jem dropped dead somewhere between Mockingbird and Watchman and everything about that just sits out there unanswered. Scout is back for a little visit from New York City and discovers that Atticus has turned into a silent racist character who never becomes more than a two dimensional prop.<br/><br/>The beginning quarter of the book is so richly written that I immediately told my husband he needed to read this book. But soon the writing cooled, got boring, became a little discourse on "What the Civil War has Done to the South," so I turned to my husband and said, "Never mind about reading this."<br/><br/>Jean Louise (Scout) and her uncle spend pages and pages of my good time rehashing the southern racial problems, the exact reason for the War of Northern Aggression, and why Atticus looks and acts like a jerk but isn't really.<br/><br/>These characters did not even remotely resemble who they once were, as though Harper Lee took a book she'd written about other people and scribbled out their names and put in "Scout," "Atticus," and "Jem."<br/><br/>No one will accuse Truman Capote of ghost writing this one.
Excelent book--Harper Lee is a great writer!  A little slow through the first third the book picked up and developed in the last third.
Really?  Five stars?  I struggled here.  First you must be a reader that read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  You must. Then with an open mind, you read this follow up that was evidently written before MOCKINGBIRD even though it is a follow up story.  Harper Lee....why didn't you write and write and write??  I tell everyone and quickly too, MOCKINGBIRD is my all time favorite book, even still today.  Now GO SET A WATCHMAN.  I struggled with the fact that it isn't a story with a firm ending.  I struggled with Atticus and his racism, but understood it.  MOCKINGBIRD is better...but almost every book is second to it.  Now about WATCHMAN and five stars.  There are dissappointments here, racism from a hero, death of a brother, Scout, now grown into a progressive woman (like Harper Lee with Capotie?) and maybe the South in the 50's is too.  But the book, the look it gives the readers into the South in the 50's. Oh so good.  This book would be nothing without MOCKINGBIRD but it has MOCKINGBIRD and it is brillant.  Brilliant in its dialogue, in its view of small town southern life, in growing up, in coming to grips with hero's/father's weaknesses and strengths. Brilliant.  Read it slow and sip it like fine wine.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
It's been interesting to see the response from friends. To Kill a Mockingbird is a land mark book that brought to the public social situations in our culture at that time.  To Set a Watchman does as well. Timely.  Hopefully it should make you rethink, or at least re examine your cultural beliefs.
I wish I had read this before reading "to kill a mockingbird". It is impossible not to add that book into your reading of this book.However, it is a "must"read. I would have given it 5 stars if I could have judged it as a stand alone book. It is my flaw that makes the difference.
I was expecting 'To Kill a Mockingbird' quality, but was very disappointed. I quit reading midway through the novel as I did not want to tarnish my ideal of Atticus. The publishing world should respect authors and their wishes.  If Harper Lee wanted to pursue publication, she would have done so.
I loved 'to kill a mocking bird' ...and might have enjoyed this one more if it had come out around the same time;  there were a few incidents that were delightful and made me laugh, but too much of the language and rhetoric belonged to another time, which doesn't need to be dragged up again now.
REad on my kindle, it was better than I expected from all the prepublication hoopla. Atticus was a Southern Gentleman, and very faithful to the Law he had learned, and a bit resistant to the laws prevailing at the time. I would say he was trapped (Like a trap in a trap, to quote Dorothy Parker).
Growing up sucks but it is a part of life regardless.<br/>Admitting that To Kill a Mockingbird was my favorite school-read, Go Set a Watchman was a must in my reading list. Relevant as ever, sadly, but a test of time nonetheless. It seems that the majority feels that this book has tarnished Harper Lee's reputation and most of all, the fictional once-hero, Atticus Finch. KEEP IN MIND this is was written before TKaM & was/is a draft. BUT it leaves a huge impression.<br/><br/>I read TKaM three times so far in my life and it got better each time. I read it the first two times in Middle School/High School, which is a time of being young and learning about the world. Now as an adult, Go Set a Watchman, is in my life as an adult so in a way I grew up with these two books.<br/><br/>Atticus was worshiped and looked up to by Scout and us, the reader, too. This book is about realizing that the people you once thought were spotless and looked up to as a child turn out to be flawed and not what you once thought they were. Which is what, in a way, growing up is.<br/><br/>Don't knock this book without analyzing both sides. Harper Lee's legendary status should not/will not/nor will be tarnished.<br/><br/>-Adonis
To Kill a Mockingbird is an awesome book. Go Set a Watchman, not so much. Granted, perhaps no finessing was done to this book as it was never supposed to be published at all, and if that is the case, it shows. I say don't bother reading, however I recommend reading To Kill a Mockingbird again.
I read it because I wanted to see what all the commotion was about. I was totally disappointed, and not just because of the tarnishing of Atticus Finch. It was not well written at all. I began to question whether it was in fact written by the same author as To Kill a Mockingbird. Not worth it.
I liked it and I didn't like it.
Question whether written by her!
iT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS.
Wish that Atticus would have stayed the same as her original 'To Kill a Mockingbird". Some things should't change as we all need those perfect heros. Having been involved in a 'sit in' at a lunch counter many year ago history is something I've lived and the books relate that history well.
I was interested in the story line in the context of the time period.  The family dynamic had evolved, as expected in any family, and seems appropriate for the era in which it takes place.  Keeping Mockingbird in mind, it was interesting to observe the emotional facets of the main characters.
As expected not as great as To Kill a Mockingbird. The overall story and narrative is sub-par in comparison.<br/>What's mildly disturbing is how the character is continually given excuses to just "accept" the racism of her home town but I'm sure that's based on real life occurrences.
It would be hard to live up to "Mockingbird", but this didn't seem to be written by the same author.  Wish I hadn't read it.
Not the wonderful sequel we all had hoped for.....I chose to believe that Ms. Lee did not have the time to finish, edit, and revise.
Having grown up thinking how delightfully innocent were the characters of 'To kill a Mocking Bird', it is quite impressive how Ms Lee managed to capture that innocence after she wrote  'Go set a Watchman' which I find quite dark. I am grateful though for both volumes - the story is complete.
Okay this contains some lovely writing by Harper Lee but it's so hard to get your head around the disappointing attitude Atticus espouses about people of colour.  I was also shocked at the casual biff Uncle Jack gave Scout and her passive acceptance of it.  All up the story faffs about with Scout and Hank and not enough time is given to exploring the core of racism at the heart of such a loved literary character.  Calpurnia makes a two minute appearance in the present and again I would have liked a greater exploration of her hardened heart.
Great read. There is a big generational thing about Southern bigotry, but not as much as it appears in this story. The solid South is still pretty solidly racist. Scout's naïveté was painful -- probably on the mark for some simple people but doesn't quite go with the woman she was becoming.
Go Set A Watchman must be taken for what it is, a novel written around the height of the Civil Rights Movement about a woman's personal struggle with those around her and the realization that each individual is just that, an individual. At a time fixated on race, this novel focuses on both the internal and external personal struggles that are its unfortunate side effect. Harper Lee once again (or technically for the first time ever in this case) delivers an incredible literary masterpiece that can offer something to everyone. Published as is, this is a rough draft so there are some instances of where editing is needed; I recommend this be overlooked while reading and not deter you when deciding whether to read this book. Once again, take it for what it is! Definitely a must read!
Written in the mid 1950's Go Set a Watchhman is the sequel to to Kill a Mockingbird.  In this novel by Harper Lee, Scout is 26 and returning to Maycomb, Alabama .  She goes back yearly for her 2 week vacation from her job in New York city.<br/><br/>  Jean Louise ( Scout ) returns to find her Father Atticus, and her boy friend Hank (  the boy who  Atticus  took under his wing) , and the town in a bit of  political turmoil.  The negro/ white situation is tense<br/><br/>  Hank wants to marry Jean Louise, she keeps putting him off. Jean louise  loves Hank but can't see herself living in Maycomb.  Memories  of her childhood ( which are taken from  To Kill A Mockingbird)  keep flooding back.<br/><br/>  This is a moving story about Scout's journey  into adulthood. The writing is not as polished  as Harper's famous book.Sometimes the transitions  from past to present are not always  easy to discern.  It was hard at times to keep track of where Scout was in time.<br/><br/>  The characters are well developed . The setting helps show the tensions and how the people lived in Maycombe.<br/><br/> So this is a story of Scout,  the people who love her, and her hometown.  Without To Kill A Mockingbird this story would  not really make sense.
It provided an interesting insight into race issues in the U.S., however it is difficult to not be a little disappointed after To Kill A Mockingbird.<br/>Maturing the known characters was potentially a flaw, rather than establishing a total cast a new characters, even in the same setting.
The coming of age of Jean Louise as seen through her eyes.<br/>The reader struggles with her to make sense of her beloved home town's evolution and her place in it through flashbacks, brilliantly descriptive renderings of town events intertwined with intense dialogue with those she loved.
Some reviews have suggested that Watchman conflicts with Mockingbird.  Some other reviewers suggest that Watchman, written before Mockingbird, is not the literary masterpiece that Harper Lee's second book became.  After reading Watchman over the weekend I have to disagree on both counts.  If I had been told that Watchman had been written as a sequel to Mockingbird I would have said it was a perfect sequel.  Scout, of course, is perfect.  Now 20 odd years older, the perfection that was her father in her childhood eyes is now awash with conflict.  But that conflict itself is not pristine: some of Atticus's behavior appears racist yet some arguments are not; more like a desire for a place and a time long lost and cherished.  Every person, whatever their race or creed, can empathize with that old longing, even if the roots are gnarled.  Even the twist in the story at the end raised my eyebrow.  Watchman, quite short in length, will stand tall in time once more serious analysis of its tapestry is complete.  It's just a shame an older, wiser Gregory Peck is not around to express such contradictions.  Perhaps Clint Eastwood or Kevin Costner would be up for it?  Recommended 9 out 10.
It is never easy to read about a lifestyle and/or views that are far different from one's own. I found the book to be emotionally moving and complicated. Recommend it to a friend? No, but it would prompt a great conversation about racism and how times have changed and/or stayed the same.
As a life-long fan of TKAM, I was expecting to dislike this book. Surprise! I actually enjoyed it, especially the Henry character and Jean Louise's relationship with him. Since I grew up in the South described in this novel, I know good people struggled with changes to their way of life.
I really enjoyed this book. Reminded me of a lazy summer day.  Not much happens in the story line, but fans of to kill a mockingbird will appreciate the continuation of Scout.  It is more the importance of how she idolized Atticus for so long and he finally became a human figure to her.
Realistic account of life in the south at the time of writing.  For those who hesitate to read because they loved To Kill a Mockingbird, I think Go Set a Watchman is the real story about the time and To Kill a Mockingbird was Harper Lee's dream of the idealistic life she hoped could be.
This was a revisit to some great characters. I enjoyed the leap forward in time and remember all to well those troubling times.  I am a child of the of a small southern town.  That town is gone now.  Agriculture died with tobacco, the young moved and the old died.  Now there is nothing.
In my mind this is far superior to To Kill a Mockingbird just because it does not downplay Southern racism and mistreatment of African Americans and also brings out the mistreatment of poor whites as well. The prejudices of the Southern "aristocracy" are laid out for all to see.
It appears as a poorly developed  draft of a possible story line for  "Mocking Bird"?  Should have been left at the bank.
Although in parts, this book reads like an unfinished manuscript, I thoroughly enjoyed what Lee does and says in this novel.<br/>On the one hand, it is very timely! In the context of the renewed discussion on race and racism in this country, Go Set a Watchman reaches us right in the nick of time, and calls our attention to the complexities of Southern racism and its relationship with Southern culture. Choosing to expose us to these complexities through the character of Atticus Finch is a stroke of genius! Who better than that icon of decency and fairness to show us that things are never simple? We discover or rediscover just how ingrained racism is into the very fabric of being white in this country!<br/>But, just when we are ready to give up on Atticus and all of the Finches, save Jean Louise (Scout), Lee takes us to a deeper, more generous place, where we are invited to look into our shared humanity and come to terms with the fact that we participate in its imperfection.<br/>I wish we would approach art with less arrogance and less urgency to side with those who are “right” about the work. We might learn a lot, even be moved, by that which is less than perfect.
Disappointing.
I did not read it the wife did.
It was OK, but an average read.
I found it tedious and preachy.
Loved it finch was not a racist
Harper Lee has done a wonderful job, again, of capturing societal issues and telling the story through her true to life characters.  Having lived through this phase of American history in both the north and the south, I feel she effectively portrayed regional opinions at the time.
I wish two things:  I had this book first and that Harper Lee could have done some editing. From what I understand, she never thought it would be published. I enjoyed reading it because I continuously was connecting names, places, and characters from TKAM which I know quite well.
Do not read this BEFORE Mockingbird! I was never a huge fan of Scout/Jean Louise but this comong of age story, from her vantage point, made me love her. I don't think Atticus is any different than in TKAMB, but remember Scout was a tot then and is now an adult. Great, great read.
I loved the book for all that it was. I loved how she would sit a recap memories and how she felt so passionate. I loved how Henry loved her and how Jem treated her all those years. I loved how raw this book was and it really touched me. when i finished i was felt kind of empty.
This gives one some insight into how the south looks on political issue and many of those differences are still there today.  Many of these same differences exist between democratics and republicans.  One of them anger against big government and the desire to guard state rights.
This book was predictable only because of all the media attention about Atticus Finch's racist core.  The story reveals that all of us are complex creatures whose principles often conflict with our personal preferences.  It is really too bad that Harper Lee wrote only two books.
There is some need for editing as others have suggested, but I believe, having grown up during this time of the book, that Atticus was trying to do what was best for his community and I think, Scout must have eventually seen his side, since she wrote this book late in her life.
I read To Kill a Mockingbird so long ago that I cannot make comparisons. That is good, because I can enjoy Go Set a Watchman for what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Harper Lee has an outstanding capacity to create character and the sense of place. Easy to read, but its ideas.
Meh. I was so hyped when I first learned there would be another book but it was truly disappointing. While the stories of Scout, Jem and Dill were of course entertaining, Atticus was a let down. Just like the follow-up to GWTH, this book will generate a bunch of bucks for Lee.
Amazing book. Great narrative!
Good read, but no Mocking Bird
Great Book, Highly Recommended
I loved seeing Maycomb's unique residents and hearing the "alternate universe" descriptions of the people and places from Mockingbird.<br/><br/>As for the novel's success at accomplishing the conveyance of a moving theme, and the merits of that theme, the jury is still out.
Yes it is true Atticus was a racist in this book which made it hard to accept but it was a story of the deep love between Scout and her Dad even though he was not the person she thought he was and at times she hated him !  The characters were real and certainly made me feel !
The novel is ordinary by itself, but taken as a companion novel to "Mockingbird", the novel enriches the impact of both works.  They really form a set of novels, with "Mockingbird" presenting a child's idealized perspective of a father and life in a 1950's Southern town, and "Watchman" the realistic and mature vision with its ugly realities, one of which is that Atticus is now a racist.  Miss Lee doesn't seem to suggest that Scout's heroic vision of Atticus was wrong  or that he has changed, but that Atticus is and always has been hero and racist, a complex human being both honorable and noble and wrong about blacks.  So too, the Southern small town is also both an ideal, friendly, nurturing, safe  for a child, yet is populated by racists for whom negroes are an inferior race and always will be, men like Atticus, and other men whose attitudes are ones of hatred and violent.  The two novels taken together present this dichotomy and complexity of real life and suggests that maturity requires  a coming to terms with and acceptance of this complexity. "Watchman" thus makes both novels better.
The book is not the disappointment that some previewers promised. I know such people. I grew up with them. The characters in Watchman are fully developed, believable, and interesting. Despite the controversy over its publication and some of its content, I am glad to read it.
My wife and I both really enjoyed the book. Being from the Deep South, my wife could easily visualize the settings and hear the language.<br/>Actually, towards the end of the book God spoke to her in her heart about one of the issues Scout had with her Dad, very meaningful!
I enjoyed the book. It was different than To Kill A Mockingbird, but I feel it showed a line between the good and the bad principles that people had. I gave it a four because I don't appreciate some of the language used, but I guess it was needed to get the feel of that era.
Not by the writing but by the story itself. To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book that introduced me to the literary world and I held that book and story close to my heart. Go set a Watchman tore that story apart and left me half empty wishing I had never read the sequel.
If you get over St. Atticus, this is really a good book.  I LOVE her writing style.  I understand why it was rejected by the publisher.  TKAM was a MUCH better book.  That being said, this book was like coming home after 45 years (first time I read TKAM) to familiar friends.
An amazing book - very much equal to "Mockingbird".  Scout grows up and Atticus transcends from being a god to being human.
This was a great representation of a difficult time. It was also a reminder that everything in life is constantly changing.
Harper Lee's early rehearsal for "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a beautifully told story marred by antebellum philosophy. That said, "To Kill a Mockingbird" remains a true American masterpiece, perhaps second only to "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
This is not on a par with to kill a mockingbird, but is very well written. The story deals with the southern reaction to the 1954 supreme court decision on segregation. I almost did not read it because of some lukewarm reviews. Fortunately, a friend convinced me otherwise.
I heard so many readers are not happy with this book.<br/>I guess To Kill a Mockingbird, for me, was always Scout's story. Atticus, and the others were background. So the demonizing of a seemingly perfect character didn't hit me as hard.<br/>I loved it on its own merit.
I loved it. Unfortunately the book is getting a bad wrap since people don't know how to read past the literal words on the page, and read it's meaning instead. It's a great book, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who says it's only about Atticus being racist is an idiot.
You are reading along, and suddenly trip over a sentence or phrase so well-written, so divine, that it takes your breath away. You have to stop and savor the wonder of it. This book is rife with those. And the content so timely for what has happened in this July of 2015.
My husband read it first and really seemed to like it.. He would not say much since he knew I was going to read it.. I am almost finished and it really good ,have enjoyed it so far.. Lots of twists is very true.. Would LOVE to see a movie made !!! Thanks,  Sharon Melson
First seventy five pages equal " 'Mockingbird". Brilliant. Rest of the novel I thought Lee started channelling Ayn Rand. Long, tedious, drawn out statements of philosophy ( Scout's & Atticus's). But, in my mind this was definitely the work of a young Harper Lee.
It is a good book. Not as good as Mockingbird but it looks obvious, to me, that it was written before Mockingbird so maybe Harper Lee just had a little bit less writing experience for this book. Other than that, this story closes a story line about Scout and her family.
The first 3 or 4 chapters were just "I'm still Scout" but Lee has no sense of romance. Relationship with Hank is very shallow and undeveloped. The rest of the book has everyone painted into little boxes trying to explain the emotions of integration in the south.
I have my B.A. in English, and all through this book I couldn't help thinking how much better it could have been with a thorough editing.  And, I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction that I won't try to identify here, in case it spoils the read for someone else.
I loved the book, though it takes a while to get going.  And it's not written as well as To Kill a Mockingbird is.  But it explores some timeless themes and I loved reading it.  I would imagine a person from the South would love it more so than I did, but I can't say.
Anyone negatively reviewing this book or believing the hype that branded Atticus Finch a racist clearly either did not read the book or did not understand it. This book is much deeper than Mockingbird & is not for those of you who like sappy heroic stories with happy endings. Most of these reviews are ridiculous and false, and only serve to remind us of why society is in the state that it's in. When nobody likes to think hard about difficult issues, examine painful truths & put yourself in the other person's shoes, but instead wants to believe everything they are told at face value & be spoonfed opinions in Hollywood movies, then you get what you get. The world is clearly full of Scouts who have never evolved & missed the whole point of the story. I applaud Ms. Lee for her wisdom in writing this & whoever made the decision to finally  publish it & apologize for all the narrow-minded readers who sadly don't get it. I fear for the fate of the world in their hands, as did Atticus. An excellent book. Feel ashamed, read it again & try a little harder to open your mind if you don't get that.
Disappointing from Harper Lee
Slow starting but good story.
It was interesting to read the follow-up to Kill a Mockingbird, and see how the South had changed and to revisit the community and the people. The South had changed in the era of NAACP and the Civil Rights Movement, but the person that shocks the reader, I think, is Atticus Finch twenty years<br/>later makes a difference. Scout is grown and had been living In New York. She is now called Jean Louise and begins to see her old boy friend. The first eighty percent of the novel is her look at the new South. Then she She follows her father and boy friend to a meeting and is shocked at what she hears. This sends her into a crisis. At this point there is tension to resolve. I felt the book was not written as well as her first, but I didn't want to close it and it held my interest. I felt the publishers should have started this proceed earlier when Harper Lee could have worked with them to improve the book a five star rating. She actually brought up some very important issues to this book. I feel it was sad that they didn't do that and not fair to the author. I think people should read the book.
Light comedy in first part of the book, in relationship with boyfriend, made reading fast and easy. Latter part of the book got a little heavy after she witnessed Atticus at the meeting, but do not think it paints Atticus as dark as the book reviews have said he was.
Go Set A Watchman is the necessary sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, allowing both the main character, Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, and the reader to overcome the childhood-naïvety-turned-adult-ignorance that surrounded Scout all of her life up until this pivotal point.
Boring!
Holy Moses--shades of Mockingbird and Harper Lee, but my first thoughts are how important a good editor is. Tay Hohoff was masterful. She gleaned the gold to be found in Watchman; pulled the nugget out and set Ms. Lee to writing about the trial and life in a small Southern town.<br/><br/>Eccentricities and eccentrics abound, plentiful tales to tell...no surprise there. Any one who has lived in the Deep South knows they are rabid about the War of Northern Aggression (who wouldn't be), miscegenation aka mongrelization, proper etiquette and States rights.<br/><br/>Psychologically it's easy to see why anyone who has loved Calpurnia and been loved well in return would be conflicted when her other parent was white. She be lovin' 'em boff. Hard stuff to reconcile and most likely impossible once you have created a hero, Atticus and know he has clay feet; all heroes do you know.<br/><br/>Pay close attention not much has changed even today once you look below that surface you scratched.  Thank you Ms. Lee.<br/><br/>What a petrie dish the South is...I love it!
In spite of what others have said about this book destroying Atticus Finch, I do not believe it did that at all. This is a coming of age story steeped in Southern dialect. Scout finally sees her father as he is: a Southern gentleman, to be sure, with all the good and bad that entails. There are many great phrases and a few wonderful paragraphs, but much that could be, and probably should be, edited out. When Jean Louis returns to her home town from NYC, the civil rights movement is in full swing, but many--maybe most--of those in her hometown are trying to control the speed of equal rights for all occurring. This is the conflict for Jean Louis. She had her father on a pedestal--as we all did--only to have him tumble. But I don't consider it a fall. He was still a good man, with high morals, and probably better than most at that time.<br/><br/>This book was an easy read and enjoyable. Growing up in the 50s myself, these very arguments took place in my home and the homes of many friends. The book is familiar, not comforting (how could it be?), but familiar.
The only captivating parts in this book are the moments that take you back to events during the time of Mockingbird. It's no wonder that after reading the manuscript, the editor (who's a genius for having recognised this) asked Harper Lee to write a book based on Scout's childhood.<br/><br/>There is familiarity in the writing, the setting and a few characters but, in the end I just wish that Ms.Lee would have stuck with her decision to never have another work published.
Preordered the book and got it at the same price as the day I ordered it. Shipping was fast and I got the book the next day after being released. I just started reading but so far it's good. There are some surprises ,but from what I have read so far it is good.
For those people who are up in arms about a new side of Atticus Finch being displayed, my advice is this:  untwist your knickers long enough to actually READ the WHOLE book.  Racism and the Civil Rights Movements are not even primary themes of this novel.  They are merely the context in which Scout learns the difficult truth that her beloved father is not perfect in every way.<br/><br/>This is a bildungsroman in which Scout comes to terms with her adult sensibilities and the realization that her father is only human, that she can profoundly disagree with her father and still love him.  There is even a passage in which she acknowledges that she considered herself "grown up" upon earning her bachelor's degree but learns that she still has some maturing to do.  This is a perfect sequel to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD because, in GO SET A WATCHMAN, we see the adult Jean Louis fulfilling the promise of integrity and humanity shown by her child self.  Yes, of course, I know that it was not meant to be published after MOCKINGBIRD, but this is what I think.
Not nearly as good as "To Kill a Mocking Bird", but it does clear up some areas and it does give closure to other stories.  After all of the excitement and hype, pre-publication, I guess I was expecting too much.  Not sorry I bought or read it, though.
It is hard to believe the same woman wrote this book that wrote my beloved To Kill a Mockingbird.  I wish there was a way to unread something, and shame on the publisher who must've only had money in their eyes
Quick read with familiar characters. Wasn't what I expected, but I was curio u s because I loved her previous work.
Detailed expose of the racist rationale for segration and repression.  For Atticus and his friends and relatives the civil war is ongoing.<br/>The desire for a nation of independent states (states rights) trumps all else. Their way of life must be preserved.
A little wordy for me.  Obviously it was not intended for publication when written.  Not too bad. But writing falls in the category of second books written when author is pushed to write something.  They are never as good as first.  Exception is John Grisham.
I was afraid to see my hero debunked--but that was just hype!  This story belongs to Jean Louise, and it was her coming of age, just like TKAM was for Jem. A good read, and completely satisfying. And BTW, it doesn't bother me that my heroes have clay feet.
Despite the controversy, this is a great book wiritten by a great author? I enjoyed this thought provoking novel.
It's worth all of the hype around the book. Quick and fun read and appropriate for issues facing our own culture.
Miss Lee was smart in publishing "To Kill a Mockingbird" first. It's not that this book wasn't a good read, but I wasn't held spellbound. Very little was likable about any of the characters, so what they did or didn't do mattered not at all. Darn.
At first I thought this was not a book that was up to the prior book "To Kill A Mockingbird" but you have to read the entire book to get its message. I really liked by the time I got to the end. My main complaint is you need a dictionary when you read it.
A couple of disclaimers:  I "read" both "Mockingbird" and "Watchman" via audio book.  And, I read "Mockingbird" first, so it's impossible for me to consider "Watchman" as a standalone work.<br/><br/>I'm a writer.  I believe the vitriolic criticisms of Lee's writing are unwarranted and unfair, particularly if it's true that the draft went virtually unedited before it was published.  In that context, the writing is very good. Certainly it does wander occasionally, and she does chew too long on a few ideas, but not badly.  Otherwise, there’s a lot of cleverness here.  And, quite frankly, it feels very modern and relevant.<br/><br/>Sure, there are character incongruities between the two books, but this one was never scheduled for publication…so it didn’t matter at the time.<br/><br/>On a related note, whatever editor read this manuscript more than five decades ago and saw the potential for what became “Mockingbird,” was a pure genius.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think it’s a good book.  Not a great book, but certainly worth my money.
The novel is quite an achievement and the adult Jean Louise dominates the pages with heroic stamina as she confronts the complexities of southern culture in the 1950's. I liked her. I liked the novel. I loved her stories of coming of age in a marvelous society of individuals and scholars and people of principle, including the woman of color who brought her up, Calpurnia. I myself think the Atticus of "Watchman" is a fine achievement. ---- And I heard nothing from his lips that he might not have said in "Mockingbird" had some one asked him. To assume that the hero of "Mockingbird" would have believed in de-segregation is a mighty stretch, indeed, and frankly I think a rather unnecessary one is make. --- And the Atticus of "Watchman" does not go unchallenged by his courageous daughter when he voices his views on race and race conflict of the 1950's. ---- Of course we find those views distasteful and dangerous, and rightly so. But then so does Jean Louise and she is the heart of the no... Read more
I did/do love this book. My only wish was that she had not killed off Jem & had brought back Dill. But I could see & feel the times she wrote about as if they were happening right now. Imagine what Scout would have thought about having a black president!
I had no expectations before reading the book. I have of course seen the movie To Kill a Mocking Bird.<br/><br/>It did not capture my interest, I did read it all and it was ok easy enough to read. I did not like Scout but did like the other characters.
The watchmen is a very very well done book. It puts a lot of good reasoning into the integration of attitudes in the south. I do not believe this book does any harm to my attitude towards Atticus in  Mockingbird, and is a valuable addition to my library.
As well written as "Mockingbird" but more relevant to today's world. Another great book from Harper Lee.
So disappointed.  I have read To Kill a Mockingbird  many times.  Sorry to say, this one will get one read only.
At first wasn't sure about finishing this book, but glad I did.  Story is a little weak, but It develops a very interesting view of racism and the impact of the NAACP and ACLU influence.  I think only time can tell if the view is meaningful or accurate.
This book made a lot of sense. Harper Lee was probably dreading the release of the book, as she plainly tells the truth about racism.  Atticus is a typical man of the times.  No one should be shocked. If they were, they are living in a fairy tale world.
Awful. The book doesn't really have a plot beyond revealing that Atticus and Jean Louise's would-be fiancee are racists, along with most of Maycomb. Tedious and clumsy. I feel sorry for Harper Lee, because this really shouldn't have even been published.
The best thing about this book is that it caused me to go back and research the reasons for the civil war.  Since a small percentage of southerners were slave holders, why did the other people fight and die?  I believe I have a better understanding now.
I grew up in the south, but I was from a large city rather than a small one.  However, I found "Go Set a Watchman: A Novel" a very authentic depiction of the small Southern life during the 50's and 60's.  One of the problems with this book is it's comparison with "To Kill a Mockingbird."  The expectations of this novel diminish its merit.<br/><br/>This novel is about the impact of cultural change in the south.  There were three sides in this novel, those waiting for change, those not wanting to change and then those who don't know the best way to cope with the change.  The representations of the characters facing change are genuine. I felt like I knew all of these people when I was younger.<br/><br/>Also, I felt that this novel was about maturation of individuals.  The difference between preconceived expectations and the realization of other factors.  This is an excellent novel about real life. I couldn't begin to describe all the facets of the characters.  It's a shame Harper Lee didn't write more.
Disclaimer: I've heard that reviews for this book are quite negative - but I purposefully didn't read them before reading it - mainly so I could decide for myself.<br/>Go Set A Watchman is not a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird as much as it is an allegory to it.<br/>As someone who spent a lifetime idolizing a Dad, this story presented to me a deep and meaningful point: we are shaped by those around us and despite our best efforts to set ourselves apart from Mom & Dad, we apples truly don't fall far from the tree.<br/>Harper Lee's writing style is both smooth and nuanced. She consistently reveals just enough about her characters and their relationships to fully draw in a reader. Despite reading this book in a day, I spent a lot of time drawing conclusions about everything: homecomings, adolescence, mores and morals, regionalism and (more than anything) the politics and emotions that must have been so much a part of bringing the South out of its slave era mentality.<br/>This is a *great* yarn. I highly recommend it.
I like the sense of place. It was like slipping into something so familiar. I like the nakedness of the conversation about race. Things were written that would never be said most conversation. Give me a view of the south as a northerner I did not have.
Although Go Set a Watchman was written in 1955, it seems we are still having the same arguments today.  Which is more important, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, or the 14th?  Do we ignore individuals' rights on the basis of State's rights?  The backdrop of the unanimous  Brown v. Board of Education decision reminds  us of every controversial Supreme Court decision since. This book could have been written with any one of them as a backdrop.  But even more, what happens when a young woman finds out that her moral viewpoints are polar opposite of not only her father, but her hero?  I agree with the many reviewers that this book works best having already read To Kill a Mockingbird .  Harper Lee was able to give us Atticus Finch as the ultimate southern hero, He was someone not afraid to stand up to the bigotry of the South.  He was the man that understood the difference between what was legal and what was just.  Anyone who loves the original novel feels all the betrayal and conflict of Jean Louise in this one.
Those that are reviewing GSAW as a stand alone book, are complete idiots! Especially those who say " I'm a writer myself".  People!!!! This was the first draft of Harper Lee's writings that gave birth TKMB!!  Basically it is like saying. ...."I really like the dinner you made, but watching you prepare it just makes me sick".  With that, I thought it was interesting for Harper Lee to allow us into her kitchen to see how she made dinner, TKMB........a fantastic dish!!,  thank you for letting us in years later to see how it was made!
This story, touched my heart, and my mind.  A wonderful story, I think I will read it again, probably tomorrow.
I was prepared to hate it since TKAM is one of my favorite books ever. The prose here isn't as refined and some of it is directly from TKAM which I read immediately before this. The tone is darker, there's swearing (!) but the last chapter is amazing.
As I just finished To Kill a Mockingbird, I really enjoyed this book. I felt close to the characters and understood Scout's confusion over her father's views regarding race. The book was a bit slow and tedious at some points, but overall a good read.
Awesome book, fast shipping
Great read, classic Harper!
It was so different than Mockingbird, but in a good way.  It bridged the gap of years with ease.  I loved it.  I saw the difference between Atticus' views and Jean Louise's, between his generation and hers.  I saw prejudice in Atticus which was never there before, but I think this was a good launching pad to Scout's own views.  I didn't dislike Atticus because of his differing views, at least not much.  I think there was an undercurrent present that the reader was not directly exposed to, and it made me vascilate between Scout and Atticus concerning this issue (of blacks possibly holding office, etc in the future.)  While I do not agree with Atticus regarding this issue, I think it gave the book a launching pad which spanned the two generations; something to both connect and disconnect opposing views.  I think it is a beautiful, loving book and I will re-read it many times in the years to come.  Harper Lee continues to be my favorite author.  I hope she gets a Pulitzer Prize for Watchman; she deserves it.
Harper Lee was prescient when she wrote Go Set A Watchman, a book that is eerily timeless for it anticipates and underscores the continuing racial angst that has existed and is yet a part of this moment in America. Harper Lee's voice is like setting down in a comfortable rocker and visiting an old and dear friend who returns us to both the good and the bad of our communal struggle, as well as the earnest desires for a better world for all in a distant and different time. The individual and personal nature of that struggle and those earnest desires for a better world remain a part of our character in every generation, resonating in these pages.<br/><br/>Scout/Jean Louise returns to Maycomb, Alabama after living in New York City. In 1950s America, she has experienced an integrated America at a time when segregation was the rule in the South. Her moral conscience, molded by Atticus more than her Church or school during her childhood, was realized in the culture of New York; the return to the c... Read more
Mixed feelings a out The book... Nicely written, beautiful moral, a bit tedious and it feels like something was missing in The plot. Nothing like To Kill a Mockingbird. I was dissappointed throughout The book but was nicely surprised by The ending.
The switch from 1st to 3rd person narrative threw me in places, but an easy & quick read.  If you love Mockingbird be warned, this is not the same type of book and you will do yourself injustice if you look for the "Mockingbird" Atticus. He is older and 'uncomfortably' racist.  It is astonishing to me that Lee wrote it when she did.  The subject is tense and complex, as are the characters. But as all good books do, this one moved me.
In this book, you will not find the characters you found in "To Kill A Mockingbird."  Some of them will have the same names, but not the same personalities or character traits.  You will see a new writer striving to find her voice as an author.  Sometimes the voice comes through clearly, and one gets a glimpse of the classic that is to come.  These flashes of future greatness raised my rating to three stars.<br/>Even though the book deals with Jean Louise Finch as an adult, it cannot be considered as the continuation of her life story.  So much is not consistent with the events or characterizations in "Mockingbird."  These inconsistencies lead me to believe that Lee did not expect this book to be published; some of the better material is even repeated verbatim in "Mockingbird."<br/>The book seems to me to be a rehearsal for the classic that is to come; a dry run, a first draft, an early experiment. That is probably its greatest contribution as a work of literature.
Since this was the original version and was revised in To Kill a Mockingbird, I can appreciate the work that went into the revision that has surpassed time and culture. To Kill a Mockingbird has and always will be a classic. Thank you Harper Lee.
A n exquisite contribution  to the annals of history  by Harper Lee.The writing  and language brings a true assessment  of the racial climate of her home during that crucial period in the 50's .A must for readers of great literature and history .
Brilliant writer. The discussions between Scout and Atticus and her uncle drive at the core and origins of bigotry. The writing itself is so visual. What a great story teller. It's a shame that this book has not received the acclaim it deserves.
I think this book stands an an excellent companion piece to Mockingbird.  It was sort of refreshing to see Atticus Finch treated as human being with flaws, rather than as an abstract ideal of morality.  It felt much more vibrant and real to me.
Don't expect this to be "To Kill a Mockingbird".  It is not, though there are many of the same characters.  It has (typical of Nelle Harper Lee) some philosophies that made me stop and consider.  I will go back and read this book again.
I did enjoy the book. I saw the conflict in Scout as she was made aware of Southern life,  not as she remembered it, but in the reality of life as it is. I felt Atticus was over trivialized and misunderstood.  It was a good read buy not great.
Not much of a story at all.  Very disappointed.
I had read TKAM in school, in college and 20 times since then. I have read a few bios of Harper Lee and the documentary that came out in the last 3 years and this is the reason i understand this story: This is the first rough draft novel Lee wrote and turned in. This is what Lee wrote and rewrote at her publishers request to define it down to the children and adding the story of Tom Robinson/Boo Radley and those memories, and not the adult Scout and the older Atticus and her romance with the young man.. That she fleshed out the latter IS the better story, as when i read GSAW i read the flashes of brilliance that TKAM has... This book is "as is" i believe and it is a very good story in itself.  Jean Louise/Scout is still feisty and Atticus still who he is only older and in my opinion more fleshed out.  I liked it very much.. Not the same as Mockingbird, similar, but different, if that makes sense.. Still a treasure on its own of a young author on the cusp of greatness.
a very big disappointment.
really enjoyed reading it.
Good read and informative.
Harper Lee writes so well!
A struggle with the ways in which a hometown can shape you...or how you can shape it.  A great discovery of the self and how each of us has the potential to separate our selves from the world...and then how to re-enter in a constructive way.
I loved it but I think it's because I first reread "To Kill a Mockingbird" ,  therefore the story was fresh in my mind,  then I "listened" (audio) to Reese Weatherspoon read " Go Set a Watchman".  She did a great job!
I laughed about the article I read on Slate as the book came out about parents who'd named their sons Atticus being upset by this book. Now, I get it. It would almost be easier if Scout's hero father was unambiguous in his racism. No. He's patronizing of blacks and tolerant of the truly hateful in the name of changing Southern culture from the inside out. Or at least, this is what I gather from the weird explanation Scout's uncle makes.<br/><br/>The problems with the book seem to come from the real theme being one young woman's disillusionment in her father and upbringing using the prop of segregation and racism in the rural South as a device to tell the story.<br/><br/>It seems to me, the editor who asked Ms Lee to write another book about the characters, set in Scout's childhood, was the true visionary. I wish we'd gotten a heavily rewritten Watchman while the author was young enough to correct the problems and leave a more decisive legacy for the characters.
"First of all," he said, "if you can learn a simple trick, Scout, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view […] until you climb into his skin and walk around in it." (3.85-87)<br/>As I see it, its the same Atticus Finch in both books. In Watchman he pleads with Scout to consider the entire context of people's lives, climb into their skin. Ditto with Mockingbird, the context is different, Mockingbird was set in the early 1930s, the worst of the Depression years, when Scout was only 6 or 7. Watchman was set 20 years later in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision on desegregation, Brown v. the Board of Education.<br/>Atticus was never Gregory Peck. Gregory Peck was not a southerner, and culturally very different from Atticus.<br/>Watchman was written first, a plea to understand the South, from the point of view of a Southern young woman who had spent some time in New York City. It was authentic, a plea to consider the strife in the South from the point of view of putting yourself into the skins of white Southerners.<br/>Mockingbird was written at the suggestion of Harper Lee's publisher because, I assume, her authentic first book Watchman was not deemed to be capable of being a great commercial success.<br/>Harper Lee was young and she did what she was told. She then wrote a book, Mockingbird, which was a fantastic commercial success because it was a simple morality tale, and because Gregory Peck was the lead actor in the movie version.<br/>Gregory Peck said there was no other role he played that was more authentically himself than in the movie Mockingbird.<br/>Maybe so, but Gregory Peck was not Atticus Finch, if Peck essentially played himself in Mockingbird, he was not quite faithful to the depiction of Harper Lee's actual father, Atticus Finch.<br/>That is the core of the problem. Most of us learned about Atticus Finch from observing Peck, but Peck was playing himself, not so much the Southern white gentlemen, Atticus Finch.<br/>Thus, the disillusionment with the book Watchman.<br/>Atticus Finch was a Southern lawyer, State legislature, pillar of the community in a very rural southern Alabama town.<br/>He was asked to defend an African American man in a rape case.<br/>Which he did conscientiously. That was impressive.<br/>But the jury was all white. Atticus Finch made no motion for an African Americans to be on the jury in Alabama circa the early 1930s. The case was lost right there.<br/>No where in Mockingbird was there a suggestion that this Southern white man was in favor of school integration, no suggestion that he was a racial liberal in the sense we conceive of it in 2015. That is something many of us read into it. But it was not actually in Mockingbird itself, neither the book nor the movie version.<br/>I highly recommend both books. They are consciousness raising.<br/>Watchman was the original work of art, with the complexities of human frailties in her family, from a white woman's point of view, certainly not written within the skin of an African American nor that of a northern white.<br/>Mockingbird, by contrast, was original art turned into commercial art, absolutely politically correct, good and evil, from the point of view of a white child in awe of her attorney father, who was nothing but perfectly good and wise, the strange unreal phenomenon of a northern liberal somehow miraculously living in the Deep South, in south west rural Alabama in the Depression. A pure work of fiction created to sell to northern children, and did it sell!!! Forty million copies so far and still going, a great international commercial success, it made Gregory Peck's Hollywood career more than any other movie.<br/>Likely Peck never knew Watchman existed and perhaps had he known the flawed real character Atticus really was, Gregory would never had taken the part in the movie Mockingbird.<br/>Taken together, they are original art for adults, with all their flaws and conflicts, Wachman, versus the commercial morality play derivative for children of all ages, Mockingbird. The contrast between the three works of art, the two books and the Hollywood movie, is strictly for grown ups. It's the real world, not for the faint of heart, not for children, nor the self righteous politically correct adult.
I'd prefer a fifth category; something like "very good," between Good and Great-Great is reserved for Phillip Roth's Goodbye Columbus & Portnoy's Complaint-And work like Peter May's "Lewis Man" and the Blackhouse & Chessman.
Love this Author.  First was To Kill A Mockingbird.  Great character development, very good for memories.
Thought I wasn't going to like this the first few chapters, but this book was very good and I enjoyed it.
i wasn't sure whether i would like this book... thought it would be difficult to follow up on greatness. But, perhaps Ms. Lee is opening up a line to a kind of humility we have all forgotten in this age of selfies and self-promotion.
While I didn't feel that the book was as well written as To Kill A Mockingbird, I recommend reading it.  I think the media exaggerated Atticus's being a racist as the story should be  considered in the time frame in which it was set.
She has a way with words.
It was unexpectedly good.
Nothing new in this book!
Almost as good as To Kill
Best book in a long time!
Overhyped! Not impressed!
left a lot to be desired.
Surprising and thoughtful
Boring

Awful.

I don't understand why some people didn't like it because it seemed that Atticus had changed. They need to understand that Martin Luther King hadn't come on the scene yet! He had to survive in the 50's in that environment. Poor Jean Louise was brought up color blind, and couldn't understand her father's changed position. I understand her pain as I was brought up that way also. If I saw my dad change his position I'd be devastated also. But, by the end of the book, both her uncle and Atticus explained themselves well enough to see why they had to somewhat change their position at least on the surface. Those who returned the book obviously didn't finish. It does make more sense in the end. It's sad that it had to be that way, but the author was being realistic, and she didn't sugarcoat the situation. It was true to life at that particular era. So, yes, I liked the book and am glad that I purchased it!
Quite a different turn in writing. But the message finally is told at the very end. There were plenty of jumbled parts that made no sense. i am glad I re- read To Kill A Mockingbird before this so I could follow her thinking.
Not at all as i expectef
This book killed me.....
I didn't want it to end!
Enjoyed it tremendously!
Harper Lee is Wonderful.
Beautifully written read
Although I have read To Kill a Mockingbird ages ago somehow I feel that this is a better story explaining how the deep south dealt with  racial issues and the emergence of the NAACP and Martin Luther King. I liked it a lot.
This is evidently NOT Harper Lee's Writing!  FAKE...Ghost writer.  She must have not known the ruse that was going on when this bok was approved and her name was ascribed to it.. Very dissapointing.  Shame on the publisher.
While I don't think it will be the classic To Kill a Mockingbird was, it was interesting to find out what happened to Scout, Jem, Atticus, and Calpurnia. It does carry a message for young women trying to make their own way.
This was a disappointing read. It is clear that it was written prior to her masterpiece, To Kill A Mockingbird. And it just doesn't compare. It seems sophomoric at best. I was so excited to read this but it did not deliver.
Written better than I expected and an enjoyable read keeping in mind the era in which it was written.  I thought Atticus was characterized pretty much as I had expected after reading several reviews before reading the book
This brought up memories of growing up in the South in the 1950's.  Very entertaining!
Not nearly as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, but was glad that I read it.  I believe that the really bad reviews come from religious zealots that did not like the interpretations that Scout gives about organized religion.
I need to re read Mockingbird still, but this book was amazing. All race issues aside, it was wonderful to see twenty something Scout speaking her own mind. She's a very strong character and a good contrast to Atticus.
This book is a wonderful depiction of the south, both as we want it and as it was.  It ranks with Ferrol Sams' books, Olive Burns' Cold Sassy Tree and T.R. Pearson's A Short History of a Small Place.  These books all depict the flowers and the warts of small town southern life - the characters, the social milieu, the familial connections and the underpinning racial tension.<br/><br/>This book is well written and thoughtful.  I can see why an editor demanded the coming of age story instead.  And it easier to accept this book already knowing (or thinking we do) the characters.  I am not sure it would have had even a small portion of the acceptance as the first (and possibly only) book of Harper Lee.  So thank the prescient unknown editor for forcing the rewrite, the creation of a classic, and the final discovery of a continuation to the story of Maycomb and Scout.
I enjoyed the writing and it really reflects the period that the novel is set in and along with the people of the time. It is a real reflection of most peoples emotions and not what people feel they should be feeling.
I thought the book tried to include too many plots and did not reach a conclusion on all of them. Scout as a adult was controversial like she was as a child. I was glad to finish the book and I was disappointed in it.
Not as good as: "To kill a mockingbird" but a good read. I lived in the South at that time in history and I thought Harper Lee gave a truthful account of some of the turmoils experienced by southern families.
Harper Lee presents a compelling view of changing attitudes through the generations. It also tells a tale of growing up and finding maturity to tolerate different family values among our elders. Certainly a good read
I think it was essential to read To Kill a Mockingbird first. That helped to make Scout's outrage somewhat understandable. Social/political thinking must be taken into consideration for the time this story is set in.
I can understand why this book was not immediately published. The long discussions between Scout and Atticus and Henry and Uncle Jack are far too involved and dull, but the flashbacks to her childhood are brilliant.
I couldn't get into it.
Very thought provoking.
It has an important message, dealing with an issue still in the news today. I think it is a sequel to her previous book, but is confusing since she apparently wrote it first. I liked To Kill a Mockingbird better.
I thought it was a great read and true to the time frame setting. Really my disappointment was Scout's immaturity at the age of 26.  I feel that she missed the best in her friend Hank and the love of a life time.
After finishing the book, I turned right around and read it again. Like many people, I was disappointed in the racism. But you know what, that's how it really was back then. I'm not saying it was right, just as it isn't now. Re-reading the book right away helped me get over the emotional experience and see love and lessons I can learn from this time in our history.
Very interesting. Looks like Harper Lee has a lot to say about how her first book was interpreted. I greatly enjoyed the chance to see more than one point of view. I good read all around. Thank you again Ms. Lee
A different perspective than "To Kill A Mockingbird" but still a compelling read.  I enjoyed Scout as a young woman.  Harper Lee still successfully makes you think about why people do the things they do.
This is not To Kill A Mockingbird, it's about Scout discovering her father is not who she believed him to be; an icon crumbling. I understand why the early editor sent this back to her to concentrate on Scout's childhood stories, as in this book, her childhood memories held the best writing. (Chapter 11 is a hoot!) I found the switching pronouns within the same page odd, but I understood what was happening. This book hits home when it reveals the easy comfort of "keeping one's place" in Maycomb, and the angry uproar outsiders (NAACP) bring to the "peaceful" southern town. And I understood the thinking of all parties, though did not agree. There is always hidden secrets behind tradition. It's an honest look at how change can disrupt the human heart. Thank you Harper Lee for sharing your writing process and this story.
This is not a sequel or a "prequel" to Kill a Mockingbird, but an evolution of the characters and story. Many have felt betrayed by the change in our nationally beloved Atticus Finch, but for me, this is where the poignancy lies. As a child, Scout viewed her father, as did we, as an unblemished hero, painted in one large swath of color- that of white knight in shining armor. But the truth is, in reality, no one is ever one thing and/or one color. And this is what "Go Set a Watchman" does- it gives complexity to characters who were unabashedly single-stroke paintings in Mockingbird. Scout's disillusionment, as well as ours, is because as adults, we see complexity where there was none when we were children. Scout has grown, and if you the reader are open to it, so will you and you feel her betrayal and anguish.
I really liked this book.  So Atticus was somewhat racist... it's fiction, people.  It's really entertaining and thought provoking.  Re-read "To Kill a Mockingbird" first and that made it even better.
Outstanding!  Loved catching up on the characters of years gone by through the eloquent writing style that could be none other than Harper Lee.  She gives us something to ponder about human nature once again.
While I enjoyed the book I thought the story ended to soon. And not enough detail about Atticus and his feelings . I was hoping it would have touched on a few more areas of how his employees felt about him...
Refreshing and relatable.  Certainly different than To Kill A Mockingbird, but I'm still so glad to have read it.  I'm secretly hoping she has other stories of Scout hidden in her safe to release eventually!
Lee captures the depth of small-town Southern racism - then or now.  This novel is more honest than "Mockingbird" because most Southen towns did not have a single person enlightened about race, whereas in "Mockingvird" Atticus is a courageous fighter for Black rights. This is not believable.  But this Atticus shows the narrow meaness of white superiority, even in a man who is otherwise likeable.<br/>I am about Scout's age - I grew up in a small town about 100 miles from this one, and when I was grown I moved toNew York, learned new ways of thinking and acting - and suffered the same shock about racism when I later returned home.  The novel tells this saga well.  But its ending is vague: what does Scout now do with her new knowledge?  We get no hint - even though her new knowledge will change her life.
Enjoyed the book,but comparison to To Kill is always on the reader's mind-at least I found it to be so. It is a good read-I share others thoughts that it may not be entirely her work. Glad I read it,though.
I really did enjoy the book.  Mostly because I identified with Scout having lived thru the tumultuous fifties and sixties in the deep south.  Of course, To Kill a Mockingbird always loomed.  Glad I read it.
I read this book because I am a big TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD fan.  I have to say that although it was nice revisiting the characters, I found myself a little disappointed in the plot. It was still a good read.
I give this book a 5 because I feel there is much to be learned here. Not just about race relations but also about one's conscience and Father and Daughter relationships,  I had tears in my eyes at the end.
Rely ratifies one star
Worthwhile reading !!!
Such a disappointment.
Good book for my kids.
I was disappointed in the book!!I LOVED  To Kill a Mockingbird!! I think the author was wonderful, but tooooo wordy<br/>and much to much discription of narrative.  It was ok--, but a little disappointing.
While not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, it was interesting to hear the racial issues being discussed through Harper Lee's prose.  They are controversial and would make for a good book group discussion.
I feel that Harper Lee depicted the time setting exceptionally well.  Even though Atticus had attended questionable groups he never did so in a way that made him a different person from the Atticus in To Kill a Mockingbird.  Scout is color blind to race and speaks well toward integration at a time when that was not the thinking of the land.  I lived through the time setting that Harper Lee used in this novel and felt she depicted the time very accurately. The scenes depicting Scout, Jem, and their friend, Dill, were extremely funny and showed how children played with few toys in a creative way.  The church revival was especially typical of this time period. I would recommend this historical novel to be read by those with an open mind. It is well written as is To Kill a Mockingbird, one of my all time favorites.
Although this book has received some negative reviews, I found it to be very thought inspiring!  I had pre-ordered the book, and I read it before anyone else had.  After reading it, I found that all I wanted to do was talk about it, but I couldn't because none of my friends or family had read it yet.  I had a hard time keeping it to myself until someone I knew had read it and could discuss it!<br/>I found the confrontation between Jean Louise and Atticus to be very thought provoking.  I tried to put myself back into Atticus' time and understand where he was coming from, and yet I was upset with myself for giving him that latitude!  I sided with Jean Louise, but I wondered if she could have treated her father with more respect, as I have often had to do with my own father when disagreeing with him on issues.
No, it's not as good a book as "To Kill a Mockingbird," but there's no feasible way that it ever could have been. It's as much of a read about growing up, in a way, as it's predecessor. Really enjoyed it.
The story begins slowly, but with patience, I enjoyed the final conversation with Scout and  Atticus.  The book proves  Lee<br/>writes very well and has a message .  I wish she had time to write another.
Loved it! When I got finished reading it the first time, I went back and read it again!
A good look at the transition from a parent-child relationship to an adult relationship
This certainly is a book of contradictions. The main character in To Kill a Mockingbird has taken a 180 degree turn and is now a racist. Caught between turbulent times is Scout. Scout goes back home after being in NYC for a period of time only to come back to a very backwards Maycomb County. Throughout the entire book, we find Scout struggling with what has become of her friends and family not to mention her hometown. It is a coming of age book except in Scout's case, it came a little too late.<br/>I am on the fence with this book and clearly this is not what I had anticipated.<br/><br/>There are times where the book is confusing. I had to go back and reread a portion that had me jumbled up as to it it was Lee was referring to. Definitely not one of Lee's better works. I would give it a 3 overall.
I made it through the 2nd chapter and put it down.  It was strange and quite boring.  I hated the character of Scout..  She was highly disrespectful and immoral.  Not the girl of To Kill A Mockingbird.
I could hardly put this book down. Smart lady. Good perspective on the real world.
The Huck Finn racial prejudice conundrum circa 1955 (approximately). Mockingbird presents Atticus Finch as a saint. Watchman adds dimension to him and makes him human. the scene in which 26 year old Jean Marie visits Calpurnia at her home during a period of personal crisis for her former nanny and substitute mom has enormous impact. In Mockingbird we see Atticus as father and committed lawyer in the 1930's deep South. we don't notice that he has no personal black friends save Calpurnia, who knows her place. Atticus is probably as progressive as we could ask a white rural Alabamian to be. But in the postwar world he's out of place. I think that Harper Lee released this book because she wanted to know that. Through the Atticus character, we confront ourselves.
Thoughtful is the word. It makes me think. Try to see things from another point of view. It doesn't actually change my mind about my basic beliefs, but helps me understand how others may feel.
Interesting to read for who ever is concerned with racial or gender discrimination. it provides insights which are relevant also today, despite the fact that it was written some 60 years ago.
I felt there was too much time devoted to the past which didn't seem to really add much to the theme of the story.  Fortunately, I stuck it out to the end and found it to be worth the effort.
ending left hanging- only of interest as a rough draft for To Kill a Mockingbird.
First few chapters are boring. And then...all I can say is, "I am Scout."
If you enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird, I think you will like this sequel. Scout has grown up and learns some upsetting things about her family and town when she spends her vacation back home.
Some of my book club members did not like this because of what they did to Scout!  I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" years ago and loved it!  And I loved this one too and recommend it!
"To Kill a Mockingbird" is written from the perspective of a small child, Scout, who has through her fathers involvement with the law opened her eyes to elements of Southern society at the time.  "Go Set a Watchman" continues with Scout as an adult who returns home who through her fathers involvement with that same society, opens her eyes further to elements she finds abhorrent that probably had existed all along.  Many have been disappointed that the child's vision is not still there as an adult, but need to look at the two works in total and see a wonderful description of a reality that in many ways exists not only in the south but in much of america.  A great, thoughtful piece of writing.  I am glad it was finally released.
I was extremely disappointed in this book.  I would like to get my money back.i
Dated

Awful
What?
so so
Good.
Great
I absolutely love "To Kill A Mockingbird" and it is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. I read it for the first time two years ago and was extremely disappointed to find out that there was no sequel. When I heard that Harper Lee was writing a second book, I knew I had to read it and when I finally got it I could not put it down and I literally read it in one sitting. After it all sunk in, I was dumbfounded. There are so many plot twists and shocking revelations... it was heart wrenching. I cried after finishing it. Writing a sequel as great as "To Kill A Mockingbird" is a difficult challenge indeed, but Harper Lee did it. "Go Set A Watchman" is a definite must-read if you enjoyed the first book.
Very upsetting & disappointing.<br/>So much that I reread "To Kill a Mockingbird" again.The writing in this book is beautiful and descriptive.<br/>In "Go Set a Watchman",this is not so,aside from the main character being much older,there is just something in how it is written I<br/>sincerely doubt if Harper Lee actually contributed much to this book.<br/>The difference in Atticus's ability to help his children's values of how to interact with all people with mindfulness and kindness only to find out in "Go Set a Watchman" that he is very predjudice and not at all what we believed from the 8 year old Scout's perspective.<br/>The difference in writing style is not at all like "To Kill a Mockingbird'.
A very good book however it got a little preachy at the end. It is not as good as "To Kl A Mockingbird" but is very interesting to read for development of the main characters.
I enjoyed reading the continued story of Scout (Jean Louise), all grown up as she returns to Maycomb county and finds it is not the same as when she left it to go to New York; their prejudice and racial injustice against the black community. I miss not finding Jem in the picture anymore and grieve his loss as a character I found as vivid as Scout's. Finding that Aticus is a different man now than she knew growing up and seeing his lack of empathy towards the black people and the conflict between them come to a head, then resolved as she learns that through the years people can change as life changes them, and their perspective. It was a good story and history lesson of life in the south during the civil rights era.
Feels like it was written for today.  Complete with more adult sized lessons!
I don't believe Harper Lee wrote this.<br/>Even if she did, she never intended it to be published!<br/>Don't buy it, and don't read it.<br/>Reread "To Kill a Mockingbird"!
Based on all the hype I expected a controversial twisted story but Harper Lee did not let her fans down.  I was pleasantly surprise and consider Watchman my second favorite Lee book.
Enjoyed reading it.  Loves the Southern dialect and the relationships in the book.  To Kill A Mockingbird is one of my all time favorites so it was nice to read another of her books.
Yes I definitely recommend this book.  I did not compare. A d read it as the authors first book. In today's society so much of bigotry prevails.  So much lack of understanding and miss understandings. An eye opener and conversation starter.  We as human beings need to make positive changes to our world.
Very eye opening theme:  you are what<br/>You came from.  This is how Scout became Jean Louise.  I suggest you<br/>Read "To Kill A Mocking" before you read<br/>This book.
I read To Kill a Mockingbird and loved it. Although this book had the same characters it was rather lack luster. It was a good thing that Harper Lee rewrote her original manuscript
The value of this book rests solely in its literary relationship with To Kill a Mockingbird which should be read first to allow for great discussion opportunities of the two books.
... than reviews led me to expect. Two issues worth pondering: Scout's daddy issues, and the difference, if any, between early conservatism and racism. Read it yourself and decide.
I hesitated to read "Go set a Watchman".  Would it ruin "To Kill a Mockingbird" for me?  Would it muddle the issues of growing up in the South during a time of conscience vs. deed?  But, I quit over-thinking, reread TKAM, and waded in.  TSAW is the natural progression of Scout's coming of age story. That it was written before TKAMB is insignificant. The only hint that it was supposed to be a stand alone novel is the difference in Tom Robinson's fate. There were no incongruities of character. We are all a product of our experiences and experiences change every day. Scout left home and returned to find that Maycomb was a dusty snapshot instead of a technicolor movie.  Been there, done that.
A woman comes back home, finds the townsfolk are all bigots and she's outgrown them all, and yells a lot.  End of story.<br/><br/>This is an okay book with little action and way too much talk.  The protagonist, Jean Louise,  and her family and friends talk everything to death and I grew impatient.  I think it would have worked much better as a short story, because the plot is so paper-thin.<br/><br/>If you loved TKAM, this might be a good sequel, because we do find out what happens to the Finches.  The best scenes are Jean Louise's childhood flashbacks, which seem sweetly familiar to those who love TKAM, but without the charm.  This book is narrated by a proper third person and there is virtually none of the rural vernacular that made TKAM so utterly lovable and memorable.<br/><br/>All in all, I was disappointed in (and bored by) the book.<br/><br/>And where's Boo?
Liked it better as I read on. So don't give up. The points that are made are worth waiting for. Confusing at times. Gives one a new perspective on "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Hmmmm... How much different are we today? Had to look up a lot of the words, not necessarily a bad thing. Will have to read again as I know I missed some of the finer points. Wow!
Disappointing novel
dated in a bad way!
Very disappointing.
hated for it to end
Disappointing read.
Excellent book with great characters and leaves you with lots of questions.
A good book challenges, makes one think and ruminates with us. Go Set a Watchman did exactly that.  I love the characters, flaws and all.  This was a gift that I am thankful for.
Many people are disappointed with this book, but let's be honest TKAM was one of the greatest books every written, so it had a lot to live up to.  It was good, but not great.  I
Perfectly fine prequel to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  It made me appreciate how beautifully Ms. Lee re-invented Atticus for her great, great novel.  Interesting study in authorship.
In the beginning chapters, there are numerous pompous words used which makes one feel as if the book was written by someone other than Ms. Lee; there is a feeling of pretentions "ring around" contained within.<br/><br/>There is an overall sadness as the main character, continuing to remember and act as a small child,  is totally shocked and unable to accept  as grown-up situations move into her present time; she is unable to fully grasp the meaning of the situations in the present.<br/><br/> Facing all of our " todays" and trying to continue to tie them to all our "yesterdays", is an age old situation that will continue be a main situation of the human existence.
This was difficult to get into for me. I found it slow and could stay interested in it. Kept putting it down. But the last half was much better and all in all a very good book.
It was thoughtful.  I don't have the problem that others had with the book.  It was a character who develops and does not quickly change, but sees more than just one dimension.
not a lot of story line here.....but shows good explanation of Scout growing up, and realizing that her Father was a very smart man, but not the perfect man she saw as a child.
I thought Go Set a Watchman was truly worth reading.  Some reviewers have suggested that it portrays Atticus as racist.  I don't agree.  In my opinion, it portrays Atticus as truly concerned with equal rights under law, as he understands law, and without prejudice.  The book may not make sense to younger people or those with no familiarity with the US and the South before 1960.  But it might be a good exercise for people who don't know or feel any sympathy for that time and place to try, as Scout had to try, to step outside our current culture, and mindfully consider another point of view and time.  There are some feelings, tensions and ideas presented that are very much with us today.
Disappointing
I desperately wanted to like this book, but overall it was so boring. There were big sections I had to force myself to keep reading. The best parts were Scout's recollections of her childhood, so I can see why the publishers said to write To Kill a Mockingbird about that, and not about Scout as an adult. She was a much more interesting child. I did not like what she did to Atticus, and I hated the ending. I would recommend keeping the love for Mockingbird and skip this one.
A great read from Harper Lee!  The trials of 'Scout' coming to terms with the reality of her home town is reminiscent of many who move away and return to find things changed!
It makes me wonder why Harper Lee didn't write more books. She has such a beautiful way with words and a great insight into the conflicted Southern mind of the 50s. Don't be put off by the sensationalist headlines following this book. It is not what you think. Scout confronts her father as we all do when we are young and realize that our parents are human. It is only our youth that clouds our vision of what they are versus what they do. She does it with love and I, who lived through those times, love the way she handles what was a complicated time, with compassion and understanding and firm conviction of what she knows to be right. Atticus would be proud and so would Mr. Lee.
I WAS A HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH TEACHER & EVERY YEAR I ALWAYS HAD THE CLASS READ "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD", A SIGNIFICANTLY WELL WRITTEN STORY WHICH I FELT TAUGHT LIFE'S LESSONS AND HOW CRUEL & DISGUSTING PEOPLE CAN BE AT TIMES. WHEN I HEARD HARPER LEE HAD WRITTEN ANOTHER BOOK THAT CONTINUED "TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD" I PURCHASED IT AS SOON AS IT WAS AVAILABLE. THANK GOODNESS IT ARRIVED QUICKLY BECAUSE THE DAY I ORDERED IT I BROKE BOTH OF MY ARMS & WAS LEFT WITH LITTLE TO DO.<br/>IT IS WORTH READING BUT I ADMIT AT TIMES IT WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO BELIEVE ABOUT CHARACTERS THAT I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT & TAUGHT AS INTELLIGENT GOOD PEOPLE WHO LIVED A LIFE FULL OF INTEGRITY.
I refused to read reviews before I read the book.  I've never been so disappointed in a book.  That's all I have to say!
I loved  meeting Scout  all grown up  and Atticus old. etc. The flash backs to her childhood incidents  were good too.<br/>Very interesting ....couldn't put the book down .
I did not have time to read this book yet.........but have been to St. Malo in France and toured this town twice.<br/>I am looking forward to this book.<br/><br/>CWDeLong
A continuation of "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Gives a seldom insight into southern views of integration and the problems involved.  Thought-provoking and well written.
Harper Lee has put our conscious on trial.  Her description of. The attitudes at that time is also timely today.  I'm glad that she agreed to publish this, her first, novel.
A must read for anyone who loved Mocking Bird - and for those fascinated or bemused by the issues exciting & inciting minds and feelings in this year's US election build up
Harper Lee would never have released this book for sale, so I suspect once her sister died, an attorney or someone took it 'out of the closet' because of the enormous money potential.  It's not a bad book.  It has Harper's wonderful voice and style.  It's just a young writer's book--a lot of telling, not showing--a lot of dialogue/little action.  Scout was dealing with issues about her father.  Contrary to reviews, it isn't about 'racism'; it's about a definition of bigotry, and Harper was brilliant with this theme...just not experienced enough to deliver it with the skill she had for Mockingbird.  I thought it was a great read.  Just not comparable to Mockingbird
At times the book was mesmerizing and a look at the Civil Rights movement in the south from the eyes of typical upper middle class white folk.  They did not consider themselves racist, but did not like the federal Government messing with their system and looking at it with a 2015 lens we would consider them racists.  Not a book that could have been published 60 years ago. Being published now is serves as a historical look at how people thought at the time and I doubt there is a better book to capture the feelings of the time.<br/><br/>With that said, with editing, it could have been a great companion to Mockingbird.  .  It gets very lost at times making it a 3
While it was a shock that Atticus turned out to be racist, Harper Lee's gorgeous prose was no less refreshing and indeed, i thought she handed a very difficult issue well
beautifully written; sweet return to maycomb, but also heartbreaking...
Thought provoking.
Didn't care for it
Very Disapointing.
i enjoyed the book
very disappointing
An important read.
I loved this book. What a revealingl looka t the story behind the first book, unknown until now. A great example things not being what they seem. This is a must read !!!
Difficult to follow at times. I am trying to take into consideration that this was not edited after Harper Lee wrote it years ago, but it does not make for an easy read.
Good southern story telling depicting interesting characters.  Though story is from the 1950's, I thought some to the race relations issues were quite relevant to today.
I enjoyed the story and I believe it would have benefitted from more editing,  Some of the exchanges between Scout and Atticus are didactic and too long.  There has been a lot of discussion about the revelation of Atticus' racism in this book after his heroic trial success in "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I believe that Harper Lee wrote convincingly from the perspective of an admiring daughter in the first novel.  In "Go Set a Watchman", Scout is a woman with her own values who came to see her father in a more mature way and not as her perfect parent.  Scout saw her father in one light as a child, and as a more complex human being as an adult.
It's very well written and a pleasure seeing the Finch family again, especially from Scout's adult perspective as the rural South's growing pains move to the forefront.
The novel is great. The book quality is poor. It is a rough end cut book. That was cheaply made. Amazing story from amazing author. Too bad book was produced so poorly.
I was disappointed with this book.  I would suggest rereading Mockingbird before reading this book; that way a comparison may be made of writing styles and credibility.
It has been years since I've read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  Took me a while to recalling of the story. This book definitely holds it own. The last half was quite preachy.
Harper Lee tackles a much more complex subject than in Mockingbird. She does it pretty well. If you lived in the South in the 60s and 70s, you will understand Atticus.
I really enjoyed this book. It was great getting to know all the characters again.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this book to all of you who enjoyed her original book.
I had read mockingbird a long time ago so approached this as a story on it's own and enjoyed it.  The journey for Scout from idealism to pragmatism is very well done.
Great book, fills in all the questions left unanswered in To Kill A Mockingbird. There are some shockers, and sadness, but over all I really enjoyed reading the book.
Quite honestly this was a disappointment. Anyone who comes into this expecting To Kill a Mockingbirrd will be disappointed. I'm not at all concerned (as much of the public is) that Atticus Finch turns out to be a racist. He's a fictional character and it's simply part of the story. But what concerned me was the overall story was simply weak and Scout, as an adult, was a preachy character. I loved her stance on the civil rights issues -- which reflect my strong beliefs that all races and ethnicities are equal -- but it was just too much. If you're waiting on the sidelines and still thinking about this, move along to the next book on your list.
This book appears to have been written after Mockingbird. My guess is that it was never polished and edited because why attempt to compete with a success like Mockingbird? The writing is not great and the plot is barely there. So the white townspeople of Maycomb are upset with Brown v Board of Education because they don't want the white and black children to mix? No news there. Southern whites have never seemed to grasp the fact that when you create an institution like slavery, it's up to you to fix the resulting problems. Hiding behind the 10th amendment is a pathetic smokescreen. Scout knew it, we know it. What's the point of the book?
Huge disappointment. Iconic characters dismissed with ' he dropped dead' and 'I think he's in Italy. Abrupt ending left me wondering if there were chapters missing.
So much talent so few books,  I love her words, with out a doubt one of our greatest American writers.  I found myself re-reading many phrases just to see it again.
I grew up in southeast Alabama during segregation Ms. Lee was in Southwest Alabama. The perspective of the book was interesting. It had meaning for me, personally.
I really enjoyed this book. Despite being written decades ago it addresses a timely subject about race in America, and explores the concept of individual identity.
I know this book has been controversial  but I loved reading it.  There are lots of back stories and the characters come alive.  Would recommend it ...absolutely!
This is a very different part of the story than To Kill A Mockingbird.  This is a book suspend that and take it as it's own book and its own story, though it is about the same characters - they are at a very different point in their lives.<br/><br/>I found it an excellent book and to me, it has "classic" written all over it.  But if you are looking for a direct extension of To Kill A Mockingbird, might want to release that expectation up front and just enjoy the book for what it is - a snapshot again, into the lives of the South and of the beloved characters.<br/><br/>I can recommend it!!  Harper Lee knew her stuff!
Much fine analysis here, in other reviews of storyline, comparison to Mockingbird, reasons for publishing, outrage over the 'development' of Atticus, etc. This review respects and appreciates all those opinions. I have many similar feelings. However, this review is simply for what this book means to bibliophiles. Lee's voice is one that I've missed. It's a voice that rings with honesty in relation to relationships, truthful insight on human character, and a rare quality to make you feel you know her, because she knows you. She knows what is at the heart of human struggle, on so many levels, and I love hearing this voice again.
Worth the wait. While not as polished as Mockingbird, it works as a perfect follow up to it. Now more mature, the 26 year old Scout returns to her hometown to discover the complexities of both personal and societal transformation in the the literal and figurative "black and white" South during the civil rights era. The grays of a people struggling to adapt to rapid and necessary change become evident, reflecting the complexities of life from an adult perspective. Contrary to some early reviews, Aticus' moral core remains intact, if not as perfectly rendered in the child Scout's memories as reflected in the classic Mockingbird.
Very average writing.  Did not feel good or educated after reading.
After all the hype and all the publicity about this novel I was a little weary to read it.  I understood what critics said about challenging our visions of Atticus Finch, who is for many a paragon of bravery and right living.  I was bothered at first with Lee's treatment of Scout/ Jean Louise's character in that she, at first, appeared to lack the independent spirit for which Scout was known.  As the narrative unfolded I found myself as emotionally involved and as affected as by Mockingbird.  This is a story about parents and children, and heroes and the nature of both growing up and growing into ourselves.  Do not miss this.
A must read for those who have read 'To kill a Mocking Bird'.  I enjoyed this look at Scout (Jean Louise) from an adult's look at how things must change to grow.
Truly facsinating especially since I'm deeply familair with To Kill a Mockingbird. Watchman is extremely well written, beautifuly crafted, and a delight to read.
I chose the book because of the author.  Th chapter about the revival was so funny it brought tears to my eyes.  The note to the Principal was pretty good, also.
Amazing read!!!!!
did not care for.
very well written
This is an excellent book- you can't put it down. All the criticism can be summed up by W.H.Auden's poem-<br/>“We would rather be ruined than changed<br/>We would rather die in our dread<br/>Than climb the cross of the moment<br/>And let our illusions die.”
As a child of the 1950's south, this remarkable book answered many vague, indistinct, complex questions about the racial relationships of that era.  There was love, hate and fear but also a sense of family that is now gone.  Thank you, Harper Lee for this book.
Go set a watchman was a good, quick read, that showed peoples'hearts and attitudes and the grit that constitutes one of the more significant parts of character.
I AM SORRY THE STORY WASN'T LONGER.  I REALLY ENJOYED READING ABOUT THE SOUTH DURING THEE YEARS.  WISH THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER BOOK. LOVED THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN
When I first heard about the direction the author took surrounding Atticus Finch, I was surprised and concerned that this wouldn't jive with the first book. This was not the case. Ms. Lee delivers a perspective not only on  Scout's relationship with her father, but another way of viewing racism at that time in history, which is clear that not all that much has changed in 50-60 years. It makes you think deeply and with compassion about the people we consider racists and the definition of racism in the context of how they were raised and the environment and community in which they grew with to have formed these beliefs.
Someone apparently told Harper Lee, way back in the 50s, and I'm paraphrasing,  that the story she wrote that became "Watchman", was a collection of "reflective episodes," not a novel.  Maybe so.  But she has such a talent for writing engaging, absorbing prose, that one gets mesmerized by the content.  And, to a large extent, the reflective episodes help you understand the characters better, and to make the dialogue and the actions of the characters that much more believable.  While this book is not another "Mockingbird," it is still something everyone should read, at least once in their lives.
Go Set a Watchman ....needs to be read.....Very timely......actually felt the early reviews were .....before the book had been presented......were unfortunate and poor...read the book and appreciate all of the emotions and sensitivity of one and all..... I agree that To Kill a Mockingbird was published at a perfect time in history....That was the best and represents an era magnificently told.....and again the time is right for Go Set a Watchman......it perhaps should have been published several years ago...and served a greater purpose, however, I totally thought it a great read and have, recommended it to my friends.
OK--not great and certainly not as wonderful as the previous book.
Not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird, but still an excellent book.
It's a nostalgia trip for those of us who loved To Kill a Mockingbird. It is beautiful writing and a gentle read, a real pleasure but it won't rock your world.
Very vibrant story and was true to the times. Thought provoking especially about "what you can do when" about change. It hit home being from the South.
I intentionally refused to read a single review/opinion of this book until I read the entire thing for myself. And I'm so glad I did! I LOVED this book - all of it's flaws and all of it's beauty. It was clearly her first novel, and I can see why the publisher pushed her to write from Scout's POV - the flashbacks are some of the best parts of the story. But even in all of the ugliness of the racism, there is truth. The political discussion in the novel is worth the read alone. It makes me laugh to hear of everyone's "disappointment" with Atticus. He's human - and fictional - get over it. Loved this book!!
This was a good read but no where as good as To Kill a Mocking Bird! It went forward in time and that seemed weird after reading to Kill a Mocking Bird first.
I give it the four stars because it is connected to To Kill A Mockingbird.  I could relive the smell and feel of the south which Harper Lee describes so well.
Great story. Almost as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. Wonder if she has any other finished work that hasn't been published. A fast read, couldn't put it down.
I like Harper's Capote like style. Carefully crafts her scenes to the person. This you must enjoy with her.<br/>As she tells of a time that is still with us.
I loved the book!  Harper Lee is an incredible writer.  Watchman has the same tone and style of Mockingbird, and flows nicely as the sequel 20 years later.  Watchman is deep.  The character Scout and the Southern living she describes is definitely a piece of American history.  The ending was unsavory to me and I was left thinking and chewing on the whole novel, very thought provoking.<br/><br/>If you are undecided about whether or not to read the book, consider this:  any novel that generates this much news, reviews, and controversy must be worth reading.  My suggestion is to read it and come up with your own opinion.
It's a first edition Harper Lee so of course I bought it but not worth reading.  After reading this you really understand why this was not published earlier.
Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  It's as though Harper Lee wrote part of it and someone else finished it.  Often lost track of the point it was making.
As a lover of To Kill a Mockingbird, I was pleasantly surprised at just how much I enjoyed this book. It's a bit rough, but nonetheless very good on its own.
I can see why "To Kill a Mockingbird" was published first.  Poor writing style.  Cannot even finish the book.  But everyone has personal preferences.
As I read this Nobel I kept.wondering  whom would be able to play the parts and have concluded there no more Gregory Pecks to continue portraying Aticus Finch.  I enjoyed this novel and agree with Miss Harper Lee's take on the fear and racial disparity as integration took hold in the changing South.  Her conclusions regarding  white fears, the NAACP, and the Klan are spot. on.<br/><br/>The novel will resonate more positively with Southerners than with liberals.  Certainly much dialogs between the races if all sides will approach the subject honestly and understand what the times were like in the setting.<br/><br/>I've spent the morning reading the many reviews on Amazon and am amazed at the vitriol of so many<br/>reviewers.  I wonder if they read the same novel I have just finished.  It is my understanding that GSAW was a first draft prior to TKAM; however, Miss Lee agreed to allow the "prequel" to be published without any editing by the pulisher.  The fact that it is/was a draft of the original doesn't change the fact that this is still a great book for me.  For those who can not separate the characters in their youth from the older characters in GSAW is a pity..for them.<br/><br/>You rock, Miss Lee!!!
I did enjoy it. Ilistened to the audio book and it kept my interest. I sympathized with Atticus. Found the last chapter very profound. Listened to it twice.
While the book is not the quality of To Kill a Mockingbird, it is well written, interesting (yet disturbing in places), and with Harper Lee's voice evident.
This is a spectacular insight into human relationships - parent, child; faith, reason; race, humanity. "Every man's watchman is his own conscience."
I doubt the book would have been published if it weren't by the author of "To Kill a Mockingbird" which I consider among the best books I have read.
Lee's novels are masterpieces. I got lost in Watchman just as I did in Mockingbird all those years ago. Both are touching! Both I will read again and again.
Rather disappointing & very unlike her other award winning novel
While it does depict the moral conflict of the time the characters were disappointing especially considering how beloved they were in To Kill a Mockingbird
I initially read it expecting a second dose of the first book and was taken aback and disappointed, same as the narrator, by the new dimension brought to Atticus. Once I finished the book, as a French person, I got to meet with a bright Philippine young woman, who asked me why is it that in Europe we all have such benefits as pension and health plans and that in other parts of the world they do not.  I struggled to find an answer that seemed to be fair at an individual level; I then realised what a masterpiece this book was  to articulate so well the shock when ideals are confronted to real life.
A very thought provoking story.  Rather saddening to see age creeping up on the heroes but makes me wish there were another story to continue the story.
Shows what is realistic follow up to Mockingbird. Great read overall and relatable. Especially if you've ever lived in the South and then a larger city.
Much better than the reactionary critics would have you believe, and also for less closely related to related to or predictive of To Kill a Mockingbird.
This is a very good read IF you remember WHEN it was written and read it in that context.<br/><br/>If you cannot be anything other than "Judgy" about the perspective, you won't get the great story of growing up, adoring your dad and then discovering your ideas are different - even if they aren't.  Scout had to grow up and she chose to get angry with Atticus without seeing what he actually believed was right.<br/><br/>The point being, as we depart from past ideologies, it can be painful, difficult and misconstrued.<br/><br/>Just be open minded to each and every discussion.
Loved this book.
A very good read
Did not like it.
Good, easy read.
Good, easy read.
Powerful ending!
Dissapointing...
Not a great book
So disappointed.
Great reading!!!
Good Book, but not as good as Her first one. A lot of changes from original book. I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys this type of reading.
I was surprised it was so good.  I was worried that it couldn't measure up to Mockingbird, but it did.  I was sorry when I finished it.  I wanted more.
Exceptional prose. Deep, dark, and formidable. Lee's command of the language and ability to spin yarn is for lack of a better word........ Tremendous!
You might have to read parts of this book more than once in order to understand Atticus's thinking on race and why he is a victim of his surroundings.
I anxiously awaited the release of this novel.  I was not impressed with it, but I think I was trying to compare it too much to To Kill a Mockingbird.
This book stands on its own and does not need to be compared to Mockingbird.  Much like people really are our values and mores change with the  times.
Sadly that is not the point of this book at all. This is Scout coming of age and becoming her own person. It is heartfelt and beautifully written. I especially love the dialogue between scout and her Uncle.  And as for Atticus? In my book he is a good man devoted to the law. Elderly now and a true product of his environment, with flaws that are revealed for the first time to both the reader and Scout. I love that her Uncle encouraged her to come back home because of her beliefs and ability to make things better. And I love the interesting fact about her Uncle and her mother.
I enjoyed reading Harper Lee's first novel that she wrote, but never published then, although it takes place with the same characters as in "To Kill A Mocking Bird" only later on in time.  However, it can't compare to her classic "Mocking Bird".  "Go Set a Watchman" is rather disappointing--what happens or is revealed about the characters later in life. If you read "Mocking Bird" you thought the best of these characters, never knowing their faults that are revealed later in life.  But I still recommend reading this good and well written novel.
This "book" isn't really a book but more of a rough draft.  Where is the story?  The character development?  The main characters, Jean Marie, Atticus, etc., bear very little resemblance to the characters in To Kill A Mockingbird.  I was left wondering if these were even the same people.  I can understand how the original publishers asked Harper Lee to rework her draft and focus on Scout's childhood adventures.  Those were the parts of this book that I enjoyed most.  The book just didn't make any sense to me.  It is truly not a sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird and shouldn't be marketed as one.
It took me a little bit to get into the book - about Chap 3. It is now very interesting and I highly recommend the continuing story of Atticus Finch.
Guess what?  Atticus was a man of his times.  Scout learns her father is not a saint.  Interesting analogy  of the 60s as a replay of reconstruction.
The perfect companion for To Kill A Mockingbird. Harper Lee has proven yet again that she is a brilliant and will go down as one of America's greats.
With the cryptic title, Lee does not disappoint in offering a follow-up (Yes, I know it was written before this) to her monumental novel.  Well done!
I am discouraged by those who try to judge this book by simply comparing it to Ms. Lee's classic.  As a stand alone book about life in a small southern town this effort should hold its own with any novel about that time period.  The author's insight into life in the south and to affects that the coming civil rights movement will have on that way of life, as expressed by its different characters, is amazing.  It makes me wish there was another book out there somewhere picking up another twenty years in the future because I believe Ms. Lee would have hit the nail squarely.
If you know nothing of TKAM (yes they exist) this book is just an okay read.  If you can just read this book for the enjoyment of reading (regardless of your personal views on life) with reference to TKAM, it's quite enjoyable. Kudos to the literary agent who suggested to Harper Lee to tell the backstory to these characters.  Never mind how this book made it to market today or how it was marketed, I think this book tells a great story about characters we already loved and teaches a valuable lesson about how things on the surface aren't always as they appear up close.....
I had heard the comments that this book portrayed Atticus as a racist, so I wanted to read it to come to my own conclusion.  I came to the conclusion that maybe we put Atticus on a pedestal after To Kill a Mockingbird.  Looking back now, he was more a man of the law when defending the innocent black man.  That's how I've rationalized it in my mind..  Remember, this is the South and in that time frame, it is probably an accurate portrayal.  Scout is the hero in this book..  I think it's a classic and I will read it again and again...  Thank God they found the manuscript.
Terrible book.  If Harper Lee had not written "To Kill a Mockingbird" this book would never have been a best seller.  A total waste of time!
This was a wonderful prequel to To Kill a Mocking Bird.Some facinating discussions on predjudice. It was an interesting book to discuss at Bookclub.
I was not expecting this theme and it took me a bit to get into the book.  I thought it was well written and I enjoyed it once I really got into it.
I re-read To Kill A Mockingbird before I took up Go Set A watchman.  I cannot say which I liked better. Many people have discussed the issue of racism and how it is portrayed in the book. I found the portrayal of the civil rights issues, voter right issues, etc. very interesting. I am constantly educated on these subjects by the very talented Southern writers like Ms. Lee.  These grown up characters are as wonderful as their young counterparts. I still found Atticus to be endearing as well as his doctor brother.  I would love to see yet another chapter in Scout's life.
Of course, I simply had to read it!  Even with low expectations going in, I was pretty disappointed.  Still some of  Harper Lee's great style and turns of phrases but honestly I feel if someone were not familiar with Mockingbird, there would not be a frame of reference for the whole storyline of this book. Why was she so outraged with Atticus' behavior?  Why was she so broken-hearted over Capernius' cold shoulder? After reading all the media buzz, I'm not sure if this was written pre- or post-Mockingbird but to me it makes no difference. I just didn't care much for it.

Meh.

Great read by a great writer. I have heard (even before the book was released) that the character Atticus Finch was portrayed as some sort of red neck racist, and I even heard a reporter claim that it's evident in the first chapter. WRONG!!  Anyone who lived in the South during the Civil Rights era would enjoy this book, and the only thing you'll learn about Atticus Finch in the first chapter is that he has developed rheumatoid arthritis and has trouble getting about. It's a wonderful southern story and if read with an open mind in very entertaining and educational.
I thought the book was well written, especially considering it was un-edited and written from the heart.  It brought to life the thoughts and fears of that time for both blacks and whites.  I'm from Alabama and was a child during the Civil Rights movement but I remember the fears of my parents, not because they were bigots or racists, the way they lived was all they knew and the way they were brought up.  It totally makes me sad for them. I have no feelings of fear regarding race, religion nor politics.  My philosophy is, as corny as it sounds, to live and let live.
I was rather disappointed; this book did not hold me the way "Mockingbird" did. I had hoped to be able to disagree with the critics but no.
I really enjoyed the novel.  Harper Lee writes well.  You do have to keep in mind the period of time she is writing about and enjoy the characters.
my sister described it as "preachy"-- It gave me insight into the way white folks were thinking back then.  We've definitely made progress.
Go Set A Watchman is a compelling book by itself.  As a follow-up to  To kill a mockingbird its outstanding as a book which takes the readers on a journey which is uncomfortable , and forces us all to face the bigot in all of us.  The book will make this politically correct world reexamine its own notions of right and wrong.  it certainly will open up a discussion of how one becomes a fallen hero.  Do yourself a favor , read to kill a mockingbird first otherwise you won't have the same emotional impact of the journey the main character experiences within the novel.
I had to read To Kill A Mockingbird after reading this to understand why people did not appreciate or enjoy Go Set A Watchman it as much as I did.
An adult Jean Louise goes home for a visit. She has a fight with her father. For the first time she sees Atticus through adult eyes. End of story.
Disliked the book. Do not recommend it.  Not as good as her first book. This was very disappointing.  Almost as though she did not have an editor.
I had to wait till the end to like the book - almost put it down.  The social commentary or description at the end is well worth the time spent!!
It's hard to be objective when reading a novel by Harper Lee. The writing is good in places but is predictable and it doesn't have enough tension
Go Set a Watchman is a great GREAT novel. I was not disappointed by the realistic portrayal of Atticus Finch and how the family's life is outlined.<br/>Many unanswered questions I had about the family in the book To Kill a Mockingbird were answered. Watchman is a perfect companion book. Read Mockingbird again then reread Watchman. I truly believe if Watchman had been published shortly after To Kill a Mockingbird, perhaps in 1965, the Civil Rights movement would have had more support, energy and empathy. Perhaps some of struggles may have ended earlier.
Definitely not what I expected.  To Kill A Mockingbird was the unusual better second novel!!  This was very slow and just hard to keep interest.
It is good; however, to kill mockingbird is definitely superior. The ending is not as tightly written as the rest, but it is still a great read.
Read (or reread) To Kill A Mockbird First.  Is more realistic whereas To Kill A Mockbird is more idealistic.  I enjoyed To Kill A Mockbird more.
Now this book.... I wanted to hate it. But I loved it. I just imagine it being set in alternate universe. So my image of Atticus is not ruined.
A waste of time
Very insightful
Disappointment!
Wonderful book.
It was a fizzer
Save your money
Extremely good picture of small town America in the South.
What a wonderful gift to readers to have this book unearthed after so long. Beautifully written and the involvement of the uncle, Dr. Finch, gave an added strength to the novel. It rather "hit home" with me as in the forties (!) I was a northerner enrolled in a southern college and have never forgot boarding a bus with the other whites while the blacks had to wait in line to board and then sit in back of the bus. Even then I was somehow uneasy having gone to high school with several black girls and felt an unfairness over this situation.
Rather shocking language for 2015 but not for the time period in which it was referring to. Story-line is as relevant today as it was in 1960.
Not at all what I expected it was heartbreaking, heart warming, and thought provoking, in turns. I will have to read it again. Very good book.
Very good book. Having read To Kill A Mockingbird many years ago I remembered more about it than I realized. Books like this are hard to find.
After I read the book, I was confused with all the negative posts as to people being disappointed. I found it to be very interesting and couldn't put it down. Upon finishing the book, I shared it with my 93 year old neighbor and also thoroughly enjoyed it. She read it twice so she didn't miss anything! She also told me to look at Isaiah 21-6, King James Bible, "For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth."<br/>I did not feel Atticus was a racist man. Saddens me to read some of the reviews.
Very entertaining…Haper Lee was before her time.  An accurate portrayal of the era in south Alabama. I’m proud to say she is a true Southern.
This is a wonderful book that gives an excellent depiction of the real causes for the resistance in the South to the civil rights activities during the sixties. The book has been unfairly criticized as anti racial by those who failed to understand what it as about. I am a yankee who happened to live in the rural south during the civil rights movement which I supported, but I also saw that the south felt that it once again was being overpowered by yankees who had no understanding of the history of that part of the United States.
Really enjoyed this.  It really brings you back to the time and then current again - - love the flashback technique<br/>Worth your time.
Remember this book was written before TKM... It is a first work but it has some interesting insight in to the American South of the time.
I truly enjoyed this book.  It is a treasure. The realization that it was written before Mockingbird, and yet<br/>brings the reader to a later place  in time and a change in attitudes of the characters. Well done.
Wonderful!  It's akin to a crispy, double crusted pie and a strong cup of black coffee.  I am once again mesmerized by the Finch family.
Well written, easy to read, with a simple message, good for teenagers.<br/>Lacks in profundity and emotional depth, but has atmosphere.
Scout has grown up and I still love her! What a great story, but so glad Mockingbird came first! This book is like coming home yourself.
maybe i have just heard too much on this subject lately
I had bought this book and then after reading what others were saying about it...put it on the shelf not having any desire to read it.  Thank goodness I got desperate one day for a  "read" and took it down.  It has been one of my favorite reads.  It is not about Gregory Peck and  To Kill A Mocking Bird .  read it and it will make you think about the good and " not so good times " of growing up in the south during this era.  It made me laugh, sometimes made me MAD but held my attention all the way thru!
Fans of Harper Lee's Best-selling To Kill A Mockingbird will fondly remember lawyer Atticus Finch and his young motherless daughter, Scout. This novel is narrated by twenty six year old Jean Louise (Scout) who has returned home for a visit. She is conflicted over feelings for Hank, an old friend and Atticus's protege, and pressure to move home for good. She finds her old Southern town too backward and gossipy, but when she learns something shocking about the two most important men in her life, it changes everything.
Wrong on so many levels. It should have been left in the vault. There were a couple of scenes that sounded very like Alice Sebold’s “The Almost Moon." Honestly, it reads like “To Kill a Mockingbird” fanfic.
A beautifully written book about the people we loved in To Kill a Mockingbird.  I adored Scout as a child and I respect and admire her as an adult.  Atticus is Atticus.  A wonderful read and thought provoking.
Writing was excellent. I see from the segments about her childhood why the publisher suggested she write a book from that perspective.
I was hesitant to read it as I didn't want to be disappointed after loving To Kill a Mockingbird but read it and loved it. Great read.
i loved this book even though a couple of characters disappointed me. It almost seemed more like the south I know than her first book.
Excellent. My Aunt , sister and I all enjoyed reading this book and talking about it. To Kill a Mockingbird is a book we love as well.
Go Set A Watchman was an excellent  read. Well written with surprises and more insight on the Fench family than To Kill A Mockingbird.
very controversial but I loved it.  It's a book of its time, so you have to keep that in mind.  Read it twice to better understand it.
Definitely written for a different time.  Some interesting historical facts. Otherwise it drags and was difficult to hold my interest.
Intriguing, keeps you wandering what the next chapter will bring. Also, sheds a strong light on the reality of the time, then and now.
Simply Wonderful!<br/>It's been a long time since I've enjoyed a book so much that I had to stop reading in the middle and switch to something else to make it last that much longer.  Her writing style is direct and easy. The story flows naturally and it's a wonderful journey.  I found myself fascinated by the characters, their growth, and the path their lives have taken.  It's an impressive tale and deserves all the accolades it's been receiving.<br/>I doubt I'll read another book this moving in a long while.
A stark look at how and why the South resisted change.
Excellent read
Disappointed!!
Disappointing.
Worth reading.

Fabulous book!
Disappointed!!
It is well-written, that distinctive style familiar to legions of To Kill A Mockingbird fans. If you are one of these fans, just don't do it. Don't read Watchman. I can see why it wasn't previously published. I kind of loathe everyone involved in the publishing of it now. Watchman broke my heart. Save Atticus the Heroic.
This storyline was unexpected. A fast read. Not the strongest ending but I'm glad I read To Kill a Mockingbird long before this book.
Loved this book...even after reading the poor reviews.  When reading it one must separate it, completely, from To Kill A Mockingbird.
Very enlightening.  I am half- way through and I anticipate an eye opening conclusion.  I plan to re-read To Kill a Mockingbird next.
Don not read it as a continuation of To Kill a Mockingbird. Look at this as something that couldn't have been published 50 years ago.
5 stars. Good read. This book in no way hurt my love for Atticus Finch. Stick with this book it's worth the read. I still love Harper Lee. I think in Go Set a Watchman she tries showing the bigger picture.
Very disappointing. Boring story. Not worth the read.
Not as good as To Kill a Mocking Bird; but enjoyable.
Reading it for the second time.....after To Kill a Mockingbird to fill in the gaps.  Loved the story line, social issues, and humor
This book is still relevant considering our continuing struggle with race relations in this country. Well written. Scout grows up.
Once you've read To Kill a Mockingbird and then begin this novel you think the world has turned on it's head. Read it to find out!
Kept me hooked from beginning to end. Beautifully written. I wish there were more books from this author. Hope you like it as much
I found it a bit disjointed. I think mainly because I was expecting so much from it since To Kill a Mocking Bird was so wonderful.
I love the way Miss Lee describes emotions and events. I understand her. I like and understand Scout and how she feels about life.
It is also ways difficult to understand our parents are more complicated and in the end more c cognizant of this world than we are. Like Jean Louise, ideals are are hard to give up. Like her I have been colorblind, making it difficult to understand and listen to hateful speeches and keep calm. I wish to be more like her father,but my mouth engages sometimes in impatience before I have understood the subtlety of what I have seen and heard. five stars and I will read it again soon.<br/>submit
I love a great southern tale. If you read it out of the context of "To Kill a Mockingbird" it is actually more realistic.
Of course it wasn't as good as To Kill A Mockingbird.  I still enjoyed it, especially the funny things that happened in the past.
I was not ready for the book to end.  I wanted it to go on and on.  I found it to be perfect to read after To Kill A Mockingbird.
Disappointing, but much better than the review I read.  Jumped around a lot  and sometimes hard to follow but glad I finished it.
Living in Alabama, I felt compelled to read this book.  I'm now going to go back and read "To Kill a Mockingbird" again!!
This is a book that that helps  many of us see that the people we put on pedestals are human. And only human.  True, it is about racism and and Scout's shock that her daddy had those feelings.  But, it tells a story of a woman who goes home and confronts her fears of where she really came from. And then, she hopefully will come to terms with it. I don't think it should have been such a shock to find that Atticus had racial leanings. Ladies and gents... that was the South. I loved the book!
If I had read Go Set A Watchman prior to reading To Kill A Mockingbird I probably would not have read the latter. I had trouble following the flashbacks and random thoughts that popped in and out of the storyline. At the very end of the book there was some redemptive qualities but still...maybe I'll read it again in a few months when the expectation of greatness has faded. At this point I think there were good reasons that this book was stored instead of published all those many years ago.
I have always wanted Ms. Lee to write another book.  I found the plot to be very candid about how it was like for both blacks and whites in the 1950's.  To be honest, the strife that she wrote about could have been written about today's civil rights problems.  I don't know if it matters but I am a white 57 year old woman that lives in Oklahoma.  I don't like to describe others nor myself by the color of my skin, however, it seemed appropriate to do so for this review.  Thank you Ms. Lee
What an incredibly tough act to follow.  Her childhood descriptions ended up being the best parts of the book--not surprisingly.
Enjoyed the read, a little slow starting, but really ended up enjoying!  Movie Maybe??  Would be interesting to say the least,,,
Loved the novel for the revelation of a dormant conscience, and the shocking discomfort of human discovery of unexpected truths.
I looked the book but not the ending. Sorta of left me hanging. Liked the sound of Harper's writing sounded like her first book.
GREAT writing.  This book addresses the issues of racism and Southern culture in a somewhat less "black and white" manner than To Kill A Mockingbird.  This story is more concerned with the gray areas of these issues and how people responded in that turbulent time.  In the focus of the 20/20 hindsight of the 21st century, the attitudes are particularly repugnant... but this book was written to reflect the reality of a time past.  And, of course,  the issues remain with us today.
The watchman pulls no punches. It relates to the mine-set of the times. I did not find it offensive, because I lived my childhood and teens years through the 50-60's and was accustomed to derogatory comments from family members and acquaintances about a "mixed" marriage in our family. The bigoted people only reinforced my beliefs to treat everyone with respect. No matter race, creed, or religious belief we should all agree to be more open-minded and learn by others differences.
i loved to kill a mocking bird  i taught it in high school  i was leery to read to set a watchman  i didn't know if i could accept a flawed atticus, but i didn't want to miss another novel written by harper lee  her characters remain colorful and full of heart  as the story moved forward, scout discovered there were cracks in the wall of integrity she had built around her father  i felt just as betrayed, as scout did  for all of us, there comes the time that we must separate from our parents and, by painful trial and error, we develop our own code of integrity  the book's moral message is good one, albeit painful and definitely thought- provoking  thank you, harper lee, for giving us the gift of your amazing talent  please find more manuscripts
Harper Lee gives us a glimpse of life in the Deep South during the time extending from the time transitioning the end of the Civil War and the early 1950's.  The South struggled as it reconciled itself the change from slavery to the Blacks' independence.  Scout's return from time in New York to her southern home in MacComb  brought  new meaning to her understanding of the changing Southern society.  Her relationship with her father,  Atticus' was greatly challenged by her experiences.
Although I have heard criticism of Atticus Finch's racism in this book, I disagree.  With the same wisdom that he displayed in "To Kill a Mockingbird," Atticus understands his small southern town and the time in the history of inter-racial relationships.  I am so glad this book got published!  No one tells a story better than Harper Lee, and the incident where the children performed a baptism shortly before the preacher appeared for dinner is a classic.  It is truly hilarious!
I liked the story and learned a few things from a different point of view. But it would have benefitted from some more editing.
Great book!  made me think, made me cry, made me smile, made me cheer. REALLY made me glad I read it - and I'll read it again..
I read the reviews before the book and was therefore apprehensive about what would happen to Atticus.  Atticus was not the focus of the book and he was right in step with the time he lived.  I grew in the south in the 1950s and none of his views were shocking to me.  Jean Louise is the main character and her coming of age story is excellent.  I absolutely loved the book!  The stories of small town life are so true and funny that I have rarely laughed so much when reading a book.
It is totally amazing to that something written such a long time ago could be so relevant today.  You just have to look at the news this past month with the heated discussions about the Confederate flag to see that much of what is brought out in this well written novel still exists today.  It is a shame that Harper Lee only wrote two novels.  She has so much incite into such a complex problem.  I only wish she had been a little less like Scout and stopped running from the south.
Spent 90% of the book wondering what the point was.  Definitely NOT To Kill A Mockingbird (which is one of my favorite books).
Beautifully written!  An easy quick read but I think it gives an interesting perspective on an older Atticus as well as Scout.
The book was not edited like To Kill a Mockingbird.  It read as though it were unfinished.  However, it was still a good read.
This book is a mere shadow of its predecessor and the writing is very poor.  There are flashes of the brilliance in "To Kill a Mockingbird" but it just doesn't come together very well.  Pretty obvious that what they found was a first draft and the attempt was made to work it into a novel.  Very disappointing and it will go in the donation pile.  Not another classic by any means, just greedy publishers and family members trying to make a dime.
Harper Lee'a writing, as always, is spectacular. Do not believe the critics. Atticus has never been a racist maybe a realist.
This book shows why Tay Hohoff was a genius. I don't know many editors who could have read this and found Mockingbird inside.
Disappointed.
Not loving it
Disappointing
Disappointed.
Disappointing
I think this book was well written but not worth reading. I think it undermined all the feelings I had for "To Kill a Mockingbird" and added nothing.<br/>I was totally disappointed.
I had a hard time getting into the book.  I actually put it aside for a month. For me the book is for the last few chapters.
I absolutely enjoyed and loved the novel,it has so many interesting facts to think about and ideas you feel like underlining
A fast read well written  -difficult to a ccept weaknesses in the characters after reading and loving TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD
Definitely not the sensation that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was but extremely well-written nonetheless. The voice and style haven't changed and the characters are those we have grown to know and love. Jean Louise Finch comes of age in this book; she sees a side of her father and of her town that she's never seen before. By the close of the book she has started to reconcile her new discoveries with her past. Overall, a very enjoyable read, heartily recommended.
An interesting surprise from Harper Lee. Very illuminating and gave a lot of background to "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Excellent book and so reminiscent of those times!
Loved it. Hard to put down because I was enjoying all the characters & story so much.  I like her writing style very much!
Too wordy.'  It seemed like the author had something to get off her mind that she couldn't quite get to in her first book.
Read To Kill A Mockingbird twice and saw the movie twice. This read like a sequel. I thoroughly enjoyed Scout's awakening.
I can understand why this was not published because of the racist issue, but it. was written well and kept to t he plot..
Good but obviously her first. Good coming of age story. Would be nice to have another with Scout as a middle aged person.
A wonderful literary historical work.  I found myself reliving my personal experience as a student in the South during the early 60's and applauding this author every step of the way for her masterful use of language and closeness to the emotional and mental airs we breathed at that time. A must read for any serious young student interested in understanding the South and the ongoing ethnic and racial challenges which we continue to live in the USA in 2015.
Go Set a Watchman<br/>Harper Lee<br/>Harper Collins<br/>July, 2015<br/>$27.99<br/><br/>by Thomas Crowe<br/><br/>HARPER LEE’S WATCHMAN HITS THE MARK<br/><br/> So, Scout (Jean Louise) comes back home to Maycomb—where “everyone is either kin or almost kin”-- at age twenty-six and after being “away” and living in New York City for several years. Sixteen years have gone by since we last heard from her in the pages of To Kill a Mockingbird and the Maycomb she comes home to isn’t the same Maycomb we know from the 1960 novel. Even so, Harper Lee’s “new” novel takes you back with whole chapters of flashbacks to those days in the 1950s when Scout was known as “Scout” and not Jean Louise. It is no wonder to this reader that Go Set a Watchman was supposedly actually written before Mockingbird, as the flashback sections are so reminiscent of Lee’s legendary book. While there is still some controversy as to when Watchman was actually written and/or edited and rewritten, it reads like the natural sequel to Lee’s Mockingbird in almost every way, as there are sections that could have easily been present in Mockingbird—chapters from Scout’s childhood memories as vivid as anything in Mockingbird.<br/>In this “pre-sequel,” what we have is an historo-sophical study of racism in the early NAACP days of the Alabama South. Much of this comes from Jean Louise’s uncle Jack in very interesting monologues citing the comparative history of 1800s England to that of the pre-Civil War South. “The South was a little England in its heritage and social structure,” Uncle Jack tells Jean Louise. “It was a nation with its own people, existing within a nation,” he goes on to qualify. And from here to the end of the book we get some great conversation on the subject between the two and between Jean Louise and Atticus, who in Jean Louise’s eyes has become something of a bigot, even a racist during the time that Jean Louise has been away. And the plot thickens as the book, by chapter seventeen, becomes a philosophical debate between her and her father Atticus and something of a podium for Harper Lee to question the caprice of her father’s hypocritical behavior and  the greater issues of  the vagaries of racism and equal rights. And here the dialogue is Alabama classic! Something right out of the 50s and early 60s. We get a real tactile sense of the time and place in a pre-integration and pre-Equal Rights South. And we also get a sense of Lee’s genius as a young fiction writer and storyteller. A very mature prose. Meticulous and skillful editing.<br/>So, what is the meaning of the book’s title? And what is a “watchman”? While it is originally a railroad reference to someone who keeps track of train schedules and puts out flags and lanterns to stop trains at the stations, in Go Set a Watchman  Harper Lee internalizes this term to reflect human consciousness and integrity. As Uncle Jack says to Jean Louise on page 265, “Every man’s watchman is his conscience.” In this sense Jack’s message to the grown up Scout is that life is a lesson in humility and that in the end life is really a question of balance. Nowhere is this more eloquently stated than in Uncle Jack’s soliloquy where he preaches “I need a watchman to lead me around and declare what he seeth every hour on the hour. I need a watchman to tell me this is what a man says but this is what he means, to draw a line down the middle and say here is this justice and there is that justice and make me understand the difference. I need a watchman to go forth and proclaim to them all that twenty-six years is too long to play a joke on anybody, no matter how funny it is.”<br/>While Jean Louise is ensconced in a private war with her father who she feels has betrayed her and his own personality, it is the Maycomb County Council—an all-white pro-Agrarian assembly-- that is the villain in this story. There’s no Boo Radley and no lynch mob, and not much action in Watchman, but what there is is lots of mental acuity and acumen—which I feel bodes well for the perpetualization of the deserved legendary reputation of Harper Lee. I’ve been to Monroeville, Alabama and I’ve spent time there talking to people who know Harper Lee and who call that place home. And I was among the sceptics—a “doubting Thomas if you will--with all the media preamble to the release of this book. But after reading Go Set a Watchman, Harper Lee has made a believer out of me. And, yes, by God, she’s done it again! Another classic?<br/><br/>Thomas Crowe is the author of  the award-winning memoir Zoro’s Field: My Life in the Appalachian Woods and the novel The Watcher: Like Sweet Bells Jangled. He writes reviews and editorials for this  paper and can be reached at newnativepress@hotmail.com
if I were going to rate this book based on its writing, I would give it 2 stars. It is incomplete, chapters end with no transition to the next, there are contradictions throughout, and there’s no real ending. Had this been written by anyone other than Harper Lee, it would have never been published as-is. But because To Kill A Mockingbird was, and still is, so successful, someone thought they could get away with publishing a very rough draft.<br/><br/>Having said that, if you read it for what it is – an initial draft of a story that eventually became To Kill A Mockingbird, it is a fascinating read. As a writer & editor, I couldn’t help but be fascinated by comparing the two drafts. The characters have the same names, but they really aren’t the same characters we find in our beloved To Kill A Mockingbird. Lee started in such a different place in Go Set a Watchman than she ended up in To Kill A Mockingbird. It is such a beautiful example of how an artist’s masterpiece goes through so many different changes before it becomes the final product worth showing to the world. It challenged me as a writer, and as an artist.<br/><br/>It also challenged me as an individual, and I believe the story has incredible potential to spark conversation in a very different way than To Kill A Mockingbird. I’m afraid because the characters are the same, the story lines will be intertwined and people will be upset, simply because the characters aren’t who we think they should be. Early commentary has already shown this to be the case.<br/><br/>I REALLY wish they had done some editing to it – changed the names of the characters, disconnected it from To Kill A Mockingbird, and did the hard work of finishing it into an entirely different book … Because the political, and emotional, issues that arise are SO worth talking about. Especially today, when we find ourselves once again talking about the confederate flag and race relations in all of the U.S., but particularly in the south.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it’s worth a read … but please … go into it knowing it’s a different story, with different characters, that have the same names.
I am not a great fan of fiction. I read and enjoy mostly nonfiction. But I was fascinated with all the publicity associated with this book, and having<br/>seen the movie, To Kill a Mocking Bird more than once, I was eager to read this book and to find out more about the original versions of Harper Lee's famous characters, Scout, Atticus, Calpurina and others. Although I tried to approach this book as a separate  book--not connected to Harper Lee's masterpiece--it was hard to completely set aside my previous acquaintance with the central characters and Maycomb county, Alabama. As I read Go Set a Watchman,  however, I found it independently interesting and absorbing. The book is well written , and I enjoyed th author's style of switching between conversations and individual thoughts behind what was exchanged in the conversations.<br/><br/>The more I read the book the less I appreciated the strong criticism by some  reviewers. This book is very interesting and enjoyable and in some places, especially towards the end, I found it hard to put it down.  No this is not a masterpiece, but a very good book that is powerful in its content and expression. It artfully presents a strong clash of ideas of Scout and the people in Maycom county that she deelpy adored and loved. In particular, I found the conversations towards the end between Scout and her uncle, Dr. Jack Finch and Attica, her father especially electric and thought provoking. They are in a sense a high point in the story of the return of Scout to her home and the shocking discoveries she made during this visit.<br/><br/>Overall , this book made great reading and left a significant impression on me. I finished this in less time than most other books I have read this past year. I would recommend it strongly.
Warning: This review comes with a disclaimer. And not the one you would expect. There has been so much media attention and controversy surrounding the publication of GO SET A WATCHMAN, and whether or not Harper Lee truly wanted it published or if she had been manipulated into doing so by her representatives. The state of Alabama was even called in to investigate charges of elder abuse. (The state determined that Lee was of sound mind when she “was able to answer questions about the book to investigators' satisfaction.”) No one was more cynical about the circumstances than me. A lifelong fan, I had accompanied my friend, writer Shannon McKenna Schmidt, to the author’s hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 2007 to research a book that she was co-authoring on literary travel (NOVEL DESTINATIONS with Joni Rendon). And almost immediately we were put through our paces by Lee’s sister, Miss Alice Lee, an attorney and her representative. Shannon had to explain why we were in town, what kind of book she was researching and how it related to Lee. Her privacy and literary legacy were that guarded.<br/><br/>So when it was announced that this notoriously low-profile author who had repeatedly said she wouldn’t publish a second book was going to do just that, I was instantly wary and disbelieving. The historic publication of WATCHMAN has made headlines worldwide. And the anticipated backlash has only just begun. It’s hard to follow a first novel like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, a classic that has been on school curriculums for decades and has been adapted into a timeless film with the legendary Gregory Peck becoming the visual archetype of a man who stands up for justice no matter what the cost.<br/><br/>Did Lee intend for this to be published in her lifetime, or is she being controlled by a puppet-master attorney calling all the shots? To get swept up in the scandal of it all would be a reader’s first mistake. The second would be to approach this novel as anything other than what it is --- a first version of what later would become the classic story of right and wrong in the American South. This isn’t TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD II. This is what Lee wrote in the mid-to-late 1950s; she handed in to her editor, and it was mutually decided to put this version aside in order to focus more on the character of Scout as a young child, through the prism of a young child’s idealized version of her father. To fall prey to those mistakes would rob the reader of what could potentially be a fascinating and enlightening look into the writing process of an author trying to wrangle many topical issues of her day (amazingly, many of which resonate so strongly today).<br/><br/>So, having said that, I would recommend to readers, most of whom I’m sure are fans of Lee’s, that if you want to enjoy WATCHMAN, remember to approach it realistically --- as an early version that was reworked and reconfigured many times, one that contains glimpses and glimmers of the classic story that it would eventually become after much careful sculpting by the author and her gifted editor, Tay Hohoff. If one approaches it almost like a scholar, not expecting a prequel to MOCKINGBIRD but rather appreciating the peek inside the process, then the reading experience will be a much more rewarding one.<br/><br/>Unlike the scrawny tomboy of MOCKINGBIRD, WATCHMAN is narrated by 26-year-old Jean Louise Finch, still “Scout” to most of her family and friends in Maycomb, Alabama, who is returning to the South of the mid-1950s from New York City, where she currently lives, to visit her aging father, Atticus. As with most twenty-somethings visiting their small hometowns, one observes things with a slightly jaundiced eye. Due to his arthritis, getting around is tougher for Atticus these days. Instead of meeting Jean Louise at the station, he sends Hank, his employee at the law firm, makeshift/honorary son, and Jean Louise’s sometime boyfriend. This trip seems to serve a dual purpose for her. Of course, she wants to see her father, but it’s almost as if the adult Scout is testing the waters, almost in a Jane Austen-like fashion, to see if she could (or should) return here for good; to accept a life where she would marry Hank, have children, take care of her father, and join the ranks of the good Christian citizens of Maycomb. But we see that Jean Louise still maintains all the spark and stubbornness of young Scout as she immediately bristles and rails against this picture. Responding to Hank’s frequent proposals of marriage, she admits her fear of the outcome: “It’s just that I’m so afraid of making a mess of being married to the wrong man --- the wrong kind for me, I mean. I’m no different from any other woman, and the wrong man would turn me into a screamin’ shrew in record time.”<br/><br/>One thing that seems to remain unwavering to the adult Scout is her idealized version of her father: “Atticus Finch’s secret of living was so simple it was deeply complex: where most men had codes and tried to live up to them, Atticus lived his to the letter with no fuss, no fanfare, and no soul-searching. His private character was his public character. His code was simple New Testament ethic, its rewards were the respect and devotion of all who knew him. Even his enemies loved him, because Atticus never acknowledged they were his enemies. He was never a rich man, but he was the richest man his children ever knew.” Which may explain her fear of committing to one man --- so few of them were like Atticus.<br/><br/>But then she catches Atticus and Hank in attendance at a Citizens’ Council meeting from her perch in the balcony of the courthouse (in a scene that slightly mirrors the classic court scene from MOCKINGBIRD), and overhears the crowd listening to the racist bluster of the speaker who denounces a government that is attempting to “mongrelize” his South by integrating whites with the black population. Aghast that her father is silently listening to this bigotry, she reflects back on a case he handled when she was young, where he defended a young black boy who had been accused of raping a white girl. He won an acquittal for the boy (a very different outcome than the Tom Robinson case that was at the heart of MOCKINGBIRD). So how could he stand there and listen to this drivel?. The weight of what she has just witnessed makes her sick to her stomach: “The one human being she had ever fully and whole-heartedly trusted had failed her; the only man she had ever known to whom she could point and say with expert knowledge, ‘He is a gentleman, in his heart, he is a gentleman,’ had betrayed her, publicly, grossly, and shamelessly.”<br/><br/>The reader, too, has a visceral reaction to seeing his or her hero succumb to the racism of his peers. But when Jean Louise confronts Atticus about his attendance, and subsequent silence, in the face of what she perceives as hate-speech, he responds much like any man of his age and era. (Of course, this misconstrued nugget of info is what every review or article is latching on to: “Atticus is racist!”) It’s the ageless trope of entering adulthood by finally seeing your parents for who they are --- people with faults. Her Uncle Jack lectures her that this realization was bound to happen: “…now you, Miss, born with your own conscience, somewhere along the line fastened it like a barnacle onto your father’s. As you grew up…you confused your father with God. You never saw him as a man with a man’s heart, and a man’s failings --- I’ll grant you it may have been hard to see, he makes so few mistakes, but he makes ’em like all of us.” One also thinks that perhaps in this early draft of the story, Atticus is a more realistic version of the author’s father, A.C. Lee, and the Atticus in MOCKINGBIRD is the romanticized one. Many of the arguments between the adult Scout and Atticus uncannily mirror issues being discussed today (especially the discussion of states’ rights versus federalism), and the scene of Aunt Alexandra’s coffee gathering exhibits a comic observation worthy of Bridget Jones.<br/><br/>So, if the reader approaches WATCHMAN with the proviso that this is a first version of a classic story, the early outline of what was to be, it can be enjoyed on this level --- as an example of how the writing process can be long and laborious and mutable. No one judges the film The Godfather on the basis of Francis Ford Coppola’s storyboarded notes. The same thought process applies here. This is MOCKINGBIRD in its earliest stages, not the classic we’ve come to know and revere. I can see book groups now, going into overtime discussing the issues and differences between this and the 1960 version. No matter the reasons behind its publication, WATCHMAN can and should be appreciated for exactly what it is.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Bronwyn Miller
I was thrilled when I learned Harper Lee would be publishing a second book, and a sequel to her first at that. She had always maintained that she would not publish a second book for how could she top the first? After all, To Kill a Mockingbird has been a raging success....selling tens of millions of copies, being published in over 40 languages, and being the most widely used novel in schools around the world. I've read TKAM more times than I can count, studied it, and taught it to 9th graders 13 of my 15 years as a teacher. All this time I had accepted that one of my favorite books would always be a stand alone. But here we are with a sequel!<br/><br/>I was teetering on 3 or 4 stars and ultimately chose 4. Of course Go Set a Watchman is not nearly as good as its predecessor, but a somewhat fun read nonetheless. Most fans of Harper Lee and TKAM should at least find it enjoyable. TKAM has more meat to it, not to mention so many levels, and every chapter seems to serve a purpose. This one lacks that depth yet carries its own wisdom and profundity. It actually almost seemed like it could serve as an epilogue (albeit on steroids) for TKAM because rather than have a serious plot of its own it centers on Scout's becoming an adult, making sense of the world around her, and figuring out who she is and what she believes in. Having moved to NYC, she comes back to Maycomb to visit. We see some of the same crew, the ever awesome and insightful Atticus as well as the uptight and judgmental Aunt Alexandra (along with several others). We even meet a few new characters, one of whom serves as Jean Louise's love interest.<br/><br/>It's interesting that this book was published now, with race relations as volatile as they are. I have no doubt some will find Go Set a Watchman racist and bigoted, completely ignoring the sentiments that existed in the deep south so long ago. This book is not kind to the NAACP, pointing out the unintended consequences of well-intentioned but faulty agendas. I personally applaud Ms Lee for highlighting some of the harsh realities backwards thinking/legislation brings. If one is not careful s/he will also mischaracterize Atticus after reading GSAW, finding him considerably flawed (and a racist!) Not at all. He understands history, law, society, and people.<br/><br/>One of the reasons for liking this book as much as I did is for the characters. I love Scout (though I wanted to throttle her a few times in this book), and Attitus is and always has been my literary hero. He's the same intelligent, dry, insightful gentleman he always was. Henry is quite likeable. And Aunt Alexandra is tolerable in this one (couldn't stand her in the first). Lee includes more funny stories that have you laughing out loud.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the novel's strengths is Scout coming to grips with not sharing the same point of view as her father on a number of issues. He has always been a sort of hero for her, not exactly an uncommon thing for little girls. Always concurring with his standards, Scout now finds herself deviating from Atticus's moral compass. Scout must come to terms with his imperfections and in the end realize that he is still her father. But does that make Atticus wrong? Is Scout right? Who's to say which point of view is correct? The book subtly points out that Scout lives in NYC, where many may think they are enlightened and forward thinking, but it is not exactly a bastion for logic and reason. They live in a bubble.<br/><br/>Another brilliant maneuver made in both novels is what I like to call the profound Atticus moments. TKAM's occurs with the court scene, where Atticus tenaciously defends Tom Robinson. He effectively points out the genius of The Constitution and our Founders but the faults of man and society. He has many poignant moments, especially when he makes his closing statements. In GSAW, he and Scout get into a heated argument as they discuss some of the civil rights issues of the day and how they will effect the South. Atticus again brings up the wisdom of the Constitution and The Founders and declares himself a "Jeffersonian Democrat". Anyone who knows their history will understand that Jefferson was a small-government type....vastly different from today's Democratic Party. Atticus touches upon the privilege of being a citizen, the importance of small government, and understanding our Founding Fathers.  Again, I applaud Ms Lee for making such bold statements as we live in a time where government is so bloated and out of control, and our Constitution is being trampled/shredded from coast to coast. (It may be interesting to note that this book was actually written before TKAM, which in a way makes it all the more significant.)<br/><br/>I did find a few flaws/inconsistencies with this book. For example, this book claims that Francis is Alexandra's son whereas in TKAM he is her grandson. Even though he's roughly the same age as Scout, Atticus married much later than his sister, thus starting his family quite late in life. Of course, these insignificant details hardly derail from the overall theme and/or content of the novel.<br/><br/>TKAM is definitely more thought-provoking and deep. But I don't think we can discount GSAW simply because it might not hold a candle to its prequel. It has its own strengths as well as significant truths that have relevance just as much today as they did 50 years ago.
Before ordering GO SET A WATCHMAN, I reread TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Had I not reread TKAM and refreshed my memory on the characterizations Harper Lee was so skilled at writing, my rating would have been higher. I found it impossible not to compare the two books.  GO SET A WATCHMAN contained pages of meaningless, shallow dialog and page after page of dumping historical information on the reader—information that seemed pointless. If you’re a reader looking for a book club read, this is not for you. Rather than lead readers into figuring out what makes Atticus Finch tick, Harper Lee literally beats them over the head, trying desperately to explain away the new Atticus.  In the last few chapters of this book, much of the conversation between Scout (now called Jean Louise) and her uncle reads like a Psychology 101 manual.<br/>The characters in GSAW, for the most part, didn’t match up to those in the first book. The African American woman the Finch family hired to cook, (Cal) moved out immediately after Jem’s death (Atticus’s only son). It was illogical that the woman who stayed with this family for two decades, raising Atticus’s two children, would abandon this family as such a difficult time.  The seemingly new and improved New Atticus bore little resemblance to the previous one. He never spoke of his only son’s death, something I found disconcerting. As someone close to Atticus’s  age, I’m noticing a trend. As we grow older, the values we hold dear become MORE pronounced with age. In reality, the old Atticus would have continued fighting for equality, just as he always had and, if anything, his views would have been even more progressive than they were in TKAM.<br/>I was raised in the 1950’s and 60’s, and I don’t recall such a fierce hatred toward our government as was exhibited in Harper’s last novel. This was apparently what drove Atticus Finch and other townspeople to dislike blacks and try to limit their opportunities (according to GSAW). To me, this struck me as odd, and I found myself wondering why Harper never eluded to that in TKAM. It felt like the modern day concept of anti-government was being stuffed down our throats rather than reflecting those times with authenticity. This is a novel filled with lovely descriptions, but beyond that, it was disappointing.
Regardless of the controversy surrounding the details of publication, I enjoyed spending more time with Scout (I know she goes by Jean Louise in this novel, but she’ll always be Scout to me), Atticus, Uncle Jack, and even, surprisingly, Aunt Alexandra.  Jem is missed, obviously, but he still is mentioned in the novel and you’ll want to read the book to see how, especially the second last paragraph.  Some other teasers: you’ll see more of the childhood antics of Scout, Jem, and Dill; Scout will reveal some things about the Tom Robinson trial that are different than in To Kill a Mockingbird; Uncle Jack reveals to Scout how he felt about her mother; Scout breaks through the impenetrable façade of Aunt Alexandra and makes her cry.<br/><br/>For all the controversy surrounding the impact this book might have on Atticus’ legacy, Harper Lee has Scout shed the childhood lens (present in To Kill a Mockingbird) through which she always viewed her father and has her actually see him for who he really is, which is flawed, and more human.  The man is not a god.  He is caught in a transitional period in time, which he and Uncle Jack acknowledge; they’re smart enough to know the seismic shift that is happening in America, and in particular, the American South.  That is amazing considering Harper Lee was writing right in the thick of all this change; this is not a woman writing from a comfortable distance and seeing the past through the filter of present opinion.  She knew it then; she saw what it was all doing to the psyche of the Southern Man, and Atticus could not let go of a traditionalist view that really, when one gets down to it, is not in support of the KKK, is not in support of segregation, but is at its core a selfish wish to slow the progress of the Civil Rights Movement; he was a man afraid of too much change too fast.<br/><br/>It is this rapid change in the South that unnerves Scout when she comes home to Maycomb at the beginning of this book, but her perception of that change does not see race as a factor; her focus is on new buildings, changing neighborhoods, social structures in flux; she acknowledges she is color blind, so she sees the changes, but, unlike others in the South at the time, she does not attribute it to the changing landscape of race relations; she can’t put her finger on it, and it just stews inside her as a general unease that does not sit well with her until her discussion with Uncle Jack, who in his words, points out that for Scout, race is “incidental to the issue.”  You need to read this book to find out exactly what he means by that and how Harper Lee pulls this all together because, at its heart, this is a novel of ideas, as readers get the opportunity to listen in on Scout verbally and intellectually spar with Uncle Jack and Atticus, which is a real treat, and is worth your time and attention.<br/><br/>If you are thinking of avoiding this book because you are afraid your polished marble bust of Atticus might fall off your literary pedestal, you will have to come to terms with, as Scout does in the book, the fact that Atticus is human.  He is not perfect; he knows he is not; and he is actually happy that Scout shakes off her unrealistic perception of him, and, in the process, can begin to grow into her own conscience.  What is ironic is that the readers who are apprehensive to read this novel are the ones who need to read it the most.  Harper Lee allows Scout to mature, to see the subtleties and complexities of Atticus the man, which is the opportunity she is also extending to readers.  Take it.<br/><br/>Read the book.<br/><br/>If you don't, and you choose to add an uninformed, negative review on this site, then you are a bigot in the eyes of Uncle Jack, who has some meaningful words on that subject: "What does a bigot do when he meets someone who challenges his opinions?  He doesn't give.  He stays rigid.  Doesn't even try to listen, just lashes out."  Be flexible.  Give a little.  Listen.  Just make sure you keep your eyes open so you don’t bump your head.
It was an OK read.  Certainly not of the quality of To Kill a Mockingbird.  I enjoyed the story but was hoping for more.
Good ideas, good insight into another time and different culture, but written in too simplistic style...unsophisticated.
They should have left this draft on the shelf. The whole message spun out into a rather dull book.  Sorry did not enjoy.
I liked it. It is not Mockingbird, but has worthwhile observations about the relationships between parents and children.
Great read. Thought provoking. Flows like a river. As always North VS. South is always a matter of perception. Splendid.
Little disappointed with the explanation at the end. To me it doesn't really jive with 1st book.  I did enjoy it though.
Good read about southern life and social classes! Race becomes an issue when you attempt to to break long held customs.
I am afraid I purchased this book three times and every time pages were missing.  What I did get to read was excellent.
It was good, but not as much fun as To Kill A Mockingbird. The best parts of the book were her flashbacks to childhood.
Even though I had heard negative reviews about this book, I did read 'To Kill A Mockingbird' years ago and loved it.  I found it necessary to read this book for myself.  I have to admit that it brought out many emotions in me, and even though I am against racism, I found that the end of the book brought it all together for me.  Worth the read.  For those who love Harper Lee's first book, this is a must read to get to the heart of a difficult matter.
This book is short, certainly much shorter than TKAM, but I enjoyed it quite a lot. It shows us that even our favorite characters grow up or turn out to be human, after all. I especially appreciated the many shades of grey it showed within the civil rights movement.<br/><br/>It's not TKAM, nor is it meant to be--but like TKAM, it made me contemplate and consider real life events happening even today, and not many books make me do that these days.
Very interesting take on the complexities of this author's mind.  Very different in many ways to "To Kill...."
I'm assuming this is as good as her book "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Haven't read it as it is a Christmas gift.
Well. Written. And. Very. Insightful.  It's. About. Race. As well as. Growing. Up. And. Becoming. Your. Own.  Person.
It gave a good perspective of what the transitioning south was like in the 50's. It was an easy read, but insightful.
Very poorly constructed. The edges of each page are very uneven. It looks like it came from a book of the month club.
disappointed as a whole.  Had trouble becoming interested in it.. until about half thru the book.  It picked up then.
I did not anticipate this being as good a novel as To Kill  a Mockingbird, and I was right. It is clearly a novice journalist's first attempt, full of long, boring didactic paragraphs, "spoken" by somewhat poorly developed characters. It was interesting to see the difference between the two novels, and good to realize a novelist can learn how to be better. It was never a "can't put it down" book but worth reading to understand the process.
I pre-ordered this Hardcover – Deckle Edged 1st Ed book back in early Feb, for a very dear literary lady-friend who lives in Canada, as a belated BD present for her. It was shipped on July 13th, and arrived on her doorstep on the 14th, the day of its official release, so Amazon once again came through.  Of course the Lady will be the true judge of its content after 'her' read, but imao, the writing is as great as it was in "To Kill A Mockingbird", so I have no doubts on her satisfaction as well.<br/><br/>I've read the 'comments' of others here, some hateful, some brilliant, all I can say, is it's also a very honest portrayal of issues that are still front-and-center in American Life and Politics today. Look at what is happening now: in one instant -- after one deranged young man killed nine black people in a historic Southern Church, and who ostensibly photo-shopped a picture of himself with a Confederate flag -- the entire political and media establishments in the country have gone on an all-out crusade to remove all semblances of the Confederacy, along with the Heritage of the South. So don't let your prejudices, 'n hate confine you.. remember, the Watchman was set in 1954, just after the Supreme Court ruled that "separate but equal" cannot stand, and no longer would States be able to avoid racial integration by setting up separate schools for Negroes. So parts of it are very hard to read, especially coming from the mouth of our Mockingbird's beloved Atticus Finch.
This was an excellent book. However, if you think you're reading the same characters as To Kill A Mockingbird you will probably be disappointed. This a different book with different themes and some of the same themes but different conflicts. It is a different book. I believe that the Mockingbird will always be a classic American tale. I believe that Watchman is an excellent story that still addresses difficult topics in a meaningful way.
Excellent read! Glad I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" first--it helped explain the characters and the setting.
A good first novel, but somehow I expected more.  Maybe that is what To Kill a Mockingbird was - the "more."
I like the shoe but it runs a little wide and slips when I walk.  I will have to wear an insole for it to fit better
A most interesting sequel to Harper Lee's memorable book, To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a "must read" book!
Since I have taught, To Kill A Mickingbird, for years and highlighted the literary devices Lee used throughout the novel, I see few of these devices in this novel.  Just based on the writing style, narrative vs conversation, I question whether Lee wrote this book.  It "drags" for the first few chapters.  I think it would make a good master's thesis where the two novels are compared for writing style and use of literary devices.
Very boring.
A good read.
Excellent!!!
Very timely.
Good reading
Great READ!!
Great book. Had re-read To Kill A Mockingbird & then this one. Has lots that take you back to when they were young.
I loved that this author wrote another book after "To Kill a Mockingbird". But not as great as first novel.
this book was fair reading. It was a bit verbose for my liking.  The story line was good but was lacking something.
It was a good read, but there were a few spots it seemed as though something was missing. As if it was over-edited.
Setting aside the question of whether Ms. Lee intended this book to be published or not (and that's tough to do), "Go Set a Watchman" is a big disappointment. The author prods and examines the issue of racism in the deep South in a very thoughtful way, even if she doesn't really cover any new ground. But as a novel the book fails to providing any compelling sense of conflict between those on opposing sides. There's simply not enough action, and I can't help wondering if it's because Mr. Lee never finished it. A young lady is exposed to the human frailties of her Dad, which is compelling, but not enough to make this book a worthy sequel.
Although written prior to her most successful novel (To Catch a Mockingbird), the author has provided a very interesting description of the racial climate in the South subsequent to the events of an American literary classic. It is a little surprising to read that the characters were so different in their later life than depicted in their younger years. I found it to be a quick read of a most interesting time in American history.
This is an opportunistic attempt to cash in on the author's reputation, which has thereby been greatly diminished.
Enjoyed this book very much!  Well written. Scouts personality in her adult life lives up to her unique character.
saw atticus as an excellent lawyer but also an antiquated man who was a  mirror of his time...but better than most
Very happy to have received this book, excellent condition and exactly on time.  Lovely book by an amazing writer.
This book has received a lot of negative feedback recently. Although it has s different feel than her original novel, it's still phenomenally written. I feel like the negativity comments are unfairly just. Artistic does show a different view point than the first book, however his reasoning behind those comments are explained at the end of the book. If you enjoyed the first novel, you'll enjoy this one. Definitely worth the read.
After so many years of holding her first novel in highest esteem, I'm not sure what I expected of this sequel. How do you follow a once -in-a-lifetime master piece? I can only say that to know what became of that little girl, her family (including the iconic Atticus Finch) was a privilege and a joy.Yes we had to deal with the reality of their human frailties but they were made even more endearing for the experience of it. Although we are not likely to see her end I think we have been given enough information to use our imagination and see into the future.Thank you Harper Lee for taking us back to that sleepy little town of our childhood and letting us once again become a part of the lives of these precious old friends. I am content but sad to leave them.
Wow, hard to keep up with her dialogue sometimes but brilliantly written.  Lee is a true writer and story teller!
A superb follow up to To Kill a Mockingbird.
The literary quality doesn't compare to To Kill aMockingbird. Character development is a consistent strength, whether we do or do not approve of how those characters changed from the earlier released novel.  It reads like a first novel that would have benefited from additional editing/rewriting. Having said that, I felt the overall impact of the story was quite powerful.  You must read to the end to get that message.
It's the sequel that was written first.  Not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird" but well worth reading.
Harper Lee has brought Scout and Atticus into modern times with the help of Dr. Jack Finch. Well worth reading.
The story of a young woman growing up half of a century ago, and learning about the many sides of human nature.
This book was not what I was expecting. History now proves what the author was conveying. Well done Harper Lee.
Loved "mockingbird", had to force my self to finish this too long, rambling piece. Did not enjoy at a;;
I enjoyed revisiting old favorite characters. Some still had some growing to do and I enjoyed seeing them do it
I had heard the media talking about the disappointment some felt regarding the portrayal of Atticus as a racist.  The takeaway for me was that Scout came to the realization that her father was human, not the God on a pedestal that she had created in her mind.  As in "Mockingbird", Scout goes through a coming of age, and realized that although they use different methods, she and Atticus, are allies in the same fight.
With all the one-dimensional clamor, one would think Atticus Finch had become Darth Vader, but what strikes me from *Go Set a Watchman* so far is the love and esteem Scout and Lee continue to hold for Atticus. He has never been perfect (he knew Bob Ewell abused his daughter and did nothing; he did not want to take the Tom Robinson case; and who said "All men are not created equal"?), and the whole point of this book is that one may continue to love someone despite his imperfections. Each person has more than one dimension. I know that doesn't fit popular wish, but human beings are complex, believe it or not.<br/><br/>Harper Lee wrote an anti-racism novel, then she wrote an even better anti-racism novel.  This being the Planet Earth, people are complaining about this, some of them not even understanding this novel came first.  These are probably the same people who begrudged *The Hobbit* being broken down into three movies.  Really, with all the garbage out there, you begrudge *more* of something actually good?<br/><br/>Here's the deal: this novel is like a trial run.  The editor suggested going back to Scout's childhood (the best editorial suggestion in American literary history), Harper did, and this book was set aside.  But that does not mean it is without merit.  Most interesting, of course, is that Lee saw the dramatic potential in the Tom Robinson episode and heightened it to a whole new level.  *To Kill a Mockingbird* is about childhood, interpersonal adult conflict, and systemic racism, a genius work on three levels affecting each other.  *Go Set a Watchman* is a simpler story, but it functions as an excellent trial run for the more advanced TKaM.<br/><br/>The Baptist Revival and the Curse memories are so wonderful it is no wonder the editor suggested a child-centered story.<br/><br/>Read GSaW because it's great.  If you must "compare" GSaW to TKaM, do so for its insights into the creative process.  At all times remember that the best writers challenge us.  Lee is now up there with Mark Twain.  Thank you, Ms. Lee.
Not worth reading
This is worth the read, but I recommend you read To Kill a Mockingbird before to reaquant yourselves with the characters.<br/><br/>As an English Teacher,  I have grown to love these characters. It is refreshing to see these characters with depth and complexities. Atticus is not perfect. There is some prejudice in us all and it is wonderful to see this through the interaction between Jeane Louise and Uncle Jack.
I really liked this book, in spite of the media's PC worries about Atticus' perceived fall from grace. I thought it was true to the time and culture of the time. If one read through to the end (and I don't think some of the reviewers did), Atticus remained true to his character all the way from "To Kill ..." through this novel. Very readable. Just don't jump to conclusions before the very end of the book.
"Go Set A Watchman" may not win a Pulitzer for Miss Lee and I'm sure she couldn't care less. But this reader, for one, found it as richly honest, as moving and as "Southern" as its predecessor.  The Finch family stands as proudly as before and Atticus  remains as wise a father as anyone could hope to have.  "........Watchman" deserves to become a classic and to be required reading in every high school in America.
It was interesting to learn what happened to the characters. Not as good as the first one, but worth the read.
I loved to Kill a Mockingbird.  This book was like a continuance of the first one in some ways.  I enjoyed it.
It was ok. A little harder to get into after so many years but I love her way of writing and enjoyed the book.
Easy read.  Felt the characters were beliveable and as close to their original personalities since growing up.
Enjoyed the bookbut cosider To kill a mocking bird a better read. And the better novel of Harper Lee,s books .
A fitting sequel to her first classic.  Hard hitting, made me question what I thought I believed.  Great book!
A great sequel to mockingbird, wonderfully written, thought and discussion provoking, therefore a work of art.
To Kill A Mockingbird was the very first novel I read in high school many moons ago but has always been one of my favorites.  So, when it was announced that another book by Harper Lee was being released I had to get my hands on it.  It took me back to a time gone by and put some twists and turns on character development that I did not expect.  All in all it was over way too soon.  It ended with me wanting more.
Total cash grab by all involved.  Not good.
Worth reading. It was better than expected.
Nah
Meh
B-)
The book has made me laugh out loud several times.  Great depiction of small town southern life in that time.
I've heard negative reviews about this book, but I found it intriguing.  Well written and kept me interested.
I pre-ordered this book when it was first announced.  The book was delivered on time and is a wonderful read.
Contrary to someof the reviews,  liked the greater exploration of Atticus and Scout.  I couldn't put it down!
Okay, so I feel compelled to share some thoughts now that I have finished Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>One, Watchman is not a sequel to Mockingbird. This was a book initially rejected by publishers. There are some flashbacks to Jean Louise's childhood that are fantastic, and Harper Lee was told to focus her novel on the childhood stuff. That was the genesis of To Kill a Mockingbird. After Mockingbird was written, Watchman was filed away, never meant to be published.<br/><br/>Two, because Watchman is not a true sequel, there are some inconsistencies. SPOILER ALERT. Watchman makes reference to Tom Robinson being found not guilty and released to live his life. There are also some discrepancies in the Finch family tree. These are minor details that make no real difference.<br/><br/>Three, despite what other reviews may state, Atticus Finch is not portrayed as some raging segregationist bigot. While his views on race may seem inconsistent with those portrayed in Mockingbird, his fundamental goodness is still there. One simply needs to take a nuanced view of him as a human rather a saint.<br/><br/>Four, Aunt Alexandra is exactly the same character in both novels. Love to hate her. Harper Lee does a wonderful job creating a character to loath. Fantastic stuff.<br/><br/>Is the world a better place now that Watchman has been published? No. Do we literary-minded folks now have something interesting to discuss? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Oh, no mention of Boo Radley? Possibly the biggest disappointment of them all.<br/>Fin.
I suspected that the new/older book might have to be a let down after TKAM and it is.  For me, it's very slow, sometimes confusing, and not very engaging at all. None of the characters are very likeable, not even Jean Louise. I apologize, I love Harper Lee and admire the air she breathes.  I would never pass up the chance to read anything written by her, and it seems nuts for me to be criticizing her book.
A thoroughly enjoyable read.  The grown up Scout was brought fully to life.  Despite the critical reviews, any fan of To Kill a Mockingbird would like  this quick, yet engaging read.  The composition reads like a rough draft in spots, which was no surprise.  However, I treasured this brief glimpse of Scout as she becomes an adult and Atticus as a father who allows his idealistic daughter to grasp reality.
Some may enjoy the pace and writing style of this book..it's blood old fashioned writing and communications!
Very dissapointing,it was just a rehash of "to kill a mocking bird" but with Sout Finch as an adult.
Nowhere near as good as "Mockingbird". Not even the same feel as the other book...different writing?
I really thought this would be a better read. But it was only fair.  Difficult to get into with the writing.
Expecting more based on hype. Disappointed
How did she write this book prior to writing "To Kill a Mockingbird"?  This was hard to understand.
Tackles a painful subject at a painful time. Ignore the reviews and read it for yourself. While it is not a beautifully crafted novel, it is extremely thought-provoking. What would any of us have been like at that time? Are you willing to see people struggle, or do you want everything tied up neatly? To make a pun, black-and-white thinking does not always give one a clear understanding of the world.
This is not really a review; it’s a simple mandate. Unless you have never read and never intend to read To Kill a Mockingbird, you have to read this book. You may or may not like it but it is no longer even possible to read one without the other, for neither can now stand alone. No longer will they be taught or discussed as separate entities. So, be not afraid and be not stuck in a nostalgic past.
There are no adequate words to describe how moving her books are... I loved To Kill A Mockingbird when I was younger for the story and I appreciate it more now because of the message. Go Set A Watchman couldn't be any better or any more powerful than it is right now. I think she intended her books to be read and not sold, merely because of the quality and the soul she spilled all over those pages.
Great read!
Great story
A good read
The point of view of Scout is more jaded than the first book. Atticus isn't perfect. But it's a good read.
This is not To Kill a Mockingbird. It is the story of an incredible journey that is universal. I loved it.
It started a little  slow for me but the beautiful prose pulled me in.<br/><br/> I am glad I read it.  .
I do not think this book should have been published. All men and women ARE created equally. It is NOT okay to hit a woman to get her attention or otherwise.
I am one of the MANY, MANY TKAM super fans and I read this, in spite of the negative press, because I love her writing.<br/>Am I a bit sad to see how human and flawed Atticus was...Yes - but that was what she wanted to write and representative of the times in which it was written. There were many insightful lessons in this thoughtful and interesting story. Smart and funny too. So glad I read it.
Good book. If you enjoyed "To Kill A Mockingbird" you will enjoy visiting these characters again.
Jumps from past to present in a way that made it hard to follow. Probably never intended for publication.
I liked it more than expected because it had good social insights into Southern thinking during that era.
Takes an awful long time to get going but the final third made it all worthwhile!  So i would say read it
Wonderful book ! So accurate for that era ! As a southerner I fully understand and appreciate this book !
Kinda disappointing.  Editing could have been much better.  Leaves you wondering if you "got" it.
I may be in the minority! I prefered it to Mockingbird which was pure fantasy to me.  This was more real.
Jean Louise Finch returns to her small southern home town after living and working in New York City, following college.  It addresses complex racial and social issues of the time (mid 1950s) and discusses how ones point of view is affected by their personal experiences.<br/><br/>This book is just as funny and insightful as To Kill a Mockingbird.  As a matter of fact, I think it is better.
This book strikes all the right chords about issues in today's society--racism, pragmatism, ambivalence, action/inaction.  I'm glad I read To Kill a Mockingbird first but was not disappointed.  Things sure do change-exactly why life is not for the faint of heart.  Involvement is key!<br/>I very much enjoyed the weave/interposition of childhood and adulthood--and of course the crazy uncle.
kept my interest,  some time between to kill a mockingbird and go set a watchman but quickly settled in.
Should have kept this manuscript hidden. Disappointed with the story and disappointed in the characters.
Some what hard to get into, but once you do the message applies to today as much as it did 50 years ago.
Interesting time, story a bit disjointed. Not enough character developement for some of the characters.
Loved the character development and the look into the south during a time of transition in the country.
I enjoyed reading this book which gave me a different perspective into the race situation in the south.
Well-developed characters, Atticus' position clarified. Great similes and metaphors. Graceful language.
Enjoyed this book, but I kept reminding myself to read and not try to compare it To Kill a Mockingbird.
It was wonderful.  I had never read " to kill a Mokingbird".  So I read it first and then this!
Wonderful peek into Harper Lee's early writing and what she first submitted.  Definitely worth reading.
I did like the book .. but doubt that it will stand up to TKAM as must read piece of literature. I sure that Ms Lee wrote the "first draft" but really doubt that she is to be credited with the finished product. I agree with the premise that the publisher is a "money grabber". Go Set a Watchman read much like a chapter book, a weak sequel.. the last 50 pages were good.
I have been waiting a long time to hear what happens to Scout and her family and friends. I loved reading this book and would recommend it to anyone.
My esteem for Atticus Finch has in no way been diminished. Though this novel was published in 2015, the transcript was written in the 1950’s and depicts the raw reality of that decade.  I find no racism in the heart of this character, but rather a man in his old age striving to remain compassionate and respectful but honest about his world view as formed over his own lifetime.
I still like  Atticus, he is a product of his time and realistic about it and his place in the community. He is a voice of reason in the daily affairs of the community and a watchman as it is going through slow moving changes in an ingrained culture and mindset of the south.  "Scout" is a formidable grown woman and the product of her upbringing---a credit to her dad.
The author has provided a true look into<br/>The South as it was in the 1950's.  I personally feel she in fact lived those words she wrote. Go Set A Watchman did not change my love of Harper Lee's book To Kill A Mockingbird as race played a<br/>large part in our daily lives during those years before 1960.  Very good read about the way things were if you could not be there.
An exemplary and exceedingly articulate literary masterpiece which provides exceptional character development and a unique contrast in perspectives between Scout as a child and Jean Louise as an adult. An instant classic and a travesty to think such articulate and immaculately constructed words have remained in isolation in absence of public consumption for decades too many.
Another excellent read from Harper Lee!
Insightful, literate, and fully grounded in all the struggles of racism. Amazing writing. Couldn't put it down!  Sorry it took so long to publish.
I was NOT impressed. To Kill a Mockingbird will remain one of my all time favorites but not this one
Throughly enjoyed catching up with Scout and Atticus. Just as well written as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Loved this and well worth reading. Not quite as captivating as TKM but a wonderful read nonetheless.
It just wasn't as great as I was expecting.  It didn't really go anywhere until almost halfway thru.
Harper Lee's writing is very readable.  I enjoyed the book, but there wasn't much of a story really.
Having re-read "To Kill a Mocking Bird" and the journalist's book I viewed the content as a young women growing up and seeing those she loves for specific reason and beliefs and coming to the idea that maybe her perception of her Father was more human than her "god". Most children perceive their parents as they wish to see them not necessarily as they are.
I'm surprised that this book got so many bad reviews.  Did no one who reviewed it understand that it was not edited, except by the author, and that the novel derived from this story--TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD--was over two years in the process of editing.  I enjoyed finding out where Scout had gone and that Atticus was actually still the person we discovered in MOCKINGBIRD.
A bit disappointing, considering all the hype about it. Did not want to find out that Jem had died!
Written with more than enough skill to keep the reader interested.  Packs quite a punch at the end!
Amazing book, brings me back to my childhood when I read To kill a Mocking Bird. It is a must read.
I loved this novel! Beware... You will never look at the To Kill a Mockingbird characters the same!
this is a good read but not page turning. simple story that you can enjoy during a lazy summer day.
Worth the read.  I reread To Kill A Mockingbird first to re-familiarize myself with the characters.
It was not what I thought it would be. I am a bit disappointed after reading To Kill A Mockingbird.
unfortunaly i had to return item only because i bought for mom, and did not know she had it already
Seemed like the era I grew up around in middle Georgia. Could relate and have adjusted my feelings.
To read  TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and then to read GTAW is to understand the miracle of good editing advice. Harper Lee re-worked a boring, wordy,tediously told tale into a literary classic. GTAW is not a book that would have done well on its own merits. I don't think Watchman diminishes Harper Lee's reputation, because it fully illuminates how well Mockingbird was done.
This story reminds me of the discussions (Well maybe shouting matches) my grandfather and I had close to the time period of this book.  My grandfather was benevolent and had the same arguments as Atticus.  Exact same.  The discussions and thoughts in this book and it's link to Mockingbird gives everyone lots to think about.  Harper Lee is an amazing writer and person.
It was okay, nothing great.  Took a while before it got a little interesting and then it was over.
A great come down from "to Kill A Mocking Bird"  Would have been better left un published.
I very much loved this book. Harper Lee is a wonderful writer.  I was very glad I read To Kill A Mockingbird first. I really think it made this novel even better. I have to say although her novels were written years ago and I do alot of reading these were two of the best. I really recommend both for good reading. I think To Kill A Mockingbird should be read first.
The book is definitely worth a read, however please note that this is not a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird and that there is no dramatic climatic point that may be seen in To Kill a Mockingbird. This book explores the different views of white supremacists as well as the important ideals and morals that a parent uses to mold their children into better individuals.
Really enjoy the insights into the South in the mid-twentieth  century and Scout as a young woman
This book is really good, but not as good as To Kill A Mockingbird.  Still worth the read though.
I read the entire book in 24 hours.  It shocked and mesmerized.  In the end I felt hope and love.
Disappointed. Hard to follow plot line at times. Doesn't even compare with To Kill A Mockingbird.
At times it was very slow.  I had loved to Kill a Mockingbird so I had to read this... it was OK.
I finished Go Set a Watchman a couple of evenings ago, and I've concluded that the young Harper Lee was an apologist for white southern resistance to the civil rights movement and the NAACP. Not only is Atticus characterized as a preservationist of institutional racism, Scout agrees with him that the "Negroes are a backwards people...." This was followed by a lot of whining about blacks wanting immediate change, and, doggone it, the whites just aren't ready for it. C'mon, folks, based on the reaction to the whole confederate flag issue, when WILL southern white preservationists be ready to join the rest of the developed world in terms of basic human rights? As far as the storyline goes, the book reads like what it is: a rough draft. Harper Lee had 60 years to revise the manuscript to clean it up and align plot events with To Kill a Mockingbird. The fact that she never bothered in all that time should tell us that she was not particularly proud of this book, and it certainly explains her resistance over the decades to having it published. Having said that, it does offer some insights into many of our favorite TKAM characters, and it was very interesting getting to know Scout as a young lady, Jem as a teenager and young man, Atticus and his siblings...<br/>In the end, it was worth reading from a literary history perspective.
Great read
Great book
Slow start
Great book
Good read.
Very good.
Only so so
Brilliant!
horrible...i only made it through the first two chapters and then gave it away...worst book ever
I was afraid it would skew my  love for To Kill a Mockingbird, but it did not. love that book!!!
I liked knowing Scout as a young woman and seeing the difficulties of dealing with desegregation
Just OK.  Remminded me of when I had  to read "To Kill a Mockingbird" iin the 9th grade.
Harper Lee tells entertaining stories that starts people thinking.  Glad she published the book.
A YOUNG WOMAN comes home ---and  tries to understand the South ,her home where she was brought and her complicated father,fiancee and Uncle [who is her mentor].  It was confusing at times...especially how she was talked out of her anger!...I will go back and read parts...I guess I related to the struggle that she went through. Does she find answers? Bob R.
I enjoyed the book.  I read it over about 2 weeks at night and enjoyed the slower pace of the book. I most enjoyed Scout's remembrances of play with Jem and Dill, very nostalgic.  Also loved Scout's story about the dance.  Harper Lee really understands people at a very deep level.  I would recommend this book but only after one reads To Kill a Mockingbird.
Though there were some disjointed aspects of this book,  I believe it adequately describes the mentality of southern whites during the 40s through now.  I was highly anticipating a reduction in the respect I have for the character Atticus.  Instead I found myself aligning his thoughts with those of the men in my family.  I felt this was an excellent read.
I can't imagine this being published first, before "To Kill A Mockingbird".  It would have this ruined the impact of both novels.
First let me just say that Scout has always been my favorite literary figure. My mother is from Alabama, and when I read Mockingbird as a young girl, I just fell in love with Maycomb County...and Scout. Go into this book recognizing when it was written and that it wasn't edited and you'll be able to just sit back and enjoy meeting up with an old friend.
Wonderful read had just read mokingbird so enjoyed continuing my book group is reading the two.
Story funny, okay.  Explation fair - and small town discription good, in some places very true!
Story is slow, but good once you get into it.  Still does not compare to To Kill A Mockingbird.
Not how I envisioned it to read. Not sure I will finish. Disappointed in the characters so far.
What are books for? To learn, to escape, to entertain, to make us think. Go Set a Watchman is just a book. Yes, I enjoyed it, but because it made me think and remember how things were when I was younger. Is it flawed, yes. Does it struggle to make a point at times, yes. Still, it made me think and remember. I remembered "white only" restrooms, and felt shame. It made me remember a childhood full of inequity and appreciate our growth. Not only as a nation, but personally.<br/><br/>I am not posting this as a review of writing style since I have none of my own,  more because even with it's difficult and flawed passages, it resonated for me. If you are an author you may critique another's work. If not, what's the deal? There are many many books I have read that failed to stimulate much thought. This wasn't one of them. Having grown up in an era filled with bigotry, which hides just beneath the surface still, it never hurts to look hard at who we are. Those who won't look at society and judge it for its flaws, may be doomed to repeat the errors of our past.<br/>If this book stimulates anyone to open their minds and hearts to others, then it was well worth the ink used to print it.<br/><br/>Now, go ahead and criticize me if you like. But, remember, it's just a book for crying out loud.
Don't buy this book, which, upon investigation, is really a very long, "short story" rather than a novel. Inspecting the typeface, it appears to be aimed at the sight impaired, and printed on heavy paper to make it look more serious. Harper Lee gave us  a bang for our buck with Mockingbird and she does not make it anywhere near it, this time.
all the hysteria over this novel is misplaced. It is a nuanced, realistic look at how thoughtful, well meaning people deal with radical social change occurring around them. I reread To Kill a Mockingbird with this, and found this a complimentary companion book. If you have idealized Atticus Finch, I suggest you re-read To Kill A Mockingbird.as well.
Still digesting it. Interesting contrasted to her later novel "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Didn't know Odin wanted to read it but in so glad that I did.  Love it as much as Mockingbird.
This book was an okay read, not bad but not great.  Doesn't compare to, To Kill A Mockingbird.
I enjoyed being reacquainted with the characters I fell in love with in To Kill a Mockingbird. The struggle with the south's resistance to giving blacks equal rights and opportunities was eloquently presented. It is a realistic presentation of the tensions of that time and gives food for thought about the racial tensions that still exist today.
Confusing to those readers who previously read To Kill a Mockingbird.  Not on the same level.
All the hype was intriguing and knew I had to read it.  Glad I did.  Expected to be disappointed in Atticus character, but rather found myself enjoying "Scout" as a strong, young woman who stands up for her ideals, even against the people she loves most and in the end, finds she can still love them though their attitudes are different.
This book was very readable. I was a bit disappointed Ms. Lee did not explore the problem of taking the middle ground when it came to race relations in the U.S. This is a much more complicated subject than she depicts. I did appreciate her literary bravery in showing how Atticus Finch, as a man of his position, would be in rural 1960s South.
It was an interesting story line, but not nearly as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird."
Great nook. Just remember this is not a sequil. It was written before To Kill a Mockingbird.
Absolutely wonderful. Loved reading the perspectives on race relations written 50 years ago.
It gave me a new outlook on the people of the southern states.. I think those of northern states (Ohio) believed the history books and put complete trust in the belief that the only reason for the war was to free the slaves. I have never thought that to be more of an excuse than a reason. the author is subtle but clear on this position.
GREAT BOOK, HARD TO PUT DOWN, TREAT YOURSELF IF YOU ARE A READER, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED
Very interesting reading. I could see all the characters from the show playing their parts.
A great book.  Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. Well written with an important lesson.
I believed the author's characters were real and gratified in the development of the story.
Prior to the book's release, the press concentrated on the change in the attitude of Atticus Finch.  However, there were other aspects to cause such a change.  And, that was not the story, that change was the facilitator so the true story could take place.  This was very well-written and just as great a story as To Kill an Mockingbird.
Reads exactly as you would expect it would, being the rough draft precursor to Mockingbird
the Books were gifts to my wife, son, and daughter.  My comments come from their comments.
Well written but I was disappointed.....just seems like there should have been more to it.
It was good and I was glad she wrote another book but it was no where near as good as TKAM
I was waiting for this and very much enjoyed it.  It was a different time and how it was..
I loved it! It touched on issues that our country is struggling with today. Some paragraphs could have been lifted from today's news. Really loved how she addressed them and where she took the conversation. Also loved the interactions between Atticus and Scout! It felt very real and eye opening for any father/daughter relationship!
Gives insight onto the 1st book. I loved it and such an easy read. Don't know what all the anxiety is about tarnishing Atticus. If anything, it keeps him human and he continues to show kindness & humility. Gregory Peck is not Atticus, but that is who we picture when we read the book.<br/>So happy they found this and published it.
Well worth the read.  A wonderful tale of becoming a woman of her own. Scout is all grown up and living in NY.. but is she really. This is the story of the summer she finally grows up and becomes more than her Father's daughter. Beautiful and spell binding.  Hard truths faced don't destroy but transform when love surrounds you..
I enjoyed the book. Brought back memories of when I read "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Even if it cannot be another "Mockingbird", Lee's writing is well worth the time!
Once I got into it I read to the end.  Very telling about the era that it was written in.
Harper Lee is a wonderful writer. The relationship between father and  daughter and her connection to her hometown are heartfelt, empowering, and inspiring. I love the way Ms. Lee writes. I imagine "Go Set a Watchman" will achieve the same acclaim as "To Kill a Mockingbird." In my humble opinion it is classic-worthy literature.
I thought the book was hastily and ineffectively concluded. The book floats along in a generally pleasant way in a mist of Southern hospitality with stories of a girl coming of age and that girl going back home as a young woman. But weighty themes are introduced and never resolved.<br/><br/>There’s  some good writing here about small town life in Alabama way back. There’s an attempt to deal with hate-filled opposition to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. About a third of the writing is excellent, one third fair, and one third (mostly the latter part) weak. It is easy to see now why this was not published way back.<br/><br/>The problem with the book being published now is that it is outdated. People think differently now. The epic figure, Atticus Finch, does some things that would be treated very differently by a contemporary writer. Uncle Jack does something that would probably get him thrown in jail. (Where he could overwhelm his fellow prisoners with all his literary knowledge) Times have changed, but this book remains mired in a 1950’s mindset.<br/><br/>The conditions under which this book is published now make it something of a novelty. All in all, it’s a pretty good novelty.
In "Go Set a Watchman" the world gains a new favorite heroine in 20th century American Literature.  You will love the woman Scout has become!  Atticus, however, has fallen from grace.  The book is fabulously written.  Because of the heart-wrenching disappointment I felt in Atticus, however, I can only assign 3 stars.
Glad I read it...and in the order I read it, after To Kill a Mockingbird many years ago.
Another good book by Harper Lee but not quite as good or great as To Kill a Mockingbird.
I thought it was well written and it showed that there was racial prejudice in that era.
Best  book I have read lately. Depicts the South exactly for the time the story was set.
I LOVEEEEEEE the way H. Lee uses the turn of a phrase so beautifully.  I thought the story was written very well but somehow lacked the excitement.  The end seemed unfinished. Not as in, "expect a sequel"  rather like a really low crescendo when you expected/wanted so much more.  Life I guess is like that, isn't it?
At 6 years old Scout sees a God. At 26 years she sees a Father. This book tells as much about mankind as "Mockingbird" but from older and more mature eyes As Mockingbird has this book may also become a book of the ages I read .<br/>Mockingbird in the 50's as a young man and Watchman as an old man. I give it 5 Stars
Excellent
Loved it.
Fabulous!
Pedantry.
Excellent
Loved it!
I enjoyed this book more than To Kill a Mockingbird. It was thought provoking and quite profound. This is the book to be discussed in college classrooms. It shows so many different perceptions and misconceptions based on who is voicing their opinion. It made me realize that we all view the world through our own rose colored lenses. I was not impressed with her first book. I never understood what the big deal was about. This book meant something to me.
What as great story!  It was so great to read about what happened to the family, the town.  This story is mainly Scouts story.  She has grown up and moved away and comes home for a visit.  But in learning about her life now you also learn about more of her childhood.  I was not disappointed. Kudos Harper Lee, I loved it!
I loved this book.  Definitely not how I expected it to be, but I loved it nonetheless.
After Mockingbird one's expectations was probably very high... A good book nevertheless
Sad follow up to Kill a Mockingbird. My whole book club agreed. Don't waste your money.
"Go Set a Watchman" is not "To Kill a Mockingbird."  But it is, in its own right, a great novel.  "Mockingbird" is a coming-of-age story about Scout Finch.  In "Watchman" we meet her again as a young adult and realize that she still has growing-up to do.  Those who loved "Mockingbird" deserve to take a new look at it through the eyes of an older Jean Louise Finch and to see that childish idol worship must give way to clearer and more painful vision.  For me, the Atticus of "Watchman" is a more fully formed character than the Atticus of "Mockingbird" and I continue to respect and admire him, warts and all.  He is still a man of principle, upholding what he believes is right and true but flawed, as are we all.  Harper Lee is a portraitist of unusual accuracy.  Her characters are true-to-life.  Readers will understand that both books are about us.  We were Scout when we read "Mockingbird."  We are now Jean Louise as we read "Watchman."  We have changed and so has the world.  I am thankful for the opportunity to revisit the world of Maycomb and to take joy again in the prose of a great American writer.
Harper Lee's writing is fantastic although the story line seems a bit fractured to me.
I am reading as I type a great book, one of the best books I have read in a long time.
Same great writing style although not all that much of a story. Glad I read it though.
I personally thought this book was the adult version of To Kill a Mockingbird. It is about race but more about raising a child as a single parent and choosing carefully when to allow the child's image of her father to transition from the idealized dad to the imperfect human being we all are. Great insightful read!!!
"Go Set a Watchman" tells the story Harper Lee originally set out to tell before writing "To Kill a Mockingbird."  It is masterfully written in the same style as TKAM, but Scout is all grown up and is struggling to make sense of what is happening in her hometown - Maycomb - during desegregation.  As advertised in the media, her father Atticus's views on race are not exactly enlightened.  However, Atticus is the author's foil to speak for the older generation that is reacting to, and being passed by, current events.  Though most readers will not appreciate the sentiments Atticus expresses, the book does provide a window into the thinking and feeling of that era in a less judgmental way than is usually expressed in popular accounts of that era.  This allows the reader to appreciate the fear genuinely felt by the characters who have lived with black people their entire lives, but fear what change will mean for their future.  The author does not implicitly endorse the racial fear, but does a great job putting it in historical and societal context.  This book is sure to be required reading in high school English and Social Studies classes for years to come.
I can write little more without spoiling all. To Kill a Mockingbird has been my favorite book since I was 12.  This book upset me,  made me angry and, like Mockingbird, made me think and feel all that made it great and powerful. I cannot recommend it too highly. Don't miss it, and keep on to the end. It's worth it.
The prose of Harper Lee is obvious after the first page. I enjoyed the book and my hero worship of Atticus only grew with this book. When this book was written, "the times, they were a chang in." It's a realistic view of a progressive person navigating a hostile land, chuck full of the people one knows and loves.
This book was so good. I couldn't stand to put it down! Definitely worth reading!! :)
Long read.<br/>Felt there was too much time with little fill in regarding the blanks
Good read. Characters from her first novel gives a warmer appreciation for the story.
Began slow, but picked up by 1/4 of the way in.  Enjoyed it and still think about it.
Literature or Just another edition of Democrat Political Subversive Political Fiction
Scout grew up exactly the way we all thought she would! I'm sorry we won't have any more books to read by Harper Lee.
Totally not what we expected. We wanted to hear about Aticus Fitch-Not the daughter.
If one had not lived in the South, it might provide more insight than it did for me.
I enjoyed this because it was so different and fresh.  Gave me a lot to think about.
Loved this book. A perfect picture of the old south. This is like a history lesson .
Book #91 Read in 2015<br/>Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee<br/><br/>I worried about reading this book as To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all-time favorites; I even have a cat named BooBerry Radley.  Hearing all the buzz about the book, I was hoping that I wouldn't end up hating Atticus Finch, one of the greatest characters ever.  I am happy to say that I did not end up hating Atticus and overall I enjoyed the book.  While not, in my opinion, as well written and developed as Mockingbird, this book was a good, quick read.  Scout is now known as Jean Louise and is in her twenties and returning to Maycomb for her annual visit from New York City.  Looking at Maycomb and its people and happening through adult eyes makes Jean Louise question if anything she believed during her childhood was true.<br/><br/>Jean Louise has grown up but she's still spunky and feisty.  Aunt Alexandra is more developed in this book than in Mockingbird.  I enjoyed the references to other characters from the other book.  It was a nice visit to Maycomb.  I borrowed this book from my town library.<br/><br/>http://melissasbookpicks.blogspot.com
I loved seeing Scout as an adult. I am sad that Jem died so young. I don't care for the profanity, but I know censorship has been diminished. I miss Scout and Jem as children and the caring Calpurnia. I want Atticus to be the same,but time and circumstances happen to us all. I believe his soul is the same.
Contrary to early reviews, the book does not paint the father as a racist.  It is a very good story about an adult child learning to separate her childhood fantasies about her parents from reality and still loving them even with their frailities and their adjustments to the reality in which they function.
Though not well-written, it is an interesting book to read in light of its history.
A very fitting and excellent follow up to the "To Kill a Mockingbird" epic.
I enjoyed this book...everyone should stop comparing it to To Kill A Mockingbird...
It was horrible.  There was no story. Impossible to follow or get interested in it.
Great preview of a wonderful popular story after it was cleaned up for publication.
Well written with many insights into the "southern thinking".  A must read.
Two very independent old south ladies! Good to hear their stories in their element.
Not your childhood characters however somewhat aprapoe for some of today's issues.
I really enjoyed this book.  In fact I believe better than TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD.
The book was like the one we feel about o Kill A Mockingbird, but more like she was thinking of a family and how things change. Too many people thought Harper Lee was saying the lawyer was rascist, but I wanted to read it so I could find out he was just checking people out. It was good. Thank you.
I don't think 1960s Americans would have been ready for this book.  I hope we have evolved enough through time to understand the brilliance of Harper Lee,and her storytelling.  Humanity needs to get why this book is important.  I loved 9 yr. Old Scout as a child and I love Jean Louise as an adult.
Loved it. Reminded me of how much I liked To Kill a Mockingbird. I think it needs to be read by a lot of people.
A very good read. Not up to To Kill A Mocking Bird, but still well worth reading.
I thought it would be better from all the hype that came out before the book did.
Well written and a great look at the world of that time.  I enjoyed it very much.
Greatly disorganized and with editor could have been a good novel . Worth reading
In this short novel Scout has grown up and returns home to discover that her family and hometown aren't quite as simple as her childhood image of them.  Who doesn't?  The book is enjoyable, thoughtful, and timely.  The story isn't as tight as its predecessor, but that's in keeping with the theme.
The book started out  as I feel Harper lee wrote it but somewhere along the way her style faded out. It seems that someone else took over.  Ms. Lee may have  written most of it or did the outline for it but I cannot help but question if this is a Harper lee classic. Sure hope I am proven wrong.
Very dry and boring. Did not seem like the same author as To Kill A Mockingbird.
Starts very slow, but builds to climactic events; another great Harper Lee novel
As good as anticipated. Very controversial for our time, but not for their time.
The book had a dint and the pages are rough on the ends a bit weird but readable
I didn't think it was as good as To Kill a Mocking Bird, but it was a good book.
Great book! I'm glad that they came out in the order that they did! Kudos Scout!
Couldn't believe how much repetition of  "to kill a mockingbird" in this book, especially the first half.  And I mean verbatim.  Nothing that interesting or exciting that made you want to continue to read this hohum book.  Any other author would have been hard put to have found a publisher.
One of the most powerful books ever for me<br/>I read "To Kill A Mockingbird" when I was very young---never left me<br/>Loved Scout<br/>Critics who call Atticus racist are so WRONG---<br/>Will read this book again after I draw my breath<br/>Harper Lee is/was a national treasure
I will have to read several times. This story has deepened the plot and I want more. Having grown up and lived in similiar circumstances I relate to Scout and Atticus. For Scout, its sometimes better to never leave home<br/> Quick read with long term thought provoking issues. Do not judge
For all the hype about the discovery of this manuscript, I expected a somewhat better story line. Characters not in TKAM, how Tom Robinson lost use of his arm and no real explanation to Jem's death were a real disappointment.<br/> Support your local library and save yourself some money.
Loved it

This us an excellent book. It explains so well how Southerners think and feel.
Not for today's time. Would have been a shocker back in the day. Disappointed.
Hey, it's a book by Harper Lee.  Not quite Mockingbird, but still a good read.
Timely perspective on race relations and even more so considering the time when it was written. I now want to reread "Mockingbird" again. But this novel stands on its own. Get the book (not the Kindle version). You will want to add this to your collection in your bookshelves!
Although I wanted to enjoy this novel as much as To Kill A Mockingbird which I read over 50 years ago, I did not. I'm probably naive to the acts of segregation in the deep south and was disappointed to read how a respected icon in American literature was portrayed as a racist.<br/>.
Not much of a storyuntil closer to the end. Did not find it that interesting.
Interesting in light of all that is going on today with the racial situation.
Great book and It brought back memories when I read To Kill A Mocking Bird!!!
Need to reread To Kill a Mockingbird first. Two different Atticus characters.
It was good as an historically informed portrait of social life in the U.S.
Really good book, catches your interest from the get go.  Easy reading too.
It is definitely not "Mockingbird" quality but it  is worth a read.
This was a good, easy read book.  I had just rather read nonfiction books.
Harper Lee had another hit in the hiding!!  I thought it was a great read!
I heard that Harper Lee didn't want this book published. If that is true, it is pretty clear why not! I almost gave up finishing it several times, but now that I have finished, I feel that although the ending gave the book some worth,  it is just not a memorable book.
Born and living in a State in which every county voted against our current President I have seen only Luke-warm to negative reviews.  I often wonder why I stay here.  This book paints a perfect picture of why my conscience is needed here.  I recommend it to everyone.
IMHO this book is a fraud and a publishing hoax. It was not written by Harper Lee. I am returning my copy and I sincerely hope everyone else does too. This unedited, unrevised, raw manuscript should never have been published as "a novel." Has any novel ever been published in modern times without being edited and without revisions? Why was this atrocity published in the first place? The publishers have trashed the legacy of perhaps their finest author. Ms. Lee should sue.
It was just, very ok!  Nothing when compared with, To Kill A Mockingbird!
Enjoyed. Lots of current day issues rise in a book written 50+ years ago
I don't this held up as well as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, but I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed the story of Scout learning about her family and her home town
This book is a challenge, but very well written and fun to read! *******
A good read, followed on well from To Kill A Mockingbird. I enjoyed both
It was a good book, no matter what trouble makers will say. I enjoyed it
this is a difficult (disturbing) and important book to read.  i was constantly reminding myself when this book was written.  it makes it a clear window into the climate of the south in the 50's.  i loved that scout hasn't changed.  but the world definitely has.
Phew who wouldn't buy another book by the author of "to kill a mocking bird?The beginning was quite difficult to get into and then the world receded and one is in the South laughing and crying.The end is life enriching.Definitely a book to keep and read again.
Ok
Ok
ok
You just have to read out of interest but don't have high expectations.
My daughter loves Harper Lee books. She is so excited to have this one.
portrayed the reality of the times and was a lovely coming of age story
I haven't decided if I liked this book or not.  I'm a big fan of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and to some extent, this story contradicts the character of Atticus.  I'm still glad I read it though.  It's one that people will be talking about for many years to come.
Harper Lees' long awaited Go set a watchman did not disappoint.  I found it true to the era it was written in and about.  Her characters, though not as well developed as in To Kill a Mockingbird,  still rang true.  It was a very intense and enjoyable read.
people change in 20 years.
Too much hype for the book
It took awhile for the story to develop but develop it did.  I thought it reviewed, rehashed, and came to grips with race relations in the 60's with to pretty deep insight.  In all I liked the story but I thought it ended a little too soon.  Sven Engblom.
I had heard a few things and was afraid I would not enjoy this book as much as "To Kill A Mockingbird" but the truth is I enjoyed it even more. The author has such an honest way of describing people I couldn't put it down until I had read it all.
Adore her rich writing and this will be the last. Love the fact that she captured the emotional, spiritual, intellectual conflict of the times in all its untidiness. Love that she found her voice and still continued to love the flawed humans in her life.
I loved To Kill a Mockingbird, so was anxious to read this.  There was lots of controversy in the media.  Read the book to find out the real story.  I love how Atticus walks you through his thought process to bring you to an understanding of his actions.
Not nearly as good as 'To Kill a Mockingbird', but I enjoyed the read.
meh...no wonder the editor asked her to tell the back story instead ;)
Not as good as "To Kill A Mockingbird", but still a good read.
Pretty good but not as well written as "To Kill A Mockingbird"
Loved it! A story of childhood memories, hero worship and coming home!
Not the deep, richness of "Mockingbird" but still a good read.
I thought it was a wonderful growing up book for Scout.<br/>Well Done
Excellent-her writing is amazing. I loved the period piece and how she draws us unto racism. Atticus, Jean Louise, Henry, Atticus brother all characters defined succinctly. Go set a Watchman-do you know what you know- your conscientious will guide you.
This book starts a bit slowly but stick with it because it's a great read.  Mockingbird is one of my all time favorite books and this lets you know what happened to the characters as time passed.  Just remember it starts off slowly before you judge it.
Much ado about mediocrity
Not sure if this is what is it supposed to be, but the story was OK.
I don't care about the controversy about publishing this book. I found the issues raised regarding Atticus finch's motivations about race relations most provocative and stimulating that I am still wrestling with, long after I finished the book.
I have loved “To Kill A Mockingbird” and I love “Go Set A Watchman.”<br/>In one sense, I think “Watchman” is a more realistic novel.  “Mockingbird” is easier to love with a clearer distinction between good and evil which appeals to the concrete, dualistic character of our younger selves;  but life seldom continues to unfold like that.  “Watchman” more realistically describes the messy, gray areas in our relationships with others.  Like “Watchman,” and like our more grown up selves, we struggle with the negative sides of the people and the institutions we love.  We grow up and continue to discover that our parents and our institutions (our towns, communities, churches) are flawed.  Yet, if we face those flaws, we will continue to struggle with them, but can also continue to love our parents, friends and institutions, and feel continue to feel “at home” with them.
Very disappointed since Mockongbird is one of my all time favorites
lots of detail....sometimes loses the point...or a long way around.
Good read!  If you like To Kill A Mockingbird, you will enjoy this.
And it shouldn't be. Scout has changed into an adult and though we relish the memory of her childhood, we must bow to the passage of time just the way we genuflect to our own. Thank you, Miss Lee, for leaving us another morsel of Harper pie.
I read it in one sitting. I was enthralled. My daughter has it now as well as my old book of To Kill a Mockingbird. I suggested she read it first. I'm happy it was published. Had some very humorous parts that I had to share while reading...
I was happy to learn that some of the pre-novel hipe wasn't quite correct in my opinion. I did re-read To Kill a Mockingbird again before I read this for the continuity and recommend that to anyone really wanting to connect the two novels.
A great read - I could hardly put it down. I loved the characters.
Not as good as To kill a mocking bird, but still very interesting.
It ended too soon! But certainly was well written and captivating.
Well-written, but not on the same level as To Kill A  Mockingbird.
Enjoyed very much pleased I was not put off by some of the reveiws
Too short.  Needs editing.  What was the final resolution?  Is Atticus a racist KKK member intent on preventing integration or is he only trying to prevent a violent race war from breaking out?  I was left disappointed and unsatisfied.
Harper Lee really explores the attitudes toward segregation and black participation in the electoral programs of this country.  She gets to the heart of the struggles some were having with the past bigotry in the south.  A good reads\
It was interesting but lost interest quickly. Did not like ending
Really enjoyed the character developments and scene descriptions.
Another superb picture of life in the 1950's South by Harper Lee.
Made me want to go back and read , and watch the film, over again
Great read. Authentic, real. Laughter and tears at the same time.
Better than I thought a first novel would be. Not as good as To Kill a Mocking Bird.
The book was merely just a bunch of randomness that was very difficult to follow. I found it grueling to read. However, the underlying themes of all men/women are created equal are very much on the forefront of society even today.
I think I liked this one as much as the one originally released.
Loved it! So enjoyed another from Harper Lee. Makes one reflect!
It's not "To Kill A Mockingbird", but still a good read.
LOVED IT!  First book I have wanted to read again...immediately!
Though I'm against it's publication, I am enjoying reading it :)
I enjoyed the book.  It's a good historical picture of the time.
Was good,  not her best work,  left you wondering what was next.
Elder abuse.  This book is an example.  Somebody or something stole everything from Harper Lee, probably unbeknownst to her----getting very rich in the process, (not Lee)---- and published this piece of trash.  Er, white trash.
I am tired of all the complaining. This is a well written and enjoyable book. Its a slice of life of the 1950s south.  She portrays it accurately (I've studied history) and adds a coming of age element.  I  highly recommend it.
This book brought the readers back to the heart of Maycomb and moreso to the hearts of these beloved characters from "To Kill A Mockingbird." I loved to see who Jean Louise (Scout) had become and how she was continuing to grow.
I haven't finished this book yet, but I am enjoying it greatly.
Disappointing. With all the pre-publication hype, I kind of knew what direction the tale would take, but even so, I can't say it was a particularly good book. I finished it, but might not have if it had been any other author.
The story was well written but the characters were a disappointment.  I would have liked to see Jean Marie come to the rescue of Frank by convincing her father to select a biracial jury and for Henry to win a just decision.
Personally speaking I really enjoyed the book. I don't have the expectations of To kill the Mocking bird.. hope I don't sound cynical. But this is a book worth the money which is what the present context is all about. Amen
Not an easy read, very focussed on American political history.
An interesting quick read !  It kept my interest till the end.
Such a gift from a beloved icon who wrote the great American novel......much more complex Atticus...much more human and realistic for the time and social class in which the story the novel the fiction was set........
I found this novel at most times boring - confusing cast of characters - possibly because I did not read To Kill a Mockingbird.  Saw the movie years ago, but have forgotten so much about it.  Sorry I wasted my time.
took a couple chapters to get into it but scout was still scout but she learned a valuable lesson of all our prejudices the hard way.<br/>thanks to her uncle she got through it.  never did elaborate on death of Jem
Not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird.  Slow getting started.
makes me want to read "To Kill a Mockingbird" again.
Love this book. Wonderful prose from Harper Lee. A treasure.
Go Set a Watchman stands at the precipice of writing that we would expect from her. An astounding view of the world that has locked its characters in a world of Donbridge for all time.  A solid finish to the first.
I loved this book.  It was hard to read at times, but it was very honest, and human.  It shows how everyone is faulty although we may put them on a pedestal.  It's hard to explain really how this book affected me.
Boring
Great.
Boring
I really love this book! My favorite book of all time is To Kill a Mockingbird, and I adore Harper Lee. When I found out this "lost manuscript " had been found and Ms. Lee decided to have it published I immediately put myself on the waitlist. I've heard a lot of talk about this book. Some are saying its TKAM #2. I do think that if you read the book with the expectation of it being that you may be disappointed. While some of the characters are the same, it's not a sequel or prequel. This book stand alone, and the similarity is that Scout is again telling the story, but as an adult. It's an entirely different perspective, trust me on this! I really do suggest you get your hands on this fantastic read, but go about it as a stand alone book.
This book describes the ambivalence and confusion during the pressures and changes in the Civil Rights days of the South. It's been said, "How do I know what I think until I see what I say?"  I sensed the author's search for the right meaning of all the<br/>turmoil and attitudinal changes reflected by 26 year old Scout when she visits her childhood home.  The reader is drawn into the complexities and moral challenges of that historic period by Harper Lee's strong realism.  No oversimplification here.  The seeds of "To Kill a Mockingbird" are very recognizable in this first novel. The character Atticus remains a man of integrity as he is in both novels.  Only careless readers would label him a "bigot"here, and Scout learns humility in the end. I was disappointed with several loose issues in the plot that were not resolved like the trial of Calpurnia's grandson, and the abrupt ending left me wondering whether or not Scout would eventually return home. The unnecessary use of the Lord's name in vain which did not strengthen the realism was also disappointing.<br/>But I thoroughly enjoyed the masterful and thought-provoking writing style of Harper Lee.  Thank you.
Loved the story. The children grown up was especially good.
Hope there's a sequel. The end just left the reader hanging
I didn't think Atticus was as bad as he was supposed to be.
There was so much anticipation of this, I was disappointed.
A good read. Lots of history mixed in that makes one think.
I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. Keep the idea of it being a sequel out of your head - it isn't that. Instead, think of it as continuing down the path of getting to know the friends you met while reading TKM.
I really enjoyed Ms Lee's writing and a "second half of the story". It felt so authentic! There was so much to think about, which is an awesome responsibility and obligation of literature. Thank you Harper Lee!
I enjoyed the depth and content of this book more than To Kill A Mockingbird, which is one of my favorite books. Harper Lee was so very talented, she has shot up to the top of people I would like to chat with.
Excellent book. Very much Harper Lee. Appreciate her style coming through.
Good sequel but, as expected, not as good as the original.
I can't believe it took them so long to find it. Loved it!
I am thrilled to have read this book! I was just the best!
Well written for my part. Such backward people to portray.
IT IS A GOOD BOOK, BUT NOT AS GOOD AS TO KILLA MOCKNGBIRD.
The truth and great development of characters in conflict.
Harper Lee opened the door to her history through this book.  I read this book with a respect due her as an extraordinary writer and found her use of language and story telling, predicting a stellar talent.
Disappointed, and hard for me to read and even harder to get into the story.  Not worth the digital price.  Harper should have written this many years ago...seems that she struggled to get through the book.
Well, if I didn't know otherwise, I would think Harper Lee wrote this book with me in mind.  It's about taming a spitfire personality, very similar to mine.  That wasn't quite clear to me until the last two chapters, so yes there's a twist in this story.  I'll leave it at that for those who haven't read it yet.<br/><br/>To those who think it makes Atticus appear to be bigoted? Take it easy.  Yes, he does attend a meeting with some people who are militantly bigoted.  But he is there to listen and only makes one benign response.  It Scout who goes nuts about it, until she gets tamed at the end.<br/><br/>The writing is positively stunning, as it was in Mockingbird.  I'm sitting here marveling at the whole experience!
I absolutely loved it. I think I'm in a minority, judging by internet chatter, but I enjoyed every page, it didn't change my admiration for Atticus at all- I found it consistent with his character in Mockingbird. I also realize not everyone wants to support the book, given concerns about Ms Lee's mental competence, but I figured the book would come out before or after her death- might as well come out now while she can enjoy it. And there was no way I wasn't going to read it, given that Mockingbird is my favorite book of all time. Highly recommend it, and can't wait to start hearing others' opinions on it! (Now I'm off to read Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms because I want to see more of Ms Lee as a child!)
I have serious doubts that Harper Lee actually wrote this book. It is not of the same quality as TKAM, nor written in the same style. I was very disappointed and would not recommend anyone read this book.
it is not "to kill a mockingbird."  it doesn't have a great story.  get your mind wrapped around these facts and enjoy it for the beautiful writing and the steps leading to "mockingbird."
Great read. Did not agree with all reviews I read before.
WELL WRITTEN I WOULD SAY ACCURATE FOR THE TIME AND PLACE.
A good book but not a classic like To Kill A Mockingbird!
Nice little story but certainly not a Nobel Prize winner!
Absolutely loved it! Perfect sequal, brilliantly written.
Of course it brings Mockingbird to mind but so much more than that. Born and raised in the South in the 50's and 60's, to me Lee's understanding of the times and the people is nothing short of amazing.
The book itself is not a good copy-it is a second rate copy with ragged edges. Cannot be touted as a collectible due to its condition, as a bibliophile-I cherish my books-I am so disappointed. Would not have purchased it had I known it was a hastily made copy.Has nothing to do with the storyline-not on par with Mockingbird, but I think it is of historical and literary interest.did some research- The paper cut is called a deckled edge and allows Amazon to heavily discount the book. They should have let buyers know that this is what they were buying, so they could make the choice to buy or not. I don't know where they have the smooth cut edge, but I am looking to buy one for my permanent collection.
Same characters as To Kill a Mockingbird, but a different story.  Writing is very good, but the story is not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird. And the Addicus Finch character in this story is flawed.
A wonderful read!  Beautiful story about gradually learning that those you love and admire as a child, your personal heroes, are human and flawed and are yet still worthy of your love and admiration.
I was not impressed.
it was slow in the beginning, I enjoyed the second half.
Sure made me think. Reese's performance made it amazing.
never really got the author's point in writing this book
On a par or better than "to kill a mockingbird".
Nice to revisit old friends from To Kill a Mockingbird!
A worthy successor to "To Kill a mocking bird".
i think this is the best book I have ever read.  She had such in-depth reasoning about the racial problems.  It was and is not a black and white issue.  There are many sides to the issues.
If this book had been published before Mockingbird, nobody would know who Harper Lee is. It was an interesting portrayal of the south at the time, but it was otherwise a slow boring read.
Very thought provoking...  enjoyed it with my booklub
A powerful reminder that life is not black and white.
About what I expected, more true than her first book.
Loved the character development of Atticus and Scout!
Not nearly as good as 'To Kill a Mockingbird' but enjoyed the book.  Disappointed to find that Atticus was a racist but it was interesting how she tried to explain the reasons behind it.
This story is based on the same characters as To Kill a Mockingbird, but just like in life, memory changes things. Scout is grown up but not yet matured. This story is her coming of age.
Not as good as "Mockingbird", but was good reading and pointed out what it was like during that time period. History is just what it is and is a part of us. Let's learn from it.
Poorly written ...has to be written by someone else.
An wonderful read that lives up to all expectations of Harper Lee....absolutely captures an understanding of our race relationships that is so timely....Thank you for another classic
I have spent the past thirty hours trying to reconcile Atticus Finch's racism in Go Set A Watchman with the Atticus of Mockingbird.  Please email me if you have been able to do this.
A very sensitive subject to write about depending on where you lived and how you were raised.  Freedoms are only missed when you finally realize they are gone forever for everybody.
A really great back story.  It makes you think of the time and place in our country's history.  We continue to face many of the same issues today but cover it up in different ways.
Easy follow. Good to know what happened with Scout.
Enjoyed the book.  The beginning was a little slow.
Very good but not great.  My copy had several typos
Independent novel.  Love her voice as much as ever.
Very interesting book. I would highly recommend it.
Good novel in its own, but not what I was expecting
This was a very interesting book.  Quite enjoyable.
If you loved To Kill A Mockingbird this just enriches it. Don't expect it to top Mockingbird. Nothing can top that book. No author should write the same book over and over anyway.
An honest look at the times through the eyes of the people living it.  I've read it twice and will be reading it many more times to get through all the layers of plot and meaning.
Harper Lee is an outstanding writer.  Yes, it was hard to see Atticus come down off his pedestal but he is human, just like the rest of us.  The thing I love about this book is that you put it down not really knowing what you think, which therefore; makes you think even more about the book.  I had friends that didn't want to read the book for they didn't want Atticus to change in their eyes, I get that, I understand that...I still see him as a great man, a man that loved his daughter immensely.  So, pleas, don't NOT read this book for fear of how you will feel about him...you will be sorry you missed it, if you do.
loved it!!!  brings out the human side of atticus.  nothing racist about book.  last third of book brings out most profound thoughts about the race debate.  will make you think.
Terrific insight into the Deep South during integration, the attitudes and changes.  Wonderfully written as a family narrative... Especially as the family we all grew up with...
Great book, not finished with it but great so far.
The parts going back to Mockingbird time were good
I thought all the civil rights stuff was overdone.
GREAT WRITING.!!! SORRY SHE ONLY PUBLISHED 2 BOOKS
surprisingly good, after all the negative reviews.
Read Mocking Bird again and then Go Set A Watchman
Wonderful. Read 'To Kill A Mockingbird" first.
If you are interested in the craft of writing, and have already read Harper Lee’s popular masterpiece, "To Kill a Mockingbird", you will be fascinated by what amounts to Lee’s first draft of" Mockingbird", the recently re-discovered "Go Set a Watchman".  This is clearly a first effort by a neophyte writer, full of the idealism and self-righteousness of a well-educated twenty-something.  There is a lot of principled ranting, a lot of explication, some characters who are blatantly there only to move the plot along, and a lot of alternating monologues presented as conversation.  And there are flashes of brilliance.<br/><br/>For a writer, the lesson to take from "Watchman" is the priceless value of the editor who was able to separate the self-righteous diatribe from the true vision, who was able to sift the showing from the telling, who lit on the shining moments of real life in this first effort  and told Harper Lee :”you should  concentrate on the child Scout – she is more interesting than the 23-year-old Jean Louise with her New York veneer – and what’s this about a rape case where Atticus triumphed against all odds?  Show why she revered her father, don’t tell us how she became disillusioned.”<br/><br/>Whoever that editor was deserves recognition.  The Pulitzer, the National Medal of Freedom and all the other honors showered on Harper Lee should have been shared.  That editor  was given a first effort and extricated a masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you are interested in how to carve a great novel out of a first draft, this book is an invaluable contrast to its successor, "Mockingbird".  If you are just looking for a good read about coming of age in the segregated South, I recommend  as an alternative "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" by Carson McCullers - also written when the author was in her early 20's, but a much more mature work. (Both Lee and McCullers were at one time very close friends with Truman Capote - maybe there was Southern Gothic in the water?)
A train bound from New York City arrives at Maycomb Junction, and from it steps twenty-six year-old, Jean-Louise “Scout” Finch. The train station is ten miles from home. Home is Maycomb County. It is twenty years since the time of “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and much has taken place in the passing of that time. “Go Set a Watchman” takes us into the new world of Jean-Louise and Maycomb County, a world where racial tensions have now brewed to the forefront, the imminent result of segregation in the south and other constitutional issues that separate black from white.<br/><br/>Jean-Louise, who has since ditched her childhood nickname, has returned to visit her ailing father, Atticus Finch. Now in his early seventies, Atticus suffers from Rheumatoid Arthritis. His sister, Alexandra, has cared for him just fine. Atticus doesn’t need much, just a little occasional assistance at the dinner table. Jean-Louise’s guilt of living her own life in NYC is derived from the Maycomb judgment against her for doing so. That guilt brings her home to a different world. But the question is, is it a different world, or as a child, had she failed to see what was right in front of her?<br/><br/>“Go Set a Watchman” has brought back many characters from “To Kill a Mockingbird.” But the loss of one specific character is noticeable throughout—Jem. Jem died young—a heart attack while standing outside of his father’s office. This fact is learned early in the book, making his absence a void in the lives of the characters and in the story. Jem appears only in Jean-Louise’s reminiscences that relive their childhood games, memories not played out in “Mockingbird.”<br/><br/>Other returning characters are Calpurnia and Uncle John. Calpurnia is retired from the Finch’s service, and in a moment of clarity, we see the black and white divide between Calpurnia and the Finch’s for the first time. It is a moment that leaves Jean-Louise speechless. Also, she is set to marry one of her and Jem’s childhood friends, though it’s not Dill. It’s Henry, a character seen only briefly in “Mockingbird.”<br/><br/>But the impending nuptials are interrupted by the story’s long awaited climax. Like many years before, the former “Scout” sneaks into the courthouse and watches from a balcony high above. There, a meeting of the town council has commenced. Atticus and Henry are both there, listening to a racist rant from two of the townspeople. At this point in the story, the identity of the more refined Jean-Louise slips away, unveiling who lay dormant just underneath—the tough, self-righteous Scout. She is appalled by what she hears, shocked by the fact that neither Atticus, nor Henry argued against the men. She calls off the wedding and confronts her family for the first time, most of all, Atticus.<br/><br/>It’s been reported that this book was the original submission by Harper Lee, but publishers wanted the story that took place in the past. It’s easy to see why. While “Watchman” is an entirely different book than “Mockingbird,” it is enjoyable, comical, and allows the reader to examine the same crucial factor in American History from a later standpoint.<br/><br/>Unchanged is Harper Lee’s literary magic with words and storytelling. At the book’s climax, Jean-Louse’s anger explodes upon Atticus. She remembers the noble lawyer that defended an innocent black man, the upholder of justice and peace. She accuses him of not being the same man. Atticus’ words are direct, implying that “Scout” saw what she wanted to see. The exchange between them is electrifying, allowing us to debate the true natures of these two characters. The book is an interesting and thought provoking revisit, a journey well-worth taking.
I must admit that I have not yet read To Kill a Mockingbird.  I saw the movie and the book is on my “to read” list.  But then again, so are a couple thousand other books.  And I realize that movies don’t do books justice, so I will read it.  And now that I have read “Go Set a Watchman”, it has moved higher up on the must get to list.<br/><br/>I’m not sure what I expected with this book, only that it wasn’t what I thought I should have expected.  It was quite slow in getting around to some of the main themes of the book.  Much of the book fills you with the atmosphere, the people, the customs, the history and the unique level of interactions that is distinctly Southern.  Having been raised by a father that was born and bred in a small town in Georgia and spending many years of my childhood surrounded by his family, I became all to familiar with these types of ways.<br/><br/>The central character of the book is Scout or Jean Louise (gotta love the South’s use of double names), daughter of Atticus Finch, who has returned home from her life in New York City.  The story is a slow awakening of the racial bias in all its complexities that existed at the time of de-segregation, and even persist today.  Actually, it goes even further than the racial bias, but also covers the social and gender bias.<br/><br/>The book offers a unique and interesting perspective on the thoughts and culture of America’s South.  A perspective that still holds to a large degree today in many areas, as is evident by the popularity of the rhetoric of many of the politicians emerging from this area.<br/><br/>But, the thing that is unique in this book is the way it is presented to you.  The issue is not just black and white and there are no real “good guys” or real “bad guys”.  They are humans, many of which believe they are acting for the greater good, attempting to preserve what they believe is a way of life they are entitled to.  In fact, many don’t even see their prejudice for what it is.  They see it as watching over “less fortunates”.  And this does not, by any means, excuse bigotry in any way.  It simply gives you a peek inside the heads of many of these people and seeing there are many shades of gray in there.  And as inexcusable their bigotry is, there is also immense decency in them.  The truth is, they are not unlike many other people who truly believe they are doing good when their acts diminish and marginalize others.  People of faith, and most of these are, believe it is their duty to watch over and guide those that don’t share their beliefs, look different, etc.  They hold a class structure that they will often deny.  And a belief that one can only rise so far above one’s origins.  So often through the book was peppered the line, “Love who you want, but marry your own kind.”<br/><br/>And I give Harper Lee credit for also turning the mirror effectively back the other way when she had Scout called a “bigot” and offered the definition, “a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices;especially :  one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance”  For, when we close the doors of communication through failing to hear, to understand, no matter how right our cause, we will doom it to failure.  The world didn’t become the way it is overnight, nor shall it change overnight.  And part of changing it is to understand it with empathy and respect.<br/><br/>It’s a coming of age, a God busting, religion busting, hero busting, blinders shattering journey.  Others refer to it as rough around the edges in comparison to To Kill a Mockingbird, but I think that gives it more power.  Because, the emergence from the shroud of our youth can be a very messy and rough journey.  I don’t know what the criteria is for a Pulitzer for a novel, so I have no idea if this one qualifies.  But, it is an amazing work of writing that makes you at least glance at the world through the eyes of another and shows you nuances and hues you had previously missed.<br/><br/>SephiPiderWitch<br/>http://sephipiderwitch.com/go-set-a-watchman-by-harper-lee/<br/>10/22/2015
With glee and anticipation I ordered my copy of Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee earlier this summer.  I started it back in July.  I finished it last night.  In between I read lots of books with the kids, a couple of other random books and a whole lot of articles and magazines.<br/><br/>This was a difficult book for me.<br/><br/>I felt obligated to read this novel.  Shoot, I felt obligated to like this novel.  I mean, one of my daughters is named after the main character in To Kill A Mockingbird.  It's a book I am attached to in a sort of unhealthy way I think.<br/><br/>And so - I started the book.  And, well, you can see from the distance between my start date and my finish date that it didn't end up being one of those I'm-willing-to-put-my-life-on-hold-until-I-finish-this-novel kinds of books.<br/><br/>Even as I force myself to type this review, I still don't really know what I think.<br/><br/>I'm not going to address the entire scenario of whether this book should have even been published, if it's the real deal, if Harper Lee is really capable of deciding if she wants this novel in the hands of the public or any of that.<br/><br/>I just want to talk about the words.  The story.  My friends - Jem and Atticus and Scout.<br/><br/>They are still there.  Sort of.  Kind of disfigured and disrobed and aged and out of sorts.  They exist.  But - they don't read the same.  They read a little too - like platforms or mouth pieces and I can't say I like what they're preaching.<br/><br/>It's hard to share without giving away the story's thrust and I can't stand when that happens to me so I'll do my best to spare it from happening to you.<br/><br/>I would not say this book shouldn't be read.<br/><br/>There are some thought-provoking ideas in here and there remains a paragraph or six, a chapter here and there, a conversation on a page or two, that is lovely and profound and worth mulling over and pondering.  But between those bits, there is a wealth of this and that unnecessary and somehow lacking, coupled with a forced feeling that just doesn't sit well with my affections for Scout and Atticus and Maycomb.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, I sort of wish I'd never seen or heard of a grown up Jean Louise or Atticus Finch.  I want to see Atticus through her little girl eyes.  (And so does she.  The novel's primary story line, really.)<br/><br/>It would be a lie to say I wasn't a bit disappointed in this late release sequel/prequel sort of book.  (I do like the title, however.  I like the meaning behind the title and the concept of setting a watchman.  An idea I'll let you unearth for yourself as you read the novel.)<br/><br/>Maybe I'm a little like Scout - the grown up one in this novel.  And I don't want to be.  Maybe I don't want my view of Atticus altered because I really liked the way he was because the way he was said something about me too.  About what I want to be true and what I want to be possible about men and mankind.<br/><br/>This new novel breaks that apart.  It doesn't just let him fall, like Humpty Dumpty from his wall.  It takes a pretty big shove and dashes Atticus to the ground.<br/><br/>Of course, when that happens, something has to break inside Scout as well.  And the thing that breaks inside of her is the same thing that breaks inside of me, as a reader and as a faithful believer in the security of Atticus Finch.  And, frankly, little old Scout doesn't come out all that clean on the other side either.  That sort of stings too.<br/><br/>You know it's like any character that's your favorite.  You can't wreck what we love about Zeek Braverman.  Come on, you wouldn't be happy if a new Parenthood episode was aired and Zeek turned out to be a bit of a falsehood in all the ways that really mattered.  If Zeek held secret beliefs that were anti-family and was working to break up the Braverman clan.  What if Coach Taylor on Friday Night Lights was a secret fan of soccer instead and really was only coaching football to get himself ready to coach soccer?<br/><br/>Yeah.  Those are ridiculous scenarios and foolish comparisons.  (And evidence of what I've been streaming on Netflix of late.)<br/><br/>But the premise is on track.  If Huckleberry Finn's life story gets rewritten and re-cast as a kid who is promoting slavery instead of rescuing Jim, your whole view of the raggedy likable fellow shifts and you're left feeling as if you loved an imposter.  You're left trying to defend his actions because of what you thought you knew about him before the rewrite.<br/><br/>That's how Go Set A Watchman leaves me feeling.<br/><br/>Like I have to make excuses for loving To Kill A Mockingbird as much as I do.
As I read this book, I was often baffled by the lengthy conversations between Jean and some of the more senior residents of Maycomb. I had a hard time teasing out what the author was trying to convey. Several times, I just threw in the towel, and hoped I would later grasp their significance. By the end of the book, it was reasonably clear that it would have been extremely helpful to have lived in the South (or better yet, the Deep South) to understand the objection being raised to being painted as slave holding aristocrats who cared about nothing more than maintaining their vaunted position, if your were white and lived in the South.<br/><br/>It is true that GSAW is about the preservation of a life and a lifestyle, but it is hard to find genuine villains. If you subscribe to the theory that Court decisions in the second half of the 20th Century and this century have advanced the cause of freedom and dignity, then the residents of Maycomb could be portrayed as hanging on to an outmoded world view. If you believe that government intervention on behalf of blacks (or any identifiable group) were self serving and largely counterproductive, and that great progress was under way well before the arrival of people from the federal government, "to help," then a certain sympathy does arise.<br/><br/>Eisenhower thought it would take 100 years from the time of his Presidency for race relations to truly normalize. Notwithstanding affirmative action, and pandering, he may still turn out to be correct. The South seems to grasp that change happens slowly. There is no 'Vanguard of the Revolution," no matter how well or ill intentioned. Jean is sadly prescient in her insightful discussion of how discarding the 10th Amendment in favor of an interventionist reading of the XIV Amendment (BROWN v BOARD) would herald federal intervention in other areas where its presence is neither needed or Constitutional. Marriage, abortion, and education are not mentioned in the Constitution, and yet the High Court has felt comfortable inserting itself into these and a wide variety of other issues with which they have no Constitutional standing.
I was given this book as a gift by a friend who wanted my reaction to it.  I grew up Southern to the core during the historic time frame in which this book is set.  Reading it, as the late, great Yogi Berra said, was like "deja vu" all over again.  In many ways Lee catches the atmosphere and complexity of small town Southern social dynamics perfectly.  She lived through them and I am pretty sure there is some of herself stitching the developing story together.<br/><br/>That said, the book is a literary roller coaster.  There are flashes of artistic brilliance that resonate with the entire Southern Literary corpus and I think, in those sections, even Richard Weaver would have admired her prose.  When Jean Louise drifts into nostalgic reliving of the time when she and Jem were playing "preacher" and the resulting "baptism" was nearly socially catastrophic, the reader finds himself suddenly "there", he is no longer reading the text but living it with those kids.  Lee has many of these moments throughout the work but it is mostly in the sub-plot narratives rather than the main thrust.<br/><br/>On the other hand her character development falls short and, regretfully, in just those characters who mean the most.  The main plot development is directed toward the existential crisis of "alienation" that occurs when Jean Louise suddenly sees that the meta-narrative that she had embraced concerning her father, her uncle, her boy friend, and indeed the entire beloved town of Maycomb is, in her mind, a hypocritical lie.  Lee's depiction of this experience is superb.  It falls short however in the immediate aftermath.  Both Jean Louise's father, Atticus, and her uncle speak to her in sonorous platitudes that have more in common with "Gone With the Wind" than with real life Southerners of that era or any era.  Similarly Atticus comes through as almost 'god-like' in his handling of Jean Louise.  What he wants to do is to cause her to stop over-idolizating his own person.  What Lee actually does is undermine this very intention.  Because Atticus is seeking for his daughter to be completely equipped to decide for herself those values which will guide her through life, he recognizes that he must sacrifice himself, to make her see himself, as flawed in at least one key area.  When this happens she will be at last able to be a truly free soul.  Now, quite frankly, this makes Atticus even more noble than before.  Further it completely diminishes his own humanity.  It would have been far better for both him and his brother to come down from their lofty philosophical detachment and to enter into Jean Louise's anguish and demonstrate some degree of sympathetic pain over that anguish.<br/><br/>As for her boy friend - Henry.  All of his early character potential, his strength and patience with Jean Louise, is sacrificed in the end by Lee's sudden characterization of him descending into petulant  self-pity and timidity.  Lee could have handled the content of what he says in his last speech much better and that was a disappointment.<br/><br/>Finally, on a positive note though.  This novel's greatest contribution is the "I was there" sense a Southerner experiences when Jean Louise is being instructed by her uncle about the dynamics of small town culture trying to deal with the catastrophic changes resulting from the landmark Supreme Court decision (Brown vs. Board of Education, 1954 ?).  Lee's insights here are absolutely superb.  Most Southerner's of the time felt those things but could not put them into words.  The paradox that what they feared was something far more than the question of race and that at the same time, it could never be separated from it, was absolutely the driving force which erupted into vicious and irrational acts of bigotry.  There was the sense that something beautiful was being lost, but that it had to be given up, because it had become leprous and misshapen and hideous.  The old Southern heritage, its culture if you will, was ultimately a nostalgic longing for a world of structure, honor and "place" in which a person could be truly free.  Atticus and his brother, again with god-like penetration, see this and at the same time, recognize that they themselves know that it has got to go the way of all flesh and yet, they are helpless to do for themselves what they each want to happen to Jean Louise.  They cannot break from it even though they see what has to happen clearly.<br/><br/>Lee's greatest contribution in this work is that last, desperate attempt to tell a generation far removed from those days, that Southern culture could not be truly described by bumper-sticker stereotypes.  It was nuanced, complex and simultaneously noble and fatally flawed.  I think only those who loved it can both weep for it and be happy that it has disappeared... forever.
Approximately sixty years ago a young liberal writer watched the news and read the papers with ever increasing distress. She saw her people portrayed as racist bigots fighting against the common rights of Man. She saw the truth in this portrayal but she also knew that these people (her people) were not fundamentally bad and although she herself had not fallen into this heinous way of thinking, she understood how her compatriots had reached this sorry state.<br/><br/>The young writer felt that she had a duty to explain, but not as a defence of the South and certainly not as an apology. She had a duty to explain so that others might recognise the seductive devil that lies in each one of us and by recognition have a chance of fighting it. It turned out that she was blessed with a rare genius and her book once written beautifully described how kind, intelligent upright people could learn to hate the terrible otherness of a foreign race. She used wit and charm to make the reader empathise with racists and almost to imagine that the horrific sentiments they espoused could be just under the surface in their own id.<br/><br/>Harper Lee took this important work to a publisher and the liberal editor read it with horror. The book forced the editor to stare into the abyss and it was dark and frightening. Worse still the editor feared that a mind less strong would look into this void and instead of turning against it might just possibly leap in: turning good men bad. The editor (Tay Hohoff) saw the genius of what she was reading but she also saw that it could not (or should not) be published. Tay had been brought up as a Quaker and she had a Quaker’s belief in good and evil. She also believed that most readers would want to be good. Tay recognised that the literary conceit in this extraordinary book allowed (in fact required) at least one character to stand out for Justice against the bigotry of his fellows. The conceit then required us to see this character fall. In the original book as penned by Harper Lee we readers are forced to see that we are all fallible humans… but for Tay Hohoff there was an alternative message, almost a Calvinist message. If the fall was hidden from the reader they would be left with a hero to look up to and perhaps to emulate. For Tay America was not ready for the ambiguities of the original message.<br/><br/>In this way To Kill a Mocking Bird was produced, in my opinion (and the opinion of many others) one of the greatest books ever written: but not the book Harper Lee originally intended, indeed it was a book with a message almost diametrically opposed to her original concept. Far from explaining why good people can slide towards an unacceptable position, Mocking Bird divided the world, if not into saved and damned, at least into those with the grace to oppose racism in the name of justice and those condemned to weak minded bigotry. It was a feel good book in the sense that all liberals could comfortably feel they belonged to the former rather than latter group.<br/><br/>Fifty-five years after the publication of her brilliant compromise with her publisher and the American people, Harper Lee has returned to her original concept, perhaps believing that her nation is now ready for it.<br/><br/>Everything above is of course pure speculation, including my assertion of Harper Lee’s faith in a mature new America. The majority of Amazon reviews indicate that her readership does not feel that Go Set a Watchman has given them new insight. Many express betrayal and assume base motivations for the decision to publish. I suspect that this reflects a liberal audience understandably unwilling to allow racists a human face. I empathise with the outrage, after all the joke was on us. I believe it was an unitentional joke but it was nevertheless a doozy of a joke. It wasn't so much that we identified with Atticus Finch, the fact was that for most of us we aspired to identify with Atticus Finch. For many of us our own moral weakness is a cause of embarassment, but at least we know what we want to be, we want to be better than we are, we want to be a fictional lawyer from the fictional town of Maycomb. Go Set a Watchman showed me that even my aspirational self is flawed (is human).<br/><br/>I hope that a wider audience might be more willing to recognise aspects of themselves in the various characters and perhaps learn to oppose the feelings of insecurity and insularity that can so easily turn to intolerance and hate.
Go Set a Watchman, the book itself, has an interesting history. When Harper Lee presented her first novel to a literary agent in the 1960's, the author was persuaded to rewrite it from the main character, the child Jean Louise Finch’s, point of view. To Kill a Mockingbird was the result, a book that became one of the most widely read books dealing with race in America. Now, 55 years later, the “original” book has been released.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman begins with Jean Louise Finch, now 26, returning home to the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, from New York City, where she has lived and worked for the past few years. She plans to spend three weeks visiting her father, 72 year-old Atticus Finch a beloved attorney who, despite suffering the crippling effects of rheumatoid arthritis, still practices law.  Although the novel doesn’t specify the date, it is presumably in the mid-to-late 1950's, because the Supreme Court has passed the school desegregation law, a 1954 law that has incensed most Southerners.<br/><br/>Having lived in New York, Jean Louise is seeing Maycomb County in a different light. In New York she has worked and lived near people of color, but in Maycomb she’s taken aback by what she sees as gross inequality. Worse, she sees her father, whom she has always worshiped, in a different, unfavorable light.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is an important book for our times. Harper Lee doesn’t gloss over racial  attitudes. She looks at the whole person, strengths and flaws together. While To Kill a Mockingbird is considered a coming-of-age novel, Go Set a Watchman is a coming-of-age novel for an adult, a work of wisdom, humanity and passion, a book evocative of another time, but relevant today. It isn’t necessarily a fun or easy read, but it’s a book that made me think. I highly recommend Go Set a Watchman.
All right, listen: we're always going to be tempted to compare an author's works against each other--for good or for bad. Look what happened when Potterheads read some of J.K. Rowling's (or Robert Galbraith's if you prefer) works post-Potter. People weren't pleased, mostly because they held (secret) expectations for it to be like Harry Potter. I realize that there are some unsavory feelings toward Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman, but we have to remember that this is a novel on its own merits and shouldn't be directly compared to or conflated with her seminal classic To Kill a Mockingbird. You'll likely have strong opinions. That's fine, I do, too. But we'll agree to maintain a respectable dialogue and not debase ourselves to blindly calling out emotional arguments. Okay? Okay.<br/><br/>Jean Louise, lesser called Scout at age 26, Finch travels back to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama from New York City for her annual vacation to visit her father. There are consistencies to life and behaviors in Maycomb that Jean Louise has become accustomed to and even looks forward to during her trips home. This trip proves to be no different, that is until she finds some questionable literature of Atticus's and learns of the Council meetings that her father and close, romantic friend Henry attend as members of the board. To learn of the actions that her loved ones are taking against the advancement of civil rights drastically up-heaves Jean Louise's life and her long-held understanding of her father. Coming to terms with this new knowledge and reflecting on her past help Jean Louise figure out who she is and where she'll go from here.<br/><br/>A narrative weaving through time and memories provides a more complete picture of Jean Louise's life after that which many of us know from her experience in To Kill a Mockingbird, Go Set a Watchman plays off of the characters and personalities first presented in that narrative but offers a new, yet somewhat familiar story for readers. While many of us will recall the racial tension present in TKAM, this new novel has an elevated racial tension due to the governmental involvement interjected via the Supreme Court. The struggles depicted, unfortunately,  resonate with ease and remind me a bit of the mini-series Show Me a Hero on HBO. Seeing Scout transform into a new Jean Louise demonstrates how complex and seemingly fickle people actually are while also illuminating how easy it is to shatter how you view someone. Without divulging too much, which you may already know since this book has been out for a while and gotten a bit of press attention, you may be outraged by some of the content, but you may also find that you have understanding, be it with the situation presented or within yourself.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 stars.
It's hard to review a book that I can't pretend to understand, although those that I do understand these days tend to be pretty trivial. Maybe other readers can help.<br/><br/>Installing conscience as a watchman is only one of many questions remaining after reading this thought provoking novel. A watchman is a mechanical feedback monitoring device that Harper Lee uses as a metaphor advising readers to install their conscience in place. I'm not sure that it works as a psychological device maybe even as misapplied as the term “normal.”  But it make for great literature. Do social conditions result from individual conscience? Maybe that's Lee's point. She does a good job of exposition within a fictional setting. Who is Lee instructing to set a watchman? Reputed to be a sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' it stands alone although comparison is a very interesting aspect.<br/><br/>Jean Louise Finch, 'Scout' of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' returns home to Macomb Ga. from liberal New York twenty year after the events in 'Mockingbird.' Is it her first visit?<br/>She is greatly disillusioned by a perceived change in her father's attitude toward an integrated society. There is lots of family background going back to the founding of Macomb, Ga. It's hard to believe that 'Watchman' was written first as this one emerges from the context of the Civil Rights movement, whereas 'Mockingbird' predates it.<br/><br/>The book is an exposition of sociology containing great character analysis as well as<br/>morays and attitudes. Lee is very good at setting mood, especially with a sense of foreboding at the end of each chapter that makes a plot unnecessary. There are two false starts on plot. A traffic death manslaughter looks like the start of another equal rights under law trial as done in 'Mockingboard,' but it's dropped. Lee is anything but a formula writer cranking out cheap mysteries. Another false start is evocation of interest in how Jem died<br/><br/>Besides the watchman metaphor, she coins interesting terms like Asquithian, which must mean doing things with regret; one more allusion to Southern ambivalence. Without naming the case, she cites a Supreme Court activist decision that must be 'Brown v. Board of Education. It evokes fears of being overrun in schools and churches. We can gather that Lee applauds the equality provisions but regrets dismissal of the Tenth Amendment. Except for this singe allusion, the book is not about the civil rights movement. There is nothing about real events. Selma or MLK are never mentioned.<br/><br/>The common law concept of property rights appears to be extinct. Contempt for “white trash” appears greater than that for Negroes. There is reference to eugenics without any accusations. Historical references include Bishop Colenso advocacy of African causes. Literature includes Shakespeare's Childe Roland as embellished by Robert Browning. There's a lot to be learned about the writing of literature.<br/><br/>Southern attitude is billed as a holding action against equality rather than any hatred although I don't quite credit membership in the KKK as a political expedient. Was Atticus a member during the 'Mockingbird' era? The reader can share Scout's disappointment as we learn of a dark undercurrent underlying 'Mockingbird.' A point of credibility is the consideration that equality and reverence for law are not the same thing. The Atticus of 'Mockingbird' could have exhibited one while hiding the other. Or perhaps 'Watchman' is the reality version of the 'Mockingbird' fantasy.<br/><br/>One rather obvious allusion in the the novel is the fact that J-L turns out to be color blind. NAACP lawyers are referred to as like buzzards. The racial ambivalence of Atticus is somewhat suspect as it's explained by others more than himself. The significant change in Atticus is the surprising loss of his attitude of equality, and the question of whether he really had it. It's the main cause of disillusionment in his daughter. The book suggests that the rule of law is disappearing across the USA.<br/>Lee suggests that many in the South share J-L's attitudes. Atticus expresses the fear that Negroes, voting as a bloc, will outvote whites to hold all local offices.<br/><br/>Some of the reactions of Scout and her uncle, Dr. Finch seem overdrawn but Lee is in charge of her novel. Throughout the novel she searches for literary allusions to make her point. The ambivalent ending of the family relationship brings to mind Shakespeare's line (Sonnet 87) “Farewell ! thou art too dear for my possessing.”<br/><br/>The book illustrates Jeffersonian ambivalence in both racial attitudes and family relationships. It tends to renew my faith in modern literature after so much mindless fluff that makes the best seller list. Half way between the modernism of 'Ulysses' and the realism of 'Les Miserables,' this is the most interesting exposition of Southern sociological attitudes that I've read.
The most thought-provoking statement in this passionate, yet immature novel comes from Uncle Jack Finch: "Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, both begin where reason leaves off."<br/><br/>As a former English teacher who taught "To Kill a Mockingbird" to sophomores for more than 20 years, I was thoroughly prepared to hate "Go Set a Watchman." And as the first 100 pages wandered around, my impatience was growing. Yes, I chuckled at the reminiscences of Scout snd Jem and Dill playing preacher in Miss Rachel's back yard. There at least I found some resemblance to the book I loved. But then Harper Lee got to the heart of the matter of THIS book -- how do you claim your OWN moral compass and not one that is based on someone else's beliefs? Jean Louise must leave Scout behind and find her own way through the morass which is the racial and cultural history of her beloved Maycomb, Alabama. "Go Set a Watchman" is not Atticus Finch's story; it is Scout's, through and through.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman," although not terribly well-focused and clearly a first draft, shows some compelling and provocative insight into the kinds of societal problems we continue to face all over American today. "To Kill a Mockingbird" remains a near-perfect novel to make readers think about childhood, family, prejudice and righting wrongs. Pausing with Scout on Boo Radley's porch and understanding life by standing in his shoes for a while will continue to be a seminal moment in literature. "Go Set a Watchman" does not change that. What it does offer, however, is some insight into "the rest of the story" that cannot be ignored as life goes on in this complex American world of diversity and racial interaction. It is worth a read and a solid discussion.
I tried my best to avoid the hyped up commentary when this novel was released. Unfortunately, the “racist” term flooded the airways before I could turn the dial; so I was keen to keep an open mind, and I did until I read the book myself.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully written novel. Harper Lee again delivers, but not in the expected fashion by many. This juxtaposition to Mockingbird is profound. The message is much different, and it is true that this novel had to come second to the first novels release.<br/><br/>This book deals with what those of us in the South know to be true during that time because we lived it. In today’s standards its key points can be seen as outdated in thinking, thus the race question. But the fact is that no matter how many times people want to rewrite history, the truth remains.<br/><br/>I suggest readers make up their own minds about Atticus’s intentions and the messages in this book. But you first must educate yourself in the period and the history to understand it. While pertinent character involvement in segregationist meetings are discussed in length by reviewers, the fact is that Harper Lee wrote that for a reason. It might not be politically correct today or pleasing to read, but it shows the slow progression of the period. And even then, she wrote it in context that speaks volumes of why she did not publish at that time.<br/><br/>Before you can judge a person, you have to walk in his shoes, Atticus said in Mockingbird. We read that the beloved character attended these distasteful meetings, but we also know his words and actions from before in Mockingbird and in Watchman. Many “whites” fought behind the scenes to improve conditions for black folks. But it had to be done within cultural boundaries. That is what Lee is showing and leaving open to interpretation. Of course she knew that the subject was incendiary. And that is her genius—not to tell the audience everything, but to allow them to make up their own mind which endures in today’s society as prevalent subject matter.<br/><br/>In the modern mind, that is what is racist—that it was not called out and settled immediately. But those who were not there do not understand how dangerous it was for even a “white” person to speak out.  Look up the civil rights murders in Neshoba County, Mississippi 1964. Many whites and blacks worked slowly behind the scenes for change. Whether right or wrong is not the question—survival is. How much courage would you have had? That is the theme—courage; and just how far you would go to move along justice.
“Go Set a Watchman”, by Harper Lee<br/>Book Discussion Questions created 8-20-2015 by Vicki Ruthe Hahn<br/>1) In 1957, Harper Lee’s publisher told her to set aside her decidedly “first book”, “Go Set a Watchman”, and write a book based on Scout as a child - which became her second acclaimed 1960 classic “To Kill a Mockingbird”.  How did she evolve as an author by editing from one book to the next?<br/>2) Because Lee never (seemed) to have written another book, there is controversy that her childhood friend Truman Capote actually wrote or heavily edited the book “To Kill a Mockingbird”.  What do you think?<br/>3) Does the writing in this novel show the same wisdom, humanity, passion, love of anecdote, humor, importance, and easy rhythms of “To Kill a Mockingbird”?  Does it meet your expectations of a Harper Lee “first novel”, or does the perfection of “To Kill a Mockingbird”? make it too disappointing to enjoy “Go Set a Watchman”?<br/>4) After “Mockingbird”, Lee worked on an unfinished follow-up novel, “The Long Goodbye”.  Was "Watchman" only the first draft of "Mockingbird", or was it a separate novel / part of a series?<br/>5) Lee downplayed autobiographical parallels in her book(s).  Truman Capote/Dill wrote a novel with a character modeled on Lee, and the town character “Boo Radley” (whom he deleted.)  Capote says that Lee wrote about the same true things but he “transfer(s) it into some Gothic dream, done in an entirely different way."  How does the shared character of Maycomb, Alabama (or any experiences) get transposed by the creative efforts of various artists?<br/>6) Do you think that Harper Lee, 88, was demented and talked into publishing “Watchman” after 55 years of never wanting to publish again; or "happy as hell" with the publication?<br/>7) What new insights do you get about racial attitudes in the South in the 1950s and Harper Lee?  Does this book add depth, context, and new meaning to her classic second book?  Or had Lee “said what I wanted to say (in “Mockingbird”), and I will not say it again.”<br/>8) What was the flow of the book’s pacing?  Did Scout’s childhood antidotes add to your understanding of the story and characters?  Were too many ideas crammed into the ending?  Were the transitions choppy?<br/>9) Is there a plot to the story?  Does the book keep your interest?<br/>10) Why is childhood friend Henry/Hank left out of Lee’s second book “To Kill a Mockingbird”?  Why did childhood friend “Dill” take more of a central role in “Mockingbird” and was in “Watchman” as well?  What purposes do each of the characters play in advancing the story?<br/>11) How did the childhood play and experiences of Jem, Dill, and Scout differ between the two books?  What did it add to the stories?<br/>12) Scout’s pre-teen misunderstanding of sex, and attempted suicide, was dark and reminiscent of the Halloween attempt on her life in “To Kill a Mockingbird”.  How did the scenes compare?<br/>13) Henry/Hank was introduced as a friend and teen/adult romantic interest.  How did his relationship with Scout/Jean Louise affect the flow of the story?<br/>14) Jem was the “big brother”, both teasing and supportive of Scout/Jean Louis.  Which of his actions showed his love for her; especially after her attempted suicide, during the Brother/Sister School Dance, and the “falsies fling” aftermath?<br/>15) Jem and Henry/Hank worked in tandem with Atticus to successfully solve the “falsies fling” dilemma with the Principal.  What did that show you about them as individuals, and about their relationship?<br/>16) How would brother Jem have interacted with Scout and Henry/Hank as an adult, if Lee had him let him stay alive?<br/>17) Calpurnia and Aunt Zandra, in turn, acted as “Mom” to Scout/jean Louise.  How did their interactions with her differ, and how did they help form her as a person?  What would have been different if Atticus would have remarried and a “gentile” stepmother taught Scout how to fit into her Maycomb Southern society?<br/>18) Were the snippets of ideas/disjointed conversations at Aunt Zandra’s Maycomb “morning coffee” effective in helping you understand the attitudes and actions of Maycomb women?  What did you think of Lee using that approach?<br/>19) What were the different attitudes to life and race as portrayed in the small-town South and Jean Louise/Lee’s new home New York City?<br/>20) Where did the book’s title “Go Set a Watchman” come from, and how does it reflect in the consciences of the characters? Was Atticus Finch the moral compass ("watchman") of Maycomb?  Was Jean Louise the moral compass?<br/>21) How could Harper Lee have improved the development of her characters in this book?  Do you think that Scout has grown up to be a preachy bore; or the same funny, ornery, rule breaking, exasperating, captivating person that she was as a child?<br/>22) Did Atticus and Calpurnia turn out acting the way that you expected from reading “To Kill a Mockingbird”?<br/>23) Do the repeated references to “mad as hatter Finches” reflect on the way Jean Louise’s relatives related to her and to life?<br/>24) How did the introduction of Aunt Zandra and Uncle Jack to this novel affect the story?<br/>25) Jean Louise says that Uncle Jack is the only person who can paraphrase three authors in the same sentence and have it make sense. Did you think his many quotes from authors and historic references added to his character or become tedious?  Did it help you to understand the issues?<br/>26) Why does the Finches’ old maid Calpurnia show racial prejudice to Jean Louise when her grandson is charged with murder?  How does that reflect the changing attitudes between Black and white races in the 1950s?<br/>27) What were the reasons for the racial attitude changes in the 1950s (and 60s)?  Did the NAACP cause more problems than it solved in the South?  If Lee wrote a novel reflecting the racial attitudes in the United States today, what would she write?<br/>28) Are both of Lee’s books “evocative of another era, and relevant to our own times”?<br/>29) What were Atticus’s, and others, concerns about (majority) Southern Blacks gaining local Government control? What kind of mayor would Calpurnica’s son Zeebo make?<br/>30) Atticus Finch, age 70, was born about a decade after Reconstruction to a family of Southern gentry.  How do his prejudiced attitudes relate to his seemingly unprejudiced actions and the way he brought up his children?<br/>31) Henry/Hank, a young man, is also prejudiced.  How does his attitude toward fitting into Maycomb society differ from Jean Louise’s attitude towards her hometown? Why?<br/>32) Aunt Zandra and Uncle Jack had different reasons for saying that Henry was not of Jean Louise’s “kind” - “Love whom you will, marry your own kind”.  Why would Henry/Hank be the right one, or the wrong one, for her to marry?<br/>33) From the Court balcony, Scout viewed her lawyer father defending a black man.  As adult Jean Louise, she was dismayed to observe his actions in a Citizen’s Council from the same place.  Why are those scenes significant?<br/>34) Scout idolized her father to the point that Uncle Jack and Atticus “wondered when her conscience and his would part company, and over what.”  How did her emotional unrest about Atticus’s prejudices become “bearable” once she became her “own person”?<br/>35)  Jean Louise refers to her father as “her old enemy”, whom she can never win an argument with. How will her relationship with her father change after she realistically  “met her father”?<br/>36) What did Uncle Jack mean by saying that Jean Louise was, “an ordinary turnip-sized bigot”?<br/>37) Uncle Jack says that Maycomb and the South are full of people like Jean Louise, but that more are needed with a “certain kind of maturity”.  Would Jean Louise come back home to live, even though she says that she “can’t live in a place that I don’t agree with and doesn’t agree with me”.  Has she lost her home forever?<br/>38) Lee describes people’s differing attitudes as being balanced, “like an airplane, they’re the drag and we are the thrust – both are needed to fly”.  What did she mean by this, and how does this apply to other situations?<br/>39) Lee says “that faith and prejudice start at end of reason”.  What does she mean?<br/>40) In the book, Jean Louise thinks many thoughts, ditties, and sayings - intermixed with conversations.  Were you able to tell the difference?  How could have Lee make this work more smoothly?<br/>41) The book is written in third person from the perspective of mostly Scout/Jean Louise, but also from the perspective of the other characters.  How does this affect the story?
Great
Go Set a Watchman, a sequel of sorts to Harper Lee’s classic To Kill a Mockingbird, has stirred up quite a bit of controversy. Putting aside the strange and shady circumstances surrounding the book’s publication, a lot of people were upset that the Atticus Finch - the moral idol of Mockingbird - is depicted as a racist in Watchman. Some fans of the original book are saying that they absolutely will not read Watchman because of how it ruins the character of Atticus Finch. In my opinion, those are the people who absolutely should read Watchman more than anyone else.<br/><br/>Having read Watchman, I can assure you that the title of “Great American Author” can still be applied to Lee. In Watchman you are brought into the world of Jean Louise Finch (AKA Scout) as an adult, returning to her small southern town in the 1950s to visit her ailing father, Atticus Finch. Much to her dismay, she finds that the civil rights movement has affected her town, bringing out the worst in its citizens, including Atticus.<br/><br/>The thrust of the book involves Scout coming to terms with Atticus’s racial attitudes. Much like all the readers who love To Kill a Mockingbird, Scout remembers Atticus as a mouthpiece for equality. Scout must realize the dangers of having a moral idol and learn to be her own moral guide. Call it a coming-of-age story.<br/><br/>Certainly there’s some criticisms to make -- It could use a bit more action, a bit more excitement. It also meanders quite a bit, giving a lot of time to flashbacks. But for a book that was never intended for publication, it’s still much better than many of the best-sellers I’ve read. I heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoyed Mockingbird. I’m fairly certain that most will enjoy Go Set a Watchman too.
This book has an important twist that reveals to the reader an unexpected insight.  If you have not read it you may not want to read this review further, so as to discover the insight yourself. We have all heard that readers of To Kill a Mockingbird are disappointed that Atticus is revealed as a racist. While it is true that he did attend one Klan meeting it was to see who was behind the robes. It is also true that he is a member of a group, Citizen's Counsel, that had a racist guest speaker one evening that Jean Louise surreptitiously watched. After seeing her father and her boyhood friend and sometimes love interest, Henry, associated with the group and the racist speaker, Jean Louise calls her father names and tells Henry she can't love him. She then declares that she is going back to NYC, where she has been living for some time, after only a week visiting as she is appalled and disappointed. Her uncle Jack, a retired doctor and someone whom she respects, confronts her, calls her a bigot and says that Atticus is not one. She is surprised and appalled at this, as well as I reading it, and she grabs a dictionary to check the definition of bigot. She reads that it is "One obstinately or intolerably devoted to his own church, party, belief, or opinion." She asks him to explain. He says: "I was just tryin' to answer your running question.  Let me elaborate a little on that definition.  What does a bigot do when he meets someone who challenges his opinions? He stays rigid. Doesn't even try to listen, just lashes out. Now you were turned inside out by the granddaddy of all father things, so you ran.  And how you ran. .... [You] ... heard some pretty offensive talk.... [and] said, in effect, 'I don't like the way these people do, so I have no time for them.' You'd better take time for 'em, honey, otherwise you'll never grow.  You'll be the same at sixty as you are now... [y]ou have a tendency not to give anybody elbow room in your mind for their ideas, no matter how silly you think they are."  Harper Lee has pointed the finger, not at the "racist" Atticus, but rather at the liberal progressive Jean Louise for being close minded and yes, bigoted. Harper Lee was prophetic as to the current level of political discourse. It has been my observation that conservatives/Republicans believe it is a civic duty to discuss politics whereas this is not so with many liberal progressives/Democrats, because well, they know better. They are bigots. Instead of debating an issue, liberals, in my experience, will demonize, name call and then shut off conversation effectively running away, by saying things like "Well I have my worldview. I don't need any more information or facts." So in this sense, this book is more important, more profound than To Kill a Mockingbird. It addresses an important element of personal growth as well as the political health, maturity and growth of Americans as a Nation.<br/><br/>GSAW is not as poetic or as solid a piece of storytelling as TKAM. It is my understanding that TKAM was heavily edited by the publisher and reworked by Harper Lee numerous times, which I think explains the difference. Nevertheless, this book is a great American classic.
This wants to be a book about maturing and developing a conscience of your own (a “watchman”).  I suspect it’s an uphill battle for many readers.  Scout of To Kill a Mockingbird has to come to terms with the fact that her conscience as a child, her father, Atticus Finch, fails her as an adult, and she must rely upon and bring her own conscience to maturity and independence.<br/><br/>I’m going to skip past all the controversy about the authorship of the book, whether Harper Lee really intended to publish the book and what its true relationship to To Kill a Mockingbird is, because the book is here in front of us — let’s see if it stands on its own.<br/><br/>It’s not a perfect book by any means.  Starting around page 100, it is driven by speeches and arguments.  The first 100 pages are familiar Harper Lee from To Kill a Mockingbird — a story told through characters, decisions, and actions.  After the first 100 pages, not so much.<br/><br/>The plot has Scout, now grown up as Jean Louise Finch, returning to Maycomb, Alabama, to visit her hometown and her now aged father, Atticus.  Her brother Jem has died years ago.  Hank, her long time suitor, meets her at the train station and resumes his aims to marry Jean Louise, and have her settle with him back in Maycomb.<br/><br/>Jean Louise is tempted by life back home, and by Hank, until she witnesses, from a similar vantage point from which she and Jem witnessed their father’s moral triumph in To Kill a Mockingbird, her father and Hank participating in a “citizen’s council” meeting, aimed at curbing the influence of the NAACP and suppressing the progress of blacks in the south.  Jean Louise is shocked and undergoes a full-on crisis of conscience, lashing out to tell Hank she could never marry him and to reject her father as morally weak and hypocritical.<br/><br/>The remainder of the story has Jean Louise coming to terms with this new perspective on her father, and on Maycomb, with the wise guidance of her Uncle Jack (Dr. Finch).  This is where the speeches and arguments begin.<br/><br/>Rather than give away what happens, I’ll only say it’s complicated, as complicated as white attitudes towards blacks in the south have always been.  There is no excusing Atticus’ attempt at nuance in explaining himself to Jean Louise — he is not the enlightened man of principle she (or we) took him to be, although there is an argument, not altogether successful in my view, that he is still a man of justice.<br/><br/>It’s exactly that disillusionment with her father that pushes Jean Louise forward in setting her own stake of conscience (aided again by her Uncle Jack).  That disillusionment and maturity of conscience looks to be what the book would like to be about.  It’s just difficult, given how we, the readers as well as the younger Scout, placed the Atticus of the earlier book on a pedestal, to get past the disillusionment per se and on to the maturity of conscience.<br/><br/>While we could call Atticus’s about-face a contradiction in characterization, I’d rather think of it as a flaw in his character, one that forces us, like Jean Louise, to come to terms with our own independence of conscience.  Doing so makes the story a provocative one, I think, forcing us to take our own moral conscience to greater depth.  It’s a little too easy to dismiss the book as betraying our image of Atticus Finch — that betrayal, after all, is the point.  Your conscience must be your own.
It’s a whole new world and it’s a scary place, but please don’t ignore it.<br/><br/>Confused by that statement? Go Set a Watchman is set twenty years after To Kill a Mockingbird and presents the world as a bit of scary, confusing place. But don’t let the perceived fear of the unknown keep you from reading this book.<br/><br/>I already know I’ll take some heat because I rated this book five stars. Many people disliked the book and claimed it needed editing. Yes, the book has some editing issues. That said, the author didn’t want the book edited – that’s the claim anyway. Yes, my inner editor had some issues on those few points. Yes, I found them. But while I had to reread a few places (less than five), I couldn’t put the book down.<br/><br/>I loved Atticus, Scout and Jem from To Kill a Mockingbird. This was a book that shaped my teenage years and the movie is part of my growing up. Atticus was the father figure I always wanted. I was afraid I’d dislike the book because I’d heard some pre-release buzz.<br/><br/>This is my take. Read the book. Read the book all the way to the end. Don’t give up part way through. Got that?<br/><br/>I’m serious. The payoff is worth it.<br/><br/>Scout is, but isn’t, the same little girl from the first book. She’s the same girl, but her views and opinions have changed because she’s lived in New York for a while. There she can be the bohemian of sorts woman, not tied down in marriage and not really caring what others think. Her free-spiritedness is refreshing.<br/><br/>But this story is a story of the times. In the 1950’s, there were pervasive problems with racism and sexism. What needs to be kept in mind while reading is that this book is truly a product of its era, but it’s also a learning curve and growth for Scout. Haven’t we all had a person in our lives whom we looked up to, then found out the person is human after all?<br/><br/>No spoilers, but this is Scout’s story. A lot of loose ends are tied up and sorted out. Scout comes into her own.<br/><br/>Yes, there are things in this book that might make some readers upset. Atticus turns out to not be the man on the pedestal like he was in Mockingbird, but as I’ve said before, read to the end. Everything will be explained and has a reason.<br/><br/>If you’re a little interested in or wondering about the book, pick it up. If nothing else, it may make you think. I sure did. I recommend Go Set a Watchman<br/><br/>originally posted at long and short reviews
This novel has been called a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee's second novel.  It is neither.  Perhaps it is the Genesis of what many consider the Great American Novel.<br/><br/>More than likely Go Set a Watchman is one of an unknown number of revisions arising from the partnership of fledgling writer Harper Lee and the extraordinary editor Tay Hohoff at Lippincott, the original publisher of TKAM.<br/><br/>The partnership worked diligently between 1955 and 1959 before this novel became TKAM.  Hohoff was a tough editor, demanding much of her young author, but recognizing her talent.  Charles Shields, in his unauthorized biography, "Mockingbird:  A Portrait of Harper Lee, related Ms. Lee at one point threw her manuscript from her apartment window.  She called Hohoff in tears to tell what she had done.  Hohoff ordered her protege to get outside and retrieve it.  Ms. Lee did.  In a snow storm.<br/><br/>By now most know the sensational headlines of early critical reviews of Go Set a Watchman.  The beloved American hero Atticus Finch was a racist and bigot.  That's why the critics of the stature of Michichko  Kakutani  of the NY Times<br/>get paid the big dollars.<br/><br/>But it's not that simple, though it may be good press.  The Scout of Mockingbird returns to Maycomb for a two week visit.  She is twenty-six, a resident of New York City.  Atticus is seventy-two, ravaged by rheumatoid arthritis.<br/><br/>Aunt Alex is in permanent residence to see after the house and worry over Atticus.  Calpurnia has been long retired.  Uncle Jack lives closeted in Victorian literature.  Dill is in Italy.  There is a new face among the familiar cast.  Henry is the young attorney who practices with Atticus, a role Atticus had hoped would be filled by Jem.  But as it is for all, life has not turned out as Atticus planned.<br/><br/>Everyone expects Jean Louise and Henry will marry.  Even our grown up Scout begins to accept the possibility.<br/><br/>However, the South is being changed.  There is a pillar of fire moving over the land.  It is the Civil Rights Movement.  And the White South is resistant, reluctant, and resolute in preserving its power.  In Maycomb County blacks outnumber whites.  United States Supreme Court Decisions will permanently alter the legal landscape of the South.<br/><br/>The conflict in Go Set a Watchman arises from Jean Louise's revulsion when she learns both Atticus and fiance Henry are members of Maycomb's Citizens' League.  As Uncle Jack tells her, it is difficult to recognize one's Gods are human.<br/><br/>If you can imagine Mockingbird without Boo Radley, Tom Robinson, Mrs. Dubose, or Miss Maudie, this would be that book.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a villain like Robert E. Lee Ewell, he's not in this book either.  Nor is he replaced as villain by Atticus Finch.<br/><br/>Atticus, as portrayed in this novel, represented the views of many Southerners.  And, if I may add, many outside the South.<br/><br/> This week marked the Fiftieth Anniversary of the passage of the Voting Rights Act.  The impact of that piece of legislation will far outlast this novel.  So will To Kill a Mockingbird.  For that novel, more complete, less sarcastic, and cynical, offered the hope of those who would seek to do the right thing.<br/><br/>There are those who say that Mockingbird has outgrown its usefulness.  That it is unrealistic, paternalistic, and overly sentimental.  That Atticus Finch is too good to be true.<br/><br/>I have known more than one real life Atticus Finch.  They exist.  They are easy to spot.  Many lawyers aspire to be Atticus.  Those who only aspire are even easier to find.<br/><br/>So.  Three Stars.  Yes, Mrs. Hohoff knew a winner when she saw one.  She helped Ms. Lee polish rough carbon into a perfect diamond.  Go Set a Watchman was the raw carbon.
How fitting that To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer, was a bestseller, and is beloved by so much of white America. Like a child, we love a white hero in a story about racism.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is the sequel or part two of truly "the great American novel." It is the story of Scout grown up. The United States—or white U.S.—in 1960, when to Kill a Mockingbird was published, was only capable of understanding the child's point of view. Now Harper Lee asks us to grow up as she did when she first wrote of her shock at finding that her people were not entirely the good people she'd understood them to be.  Or rather, that they were good people with this fatal flaw of wanting to keep the Negro down, slow, without true equity or equal rights to representation. She presents two-faced, double-talk Southern manners and allows Atticus to explain the thinking of white gentry in the south. They cling to their power through the tenth amendment while ignoring the discrimination prohibited in the thirteenth (involuntary servitude), fourteenth (are citizens; abridge the privileges), and fifteenth (right to vote).<br/><br/>We all loved To Kill a Mockingbird but forget that Tom Robinson did not receive justice. Harper Lee wrote a reality that remains today. You can be innocent and sentenced to die on the flimsiest or complete lack of evidence if you are Black in America.<br/><br/>The book she wrote first, Go Set a Watchman, was too hot for 1960 America. Her publisher asked her to write the child's point of view instead. A suggestion that likely made sales of the book a big success. Too much of white America was still in its childhood—including many of the "good, white liberals" of the north. Now we get the rest of the story and the impetus for writing: What Harper Lee saw as a young woman growing up in the 1950s in the south. She lived through 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education and recognized the hypocrisy of the reaction of much of white America.<br/><br/>I had already ordered the book when pre-release reviews started coming out with notes about how people wouldn't recognize this Atticus. But he is the same Atticus, and that is the point. "It's always easy to look back and see what we were…It is hard to see what we are" [p. 269]. Harper Lee wrote the truth and waited until we were ready for it. God Bless Her. The only thing that could make it better would be if she willed the proceeds of this book to the NAACP or BlackLivesMatter.<br/><br/>In the end, the book also explains why Harper Lee returned to Monroeville and stayed.
If you haven't read Mockingbird recently, I would highly-highly recommend revisiting it before going into this book. Although it was written before Mockingbird, Watchman seems to expect that the reader is already familiar with the trial of Tom Robinson and the endless wisdom of Atticus Finch.<br/><br/>In this book, Scout returns to Maycomb County at the height of racial tensions during the end of segregation. Scout, having learned sensitivity to the African American experience largely from her father, is horrified to discover that Atticus and her boyfriend are attending a community outreach where racists spout disgusting opinions. It is later revealed that her eavesdropping of the community outreach is not exactly as it seems, but Scout must still battle with the realization that her God-like reverence for Atticus is diminished by differing views on race.<br/><br/>Knowing that this book was written first, it's astounding to me how superb it is in terms of a 'sequel'. It seems to already know how decades of readers have reacted to Mockingbird even without referencing any events in significant detail. Tom Robinson and the rape trial is alluded to with extreme brevity (only a few sentences, really) and yet that experience is crucial to understanding how Scout is the way she is.<br/><br/>Although unedited, the prose is gorgeous and a delight to read. It has a more modern feel, which makes sense since the story takes place several years after Mockingbird. It's also shockingly timeless and relatable to many recent supreme court decisions<br/><br/>OVERALL: A flawless extension of To Kill a Mockingbird. I had low expectations coming into this book and was horrified at the possibility that it could 'kill' the classic novel. It doesn't cause a dent, and, in fact, adds substantial context and breadth to some of literature's most iconic characters. Harper Lee would be crazy to NOT want this published.
There are many mixed reviews about this book out there and I'm just going to express my thoughts on what I thought about the book. For those who haven't read it, Go Set A Watchman follows Jean Louise (Scout) in her mid 20's and returns home to see her father, Atticus Finch who is now in his 70s. In their home (he sold the other home which is now an Ice Cream shop) is Atticus and his sister Alexandra who annoys Jean Louise (according to her) at every opportunity. You have to remember this is the South and back in the day so her aunt's perceptive is, you must wear skirts, act in proper manner, don't talk back, don't give anyone a certain look, the family has a reputation, don't do this or that.<br/><br/>Jean Louise I feel, has not changed in character. She's still that rough, challenging, sarcastic girl who easily gets annoyed and wants to argue about everything (in To Kill A Mockingbird, her fist would go up pretty quickly). While home she eventually discovers that her father along with Henry, her boyfriend/maybe one day fiance, are racist.<br/><br/>The book in all honesty was slow to begin with. It centered more on Jean Louise and her relationship with her boyfriend and her constant bickering with her aunt. It really didn't pick up until her discovery and from there that was basically the rest of the book. If this was a movie, Jean Louise's character  should win an award for just the amount of emotion she displayed while talking to her father, a now fallen hero in her eyes. She felt robbed of a childhood with the discovery of her father's thoughts on African Americans.  She saw everyone as equal, she admired Atticus, a brave man who once defended an innocent black man when no one else would, she loved their housekeeper Calpurnia who her father never hesitated to help out when needed yet here he was talking about the white race being superior and blacks shouldn't have the same equal opportunities. Racism is always a touchy subject and still exist, which is evident with all the events currently happening today but I won't get into that in my review. I will say it definitely makes you see Atticus differently and thankful that To Kill A Mockingbird was released first.
One understands Maycomb and its families in Mockingbird.  There are positive and negative characters, the clear right and wrong of youth with most everything seeming in clear focus, even when later seen refocused.  Boo Radley is a Monster, but becomes a kind protector in transformation.  Atticus is respected, vigilant for the letter of the Law and perhaps, eventually though surprisingly, the best shot in the county.  In any case he is the heroic ideal of Scout come true.  The town is small America with the twist of Justice turned on its tail.  Atticus has won a decision for an African-American man in our minds and likely in that of the town, if not in its rendered judgement.  It is, in this sense a tarnished ideal, but yet an ideal.<br/>Twenty years have passed and the world of Scout has become that of Jean-Louise.  It is a world splintered between perspectives.  The Scout vision of the past competes in Jean-Louise's mind with her fifties cosmopolitan vision of a backwater town with tired manners and passé ideas.  What she is not prepared for is the fracturing of her ideal of the people there and her own understanding of them.  Even only four years after her trip there for a family funeral, she finds the gentle Southern ways and the easy-going White dominance replaced by White-Black hostility, this of a suppressed form with mutual suspicion and self-imposed segregation.  Scout's idealistic Atticus has become Jean-Louise's enfeebled and compromised elder Atticus.  He is perhaps the same, but has become more multi-faceted and more dependent.<br/>To avoid too much of the plot, the viewpoint migrates in this work, unlike Mockingbird, this between her youthful ideals, her modern cosmopolitan fifties views, those of just 4 years ago and those of the customary Maycomb White community.  Mixed in a bit later is a complex view of the whole by her uncle, though distorted as much as an abstract painting by his philosophical bents on it and a hint of an African-American perspective by the family of Calpurnia, her former cook and housekeeper.<br/>Given all of this, the novel makes little sense without reference to is latter precursor.<br/>Additionally, the work is, as is, quite fragmented in view and unclear without reference to Mockingbird.<br/>Finally, for publication in 1957, or even in 1962 or 1969, this work was much too raw to be acceptable.  Jean-Louise had views that could not be seen as acceptable to large segments of the reading public.  Neither her contempt for the ways of Maycomb and the greater South, nor the independence shown in her revolt against this would have been seen as proper.<br/>All of this stated, the work starts and develops in well-crafted manner with dialectical elements presented in the first half in small skirmishes between Jean-Louise and various opponents (Hank, Aunt Alexandra or others) in each of the chapters.  The few flashbacks are a welcome period of quietude, if not without embarrassment, only marred when they turn up unannounced.  The problem with the work is the final conflict and its resolution.  The conflict made as starkly antagonistic as it is can hardly be imagined to find any workable rapprochement.  The supposed resolution here rings hollow and seems inappropriate.  A more fractured family outcome is the expected and logical conclusion and a somewhat more nuanced conflict might have been seen as the workable set-place for the conclusion penned in this work.<br/>This novel undoubtedly, while less than perfect, is a very worthwhile read.<br/>The attempt here is for something ever more complex than Mockingbird with ever more competing viewpoints and with more issues at hand.  Mockingbird is a gem, though a much less complex one.<br/>If this work had been readdressed and not placed in a 'back-shelf position', I have no doubt that its kinks would have been worked out.<br/>The Maycomb of Mockingbird deserves a sequel.  This work while unfinished of form, if not of plot is the best we will get.
From my reading of information about Harper Lee over the decades and from recent internet research I have done, I have come to some conclusions about the stories behind Lee's writing of both To Kill a Mockingbird (TKAM) and Go Set a Watchman (Watchman).<br/><br/>Admittedly my synopsis indirectly includes my opinions, but they are ones that I have tried to keep objective by gathering information over the years, discerning fact from fiction, reading between the lines, and intuiting.<br/><br/>How Go Set a Watchman and To Kill a Mockingbird Came To Be<br/><br/>Harper Lee's full name is Nelle Harper Lee.  Some have posited that she chose to not use Nelle in her author name because she did not want readers to know she was female.  According to Lee that was not her purpose.  She, in fact, feared that if she used Nelle, readers would pronounce her name Nellie, a name she did not like.<br/><br/>Lee went to university to study law but left after her third year because she wanted to pursue writing.  She moved to NY, worked  at airline reservation desks by day and wrote in her spare time.<br/><br/>A Christmas gift from friends in 1956 changed her life.  It was money they pooled together to enable her to support herself while writing full time.  This is how she was able to write Go Set a Watchman.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman was a large manuscript of somewhat disjointed narratives.  It was a first draft.  It is this first draft which is  "only lightly copy-edited" [The New York Times, Jonathan Mahler, July 12, 2015] that has recently been published.  (If/when you read Watchman, I think you will ponder as I did how it could have become TAKM.)<br/><br/>Her publishers thought Watchman had merit and would improve if she would have written it in the first person through the eyes of Scout as a child (age 6).  She had originally written it in the third person with Jean Louise (i.e. Scout) at age 26.<br/><br/>Watchman is about Jean Louise's disillusionment with Atticus' racist views, yet TAKM is about a father with integrity and moral courage.  How did a tale of disillusionment of one's father's beliefs become a tale of his integrity?<br/><br/>Lee was a first time author with no experience at rewriting.  She was probably unsure of herself and leaned on her editor's advice.  She did say, "I was a first-time writer, so I did as I was told.”<br/><br/>Tay Hohoff was the editor who helped considerably in the rewriting of Lee's original manuscript.  It took a couple of years in which she helped Lee eliminate much of the extraneous material.  More importantly, she greatly influenced the change in the tone of the narrative.  Ms. Hohoff was a Quaker.  While helping Lee rewrite, Hohoff was also writing a biography of John Lovejoy Elliot who was a social activist.  Given Ms. Hohoff's Quaker background and being immersed in writing this biography may have consciously or unconscientiously swayed Ms. Hohoff to sway Lee to change Atticus' character.<br/><br/>I intuit that there were two reasons why Harper Lee never published again.  One reason she admits to:  She did not like the limelight.  I think the other reason is because she felt inadequate to write another novel because she realized that the rewrite was mainly the effort of her editor, Tay Hohoff.  After all, the final version of her original took a 180 degree turn changing Atticus from a bigot to a non-prejudiced man of integrity!
....something that we already have known through 'To Kill A Mockingbird'. However, the last twenty percent of the read makes it up for all that is missing in the first parts of the book: Flat characters. Redundant situations.  The Theme. And, A Watchman.<br/><br/>The book is truly about a portrayal of a little girl, who is now grown up and independently living in New York. Jean Louise worships Atticus, her father. In her world Atticus is a perfect man, and infallible. When he falls from her altar, she is devastated. She feels homeless and out of that helplessness the book becomes interesting only at the end and just when you think it's interesting, it ends<br/>Since human mind longs and seeks perfection, and when one finds it, even when it's in a fiction, as Atticus in TKMB, we love it. We don't want to let it go. In this book Atticus is more human. Atticus is ready with justifications to defend his way of thinking. But, Scout too is not ready to listen and change. She is full of her conviction.<br/><br/>I learned from this book the Thomas Jeffersonian views of democracy: Voting is a privilege and it is not to be given lightly or taken lightly. Man must understand it and then earn it. It's not a birth right. Man can't vote just because he is a man. It's so true, if we gave a test to all the voters only handful of people will be able to vote. 'Vote Banks' won't be an issue then.<br/><br/>If each one of us set a Watchman,  as Uncle Jack says to Jean Louise, even the racial problem wouldn't be solved. He tells her there is only personal conscience, there isn't a universal conscience. What we see in this book is that one race is deprived, stripped off their right to happiness, even human dignity. Even Hope. If everyone's watchman is alive one race would help deprived race to nurture their hope to pursue life with human dignity. Tragedy is, men shouldn't have to set a watchman to observe this common human goal since good conscience is natural to human existence. When one race claim to be superior and obliterate other, their loss ultimately is greater.
Once again we are treated to a tale as only Harper Lee can tell it. The basic personality of Scout, as an adult, hasn't changed much. I have only read about a third of the book, but I know I can recommend it if only on the basis of it being pure Harper Lee. Filled with the quirkiness of the Southern life style and characters of  that time, there are still childhood flashback scenes with Scout, Jem and Dill that weren't included in To Kill a Mockingbird. There is much controversy regarding the publication of this book, but controversy aside, Harper Lee herself approved the decision to publish it. She made a statement to the affect that if people would enjoy it, then of course it should be published. Good decision. It would have been a shame for us to have missed out the chance to read another great novel from this iconic author. No worries Harper, people will definitely enjoy this book. The following is to address issues brought up by people who were disappointed in the book and giving it poor reviews: (SPOILER ALERT) I bought this book not because I wanted to read more Mockingbird, but because I wanted to read more Harper Lee. We loved Mockingbird because of the innocence we felt while experiencing dramatic incidents through a child's eyes, and ultimately taking away a message of hope from the book. But was that what we were supposed to come away with? Was that what Harper Lee intended? I doubt it. We all know Scout is Harper Lee. As she tells the tale of Mockingbird through Scout, there is an undertone of a child trying to understand life and the people and events in her world. That journey of understanding does not end with the last page of Mockingbird. All kids think their parents are infallible. As adults, they become aware of the fallibility and flaws that are in all of us. Atticus and Scout are no different. Did Lee intend to make an immortal hero of Atticus? Of course not. Remember, Mockingbird and Watchman were one book. If not for an editor telling Lee to separate the flashbacks from Watchman and make them into a separate book, both books would have been published as one unit and we would have seen Atticus as he truly was instead of what we thought he was. People are commenting that Atticus is suddenly a racist. It's not sudden, he always was. We just didn't know it because that part of the book was never released. Other comments are saying Scout seems different. Of course she is, she's an adult now. What did you expect? Both books are a reflection on the personal life experience of one woman; Harper Lee. She holds a mirror up to her life until her middle 20s and lets us see through her eyes. Because of the separation of the two books, Mockingbird left us with a social message still echoing today, and a hero in Atticus Finch. But that could not have been intentional on the part of Lee, as it was not her idea to separate the story in the first place. It's mentioned in several places that it took years of re-writes to turn Mockingbird from a series of anecdotes to the cohesive novel it is. The writing in Watchman, in my opinion, is as good as Mockingbird. It was not as heavily re-written as Mockingbird by the author, and so is ultimately closer to the message Lee wanted to send in the first place. I believe the reason her sister opposed the publishing of Watchman was likely because Lee, unprepared for the wild success of Mockingbird, had a hard time coping with her sudden fame and it caused her great distress. I believe it was for that reason more so than any objection to content of the book that made Lee's sister recommend not publishing it. So what happened here? Why is there so much controversy and criticism of this book and the decision to publish it? Because we found out our hero, Atticus, like most people has feet of clay. And we don't like it. We only thought we knew what Mockingbird was all about. Had the book been published as written in the first place, we would have known that. It was never about altruism, it was simply a story about the observations and experiences of a woman from a small Southern town at a certain point in time and how those experiences shaped her as a person. Editing, and we the readers, turned Mockingbird into more than was originally intended. Now we're disillusioned. Well, that's life. That's what Harper Lee was saying all along.
I was totally prepared to be disappointed, and instead I was pleasantly surprised.  If you are aware Go Set a Watchman was  written before To Kill a Mockingbird and you are prepared to judge it on its own merit and not compare it -- hard as it is -- to Harper Lee's most famous novel, then you can appreciate Go Set a Watchman as a glimpse into a writer honing her craft, and you can appreciate the importance of this novel for how it ads to our understanding of the deep South and the characters in Mockingbird.  It does take 76 pages to get to the theme of the novel.  It does start a bit slow, but the anecdotes are deceptively simple crucial elements of showing the narration. As an English teacher, I would love to teach this novel for its brilliant understanding of the social mindset and politics of the deep South.  Beware of criticism of Atticus. Those who have passed him off as an unapologetic racist are missing one of the main points of the book: an understanding of the deep and controversial feelings about states'  rights vs. federalism.  This novel is a guide to listening and understanding others' beliefs as much as it is a literary masterpiece.  Harper Lee's novel is important historically speaking, and it shows how those searing issues are still sizzling today.  I had a deeper respect for Atticus after this novel -- and for Harper Lee as a novel-- after reading Go Set A Watchman.  I do not agree with Atticus's beliefs or condone them, but I respect him for making readers realize there is no solution to problems if there is no dialogue.  This is a lesson about what bigotry is really about.  The message brought me to tears. Politics aside, there are social and personal messages that will resonate with readers.  Harper Lee really did have a second book in her.  Bravo!
“Any man in this world, any man who has a head and arms and legs, was born with hope in his heart. “<br/><br/>I had mixed feelings about reading this book. I had read all the hype on Ms. Lee perhaps being “tricked” into Okaying its publication and also the early reviews about Atticus Finch’s racist views, but decided to read it and decide for myself.<br/><br/>This is a painful book to read or listen to in my case, because we return to characters we came to idealize as perfect specimens of the human condition and find them to be human after all.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Jean Louise Finch (Scout) returning home to help her father, whose arthritis is getting the worst of him and to make a decision on if she should marry her childhood friend and good friend of her late brother Jem, Henry Clinton.  What she discovers is that while living away from Maycomb she has grown in her world views, the town she left behind has at its best stayed the same, at its worst gone back a few decades.<br/><br/>That is the basics of the plot, which is not much but the writing was superb. Harper Lee was able to put into words what people thought, how they talked and why they believed what they did without condoning it.<br/><br/>For those that hero-worshipped Atticus Finch, they like Jean Louise are in for a hard reckoning. The lesson may be that no one should be set upon a pedestal; that under the skin we are all human after all.<br/><br/>I listened to the audible version with Reese Witherspoon narrating. She took a bit for me to get used to, but by the end of the book, which was a daunting read, Ms. Witherspoon won me over.<br/><br/>I found the book perfect for the discussions we are having today in America. I hope you read it and discuss it until we all become like Jean Louise “color blind”.
Such a wonderful book. I'm glad it was released second, I truly appreciate being reunited with old friends.<br/>Every bit as enjoyable as Mockingbird, and just as insightful.
I was very impressed by Harper Lee's understanding of the southern mentality, and she made Scout the perfect character to challenge those beliefs that she had grown up with.
I found the book well written and quite fascinating.  Just don't compare it with "To Kill a Mockingbird", it is a very different view of race relations in the South.
Wonderful. Fun to read and so thought provoking. What a timely book to read now. I so thought times had changed more. I only wish everyone could be as wise as Atticus Finch.
This book and it's circumstances will be talked about and debated for years to come.  It has earned it's place in history and is a must read.  I'm so glad it was published.
You can see my star rating..that is all I will say. I don't want to ruin it for anyone. Suffice it to say....it wasn't what I was expecting and it has made me think deeply.
Not at all what you would expect from Harper Lee.
Compared to her other book, it was disappointing.
I'm not finished reading this but so far so good.
Make sure to re-read To kill a mockingbird first.
Boring and racist
Very disappointing. Doesn't have the heart of mocking bird.
I was disappointed in this novel.  It was by no means as captivating, entertaining, and enlightening as Mockingbird.  Perhaps a second reading will elevate it somewhat.
Was okay, but disappointing after her first book
This book was ok but I liked the first one more.
Good book, but definitely needed more developing
An interesting read but very predictable ending.
Read it all the way through before you decide. Awesome book. Now I think I will reread To Kill a Mockingbird. Though part of me wants to start this one all over again.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Any critism must be from people who had no idea of what life was like then.  I am only sorry there is not another HARPER LEE book to enjoy.
Thought provoking on so many levels. It is fortunate that Scout matured so slowly - her quarter century to our half.  I think we may be ready for her, again.
Wish I could say this is even almost as good as TKAM, but it ain't even close.  If Harper Lee did write this, it was a draft that was justly rejected by the publisher.  There are glimmers here and there of what would become her classic novel eventually, but the writing in this is nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>Several passages between Jean Louise and Uncle Jack are downright painful to get through, and thankfully didn't make it into TKAM.  Atticus is not the same man most of us grew to love and admire in TKAM, but perhaps a more truthful rendering of Southern sentiments of that time and place.  Even Jean Louise vociferously resents the Supreme Court's verdict on segregation as a violation of the tenth amendment, also a more truthful sentiment of that time and place.<br/><br/>The best part of this book, to me, is the chapter on the "Coffee" Aunt Alexandra hosts for Jean Louise with the women of Maycomb.  That is the only place you can see the genius of Harper Lee come roaring through.  It's a hoot, and almost makes it worth reading this otherwise poor attempt at a novel.<br/><br/>TKAM has been my favorite book since the first time I read it in high school, over fifty years ago, and have reread several times since.  This book will not ruin that for me, and I hope not for anyone who loves TKAM.  Watchman should be viewed for what it was, a failed attempt that Harper Lee was able to rework into one of the best and most loved novels of all time.  Interesting to see what it was knowing what it became.  A good lesson in never giving up!
Loved the characters and setting. Great read.
Worth th read, but not as good as Mockingbird
I loved this new look at Atticus and Scout  !
Excellent book.  I could not stop reading it!
So glad To Kill a Mockingbird came out first!
Having grown up in the south and still aware of folks with similar thoughts, it was a thought provoking and uncomfortable read. That said, it was excellent.
This book narrates a turbulent time in the mid-20th century and the way people made decisions and felt about things based on southern cultural values and perceptions. Her father's multi-perplexity is a pinnacle of conflict for the daughter who has tasted the waters of big city life and is now able to compare her socialization with the outside world.<br/><br/>The book is very well written and the writing style parallels “To Kill a Mockingbird,” but not the flow. I found Parts I and II dreary, boring and fatiguing. From page 85 on the book picked up to some extent but I felt at times as if I was watching the Hallmark Channel, which after viewing with my wife for a number of years has forced me to become segregated from television and its mind-numbing and wearing  offerings. Harper Lee is a brilliant writer who apparently wanted to author two books about one thing – her upbringing, her family, her community, her conflicts and her value system. Egocentric - yes, but also very cloistered. Harper Lee had a lot to offer the literary community and our turbulent culture but chose a withdrawing path instead. I am not critical of her for that but I am saddened because literature, movies, relationships, women’s issues, the  practice of law and even racism might have been very different and moved much more rapidly toward a healthier state of being. She could have been a dialogue producer that made the words tolerance, impartiality, and compromise more than a suggested alternative to abhorrence.
I anxiously anticipated reading this novel, so much so that I re-read To Kill a Mockingbird immediately beforehand. Frankly I didn't think Go Set a Watchman compared favorably either as a literary work or as a story. The controversy related to the transition Atticus from a civil rights champion to a segregationist (?) notwithstanding, the book just seemed like a draft instead of a finished work. Frankly if I hadn't read To Kill a Mockingbird and known the back story and the characteristics I would have rated Go Set a Watchman lower.
This book again reminded me that too some degree we are all bigots.  We are challenged to accept our failings and strive to live better for one another.
Excellent book.
Gives another view of the family making them more human. Also, shows the contradictions of the time. It shows the importance of appearances to others.
I was really disappointed in this work and found it hard to finish. After such a great first novel and so much anticipation, this was a downer for me.
I'm thinking if Harper Lee had written and published this book first, there would not be To Kill A Mockingbird because Watchman just isn't that good.
I live in Alabama, where "To Kill a Mockingbird" is celebrated on an ongoing basis. For many years here, there have been persistent rumors that Harper Lee had written another novel; and that it would be published following her death. With "Go Set a Watchman," it appears that her handlers have decided, "Why wait?"<br/><br/>At least Harper Lee is alive and able to oversee the publication of her "newly discovered" work. Or is she? Alas, Lee herself is 89 years old and barely able to sit up in bed, much less spearhead the publication of a novel. So there's no way to know whether this publication truly reflects her genuine intent.<br/><br/>Yes, the state of Alabama supposedly investigated and cleared a charge that Harper Lee has fallen victim to elder abuse. But please remember, dear reader, that our beloved state government officials are at times motivated by less than pure intentions. Alabama elected officials have been known to transfer residence straight from the Governor's Mansion to Federal prison.<br/><br/>While I do not believe that Harper Lee herself is motivated by the paycheck, rest assured that everyone who stands to benefit from her estate understands this opportunity.<br/><br/>"Go Set a Watchman" is best viewed as a historical artifact - the first draft product of a talented young author. Its character revelations should be digested as such. It was never intended to be a true companion piece to Mockingbird.
Glad I read it but like Mockingbird better.
Liked it better than To Kill a Mockingbird.
Well written. Great historical perspective.
Great read. Planning to read it again soon.
Not what I expected but we'll written and very interesting perspective on racism. I still see today's news in the pages here.  Not much has changed.
For those of us from small southern towns who grew up being cared for by a Calpurnia and lived this period in history and are still living with its errors and repercussions, this is the best book ever written. It has a sad clarifying prescience and layers of truth beyond measure. The professional reviewers are clearly on the outside looking in through the store window with no small southern town life experience that parallels Harper Lee's and thus are completely missing out on the most fascinating parts.
Love this book!  I have waited since the day it was found. After all of these years I finally have more to love about my favorite book of all time!
Not as good as Mockingbird but I really liked it.  I laughed out loud at some points.  I plan on reading it again - Thankfully Scout never changes.
As a classic literature buff and To Kill a Mockingbird fan, I was eagerly anticipating this unique publication. After hearing some of the initial commentary, I was even more eager to determine for myself what my reaction to it would be. I heard people say that this would only damage Lee’s reputation. In my opinion, it does not, but rather enhances it. Lee’s insistence of not publishing anything after Mockingbird is well known. But as Watchman was written and offered for publication first, I’m glad that it saw the light of day, as the Watchman manuscript was in essence the “Mother,” of Mockingbird, out of which it was given life. An editor evaluating Watchman, saw something else of great potential in the manuscript, and I think the literary world is thankful for that editor for ultimately giving us Mockingbird. Perhaps those editors are worth their weight in gold.<br/>Had I been the editor, I likely would have accepted the Watchman manuscript, because it is excellent writing. Perhaps I would have seen a fleshing out of the story of Scout’s childhood as a sequel. But ultimately I think it is good that Mockingbird came first because chronologically it came first. Watchman as the sequel allows us to continue the story and see what happened to these beloved characters. If Watchman had come first, I think it might have lessened the impact of Mockingbird. Setting up the “Atticus as shining hero” is critical to Watchman because it’s what drives Scout/Jean Louise to act as she does. We, like Jean Louise, are shocked and dismayed that Atticus may not live up to his own ideal, because we’ve experienced it through Mockingbird first. But it is a natural experience which Jean Louise deals with. Childhood memories tend to be idealized and simplified in a child’s eye. But as we mature, we see that there is more to the world which we saw and that it is much more complicated.<br/>Yes, Mockingbird is a great book, but with the complexity and realism added, Watchman should stand as an excellent companion piece. It adds depth to the characters whom we thought we knew so well. It also expands the conversation about race beyond the more simplistic message that we should treat everyone equally before the law. And perhaps it is more amazing considering the time period and the perspective of a white, Southern woman of the day. Perhaps the editor saw that such a book and a message from such a person as Harper Lee would have been found too abrasive and in-your-face for the reading public of its day to handle. Mockingbird is more palatable for its era. And Watchman should be able to be appreciated in this current era much better. If there had been a negative backlash with Watchman’s publication in the Fifites, would a book like Mockingbird have been accepted so widely and so well into the canon of classic American literature? I doubt so. Good for it to have unfolded as it has.<br/>Yes, the initial reaction to news of Watchman’s ultimate release, that how will the adoring public react to Atticus being portrayed with flaws and prejudices, was well founded. But I find the book doesn’t really tarnish Atticus’ image. It alters it, yes, but I find it important that we should see the more realistic portrayal of him. It only adds “character” to his character. And his portrayal wasn’t quite as negative as people feared.<br/>I didn’t find the new Atticus to be a racist, but rather a cultural “stick-in-the-mud.” His character has a lot of relevance today as we see debates of the Confederate flag being cast as either a racist symbol or a mere symbol of Southern culture. Atticus is more trying to protect what he views as the goodness of Southern culture. His age and the age in which he lived skews his view perhaps to not see that the good Southern culture that he wishes to preserve was only made possible by the diminishing of the Negro race, and keeping the status quo was the only means of maintaining what he grew up enjoying as a white resident of Alabama in the first half of the 20th century. In modern terms, this is defined as “white privilege,” and Atticus has a natural defensiveness to what he sees as threats to this privilege. Granting blacks instant full civil rights would certainly upset his apple-cart. But that doesn’t make him a racist. Jean Louise, representing the younger generation, the changing of the times, the vanguard really of new thinking for white Southerners, has the widened perspective of progressive thinking, living in New York City as a young adult in the Fifties, which allows her to see the insidiousness of the Jim Crow-era South. Her dilemma is a wonderful dramatic conflict. How do you remain proud of your good and decent Southern upbringing when you realize it is severely tainted and rotten at its core? The goodness of the decent upbringing that Jean Louise received from Atticus was tainted, not only by the enslavement of Negroes in the prior century, but also the continuation of treating them as second-class citizens and tolerated racism from others in her community in her current time. She has the right to have admiration for her upbringing which produced the goodness within her, but she is also right for abhorring the intrinsic evil contained within it, and for her eagerness to exorcise it from the culture in a swift revolution. While she is not afraid of what such a revolution would bring, Atticus is. And the conflict between them makes for high literary drama. Atticus symbolizes the good qualities of Southern culture, but his resistance to swift change mirrors the long, slow progression of change in the American South. Yes, we needed more Atticus Finches with the courage to stand up to racism when confronted with it. This would lead to cultural shifts away from tolerated racism. But we also needed more Jean Louise “Scout” Finches to move to a new level of enlightenment, where eradication of racism is the primary goal, instantly, now and forever.<br/>Hopefully this book will be taught in schools as well. It has a lot to offer.
Nothing like I had hoped for.  Very disappointing.
Though I have heard some controversy about the character of Atticus, I found the writing comparable to Mockingbird and the characters compelling.
Not near as good as To Kill A Mockingbird!
Liked this more than To Kill A MockingBird
It's a short story that needs to continue.
Excellent addition to Harper Lee's legacy.
Enjoyed the perspective and the mood shift
Scout returns to Maycomb, but what promises to be an exercise in nostalgia has jolting surprises and a tension-filled experience for the reader.
This book is significant and powerful in its own right. Once again Harper Lee teaches us all a hard lesson we were reluctant to hear. Love her.
Not as much of a  classic as To Kill a Mockingbird but an excellent recreation of the feelings of many people in the South in the 20th century.
I don't see where people got the idea that Atticus turned racist.  That is not what I understand from reading it.  I liked the book very much.
Anyone who fears that this book will taint his or her feelings about To Kill a Mockingbird need not worry. There is no plot, the dialogue is a cheap imitation, it does not come close to the masterpiece. I was so disappointed by the book. I had so hoped to see another great book but this was simply a pale imitation of the book we all have loved. I would not recommend it.
Excellent book
never read it but the girlfriend liked it
Liked the first book released a bit more.
I am still reading it but I like the book
The books starts very slow but ends well.
Hard book to read.  But worth the effort.
Nowhere near as compelling as To Kill a Mockingbird. Fair at best. I can see why her editor sent her back to the drawing board the first time
Sad but relatable sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird. I wish Scout had remained blissfully ignorant of the sad realities of Maycomb as an adult.
I loved To Kill a Mockingbird and have read it dozens of times.  This book is tedious, stilted, and hard to get through.  The flow was choppy.  I almost gave up several times but did complete it, and I'm not sure I even understood all of it, but it's not worth the effort of reading it a second time.  There were several passages that were very well written, but they were few and far between.  Some of them were nearly identical to passages from Mockingbird.  It was disappointment.
OK, this novel is not "To Kill a Mockingbird." but it's a respectable follow-up even though Harper Lee wrote it before her Pulitzer prize winning classic. The writing seems uneven and not as refined; perhaps that's why the author set this novel aside and didn't publish it earlier. That being said, this novel will provide plenty of topics for discussion and allow us to consider the complexities of race in America. A novel must be judged not only by the time and place during which it is written and what it conveys, but also for the time during which it is read. With the civil rights act, integration, and the passing of time, we view Watchman through different lenses than when Lee originally penned it.<br/><br/>That Jean Louise has left her childhood Southern community and lives in New York enables her to look at race with society's contradictions. Her father, whom she has always regarded as a god, is no such thing. Rather, he is a not-perfect human with shortcomings and failings who must fit in with his community and deal with the complexities of race there. In Scout's disillusioned eyes, though, Atticus as a segregationist trying to preserve the southern way of life makes him a hypocrite and a fallen hero.<br/><br/>I did enjoy reading about Jean Louise's interactions with her Aunt Alexandra, Hank Clinton, her Uncle and about her childhood memories, and this is a worthwhile read.
Being a fan of TKAM (both book and movie), I had to read this novel.  And not being a person to believe "what the critics say," I was going to read it no matter if everyone believed that Atticus was not this iconic character.  On the contrary, this book solidifies Atticus as one of the most iconic, most human characters in American Literature.  After reading TKAM, we, along with scout, put him on such a pedestal.  GSAW just shows us that his is just a human, but his is a very wise and honorable human.<br/><br/>I, frankly, do not understand why the "critics" believe him to be a racist, or a bigot, or a person who does not respect the negro.  I think he respects them more than any activist, any other person fighting for equal rights.  He gets the real picture.  He gets that if you want people to be treated equally, you have to show them how to earn that, just like any other person on the earth.  It shouldn't be handed it to you. He saw what would (and did) happen when you give someone something they aren't ready to handle.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I would love to encourage everyoune to read this, after reading TKAM.  The reader needs to have the same understanding that Scout did of her father that she did going into GSAW.  I think, in time, this book will be as iconic, and as important as it's predecessor, and that both will eventually go hand in hand.
Where To Kill a Mockingbird was charming, this is uncomfortable but what discussion about race between people who disagree is comfortable.
I could not always follow the reasoning.
not as good as the original but what is?
Wonderful and so very thought provoking.
It was not as suspenseful as I expected.
I can understand why it was not published years ago. It needs more work. Should not have been published at this stage. Still a good read.
I was happy spending time with my favorite characters again. But I'm glad Ms. Lee's second draft far exceeded this. A primer on editing and patience. There was greatness. This wasn't it.
It read as a draft and not a completed work. I now subscribe to a theory that this was a rejected first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird.
This was my world in 1960. Harper Lee summed it up in Watchman. I would recommend this novel to anyone, but especially to a Southerner!
Reveals Deep South attitudes in the aftermath of Board vs. Education - Scout is mature in her realization that the Old South is wrong.
Bought this for a gift and she loved it
Excellent read and great for book club!
Wish there were more Harper Lee novels.
Absolutely stole my heart. A must read.
Good though not as good as Mockingbird.
I read this book with little anticipation and much trepidation. I had preconceived notions from early reviews and almost missed the real message in this book. I believe the delay in publishing such a book was because it was written in the midst of such racial strife in the whole country that Harper Lee or her agents decided it was not a good time to write such a story.<br/>We must remember that we were reading what a young girl perceived about family, small town politics, and the pedestal upon which Atticus Finch presided in her mind.<br/>I invite people to read this book for what it is, her first book. The one she wrote before  To Kill A Mocking Bird. Atticus Finch will surprise you as will Uncle Doctor Finch his brother. I came away from this book with a strong "Ahhhh" moment. I am white, 68 years old, raised on the Mississippi Gulf coast about as southern as you can get. I lived these times and learned a great lesson from this book: Much of the strife brought about during those times and the very times we are living today are so hurtful because people are forced to do this or that without question. This is America. The land of freedom and opportunity. People abuse it so often because to be heard they have to shout and protest. Atticus had a better way of handling this. Maybe our leaders should read the book.
Harper's editor was right.  The story of Scout's childhood and the events referenced in Go Set A Watchman needed to be told before this novel, about Scout as an adult, could be meaningful.  It is almost essential to love To Kill A Mockingbird before reading this sequel.  The more familiar a reader is with the story, the more fascinated and attached to Scout, Jem and Atticus, the more this book will rock him.  Being rocked isn't always a bad thing, but it can be uncomfortable. In fact, the same reasons that Scout is unseated in this novel are the same ones that are possibly causing so many readers to dislike the book.  They, unlike Scout, do not grow by the end of the book and get stuck in their struggle with what they thought was an unflawed hero.  Masterfully crafted and very human.  Not everything is clear or fixed in the end but love still wins.  Well worth the struggle with the complexities and realities of the time, even if reading about them uncovers some of the ugly deep roots of racism. If you don't want to find Atticus is not the man you thought he was in Mockingbird, don't read this book.  If you do read it, try to enjoy the artful way Harper crafts her novel.  Notice where the climax between Atticus and Scout occurs and realize that, with Scout, the hope for a change in the next generation begins.
Can't get past the unexpected death. Probably won't read the entire novel. Don't want to tarnish dear memories of Scout & Atticus.
Another fantastic novel by Harper Lee.
Enjoyed the book more than I expected.
Pleasant surprise and enjoable reading
Go Set a Watchman suffers from some of the minor flaws of a first novel.  At times, it “tells” what has happened instead of “shows” you.  The dialog is a little clunky,  But besides that, it’s not a bad read.  I can full-out disagree with Atticus’s racism, and still enjoy the book.<br/><br/>As for the argument that Atticus can’t be racist based on his portrayal in To Kill a Mockingbird:<br/>1) This book was written BEFORE To Kill a Mockingbird.  Nothing was written in stone, yet.  I believe she says Atticus wins the case, which is not what happens in Mockingbird.  (So, you could think of it as a alternate reality story.)<br/>2) Believing Atticus is not a racist isn’t proven by him taking the case in Mockingbird.  He was ASSIGNED the case, he didn’t pick it.  He was assigned it because he would do the best job defending him.  And Atticus believes he is fighting for an innocent man.  And lastly, attorneys don’t have to agree with or like their clients to try a case in their behalf.  It was his job to defend him.<br/><br/>So, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Atticus would end up the way he is portrayed in Watchman.<br/><br/>Watchman is an interesting return to characters you already know and love, fifteen or twenty years down the line.  It’s worth checking in on them again.
Amazing story of family relationships and comunity persons living lives that exposes the good, bad and ugly of human interaction.
I can scarcely believe that Harper Lee wrote this some 50+ years ago.  It is so timely for today's fractured Merica. Great book!
There is a reason her publisher chose the other book.  Don't waist your time.  This book betrayed the reputation of Harper Lee.
I enjoyed visiting with the Finch family again. I was sad to hear that Jem had passed away. Grown-up Scout is true to her self and is recognizable as the older version of the young girl that she was in To Kill a Mockingbird. I was not as upset over the apparent changes in Atticus' attitudes as some other readers were. Race relations are so very complicated and Atticus really has not changed that much between the two books. Atticus still believes that the law is the law and he still is kind and courteous to all people regardless of race. He is not a saint but he is still a very good human being. In this book we see Atticus through the eyes of the grown up Scout. His attitude towards his black neighbors has been tempered by forced integration and Federal intervention. Atticus is not so much a racist as pro states' rights. I was a bit confused by one part of Watchman where it is said that Atticus had successfully defended Tom Robinson. Atticus did a great job defending Tom but the jury came back with a guilty verdict. I wonder how many other readers, like myself, sort of skimmed over that discrepancy between the two stories because, in our eyes, Atticus had won the case and the jury's verdict was just irrelevant to us. I did enjoy my visit with Scout and her family.
important period piece of literature.
I liked to kill a mocking bird better
Wonderful story. All about the injust
Having taught TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, I was most curious about the first novel.  I found it illuminating and thought-provoking.
I'm glad I read "To Kill A Mockingbird" right before reading this one. I actually think that helped me enjoy it more.
I thought the book was very good. It shows the way some people in the South coped with others who were bigoted in their ways.
I am amazed by the level of understanding this author has. Her intelligence is so past mine that it is hard for me to grasp.
Didn't expect it to be so wonderful but it picks up the story of Scout and Atticus and brings it to a heartfelt conclusion.
Go Set A Watchman, written prior to the publication of Harper Lee's American classic, To Kill A Mockingbird, is actually a sequel to her acclaimed novel.  Although it is well-written, it reads like a treatise on racism and bigotry in the south following the Civil War. The novel is once again set in rural Alabama.  Scout, now known as Jean Louise, twenty years older and living in New York City, has come home to visit her family only to discover how much everyone has changed.  Through her idealistic eyes, she is appalled at the racism that now exists and especially disillusioned with Atticus, the father that she always worshipped and idolized.  It is through her dear Uncle Jack, that she begins to understand the necessary, albeit unfortunate, consequences of change in the white folks of the deep south, and in particular, her father.  This novel resonates with us today, as racism and bigotry continue to exist in our country and probably always will, since people dislike change and feel threatened by those who are different from them.  Therefore, it is our conscience that must be our "watchman", our guide, in treating others with the respect they deserve, whatever the color of their skin, their religion or their ethnicity.
Harper Lee's second novel (or first, depending on your level of belief in the pre-release stories) will deepen your understanding of racism in America.  As such, it is well worth reading.  It is flawed as a novel, as is To Kill a Mockingbird, but it helps us viscerally feel racism, or as Atticus would say, "walk in another man's moccasins."<br/><br/>This novel does not diminish Harper Lee's landmark Mockingbird, but it does add another level of comprehension of the horribly wicked web our prejudices have spun around the lives of our citizens.  I taught Mockingbird to high school freshman, and as such, have relived all of its moments repeatedly.  Curiosity caused me to learn more about Harper Lee's relationship with Truman Capote (reportedly Scout's friend Dill in the novel.)  Dill shines in the new novel, and that's fun to observe how a less experienced novelist experimented with the telling of childhood memories.  Additionally, it shows the brilliance of the editor who encouraged Harper to write that story instead of Watchman.  What a gift to all of us!<br/><br/>We cannot be afraid to be truthful about the many shapes the relationships between races may take.  Watchman is fearless, and the time is appropriate to bring it to light.
My wife absolutely loved this novel!
Liked  To Kill a Mockingbird  better
Certainly not To Kill A Mockingbird.
Beautiful book! A fitting companion.
Was so so.  Nothimngike mockingbird.
Had mixed emotions before I started the book but then could not put it down.How pleasant to have discovered this Treasure!
An extremely dated and non-engaging narrative.  I'm almost halfway through this book and not sure if I'll get much further
Some of the charm of Mockingbird, not all .  Great study of  daughter and father relationship. Nice conclusion. Well done.
I enjoyed it
Excellent!!!
I enjoy humor when it's done naturally, a well  turned phrase that makes me remember how much I love words, and visiting a far away place, populated with realistic and interesting characters. I like to feel the swaying of a train as its being described and tasting a cold coke on a hot muggy day. I'm keen on listening to points of view that force me to think for myself, even if it makes me uncomfortable...
After all the build-up I guess I shouldn't be surprised at my disappointment. How could any novel live up to the hype?<br/><br/> I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird." I've read the book at least a half dozen times and I watch the movie once a year or more.  BUT I am on page 165 and am unlikely to finish it.  This is not typical of me. As an English major and a published author, I always finish reading a book.
I liked both of Harper Lee's books!  The second one just kept the story going. Enjoyable!  Read and enjoy! JANE CURRIER
I like ti kill a mockingbird better
Still prefer To Kill A Mockingbird.
Thought provoking and well written.
Harper Lee's talent is undeniable. It's again Scout's view of the world, two decades later, sometime after WWII.  It's more post-adolescent angst than childish idealism, but the idealist in Scout is still present. This book made me think, and I'm glad I read it. Now to read To Kill a Mockingbird once again. The best books should revisit you about every decade, to teach you how you've changed.
A
What amazes me the most is that Harper Lee wrote this book first.  This was her first choice of content, what was burning in her to say. There's no doubt that she cared passionately about the issues raised. That she would write it in the 1950's about the South of that time I find quite heroic.  Not only showing Scout's abhorrence of racism, but also the claustrophobia that Scout felt at the idea of fitting into the life of a southern woman.  And beyond that, the universal themes of searching for an independent identity, not easy for ANY woman in the 1950's.<br/><br/>I really liked and respected this book for what it attempts to cover, which is very far reaching. Perhaps her early publisher could have worked with her to tighten this novel, instead of changing a book about complicated human failings to one resting on the heroism of Atticus Finch.  I loved To Kill a Mockingbird, its characters and its plot. But if Harper Lee didn't originally see Atticus as a perfect hero, which publishing decision was more callous? The original rewrite of Atticus into a godlike figure, or the recent one to publish Go Set a Watchman so people could make their own decisions about it?
I was glad to read this as To Kill a Mockingbird is a favorite of mine.  Some of this was a bit painful emotionally.
A more serious book than Mockingbird, taking a balanced view of the age old problem of racism in the American south.
FANTASTIC<br/>As relevant now as it was then. It is such a joy to read a great author and not want the book to end.
To Kill A Mockingbird has been my favorite novel for a s long as I can remember. At first, I was so excited that there would be another Harper Lee publication. Then I was worried that I would be disappointed. While I still prefer To Kill A Mockingbird, Go Set A Watchman did not disappoint. Perhaps after I have read Watchmen  as many times at TKAM, it will also occupy a part of my heart.
The book seemed too wordy without really having a point. However, you can sense the essence that would become TKAM.
Didn't like as well as Mockingbird
A good read, somewhat predictable.
I 'm no finish yet ,but I like it.
For a book draft it was excellent.
Not as good a To kill a Mockinbird
Thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Lee's book!
Good story, surprise ending for me
True insight into South attitudes.
Excellent book.  Enjoyed it very much!
Novel tells what happened to the characters from TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD when intrergration took place in the South
Any fan of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' should add this to their library.  Disregard any spoiler alerts from the media.
I'm still reading it, but so far I really like it. It's hard to not compare it to "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Delves deeper into our human faults and crumbled expectations. How we learn to accept or rationalize compromising.
I enjoyed the book immensely.  I did re-read To Kill a Mockingbird first which helped my recall of the characters.
I enjoyed the story told in this book and would like to read more from this author if she decides to write again.
A very true to life way of understanding the southern gentry.  I recommend the book for those who are interested.
I give it a 5, not on its literary merits, but rather because it was an integral part of an amazing process. Only a brilliant author could transform this work, Go Set a Watchman, into a beloved, time-tested classic bridging the age, racial, and social class divides so adeptly depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird, circa the 1930s American South.<br/><br/>As one who enthusiastically introduced To Kill a Mockingbird's historical, political, and social themes to my 7th grade honor students each fall, I was impressed with how Ms. Lee was able to take a few nuggets from Watchman and develop them into something 'novel,' To Kill a Mockingbird, with a fully formed and emotionally, riveting plot supported by a well-developed and diverse cast of characters.<br/><br/>What a blessing to all of us that Harper Lee heeded the advice of her editorial mentor! By giving a few of the buds in her first draft of Go Set a Watchman the time and attention they needed to blossom, combined with rechanneling the rage of a young adult protagonist into the voice (and eyes) of innocence, she successfully crafted a spectacular work of art, To Kill a Mockingbird.
I really enjoyed this book. It's clearly Scout and Atticus in a different time period. The book has a different feel than TKAM and definitely not a “revised” or “alternative” edition.<br/>It's a story about racist attitudes and how they affect the people in the story. You're not going to come away hating Atticus, you're going to realize he was a product of his time and place.
I read the prerelease reviews and I can only think they were written before they finished reading to the end. I recommend this to everyone, especially if you loved To Kill a Mockingbird! The characters depth and their dealing with the huge changes in their society are beautifully written! Please read with an open mind and appreciation for the author's  craft and sensitivity.
Great book. Very talented writer.
It's about what you would expect.
Not nearly as good as Mockingbird
Great book. Slow to start but then gets to then gets to the point of can't put it down. I am passing it around.
I loved reading this book.  If I were a High School English teacher this would be required reading in my class.
Just so human, so scarily fitting for the 21 st century in regards to race relations. I really loved this book.
I enjoyed the book very much and found the characters concerns about the changing times thoroughly believable.
Truly superb!  I read this book immediately after finishing To Kill a Mockingbird, and Wow! is all I can say!
Regardless of when Harper Lee wrote Go Set a Watchman, it is impossible to believe it was not meant to serve as a second novel, follow-up on To Kill a Mockingbird. How else to explain its deftly placed updates on our favorite characters and the subtly interjected flashbacks? Without knowing the big-hearted, larger than life Atticus lionized in TKAM, how would the reader of GSAW understand the depths of Scout’s emotion seeing Atticus reduced to the size of a small-minded bigot?<br/><br/>Despite the book’s terrifically funny first chapters, Scout is mortally wounded mid-way through and then left for dead by the unnamed narrator -- who is, at times, presumably an older Jean Louise.<br/><br/>Read as a companion piece to Mockingbird’s satisfying morality play, the messy mixed message of GSAW is an unsettling shock to the conscience -- perhaps so shocking, Harper Lee thought better of publishing it. Why kill a mockingbird?<br/><br/>Well, as an African American reader who has long loved Lee’s first novel, I delight in this devastating addendum. I revel in this opportunity to put things in perspective – to return to Maycomb and see it as Tom Robinson and Calpurnia saw it. I celebrate Harper Lee for keeping it real.
A real thinker. Loved this book.
Good reading kind of predictable
Slow to start.  Got much better.
Disappointed after all the hype!
When you read the book, you will understand why she published in the order she did. What a story teller!
I ;had written my review above.
I was disappointed in this book
Awful. Couldn't even finish it.
Strong ending, enjoyed the book
not as engaging as I had hoped.
It was enjoyable excepted more,
Great sequel to Mockingbird...!
Much different than I expected.
It was exactly what I expected.
Great read. It leaves you with more questions than answers. A good starting point for discussion.
I thought it was very good...
Good story -tedious at times.
Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
Loved it. Still love Atticus.
I was disappointed in the writing. The prose was rambling. No a patch on To Kill a Mocking Bird.
Wonderfully written, perhaps not one was expecting but then perhaps the expectations were wrong!
Great Read; too bad it wasn't available years ago.  It was a perfect followup to the first book.
Don't waste your time or money!
“Now think about this. What would happen if all the Negroes in the South were suddenly given full civil rights? I’ll tell you. There’d be another Reconstruction. Would you want your state governments run by people who don’t know how to run ’em?,,,,This phrase is central to the theme of this story. It wasn't at all what I expected, but the more I read, the more I realized the truth in it according to the time (the 1950s), even though it wasn't a good feeling. I loved the characters, though I did wish that Jem was a part of the story. I'd love to know what he would have thought about what was going on in the town after having grown up there with Scout and Atticus. Because I grew up during this historical time, I understand the thoughts and feelings of the townspeople toward Blacks and their newfound freedom, and that is not to say that I like it. It was the harsh reality of the time. I was exited when I found the title of the book in the story, and even more surprised that "Go set a watchman" is Biblical. I highly recommend this book.
different, but very likeable
I love the Finch characters!
Not exactly what I expected.
First of all, I totally enjoyed this book! TKAM is my all-time favorite novel, so I was really excited to read this one. Scout is 26 and visiting Maycomb. It starts out nostalgic, but in a matter of days the rose colored glasses come off. And Scout begins to see things for how the really are, and it forces her to formulate her own opinions and become her own person. To me it felt like a natural and realistic progression of a character.<br/><br/>I can understand the criticisms and reservations that people have. But as the reader, you have to keep in mind that the novel reads like a first draft. There are parts that could have been fleshed out more, but those fleshed out parts are in fact TKAM. This book was a first try, and then Lee went and wrote TKAM after her editors told her to focus on the backstory.<br/><br/>Also, if it's been awhile since you've read TKAM, give it a re-read before you pick this one up. It will be a nice refresher!
I was reluctant to read this following the reviews. However I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was a realistic portrayal of inter-racial issues in the Deep South of that era. It it much harder-hitting than Mockingbird. The fact that the much loved Atticus was part of the resistance to greater equality just made it a more complex dilemna. Even someone who'd stood up to racism on behalf of one young man can still be intolerant of that young man's race as a whole. The realisation on Scout's part that intolerance of intolerance and of the people who are intolerant is in itself intolerance added another layer of subtlety. It's probably too short to have been intended as a stand-alone novel but the broad themes it explores have continuing resonance today. For racial and class intolerance then think welfare, immigration or religious intolerance today. Well worth the few hours it takes to read it. As with Mockingbird the dialogue is superb.
Loved it!
Our book group had a good discussion about this book.  All of us loved "To Kill a Mockingbird", and for those of us who equally loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus in the movie, I'd say the "real" Atticus in "Go Set a Watchman" was as heartbreaking for us as it was for Jean Louise.  But we all came to the conclusion that our understanding of Jean Louise, whether or not she and Harper Lee were one and the same, had greatly expanded after reading the book.  And the meaning of "law" as Attiticus respected it was very pertinent to recent debates.  We saw our own journeys from childhood, having to reconcile our childhood adoration of parents with our adult sensibilities, and we were drawn to the idea of setting our own "watchman" for ourselves again.<br/><br/>Is it well written?  No. This was a draft.  Is it worth reading?  Very much so.  Re-read "To Kill" first and then read this one.
Great Southern book. She should have published it sooner. It is the South as I experienced it growing up in North Carolina in the fifties and sixties. The publisher was afraid to publish it because of its truth. The NAACP were considered Yankee instigators and rabble rousers. The idea of desegregation was scary to most white people at the time. America can not rewrite history by being appalled by the Atticus Finch in this book. Read and learn. It is so timely. Secretly many people in America have progressed none or very little since this era.<br/>The language is so rich when Jean Louise describes her eccentric relatives and neighbors that I feel that I know them too. This is a southern book. Enjoy it. Learn from it. Embrace its lessons. Search your own hearts. Confront your own prejudices. Atticus Finch was just a man with flaws as we are all flawed. Feel Jean Louise's heartbreak as she realizes this. This is her coming of age moment.
I pre-ordered this book and it came as soon as it was released.  I liked the book, but, like so many others, it was upsetting to read how Atticus was, shall I say, not quite the tolerant man I thought he was. And, his brother was just as bad. Well, the town was just as bad.  Frankly, it was heart breaking. I put myself in Scout's place and was as upset as she was to learn how wrong she had been about the people she loved the most.  I thought I would never be able to read or watch "To Kill A Mockingbird" with the same warm feeling.  I decided to read my worn copy and then watch the movie and found, especially after watching Gregory Peck and his soothing portrayal of Atticus, that I could separate the two.  Let's hope a movie isn't made of this book.  It would be too difficult to watch Scout going through the shock and pain of learning the father who she knew as a kind and tolerant was not the man she loved and respected.
Harper Lee's writing style was very evident in this book.  The book was excellent but was badly edited.  Since To Kill a Mockingbird was born from the first time this book was edited then maybe they just didn't bother.  I found no quarrel with the death of Jem. The separatist views expressed by Atticus in this book do not strike me as being a betrayal of the character in To Kill a Mockingbird.  In the latter Atticus was concerned with justice over race.  The views expressed by the character in the former were appropriate to the times.  I found it disturbing that the reference to the trial in To Kill a Mockingbird was not an accurate accounting but has Tom being acquitted and an amputee.  The encounter between Calpurnia and Scout in Go Set a Watchman could have used some clarity.  Harper Lee's talent for delving into the nuances of human behavior and thoughts has always delighted me.  This book deserved better from its editors.
I kept waiting for something big to happen...not the same caliber as To Kill a Mockingbird.
Growing up in the south about 10 years behind the setting for Watchman I had fond remembrances of a lot of the descriptions in the book. I grew up in Pine Apple, Alabama about 45 miles from Monroeville in the segregated south. And even though there was segregation I played with African American kids growing up. If we wanted to play baseball it would take both black and white kids to have enough players for two teams in my little town.<br/><br/>I've never met Harper Lee but I did spend an afternoon researching deeds in the Monroe County courthouse with her sister Alice. She was a class act with brains and was very personable.<br/><br/>I thought Harper Lee did a fabulous job of describing the social and political scene of the south at that time. As much as I liked "To Kill A Mockingbird" (I just read it again last year), I think "Go Set A Watchman" is better. I hope someone makes a movie from this book.
Despite some negative reviews, based mostly on disappointment about Atticus, I found this novel honest and refreshing and Atticus realistic.  . That disappointment arises from a misreading of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD--many readers putting their own views into the matter--for Atticus there took up the case because he believed in a fair trial.  But he was a man of his society--and yet  today we force our views onto the past and demand they measure up--or else.  Harper Lee explains where Atticus has gone and why.  She is not sentimental, nor unreasonably idealistic.  She is not judgmental and the very people who proclaim they are not judgmental are often the most so.  That is not to say she agrees with Atticus (I am sure she does not) but, unlike the PC tyrants, she allows him his say.  It is that age-old debate:  freedom versus equality.  Which must yield when they clash?  Your choice reveals much about you.  I know mine.
I have finally finished Go Set a Watchman.  I thought it was good.  I'm glad I purchased a copy for myself.  While it doesn't have the polish of TKAM, and no one ever should have expected it to, it is a good novel and should not ever be compared to Mockingbird.  It is not a sequel.  I don't think it should be held up alongside Mockingbird and compared, critiqued, and/or criticized.<br/>This is my opinion: Watchman was a rough, honest view of a young woman's anguish when she discovers that a man she put on the highest possible pedestal is really just a human trying to do his best.  That, and she has to come to terms with what she feels is a betrayal from him.<br/>Yes, it's true the writing isn't very polished, and yes it could have stood some editing.  But, in a way, I think that made the novel feel more personal and made Jean Louise feel real to me, because her anguish was so raw.<br/>Definitely worth reading.
Hard not to think that in her 90s Harper Lee isn't more relevant than ever to the America today and the tensions that remain.  Sure in places its garbled and hard going but the whit and sharpness of the dialogue delights. Atticus is the same man we know and love in Mockingbird, but here we see a man evolved by the inevitability of the world he inhabits. Scout takes up the role of Atticus we knew in Mockingbird.  The tension and debate between them that fills the last third made the hairs on my neck stand up.  Perhaps not the great novel all dreamed off but it could never live up to that, but perhaps even more important a cold bucket of water thrown over us by a Graceful woman in her old age begging us to look at the world we too easily accept, where in tolerance and racial tensions divide and break families and communities.  I found it haunting and perhaps even more needed and relevant today as when written.
Okay book, very repetitive.
Great book highly recommend
I liked all but the racism.
Not as good as Mockingbird!
Quick service. Quality item
Good book for a discussion-
What an outstanding book!  I know some people are disappointed to see Atticus fall off his pedestal, but I admired Harper Lee for allowing him to be a man of his time and his place.  He wasn't a racist, he was a pragmatist who believed in states' rights.  He felt things were moving too fast and he didn't like outsiders telling people what to do, how to do it, and how fast it should be done.  The reader can see how the changes in the fifties and sixties affected the ordinary people in the South.  Change is always hard to accept, and people often feel threatened by it.  This book does a great job of showing how people reacted in those days.  Don't look at it through twenty-first century eyes.  A lot has happened since the time of this book and the reader should take that into consideration.  Also, what people seem to ignore, there's a great deal of humor in this book.  I especially liked the scene where Scout is baptised naked and turns around to see the minister!
Atticus sounded just like my father and groundfather talking about King when I was a kid.
I loved it. Description of a very hard time in history for everyone was done beautifully.
Having read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD three times over the last four decades, I could hardly wait for my hard-cover copy of GO SET A WATCHMAN to arrive. Cover to cover, Harper Lee did not disappoint me, although there was one scene (a social tea) that could have used a bit of  editing in my opinion. The story delves into the often ignored and hard-to-discuss social topics of the struggle of class discrimination and racism in the 1950s and 60s that are still alive in and relevant to us today. Jean Louise Finch, as a young adult, returns home from New York City to visit Atticus, her aging father. As the story unfolds, Jean Louise finds that childhood memories are just that. A child, sees as a child. Now an adult, Jean Louise is faced with the reality of the human condition and questions her own beliefs. Once again, Harper Lee did not disappoint this reader! GO SET A WATCHMAN is a book I'm sure to read again.
I was very disappointed in this book.  Am surprised by the rave reviews.  It hardly seems like a novel, there is no story line, nothing really takes place.  The characters are one dimensional.  There are just several long, rather obtuse conversations.  Total waste of time.  Glad I borrowed it from the library.
The book moved slowly for the first half but then delivered its intended subject matter.
A SPECTACULAR PREQUEL to MOCKINGBIRD.  This is the story Harper Lee wanted to tell us 60 years ago!  Now, here it is.  I know this Atticus Finch; I grew up with him.  This is the REAL story of that place and time.  The question is:  are Harper Lee's fans ready for a strong dose of reality?
This book can't be compared to TKAM, although because we read that one first and fell in love with it and Atticus, most of us can't help it. The issues are different. TKAM taught empathy and gave us a role model, seen through a child's eyes. Go Set a Watchman is about a young woman who finds her heroes, Atticus and her uncle, have feet of clay and don't have the same values she does. Of course, haven't we all been there? As a teacher I would continue teaching TKAM to high schoolers and perhaps teach Go Set a Watchman to college students in order to discuss the fallen idealized hero and claiming the values we cherish for our own despite being disappointed and feeling betrayed by the very ones who taught us those values. I'm glad that Harper Lee listened to her editor and rewrote her book and gave the world TKAM. Harper Lee is still a good writer, but the story we want is in the other book.
A little disappointed.  But then To Kill a Mockingbird is a pretty tough act to follow.
Thoroughly enjoyable read.
Haven't finished book yet,
Beginning was slow.  Would be hard to follow if not read To Kill a Mockingbird first.
Enjoyed this book very much. Harper Lee can paint perfect pictures of her characters.
I was expecting at least equal to if not better than Mockingbird. I was disappointed.
Great read. A good companion book to To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee does it again.
Powerful
The book was a great read
I' do this later.  Thanks
NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED
Harper Lee creates a "conversation" that all of America needs to hear.
What he heck happened to Boo? Atticus Finch broke my heart. He broke my heart.
Extremely disappointing; in my opinion, most likely not written by Harper Lee.
I loved it just as much as To kill a mockingbird which I am now reading again.
There are common phrases, and inconsistencies, all of which combine to leave the reader guessing how Watchman relates to Mockingbird. What is certainly true: This is a great book, and but for the unavoidable comparisons, it would be lining up the prizes.
I re-read Mockingbird to get to this novel with a fresh experience of Nelle Harper Lee, and then read Marja Mills' The Mockingbird Next Door to get an up to date account of Nelle Harper Lee herself. After this preparation, I thoroughly enjoyed Watchman, and it helped me better understand my own experience of race relations in my life in Virginia in the 1940's - 1960's. Assuming Lee wrote this novel about her father and their relationship before she finished Mockingbird, it makes Atticus Finch more believable to me, and suggests how this character evolved within the evolving racial relations of his time. I appreciate the book, and I appreciate Nelle Harper Lee as a writer and a real person struggling along with all the rest of us. Go Set A Watchman yourself. It will probably be good for you.
I am presently reading "Go Set a Watchman" and am really enjoying it.
This book is a page-turner by definition. The text flows mellifluously - more than To Kill a Mockingbrid (TKAM) does - and it tells the "other side" of Maycomb and its people. The plot unravels very linearly, punctuated by flashbacks to Jean Louise's childhood. The characters show their unknown sides, but they have not changed into something one would not recognize from TKAM. Maybe, one way to see this books is as an unabridged version of TKAM, rather than its sequel. With one exception, the part in which JL and her Uncle Jack had a long conversation, I was never bored. This piece really had me going non-stop and although it is a sequel to the all-time favorite TKAM, it has its own life and exists fully without being shadowed by its predecessor.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend it.
Don't believe the critics. Read it all the way to the end with an open mind.
Harper Lee does it all over again.  Easy, engaging reading, good beach book.
It was wonderful to read about Scout's adulthood.  There were definitely some surprises and twists in this novel, but I was happy to know that Atticus was still a good man.  Harper Lee's writing is so enjoyable.  I would highly recommend this book
Brought me right back to Scouts world and how it had grown just as she had.
Really enjoyed the book
Didn't see that coming.
Brilliant book loved it
Wonderfully insightful.
Interesting, easy read.
wish she had more books
I am glad of the irony of knowing Mockingbird before this earlier novel was published. It gave me a chance to know and idolize Atticus in a way similar to Scout. So the emotions of Scout mirrored my own as Atticus's actions and words progress in Watchman. The public hoo-haa over Atticus's racism misses the point that that was only the vehicle of a coming-of-age story for Scout. It had to be that dramatic to be that successful. I do marvel in both novels of Harper Lee's grasp of racial issues at a time of the very beginnings of the civil rights movement in our country. I love this woman's writing: her characterization and sweet sub-stories within her novels are peerless. Both Watchman and Mockingbird have places on my shelf among my most loved and favored books.
If one can get past the disappointment of Atticus Finch being a man rather than a sainted caricature, then this becomes Harper Lee's second great novel.  The real issue is the Supreme Court legislating from the bench, an error that has continued to this day.  We learn a bit more about the ugly underside of Maycomb, and a lot more of Scout's personality comes through.  The rape trial was won rather than lost, and we learn that Atticus has a brother with whom Scout has an interesting relationship.  The pain of racial relations - to both white and black citizens - comes through.  Ms. Lee's writing again leaves the reader in wonder at its greatness.  Not as many "wow" moments as To Kill a Mockingbird, but enough to make a frustrated writer like me marvel!
If you enjoyed "To Kill A Mockingbird" you will enjoy this sequel.
This is another classic by Harper Lee.  It is hard to believe that she wrote Go Set A Watchman prior to To Kill A Mockingbird.  The two books support and compliment each other.  While many have avoided this book because it represents Atticus as a racist, this novel is very realistic relative to beliefs predominant is the South during that period.  The courtroom scene meeting of the citizen's council is powerful and haunting.  Even "Scout" makes room in her beliefs for the views of others.  She comes to accept that people who are basically good can harbor prejudice and hatred and that changing attitudes happens over time.  Don't shy away from this book because of negative press.  It is realistic and does an excellent job at portraying racial divide.
It exceeded my expectations. Within the first week I read the book twice.
Harper Lee is such an acclaimed author and this book was not disappointing. I love that she ever so often reflected back to the time she was a child. By doing so, she made this book a natural sequel from her famous "To Kill a Mockingbird". If I had to be critical of anything, I felt she filled excessive amount of the book with the political issue of segregation in the South. During that period, it was a way of life in the South. That didn't make it right, but so were a lot of other things. The conflict she felt was carried further than I would of liked. My other criticism was why she waited so long to release this book. It was written as well as her acclaimed first book. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and wished she had written more.
The author never intended for this book to be published.  I chose not to read the book because I think it unfair over-ride her wishes.  To Kill A Mockingbird is a wonderful book and I did not want to spoil that book by reading this one.
Negative critics of it have, perhaps, not read it all the way through...
Will be reading again!
perfect for my library
I ordered for a friend
A little disappointed.
Enjoyed the new ideas.
It was a little boring
Working on reading it.
On time.....great item
Did not like it at all
Well written, but sad.
Maybe not as gppd as To Kill a Mockingbird, but very enjoyable reading.
Beyond regional, national, and racial issues, Lee investigates hypocrisy.  She turns the tables on the self-righteous and forces her reader to consider that what's most important is adopting a sense of equanimity toward others--even those whom we're convinced are evil.Specifically, a discussion of the novel could asks the following questions: What is the nature of bigotry? Does equanimity extend to hate speech and evil deeds? When does getting along conflict too strongly with our conscience? Can we love those with values we denigrate? Does Jean Louise understand Maycomb, Alabama?  Human nature? Her family? Men? How close/distant is the narrator from Jean Louise’s values and viewpoints? Is there a moral touchstone in the novel?
I enjoyed this book almost as much as"To Kill a Mockingbird"<br/><br/>I really think you have to be a "Southerner " to understand it's true story. I really think Harper Lee was ahead of her time. Enjoyed. Thanks to the author.
Written many years ago, it gave a very truthful reason for the Civil War, why it was fought. It also gave us a good reason for honoring our heritage. So, Southern people hold up your heads and be proud you are from the south!
It broke my heart to read this book. I don't want to give anything away, but I can say this: the pre/sequel to my beloved TKAM broke my heart... And unless you are made of stone it will break yours. Perhaps the most shocking and disarming part of the book is the absolute relevance of the subject matter. It will never be allowed in public schools, not in a society that has become the scrap dog at the table of the government. You will need to know your history to understand what a relevant and real book it is and how it foreshadowed the society we have become. Read it but be prepared to mourn... This is not the Harper Lee who sought to free Boo Radley. This is the Harper Lee who is a political and societal prophet.
Very poor novel in many ways. Characters were uninteresting and bland
Not enough people realize that "we" don't own her character, Atticus Finch. He is now shown to be nuanced, but clearly recognizable. In spite of the negative New Yorker review... I thought it was an excellent novel.
I sincerely doubt Lee wrote this. It is so slioshoddily written and seemingly hastily released to appease Social justice warriors for a quick buck. Awful. I demanded a refund, received none, so I mulched it for fire tinder.
Harper Lee has a way of pushing all your buttons. She puts a little ring in your nose and jerks you about like you were some farm animal looking for your friend. Go set a watchman is no different than to kill a Mockingbird. It will be read and misunderstood and then read again and all things will be revealed . There is understanding in this book and there is love between its words folded carefully among the sheets of pristine lettters that show you everything, but make you squint at their edges. Both happiness and sadness live between these pages as is the story of human nature. Scout will steal your heart once again and the dryness in the back of your throat will return, at least for a little while.
Really good book I wasn't disappointed. Wish it was a little longer.
This was written before To Kill A Mockingbird, but reads much better as a sequel. The change in Atticus is shocking for the reader who is familiar with the previous story and makes Scout's shock more realistic. Had this been a stand alone novel it would have seemed a bit melodramatic. The politics are well argued and very much in line with how people thought at the time. Perhaps too many speeches given by characters, but the writing was still good and there were a few excellent lines.<br/>Overshadowed a bit is the wonderful description of the South as it once was, both before and after the war. The childhood flashbacks are the best parts and are reminiscent of the quality of To Kill A Mockingbird.
What took you so long
Speedy delivery. A+++
Decent and whimsical.
It's very difficult to read this without considering 'to kill a mockingbird'. As such it is very difficult to rate it as a stand alone novel. My rating is high due to sentimentality. I was constantly reminded how wonderful 'mockingbird' is, how developed the characters are, and how inspired harper Lee was to create such an intricate story from this original 'watchman'. I wasn't disappointed with Attics. It was refreshing to be reminded of our humanity. I would have to read it again to consider its own merit because as I said  I was continuously linking stories and characters. One thing can be said, the two novels blend wider fully together, albeit the differing sentiments
Race relations has plagued humanity from the beginning any time a "tribe" comes face to face with the other.  Lee's novel gives voice to one "tribe's" rationalizations, bigotry, and half conceived attempts at understanding the other.  Among the cacophony of these voices is the protestations of Jean Louise, aka Scout.  Coming face to face with a world and people who are no longer as good as first realized deconstructs our youthful gods.  Reconstruction, on the other hand and as the narrative suggests, begins by giving our gods the humanity they deserve.  Lee is a true southern wordsmith.  I am grateful to have this extraordinary book in my personal library.
Not a masterpiece, not at all the level of To Kill A Mockingbird.
Great!  Reece does a great job of reading this well written book.
Shame on the vultures who did this to Ms. Harper Lee (and to us, the readers). Nothing but a money grab. What next? Do they plan to take Ms. Lee's hearing aids, glasses and wheelchair and sell them on eBay?
Not worth the effort
purchased as a gift!
Sort a anticlimactic
Hard to see how this could have been written BEFORE Mockingbird.
It's hard to not compare Go Set a Watchman to To Kill a Mockingbird, and I think it's easy to make an argument that To Kill a Mockingbird was the greatest book ever written, if one can say such a thing.  Certainly in the discussion.  And Go Set a Watchman is not going to be in that discussion, but is a very, very good book.  It's 20 years later, and Scout is visiting Atticus in Maycomb.  Things have changed, it's around 1949, and the old South is changing.  And the book is about change and how people deal with changes.  It's still a lovely book, although it starts a little slowly.  In the end, it made me think a lot, and that's why I would fully recommend.
Please credit me the cost of this book<br/>It was terrible
Protecting values can sometimes be thought of, as stubborn.
This story tells about what segregation and race relations were like in the 1950s and 1960s.  It tells the story from a Caucasian viewpoint, but is very sympathetic to the black viewpoint.  The story draws no conclusions, nor does it offer real solutions to the race relationship problems of that time, some of which continue today.  What it does do is explain the reasons for the lack of action on the part of white southerners at that time.  It does not condone that lack, it only explains it.  It is a story that needed to be told. Like our own children, we may not like the things they do, but we still love them.
I think we need to rewrite the ending of "Go Set A Watchman" to better reflect its relevance to "To Kill A Mockingbird" and to provide us all with a comforting resolution to this heart-breaking novel. Here is what I have so far: Atticus was never a racist; he had a slight stroke that left him disoriented for a short period of time and unable to make clear, rational decisions. Atticus becomes a firm supporter of MLK but dies tragically, poignantly, on the eve of the Civil Rights movement.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, Mockingbird fans... I'll write more after I clean off my rose-colored glasses ...
I thought this was  excellently written and very realistic
I didn't think Atticus was as bad as some of the critics say he was. I felt he was just trying to see both sides.  I think Scout came to that conclusion as well. I highly recommend it!
My son read TKM (To Kill a Mocking Bird ) in his high school English class. Since I hadn't read it myself since high school, I re-read it. Shortly afterwards Go Set a Watchman came out. I was very excited to read it. It gives a great prospective of what the mindset must have been at that time. I grew up in a rural southern community. Reading Scout's thoughts on racism  and bigotry helped me to see what people thought during the time of my grandparents and parents. It helped me see how things evolved to how the racial climate is now. I think it will be a good book to read again and analyze further.
Enjoyed the story.
Thought provoking.
Great transaction!
Gave it as a gift!
Big disappointment
Thought provoking.
Great follow up to To Kill A Mockingbird.  Some say this is what she wanted to say the first time around. I say the timing probably wouldn't have been right. Great job and thank you.
Seems like the book was written by two different Authors.
I thought it was an interesting sequel. Scout  is grown up and seeing race relations from a different point of view. She sees Atticus  in a different light than she did as a child.
While the book has many issues, both from a writing and thematic standpoint (You basically have to be very familiar with Mockingbird to follow some of the flashbacks), I would still recommmend reading it.  It offers fascinating glimpses into additional facets of Scout's childhood.  It has some fun parts, and it's a quick read. Some parts are problematic, but the way some people talk about other people is problematic in life, especially in the 50s.<br/><br/>On a personal level, as a white cis-gender woman of a fairly liberal bent who, in the recent political climate, is finding that people in her life who raised and influenced her to be respectful of everyone are suddenly hateful, meme-sharing, whining bigots, openly and loudly on Facebook and other social media avenues, the book is ringing surprisingly true from the protagonist's perspective.<br/><br/>Desegregation is not directly Jean Lousie's fight, the outcome will really have no bearing on her life as she lives it, and it's likely nobody wants her to stand up as the "great white defender of the minorities", because that would be patronizing as hell. But she still cares even if it's not her place to take the helm in the fight against injustice.  She still has a deep feeling of "what the hell happened to you, you used to be so sane" about the people around her, and is struggling with her feelings towards the people she loves and the way they are acting.<br/><br/>And I think a lot of us are in the same boat as Scout. Draw what corralaries you will, the civil rights movement, desegregation, or even today's issues with displaying the Confederate Flag, or LGBT rights.  You want things to be ok, and equal for everyone, the playing field leveled so everyone gets by on the merits of what they contribute to society, but you definitely want and need to check your privilege.<br/><br/>This book couldn't have come out at a more perfect time to possibly foster discussions about all this.  At the very least those of us who don't really have much of a place in the world of social justice can empathize with Scout.
I must say I have not read "To Kill A Mockingbird."However I consider it an all time favorite movie and a classic for all time. So I cannot comment on Harper Lee's writing style for Mockingbird. I found Watchman difficult to read due to the heavy use of southern colloquialisms that I was not familiar with even though I grew up in Atlanta, Ga.  in the same era. Further, the use of literary references by the uncle complicated the reading. I found the character and plot development a bit lacking. Overall, it seemed a good attempt at a first novel but needs development and polish.
Sensitive historical issues explored but I didn't realize this was going to be a great "father/daughter" story!  For any girl or woman who has struggled in her relationship with her dad, this will truly offer some solace.  I saw my dad in Atticus and myself in Scout.  Fell in love with the zany, intelligent uncle.  If this becomes a movie, I look forward to see who is cast in each role.  If you remember the history of the midcentury south you will find this to be a fabulous perspective as Harper Lee amazes again with her keen, thoughtful writing style and magnificent insight.
It's a story about discovering an identity. It's about growing up, drawing your own conclusions, and standing up for what you believe in. Although Atticus was raised a separatist, he raised Scout to be  'color blind' and see people as people. As Uncle Jack mentioned, Scout is the kind of person the south needs. She bravely challenges their ideals and traditions. At first I wasn't sure the meaning behind this story, but it became clear to me by the end of the story. Could  this story stand alone? I don't really think so, but I do believe it's a good sequel to  To Kill a Mockingbird.
Excellent read for the current day history of the races.
I don't understand why people hated this book so much, I'm convinced they didn't finish it to be honest. This book was extremely realistic with the time period and the characters are true to themselves. I was upset with the death of a particular character and the lack of speak of another; I also didn't catch the part about their old home. But all in all it was a great sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird and I think if people give it a chance and get over the whole idolization of Atticus Finch then they will really like it. I recommend it even if you didn't enjoy To Kill A Mockingbird.
"Go Set a Watchman" deserves to be read as a companion to "To Kill a Mockingbird."  It tells the continuing growth of Scout from a little girl who lives in the safety of her father's presence to a young woman who must make her own decisions and chart her own course through the turmoil of the civil rights movement in the South.  I think that "Go Set a Watchman" may have benefited from the assistance of a skillful editor, but, regardless it is an important work that honestly portrays a difficult time in the history of the South and the United States.
Since To Kill a Mockingbird is my all-time favorite book AND movie, I had high expectations for this one.  I learned, though, as Scout did, that human beings are complex and unpredictable, sometimes in predetermined cultural ways.  It was very interesting for me to see how her life had changed from the little girl she remembered, and the childtime experiences she had, to the grown-up realities of her today.  Even though, she thought all was lost and forever changed, she thought it through...as did I, realizing that humans are almost NEVER what we think we thought we knew.
I read it immediately a second time.  There was a lot of character development, flash backs, and moving discussions between all of the key "Mockingbird" players.  Doctor Finch adds much to carry out the key lessons of the story.  The book is consumed with the prevalence of racism in our country, and it is even more overt today.  Great book, and I can understand why editors did not want "Watchman" published 50 years ago.  I trust we are today able to read it, do some personal evaluation, and hopefully act courageously to begin to improve our great country.
This is truly literature and I enjoyed reading it very much. What a fantastic writer Miss Lee is, why did she not write other books?  You can visualize every word and description that she writes. That seems a shame to me that we only have two of her books.  I did not expect this book to take the turn it did with Atticus's attitude after To Kill a Mockingbird.  But this is an interesting look at what change meant to many people in the South during the civil rights era.  I was very glad to have read this book, but To Kill a Mockingbird was by far my favorite of the two.
I loved To Kill A Mockingbird and although there are a few flash backs to Scout's childhood (which made me laugh out loud), mostly this is about Scout's coming to grips with who her father really is, not a child's view of their father as God. A coming of age story, but a coming of age as an adult. Very well written. A few grammatical errors and one minor character's name kept changing from male to female  (why didn't the editor catch those), but I really enjoyed this book. Read for it's own sake as an adult story to answer those big questions we self examiners ask.
A great read,  Not unlike To Kill a Mockingbird.......
Great book...not as good as Mockingbird but enjoyable.
I loved it as much as "To Kill a Mockingbird".
Another classic with insightful passages.  Great read!
The book starts well.  The writing just carries you along with its descriptions, characterizations, and the humor throughout.  The pacing and the flashbacks work well.  I really enjoyed the first 75% of it and put it down for a little while so that I could savor the satisfactory ending I was expecting in the last 25%.  Nope- it was a disappointment.  Perhaps if this book had been published in the 60's or 70's, I could see the ideas and the white-apologist view as appropriate for that time--- but it doesn't fit in now.  I think what really ruined it for me were the long, preachy sermons.  They went on for pages and pages- about ideals and thoughts. . . as if Harper Lee was trying to convince her audience with her reasoning.  She's right, more or less, but the book is coming 50 years after much of society doesn't need convincing anymore (and those who need convincing will not be reading her book).  Some of the things she said made me feel uncomfortable- that even in her very strong voice that she claims her belief in equality for all, that she is "colorblind" -and I can't quite put my finger on what it is.  I felt that there were some unintentional racism in her attitude that would be probably not have been noticed in the 60's.  I really shouldn't expect a book of the past to address the issues of today- should I?  Like To Kill a Mockingbird, she has other big themes going on such as a coming-of-age story and womens roles.  I was impressed with her descriptions of women and society's expectations for them-- which in some ways does still apply today.  I put three stars because I liked it and will probably read it again, but I will look more closely for what exactly bothered me.
I would give this book five stars, but there were some issues.<br/><br/>1. When I ordered It and set it to Guraranteed 2 Day Spipping I was expecting It to come in two days but I got it on the third. So if you do care about when it comes then you're going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>2. The second problem is that, and this may seem like a lame excuse but it's not, the book is too big. It matter of fact actually fits my hand. So it almost may not be worth carrying around.<br/><br/>Other than those two complaints, it was a good book, and I would buy again.
Not a great book!
A very good read.
Enjoyed the book.
thought provoking
very interesting!
Enjoyed the book.
Found this novel interesting as a sequel To Klll a Mockingbird.  The heroic and steadfast nature of Scout's father from her childhood is shattered when she reaches adulthood when she finds him tolerating and seemingly condoning racism.  I see spiritual parallels is our relationship with God as we often do not understand why he tolerates racism, bigotry and sin in our world.  Thank you Father for taking care of our sin problem by sending Jesus Christ your Son to pay the penalty for our sin and redeem us to yourself.  Our part is to receive this truth by faith.
Should never have been published. There was a reason it has been kept in a safety deposit box. I will not let this novel tarnish my favorite book To Kill A Mockingbird.
I am very glad that I bought this book.  "To Kill a Mockingbird" is one of my all time favorite books.  I enjoyed "Go Set a Watchman" more than I thought I would (considering some reviews I read in the newspaper).  Harper Lee's writing is refreshing.  It is a book that will make you stop and think.  We thought we knew the whole story but this book shows another side and how complicated life really can be.  I also liked the style of the pages.  They do not have the same slick edges as newer books.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
I enjoyed the book, but thought the ending need work.
It's very disconcerting to me that this very poorly constructed and first-stab effort to the vastly read TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD has appeared in this way---for the whole world to see. I am baffled that the author had this hidden somewhere..why? It's a very bad first draft. Why did Nelle keep it? Many may not know that Nelle's sister, Alice--an attorney, although much older--kept watch of her younger sister's affairs and for decades works like this were forbidden fruit. As soon as Alice died in 2011 (at age 103--she was still practicing law), the vultures descended and scooped this one up. All for visions of great profits, of course. It's a bad book. And it's very unfortunate that the Atticus here is an unlikable bigot and now everyone's chattering about that and that the Atticus we love is a 'White Savior.' No. The Atticus we know is just a decent man with a good conscience. That is all.<br/><br/>My feeling has always been that TRUMAN CAPOTE was the real author of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. He was talented enough to write it--if you look at his charming short stories and early works, especially, the VOICE...there is a connection; they were childhood friends. I believe Nelle has been sitting on this secret for decades,(she stopped giving interviews in 1964...Why?) and who knows what we will find out once she is gone? I have a feeling there's a confession lying around somewhere....and unconsciously, her hidden secret is why she hung on to this lousy first draft. A far better talent re-worked the material and created richer characters and description...and I am all the more convinced now that I have read this mess, that it wasn't her. It was Truman.
From what I understand this was Harper Lee’s first submission for publication.  It shares many of the same characters and general themes as To Kill a Mockingbird.  I found it to be a very worthwhile book in its own right although somewhat less polished than Mockingbird.  I bought this book on the strength of Mockingbird.  I thought it would be interesting to read the work of a growing writer.<br/><br/>The main theme of Watchman is distinctly different than Mockingbird in that its focus is on a 30 year-old woman coming to terms with her idealistic view of her Southern hometown and the idolization of her father.  Many of the Mockingbird themes also come out in Watchman; bigotry and racism and the Southern and small town way of life from the point of view of both children and adults.  The greatest consistency between the two books is the main character’s idolization of her father, Atticus Finch, and the portrayal of the main character, Scout, as color blind and innocent.<br/><br/>I liked this book.  There are stylistic differences from Mockingbird which I think reveal a less polished writer.  I found it a very compelling story in the end in that it deals with the early stages of desegregation much more directly than Mockingbird.  While it condemns bigotry, white privilege and segregation even more directly than Mockingbird, it also acknowledges the basis, although unjustified, for Southern fear and concern.  More compelling was the theme of a young woman dealing with daddy worship.<br/><br/>It is hard not to speculate why this book was rejected by publishers of the time.  The book argues that the South’s rejection of forced federal enforcement of black rights and integration is as much based on state’s rights as it is on bigotry.  The Northeastern narrative of the South in the early 60’s was that it was a hotbed of ignorance, intolerance, and racism.  Certainly, there was much truth in this view at the time.  Watchman tries to make the point that Southern intellectuals were not as single-mindedly bigoted as was being promoted by northern liberals.  It argues that the South was also reacting to the heavy hand of Northern federalism.<br/><br/>Clearly Watchman was swimming against the tide of the Northeast liberal narrative of the South as a block of unprincipled racial evil.  Even today, liberals routinely deride and denigrate the South.  It took Mockingbird, with its unqualified and simplistic portrayal of Southern bigotry to qualify for publication.
If you’re expecting the kind of suspense and excitement that moved "To Kill A Mockingbird," you’ll be disappointed.  Though "Go Set A Watchman" takes place 15 or 20 years after the events in "Mockingbird," it was written before it, and Lee’s skills were not as finely honed as they were in the later work.  Nevertheless, I found it a very good read, though there are a few places where it dragged.<br/>A grown-up Jean Louise (Scout) travels back to her hometown of Maycomb, Alabama, to visit her father, and finds that her, at best, tenuous, feeling of place within the community has been broken.  Jean Louise had never felt all that accepted in Macomb, not only because she was a tomboy and rebellious against the expectations of Southern females, but because of her finely honed sense of right and justice<br/> She thinks that at least Atticus shares her sense of right, but when she trails him and Hank to a meeting of the Citizen’s Council, and listens to the polemics of the meeting, her adoration of her  father is shattered.  And her relationship with Hank, who had proposed to her, is ineradicably altered.  She thought her father was a beacon of righteousness in the bigotry that permeated Southern thinking.  Finding that he does not share all her beliefs, beliefs he had imparted to her, threatens to drive a wedge between her and the rest of her family and friends that could never be repaired.  Her relationship with her father Atticus, her aunt Alexandra, and her suitor Hank, are all being derailed by the seemingly unbridgeable gap in their views of the major social upheavals of the time.  Even Calpurnia, her beloved childhood maid and nanny, turns her away, seeing her as a representative of the white establishment.<br/>There are are some lovely passages in the book.  Two paragraphs talked about her shaky induction into the female society of Maycomb and they rang very true to me.  There is frequent reference to a poem by Robert Browning, "Childe Roland To The Dark Tower Came," about a journey undertaken by a knight, and perhaps Jean Louise feels that the poem is paralleling her own journey.<br/> If you want to understand the turmoil in the South in the late 50’s, early 60’s, this book will provide you with some of the rhetoric people used, and Atticus provides the philosophy of the old guard.  Jean Louise is, of course, the new guard, and she will have to decide if she can maintain any type of relationship with her family, or if she separate herself from them.
I believe an entire semester could easily be spent on this book alone, examining what Lee is saying about racism, about Supreme Court rulings, about women, about parenting, about culture. This book could fit into a literature class as easily as it could be read in a sociology class.<br/><br/>This book is one of self-examination. While reading this book you should be doing some hefty thinking. It's not a book to pass the time and escape the world. It's a book you use to examine the world and think critically of it. And, perhaps more importantly, to think critically of yourself. Because of this I'm hesitant to put my own thoughts on this book into the world. I want others to read it with a clean slate, examining it from their own perspective. Both for the conversations this could ignite, and for the growth in each individual person and in society.<br/><br/>For me this book got me thinking heavily about the implications of 1964's Brown v. The Board of Education, and what it means for us today. It meant thinking about the legalities behind things like bakeries who turn away gay couples, and what that means in relation to diners who want (and wanted) to turn away people of color.<br/><br/>And then Kim Davis hit the news cycle, inflaming the world with conversations about where religious rights trump legal requirements in the workplace, and how that is different for someone working as a civil servant versus another job.<br/><br/>What has struck me as rather shocking... (is that the word? Surprising? Intriguing?) What has repeatedly gotten my mental wheels returning to Go Set A Watchman during this Kim Davis media hype is the number of gay supporters and allies I know who have said things like, "Well, it's your wedding day. Why would you WANT her to be the one who gives you your marriage license? Go somewhere else for a more positive experience." (Apparently it's still okay to make homosexuals sit at a different counter.) (See, now, I swore I wouldn't do that...)<br/><br/>Atticus is wondering if forcing integration in our schools is going to simply make things worse in the future because we're giving the government too much power.<br/><br/>Scout believes that people will only treat others as equals if they are forced to do so.<br/><br/>Scout and Atticus are asking each other, at what point do we determine whether or not the government can mandate our morals?<br/><br/>I'm asking (and answering for myself) at what point do we say, "It's your right to be prejudice," and where do we say, "Go to jail, go directly to jail," instead?<br/><br/>Many of the reviewers of Go Set a Watchman have been frustrated. They have cited this book as confusing and not concise in its opinions and viewpoints. They want Lee to take a real stand, and tell us what she wants us to take from this book.<br/><br/>We all know Lee isn't going to do that.<br/><br/>Lee is not telling us what to think. She is showing us how. She is showing us two different analytical approaches to the same situation. Scout and Atticus are coming at race relations from different angles, as we all are.<br/><br/>This book is confusing people because so often we are told what to think, and this one is instead showing us how to think.<br/><br/>So my review is this: Read this book. Read it a few times. Read it with a journal nearby. Let your mind wander while you read it. Pay attention to the ways it connects with today's media. And then, when you're done...<br/><br/>Read it one more time.<br/><br/>http://imaginekatrina.blogspot.com/2015/09/harper-lee-blacklivesmatter-and.html
Two warnings: 1) I have only read ten pages of this book so far and 2) There will be (non specific) spoilers from the first couple pages. To those of you who are even half the To Kill a Mockingbird fan I am, please prepare yourselves before you read this book. This book is the first draft of a novel Harper Lee wrote in the 1950s, and many believe that this was the first draft of TKAM itself. It is written in third person omniscient, so you will have to get over the fact that things will not be coming from Scout's naive perspective (it's not her 26 year old perspective either, which sucks yes but keep fighting). There is also a character (a major character) from TKAM (one that I'm pretty sure everyone loved) who dies in literally the first 5 pages and I sat on my couch for about ten minutes wondering if the cameras from Pranked were going to come out and get me, but no, it really happens. The book just doesn't have the incredible flow and diction TKAM had, and I miss that. But I am going to stick through until the end (because I heard the second half is much better).<br/><br/>On a more positive note, this book is a great opportunity for people who dream of being writers; this is a chance to see a Pulitzer Prize winner's first draft and remind yourself that when your novel is close to garbage, this one is too. BUT, something I heard that many people are not fond of, is the fact that Atticus Finch has turned sour in regards to race and is very different in those regards to (my favorite character) in TKAM. Although many people hate the book for this reason, I think it is a wonderful reality check. In life, heroes will fall and Atticus becoming a different person because of the horrible racial inequality around him, it (brutally) but honestly true.<br/><br/>I haven't decided yet if I would recommend this to TKAM fans because, well let's be honest, it crushed my soul and will take a few days to recover from, but it shows us the truth of life and what a first copy that many people said shouldn't be published looks like. But remember, I'm only ten pages in so maybe I know nothing. I hope I was able to give you both sides of the debate, now it's your time to decide if you can do this.<br/><br/>PS. Apparently three stars means you think it's "OKAY."
This novel has flaws but overall it's finished, coherent, thoughtful, and powerful.  It's not mere rough draft of Mockingbird.  In fact, it revolutionizes our sense of Harper Lee's importance as a novelist, not to mention our understanding of Scout/Jean Louise, Atticus, and Uncle Jack.  Jean Louise is older now & has to deal with the fact that her father is not perfect--in fact, he's complicit with much southern racism, including the all-white "Citizens Council," the successor to the KKK in the 1950s.  It's a novel of ideas, full of powerful debates about federal intervention in the South after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the rise of the Civil Rights movement, "states' rights" backlash, and other events.<br/><br/>Readers who are angry that Atticus is no longer the perfect father and wise elder need to grow up.  This portrait of Atticus in the 1950s is courageous and realistic; his positions are those that many white southern liberals took, and his older daughter's criticisms of his take-it-slow on civil rights and let the South decide, not the feds--are eloquent and hard-hitting.  (Atticus recognizes a good deal of his intelligence in his daughter, even though she is fiery in a way that he rarely is.)  The Atticus in Mockingbird that we all loved still lives unharmed by Watchman--but now we can see that portrait for what it (brilliantly) was, the picture of a parent or wise elder idealized by his adoring children.  This new Atticus (and Scout's relationship with him) is much more complicated, and that's fascinating.<br/><br/>The novel in many ways sides with its heroine but it also subjects Jean Louise's beliefs to really intriguing critique -- particularly her rather arrogant confidence that she is "color-blind" and, as a progressive, free of racism.  The questions debated are still (sadly) relevant today, as many in the U.S. realize that we are a long way from being a "post-racial" society.  Relevant too is JL's sense that one "can't go home again."  When she returns home she sees all Maycomb's flaws:  should she flee back North, or stay and try to make the South better?<br/><br/>None of the reviews have adequately mentioned that the novel is often very *funny.*  It's a witty, feminist social satire of gender roles and expectations (especially the pressures on Jean Louise to follow ideal models of "femininity" and marry); small-town small-mindedness; and many other topics.  The fuller portrait of Uncle Jack and his relationship to Jean Louise is superbly done.  Because our heroine is older, Lee's criticism of social hypocrisy is much more ambitious than it was in Mockingbird.  Readers who enjoyed the satire in Mockingbird--not just its wisdom about how to do the right thing--will definitely recognize and enjoy that same voice in Watchman.  What's so moving about Watchman, in the end, is that now it's not clear what "doing the right thing" is:  JL has to puzzle it out for herself; she doesn't have a trusted elder explaining it all for her.  Welcome to adulthood.
Amerikans are a very religious pipples. It’s therefore not surprising that their taste in literature tends towards the infantile. For example, given Oates’ statement that the real novel  violates the implicit reader/writer pact, it’s not surprising that amerikan reading preference runs contrary, and towards pact-satisfaction in a way that Goldilocks herself would approve.<br/><br/>In other words, although ‘Atlas Mugged’ and ‘Begone with the Sin’ clearly drip fascism from every sentence, even the literature that’s sublimely humanist in theme take on nothing more difficult than a child’s vision of justice. With Huck, we just know that, without the vicissitudes of adult town life on the Mississippi to inform us otherwise, slavery is just plain wrong. For her part, Scout sees her father fight for justice against the white trash, and is rightly proud. Nomos oud-pathein.<br/><br/>Yet Ethos pathein. There’s something hidden in this inner discourse which, as a child, Scout childishly ignores. But so did the readers, which is childishly unacceptable. In short, the heroic moral stature of Atticus --only described by discharge of his legal obligation-- is falsely assumed. Now this foreshortening of character, of course, was augmented by the moovie—because that’s what Hollywood is supposed to do: inner virtue (or evil) is represented by outer appearance, and all that.<br/><br/>Simply put, ‘Watchman’ offers us the full Atticus that was always there; an immanence that his young daughter was unable to grasp which now, as an adult, she can. That certain readers have trouble coming to terms with this ‘new’ Atticus begs the Oatesean question: because the image that you formed of the Atticus in ‘Mockingbird’ was that of a child, you’ve deceived yourself.<br/><br/>Atticus has always had the sentiments of a racist which, at least in his own mind, never conflicted with his duties as a lawyer. As in the old Aristotelian tradition (‘Atticus’!), law and ethics fall into discreet categories. This concept was clearly expressed by both Atticus and his brother in their confrontation with an angry Jean (‘Scout’), in which they win a tentative acceptance. Likewise, Jean somewhat reluctantly agrees that the struggle of her own redneck alabamapeeple for the separate- but- equal status quo is to affirm the natural order of the universe.<br/><br/>So in the telos beyond the boundaries of the narrative, we put Jean back on the train. Rightly, she’ll agonize over the unsaid: “But Father, the Brown decision of ’54 clearly and unanimously stated that ‘separate wasn’t ‘equal.’” But father, you speak of legal obligation as totally removed from the moral obligation that you owe others!”<br/><br/>Then, she’ll come to realize what The Watchman said, “Babylon is destroyed, her idols smashed and ground to dust”. The self-serving iconographies of ‘the south’ no longer exist-- as if they ever did. Lastly, she’ll awake to the idiocy of her Polonius-like uncle who chose to twist Isaiah to suit his own petty needs. Southernism, she’ll realize, is a mental disorder because it chooses the me-ness of the island over an understanding of others. Now as an elderly 85, she’ll see the trash element in their Dixie tee-shirts that read, “Not hatred, a tradition”, and say, ‘I told you so’.<br/><br/>So can we speak here of a Body without Organs? For the first hundred pages, we’re gulled into a false, hand-in glove accommodation of Jean’s homecoming. This forms a revitalization of the world of old sentiment, manners, and growing as an expression of acceptable difference. Then from page 101 onwards, Jean loses her Plane of Consistency and becomes…dis-organized. Anger fuels a world view that’s totally rent asunder. Everyone is alien. In this sense, Lee’s novel becomes better than great—rather, an act of genius in her description of Jean’s delirium through its remarkable dialogue which—trust me from my own experience—is all too real.<br/><br/>Moreover, what’s stunning is that Jean’s shock reverberates back through the narrative as violent unhinging of the entire reader/writer contract. Again, to revert back to Isaiah, what’s announced is not only the smashing of the Idol of Atticus, but also that of the expectations of the reader him/herself. In this sense, Watchman is a Novel of Violence
“Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common: they both begin where reason ends.” – Uncle Jack, page 271<br/><br/>As many teachers, readers, and lovers of literature did, I came to this book with mixed emotions – excitement, trepidation, joy, worry, and yes – some prejudice and faith.  Setting aside the controversy under which the book was published, I am glad the book was published and I am so glad I read it. It was fun to be in Macomb again.<br/><br/>It is not as good as To Kill a Mockingbird – but did anyone really expect it to be?  TKAM sets the stage and draws us into Scout / Jean Louise’s life and GSAW is the messy backstage show: interesting and full of raw emotion, but I’m not sure if I wanted to see how the sausage was made. . . alas.<br/><br/>But Scout is Scout and it was fun to hear Lee’s voice again.  I laughed out loud in some scenes.  Seeing how she acts romantically and flashing back to her younger days again remind us that she’s the same ol’ Scout that we loved.  I could even see her indigent responses on the face of Mary Badham (actress who portrayed her in the film version of TKAM).  Unfortunately, I feel like she didn’t mature much in the 20 years since Jem broke his arm – the second half of the book was just a big, melodramatic temper tantrum that could’ve used some more editing.  I mean, really, she goes from Uncle Jack to Hank to Aunt Alexandra to Atticus just rehashing the same outrage. I know people need time to process their emotion, but I didn’t need to be a part of all that. I would’ve liked to see more resolution.<br/><br/>Interesting character that Uncle Jack – again, I’m not sure I needed all of his obscure references and circumlocutions, but he was a voice of reason after Atticus fell from grace in Scout’s eyes.<br/><br/>I know the modern media has been hung up on the “Atticus is a racist” gossip, but that’s really not a surprise, is it?  TKAM was all about Atticus’ ascension onto a pedestal and this is where he falls from that pedestal – I thought we Americans loved that archetype.  But perhaps that’s just a pop culture thing.  Atticus transcends all boundaries and we suspended our disbelief when Scout portrayed him as a god.  Did any of us question Scout’s reliability as a narrator?  I didn’t. But if we face the facts (that Scout doesn’t want to see), he’s become an old man and old men are known to be crotchety and conservative – plus this took place right in the middle of the civil rights movement and that scared a lot of Southerns. . . The other thing about Atticus is that he now has more depth as a character; I think we can all agree he was pretty static in TKAM.<br/><br/>TKAM is still a book in its own right and we need to continue teaching just as we always have – this may change some of the conversation, but hopefully it will become a richer conversation where students are more critical of Atticus (and perhaps Scout even) and that’s not something to be feared.  We English teachers don’t want to be accused of being hypocrites by the Scouts in our classrooms now do we?<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead with commentary:<br/>Jem was so pivotal in TKAM, but he only had a few passing comments in GSAW!  What a disservice to his character – even Dill had more development.  Jem just died of a heart attack when he was engaged.  That’s about all we know.<br/><br/>I wish they had “cleaned up” the details of the Tom Robinson trial, just for the sake of continuity with TKAM; it states that Atticus won an acquittal, the black man’s arm was injured in a sawmill accident, etc. and obviously that was not how it was in TKAM.<br/><br/>Speaking of the lack of resolution, did Scout go back to NYC or stay in Macomb?  What becomes of her and Hank? How much longer does Atticus, Aunt Alexandra, and Uncle Jack live (and what happens after their deaths)?<br/><br/>And what was up with Calpurnia?!?!?!? I amazes me that Lee fleshed out her character so much in TKAM if that one scene in GSAW was what she began with. . . I was so sad that she refused to acknowledge Scout when she came to visit.<br/><br/>I did really appreciate the authenticity of the vernacular Lee uses.  This is a time capsule and despite how offended we may get reading some of those passages where Mr. O’Hanlon rants on during the citizen’s council meeting, it was appropriate there (especially seeing how furious Scout becomes after hearing him speak).  We could not have appreciated Scout’s outrage as much if Lee had just paraphrased – and even then I tired quickly of Scout’s outrage.<br/><br/>During the coffee gathering that Aunt Alexandra hosts for Jean Louise, there’s a very odd tangent / exchange / hallucination that Scout has where she’s arguing with the city of New York.  Again, I think the narration and eccentricity of that could have used more editing.  It just struck me as odd and difficult to follow.
SOME SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Go Set A Watchman lacks the grace and ease of TKAM, but I still found it compelling and worth the read.  The book is choppy and sometimes confusing in its POV. I found myself having to re-read certain segments in order to understand who was doing the talking or thinking.  Ms. Lee spends too much time on tedious events and descriptions that detract from the heart of the story. There are moments of brilliance and humor in which one can sense what the story might have been had it been given more development and greater depth--but in its current state it often reads more like a short story than a fully realized novel.<br/><br/>Still, the book's primary themes are relatable to my own life in such a personal way that I could not put the book down.  I had to see how, or if, Harper resolves the conflict between Scout and her father Atticus.<br/><br/>The whole book is worth the last few pages, and though it is truly a simplistic story in many ways, with rather a flimsy plot--the concluding chapters brought tears to my eyes as I recalled my own childhood adoration of a man I thought could do no wrong, only to see him fall from grace. As Scout discovers what she thinks is the 'truth' about her father and is devastated that her whole perception of him is a lie--we the readers are right there with her in her devastation, having fallen in love with Atticus Finch in Mockingbird.  As she must find a new and different footing in their relationship or simply walk away never to see him again--we as the reader are given the same choice.<br/><br/>GSAW cannot compare to TKAM in terms of its atmospheric elegance and utterly compelling story, but neither does it destroy my love and admiration of Atticus Finch, as some readers have suggested it would.<br/><br/>"Now you, Miss, born with your own conscience, somewhere along the line fastened it like a barnacle to your father’s. As you grew up, when you were grown, totally unknown to yourself, you confused your father with God. You never saw him as a man with a man’s heart, and a man’s failings — I’ll grant you it may have been hard to see, he makes so few mistakes, but he makes ’em like all of us. You were an emotional cripple, leaning on him, getting answers from him, assuming that your answers would always be his answers."  Jack Finch
I was disappointed in this Harper Lee lost and then found book.  It was pretty good for the first 2/3s of the book and then it became ... oh, I can't even say!  Maybe very boring and so WAY off track!  I loved the characters but then in the last 1/3rd of the book they became something different!  I almost thought this was a current politically correct approach but I know it was written many years ago.  So disappointing!  Do not expect the same quality of writing, story or characters as in "To Kill a Mockingbird"!  Not going to happen!
It's okay; it certainly isn't To Kill a Mockingbird.
In order to read this book you will have to remember that it is NOT about Atticus.  It is about Scout.  It weakens the character of Atticus a bit, strengthens that of Aunt Alexandra and develops the family history.  The novel primarily deals with Scout's emotions and how growing up in the town and family she did has shaped her beliefs.  The most important point of the book is that we are sometimes forced to align with the undesirables in order to protect people we love.  It does require an open mind but I found it interesting and enjoyable.
I absolutely loved this book! Many times I laughed out loud at the way Jean Louise spoke and described things in Maycomb. She truly skewered all the inhabitants with her wit. The later third covered her disappointment at finding her father was not the perfect man she had always assumed him to be. Many of my friends disliked the way Atticus was made into a human being, rather than the idol from To Kill a Mockingbird. I found that this book just made him more human. His ideals were still in place, but he was, in the end, a man of his times.
I was unsure I would like this book based on all the negative publicity before it was published BUT I LOVED IT!!! Harper Lee is an exquisite writer and the interface of To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set A Watchman makes this a great read. Given the setting of the story and period of history it's a fascinating coming of age account of a young woman finding her self and beliefs. This book will be discussed forever and will help the next generation understand the difficulties encountered during desegregation not unlike what's going on today.
Helped me understand some things and I did enjoy it
Excellent Book.  Wish Harper Lee kept writing more.
To Set a Watchman<br/><br/>Sometimes I do the right thing. Instead of listening to all the bad press on Atticus in Harper Lee’s newest book, I read the book. What a thought provoking book.<br/>I won’t go into details because I don’t want to spoil this for other readers. Harper Lee, thank you.<br/><br/>The last two chapters remind me of a scene between a principal and myself when I was in my late 20’s.<br/>I was Vice President of a teacher’s sorority, ready to lead the group in a year.  I visited the main office in the Midwest and came home and resigned.<br/><br/>“They are bigots,” I told my principal. “I want nothing to do with them. They don’t allow blacks in the sorority! Even their walls are white!”<br/><br/>“So you plan to be a coward,” the principal said. “IF you are true to  what you say you believe in, you would stay and make changes instead of turning away. You’re as bad as they are. So you’re going to quit each time you meet up with people who don’t share the same values as you? You’re a coward. Stay and go on to the national level and repaint those walls.”<br/><br/>I didn’t listen and took the easy way out and quit.<br/><br/>I leave you with one thought on Go Set a Watchman. So I see a group of Klansmen. How do I know if one of the Klansman is not there to bring about changes…to get into the heads of the Klansman. What if, to end the work of the Klansmen, he is  there to study first what he needs to dismantle? How fast we judge without going beyond the masks and words and outer behavior of our surroundings. Sometimes we are as bad if not more than those we despise.<br/><br/>Yes, I’m glad I read this book. and folks, this book is  fiction.
I really loved the book. I thought it was classic Harper Lee. I know there's been a lot of discussion about Atticus but I feel like his position was somewhat explained by his brother, Scout' s uncle who we really get to know in this book. Loved this character as much as I loved Atticus in To Kill a Mockingbird. It was great to see Scout grow into the amazing, independent woman she became. Also very interesting to see how things and people had changed during the time Scout had grown up and moved away. Would definitely recommend it.
I did my best to read with an open mind, trying to put one of my favorite books (To Kill a Mockingbird) out of my head save recalling the characters. In that respect it was readable, taking around three hours. But I must say it is not terribly well written with some rambling pages and other material that added little to the story. Some of the flashbacks to her childhood with Jem could have been eliminated with no consequence.<br/><br/>As a character Scout was not so well developed but relied, in my mind, heavily on the character from Mockingbird. So if you had not read that book, too much would have left you scratching your head. The relatinship with her family, mostly her uncle, was interesting as were her observations of life in the south after living in New York for sometime.<br/><br/>What seems to have garnered the most condemnation for this book is the revelation that Atticus belongs to a "society" of people who believe African-Americans in the south of the 1950s were somehow not capable of being full-fledged citizens. Is he a racist? I guess, but I still find his sense of right and wrong to rise above that in comparison to some of the truly awful stuff that was going on at that time. So I can neither condone nor condemn his thinking. What sticks in my mind was the way the character of Atticus defended a black man aganist the charges of a white woman. He defended with all he had, with no thought to the consequences because he knew it was just.<br/><br/>Would I recommend this book? Perhaps, but with the caveat that it is a fair first effort (which apparently it was). I am so sad that Harper Lee wrote nothing more to share as she grew older.
I expected more.
Great story line
Disappointing...
Outstanding book
Not as expected.
Excellent book!!
Quite a surprise
Very unique glimpse into values and mores of South
While I thought the first part of the book was written like a romance book, it was mostly the end which really disappointed me.  I never fully understood Attpicus' position in Maycomb and his almost racist attitude.  I guess I can't imagine this based on his views in To Kill a Mockingbird.  While I don't really see this as a prequel to TKAM, I think that knowing this book was written first somewhat disappointed me.  I guess in the end one has to assess each of these books on their own although for me that was hard to do?
With all of the bad reviews circulating in the press, I was really worried that reading this book would dampen my affection for To Kill a Mockingbird and, in so doing, obliterate my perception of Atticus Finch. But...that's not what happened. Instead, I fell in love with Jean Louise (Scout) and her family all over again. I agree with those critics who say that it does not achieve the literary heights that its predecessor managed, but that doesn't render it unworthy. And it definitely should not be considered wholly separate. If anything, this novel enriches the experience of Lee's classic tale of Maycomb, Alabama.<br/><br/>It is such a strikingly real depiction of 1950s South that it would be a travesty to overlook Lee's identification of the cultural nuances that shape the region, particularly those that hold sociological significance then... and now. If Fitzgerald was genius for his prescient observations of the ramifications of Jazz Age debauchery, then Lee is genius for her keen insights into the psychology and sociology of American racism.<br/><br/>In other words, this is an important novel for America, probably more now than ever. We should not see this incarnation of Atticus as a literary misstep. Instead we should recognize that our instinctive need to recoil from the imperfection of his heroism and our desire to mourn the eternal justice we thought he brought to the town, mirror the exact psychology that throws Jean Louise into a tailspin. And that to me is the mark of great literature--it provides no easy answers, but leaves us so unsettled that we must continue to search and to probe for understanding.
There was a lot of backlash over this book, and I am very glad that I read it regardless.  The characters flowed from "To Kill a Mockingbird" and I do not feel the legacy was tarnished.  The book was written depicting a time in this country's history that outrage can not arrange.  Atticus' involvement in the racist group was justified.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, there were some lighthearted moments and the feel of the writing and genre brought me back to "Mockingbird" and all I loved about it.
It was good to read to finish the story of Scout.
I give "Go Set a Watchman" a 5 because of the difficulty of the task and the honesty of the author  in undertaking the subject. Does it have flaws?<br/>I believe so, but I read it straight through, which is more than I can say for so many books today that are well executed but formulaic.<br/>It deserved to be published and although it may disappoint some who would like to keep Atticus Finch on his pedestal, it adds dimension to a subject that takes an author of Harper Lee's calibre to handle.<br/>TDG
The novel met my expectations for a good writing, equal to To Kill A Mockingbird.  I can see where To Kill A Mockingbird flowed out of To Set A Watchman.
This book got bad press when it first came out. It was said that Atticas Finch reversed his fairness position. I did not find that to be true, he was just as honest and fair as always. What he did object to was the NAACP coming into the small towns of the South, and turning folks against each other.<br/>There was very little racial strife, when the NAACP got finished filling the South with propaganda and hate, neighbors didn't trust each other any longer. Interesting read. Read it and see what you think.
If you want a deeper look into who Harper Lee is, this novel almost reads as an autobiography. It lagged at times and felt like she was arguing with herself, but the issues are still so relevant today and deserve the attention she gives them. And Atticus is not as racist as people make him out to be. He's a realistic look at how a white man in the south would have tried to deal with the tumultuous race relations on the edge of the Civil Rights Movement. The entire book is well written and worth the read.
Even though folks were upset about Addicus being less of a hero than in To Kill a Mocking Bird; as a black woman, I still enjoyed the book, because Harper Lee was writing about the time, and clearly showed the conflict between the 2 main characters. I found it to be a good read. Now, I am re-reading Mocking Bird. Besides, Harper Lee is no spring chicken and on Social Security like so many of us...so she probably needed the money. I understand, being 65 and just starting my own 1st book! :-)  ~D.A.Mills
I read it the day it was released!!! It is a very good book and I would definitely recommend to anyone who has read "To Kill A Mockingbird."
pretty good considering what it was up against.
Drawn out story
Very satisfied.
Love the author
Very enjoyable.
Worth the wait!
Harper Lee fan.
Not a good read
This was great!
Excellent book!
So Far So Good!
Glad I read it.
not much to say
Wonderful book.
Loved the book.
I think this book has been misjudged and misinterpreted by many people. It is definitely not as easy to understand as To Kill A Mockingbird (which while I'm talking about it, I shall say needs to be reread by everyone who read it in middle school; many teachers assign it to those to young to read it). You need to really think about what Dr. Finch tells Scout about Atticus and Henry. If you do that, you will understand Atticus' behavior that has baffled so many To Kill A Mockingbird lovers.
thank you harper lee for sharing this great story with us. no it is not TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD but it is not  meant to be. it is more honest about race and racism than MOCKINGBIRD is.  it is a hard read only because of the truth it tells.  HARPER LEE HAS WRITTEN ABOUT THE united states of America not how it should be but how it was and in many ways still is. again thank harper lee!!!!
Well worth a careful read. Some people have disparaged this book by saying Ms. Lee made Atticus a racist in this book. I believe just the opposite. Having grown up in a small town in rural America, I understand the why one might attend meetings of people who don't believe the same as you do so that you understand where they are coming from. This is especially true if you have a business or practice serving these very people or others who could be affected by the actions of these people.
I think this book really helps those of us in our time understand the South better - where they were coming from when faced with integration and equal rights for all people, for better or worse.  I found it interesting having grown up in the fifties in Virginia, but more importantly it provided me with with the best explanation I have seen of how southerners viewed a change that would turn their world upside down.  It also helps us understand why many in the south are still upside down.
It was interesting to see how Scout has developed into the young woman, Jean Louise, living in New York City, and home for a visit with her aging father, Atticus.  Her small town in Alabama, her father and other residents have changed much to her dislike....concerning the blacks.  Although this story is a period piece, I was surprised at the disrespectful words Harper Lee used to describe the black people.  I believe Harper Lee should have stopped writing after her first blockbuster.
I gave this book five stars but I admit that the book, combined with a lot of research on the internet about the genesis of the book and the controversy, made me pretty upset. I could understand that Atticus was a racist who believed in defending and innocent defendant, and of course it burst my bubble about Atticus. Are his views any different from Theodore Roosevelt who called the Japanese honorary Aryans and gave them Korea as a gift, or his promoting American presence in the Philippines by calling Filipinos "monkey people"? Roosevelt's views were in 1909, Atticus was an attorney in 1950. How much have people really changed?<br/>We just moved to Northern California after eight years in Arkansas. Atticus' views are alive and well in the South, as is the Confederate flag. A waiter refereed to people from Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois as "Northern Invaders" and my rather young endodontist reminded me - I'm from Washington State, and hence not a "Northern Invader"- that the North had impoverished the South. I saw not a single integrated church.<br/>What has this to do with the Harper Lee book? We have to remind ourselves that the book was written in the 1950s and that Scout aka Jean Louise was representative of changing times and that in the end she came to terms with human nature.<br/>Additionally, research concerning the publication of this book is as interesting as the book itself. It makes me wonder how much is attributable to the publisher rather than the author.
As a native Alabamian who grew up reading TKAMB and who also moved to New York in my early 20s', I related to Scout in so many ways throughout this book, and I am so happy it was released. It's hard to put into words the emotions I felt while reading this book, but I believe the book is more about the new adult relationship between Scout and Atticus, and how Scout had to realize Atticus is actually only human, and not the sinless God she made him out to be in her childhood. There were so many difficult parts of the book to read, it made me sick to think of the way people spoke at that time. But I think the book is actually trying to send a much simpler message about how relationships can evolve, set in a time where so much controversy is taking place. Every child reaches a point in their lives where they realize their parents are only human too, they will make mistakes, they will disagree, and they might fall off the pedestal we put them on. I, too, struggled with so many of these thoughts and feelings every time I returned home for holidays with my family after so much time on my own in New York. I disagreed with my parents views in SO many aspects; but I still love them and I respect them. Scout has grown up, she still has a few lessons to learn, but the more I read in this novel, I saw so much of the Atticus I knew from TKAMB in her now as a grown woman. Scout and Atticus may have their differences, but at a core level, they are bred from the same cloth and they are good people at heart.
I loved the book and I love Harper Lee's writing style.  As some would object to the subject matter, I saw several observations about the society at the time the book was written that are still true today.  It was also a great study of maybe not agreeing with other people's ideas and actions, even while disproving of them, the acceptance by Scout that every individual has the rights to act on their own beliefs, and "just because it is, doesn't mean it has to be that way".
I like well-written works, especially ones with an all-encompassing presentation of the shades of life. Harper Lee's classic is one of those smooth-flowing works, written with an insight and presented in an easy to relate manner that  is easy to grasp. It is an unique style seen in works like  "The Usurper and Other Stories", "Water for Elephants" and "The Alchemists". "Go Set a Watchman"  is a  great piece of literature and a recommended read.
I give it 5 stars for introducing an interesting concept; that our civil war was really not about slavery but about a culture of identity based on racial strata. I didn't lose any respect for Atticus. I believe his actions in both books were based on his love of the law and not any kind of racial philosophy. The main character remained just as childish in Watchman as she was in Mockingbird, which was charming there but inexplicable at age 26. Not a fun but a thoughtful read.
With the understanding that it is an unfinished and undeveloped manuscript, I thought it was a terrific read. Notwithstanding the very shady circumstances of its publication, it met and exceeded my expectations. Despite the way it has been marketed, it isn't a finished novel and should not be compared with To Kill A Mockingbird as such. Bottom line: unfinished or not, it was a joy and a privilege to experience the world through Scout's eyes again, if only for a little while.
It was a little hard to get into, but the pace picked up after the first couple of chapters.  Some of the flashbacks to Scout's childhood were very funny.  It gets a little preachy towards the end, as Scout is vehemently against racism and believes that Atticus has become a racist.  However, that issue is more or less resolved and the title of the book helps the reader to understand why. " Go Set a Watchman", is a biblical quote from Isaiah 21:6, King James version.
It's different, in some ways, from her classic, To Kill a Mockingbird, but just as poignant and, maybe, more insightful.  It is too bad for all of us that we have only 2 writings from this profoundly talented person.<br/>I'm not sure what I expected but, whatever it was, I got more than my money's worth. The early reviews seemed slanted and made Atticus Finch a 'racist' but that slur doesn't stick. Atticus is the same Atticus - just viewed from a different perspective.
Ms. Lee's prose style is masterful. Virtually every sentence is a confection to be savored, the very best of Southern writing. I think she ended the book a bit abruptly, however, and seems to find a rough wisdom in having her narrator slapped and backhanded by her uncle. I would have expected the book to end with her permanent relocation to New York, but the heroine seems to accommodate the prejudices and meanness of her little town and wants to stay. I wouldn't have.
I remember seeing "To Kill a Mockingbird"  at a drive-in when I was about 10.  All I remember is Gregory Peck and the film being in black and white. So I read that book and found it to be very slow but necessary before reading "To Set aWatchman" .  Now this book was very good and gave me much to think about.<br/>Both books are going to one of my daughters, but I am reluctant to let Go Set a Watchman go as I would like to refer to it from time to time.
I looked for the name of the editor--none. It strikes me as strange that a book written so long ago and rejected upon first submission, could now be published as a unedited novel. I looked for shifts in voice or vocabulary and anything else that might distinguish Harper Lee's original work from that of a 21st century editor. I thought I saw some places; however, I will not cite the because I don't want to spoil any enjoyment other readers may derive from their own hunt.<br/><br/>My comments on the story are reflections based upon my own experiences during this period. My children attended an integrated elementsry school when we lived in Illinois. when we moved to Ohio,it did not come to our attention that the schools were not integrated until our fourth-grade daughter told us at the dinner table that her teacher told the class to go home and tell their parents to vote for George Wallace because unless he won, they would have to go to school with black kids. And our daughter said when teacher told untrue things about black kids, she raised her hand and stood up and told the teacher she was wrong. We asked our daughter what exactly she said.<br/><br/>She said, "I told her you don't know what your talking about. I went to school with black kids and my best friend was black."<br/><br/>We asked what the teacher said.<br/><br/>"She said thank you, sit down now. And, then she told us to write our spelling words five times."
For what it is - an unedited draft of a novel - this book isn't terrible.  The beginning seems to be without a plot, but it improves as it goes.  A lot of controversy has swirled about this novel, but for the time period it's set in, I don't think the narrative is particularly surprising.  People forget that Atticus Finch is a FICTIONAL character...regardless of his portrayal in this book, Harper Lee's personal convictions still come through in the persona of Scout.
Disappointing
When you revisit a book or an author you read as a young person, it can have a different feel. More life has come your way between the readings. I picked this up as I alway had fond memories of TKM. The same voice is there and many of the same characters but what I remembered as compelling and thought provoking seemed choppy, naive and puzzling with this reading.<br/><br/>Scout's take on the world hasn't changed that much and at times it is odd to think of her as a twenty-something woman with the way she views things. I can't say it's a huge surprise Atticus has changed, if indeed he has at all. There is a nice bit about growing up and recognising that those we  idolise can let us down, but I finished the read and put it down thinking it was not a grown up book.<br/><br/>It's a good beach read. I meandered my way through it over a few days between sips of wine or dips in the pool. There is a feint hint of unintentional cognitive dissonance as characters expound from time to time in grand soliloquies but lack the ability to translate that into action or higher level thinking. It's a relaxing read that might spark some dialogue on race relations but I can't say it's thought provoking.<br/><br/>This review is vacillating because I did really want to like it, and to a degree I did, but it wasn't what I had hoped. I think it is worth it to satisfy curiosity but it felt more like required reading for middle school or junior high.
I loved it.  I am so glad I purchased it....
"Scout" Finch, Atiicus' daughter is the principal character in this fascinating sequel to Kill a Mocking Bird. The tom boy turned rebel, Atticus himself, his brother Dr Mark, Hank, her fiance, Xania, her aunt and Calupurnia, her nurse are superbly drawn up characters in this wonderful book. some of the chapters are hilarious like Part V, Chapter 16 etc, which shows ms harper's keen sense of observation. some words jar. but overall worth the long wait.
Very good book
Disappointing.

Very good read
Is it not fascinating that entire groups of people reading this book react as if stung by the most base betrayal, not unlike Jean Louise herself?<br/><br/>To Kill a Mockingbird was written from the viewpoint of a child. In so many ways the story is simple yet never simplistic, fundamental yet always profound. It has resonated with readers for more than 50 years and will undoubtedly continue to do so for long into the future.<br/><br/>Rare is the parent who can trust that should his or her adult child discover the parent's feet of clay, love can survive even in the face of abject disagreement.  In Go Set a Watchman, Atticus Finch ultimately proves that he is deserving of not only his daughters love but of ours as well. He does this by loving his daughter enough to set her free, free from his shadow, free from his principles, free from his legend.  In so doing, ultimately freeing himself from the two dimensional caricatures into which folk heroes are too often twisted.<br/><br/>As Harper Lee's first book, Go Set a Watchman would not carry with it the growth of Scout\Jean Louise and the humble humanity of Atticus Finch, had it been published before To Kill a Mockingbird. Irrespective of criticisms, read in the order in which they were published rather than in which they were written, both novels provide a lyrical hymn that has never been sung for quite so long or quite so well.<br/><br/>Thank you Miss Lee.
Excellent companion to To Kill  Mockingbird
For those of us who grew up loving To Kill a Mockingbird as a book and a movie, this was sometimes hard to read. But it was still a moving experience revisiting the Finch family and their town. And we can appreciate that Mockingbird showed nobility in the face of harsh realities.<br/><br/>Despite what you may have heard about how things have changed, it is worthwhile to read for yourself, and reflect on what Harper Lee wanted to say about her world.
This is a hard book to review for me.  I remember the famous one, of course.  And I love the way she pictures the Southern ambiance.  In the twist she gives to Atticus' character from "Mockingbird", he is more real, less romanticized.  But something about the novel seems unnecessary, redundant.  To me, I think the original one impressed me most with its style.  This one has the same style, but less of it.  Or maybe I just didn't need it again.
I thought it was an excellent novel.  I liked that it was told from the more sophisticated, adult perspective.  Although the characters and place are the same as in To Kill a Mockingbird, the time frame and age of Jean Louise keep it from being the  innocent and idealistic story of Scout the child.  This book is blunt and forces us to look at the attitudes of both blacks and whites in the South during the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement.
This is the sequel to kill a mockingbird.  Atticus daughter returns as a grown-up to find out that her father is very human.  He is not this perfect man<br/>that she has on a pedestal.  As wonderful as he is, he has all the flaws-racism and bigotry that exist and she cannot cope with this new person. In her world everyone is the same.  She was raised by a black maid she adored,but even this wonderful woman felt different towards white people.
I'm enjoying the book.  Excellent writing.
Great Book, but not as good as Mockingbird
This touted book is one of the most boring books I have read recently..  Full of ego, self-absorption and arrogance of characters.
This book was very interesting to me, i am not one who likes these kind of books but i thought i would give it a try. Its very easy to read but seems you need to be on top of it to know how it goes and i am one who isn't patient enough but i tried my best and thought the book was ok. This book is more meant for people who are really into reading these.<br/><br/>I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review
My book club just read To Kill a Mockingbird so I decided to follow it up with Go Set a Watchman. This is another coming of age story except that Scout is 26 and living in NY. I think the reason TKAM is a classic is because it deals with issues that are still relevant today. Go Set a Watchman covers fewer issues but with the same poignancy. There is a scene between Scout and Calpurnia that just about broke my heart.  I recommend this book.
I went back and re-read To Kill a Mockingbird before reading Go Set a Watchman. True To Kill a Mockingbird is a much stronger book but it was fascinating to experience Harper Lee's growth as a writer and thought process. Go Set a Watchman brings up many important issues. I enjoyed how she debated two sides of such a sensitive subject so brilliantly. I feel these two great novels go hand in hand. I'm glad Go Set a Watchman was released.
really  really  enjoyed  it  An ee opener
I finished Go Set a Watchman last night. In my view, Atticus did not turn out to be an obnoxious racist. He was a white man in the South in the 1950's. He had the same level of knowledge as any other man in his location and generation.<br/>The story is told from the point of view of Scout as a college graduate after several years in New York City. It's short and rather disjointed, but those who loved TKAM will enjoy the novel.
Disappointing
Much too slow
Great reading
love the book
A great read!
One of the greatest writers of all time!
It is no "To KILL A Mockingbird"
Pure Harper Lee and well worth the read!
Really enjoyed it. Glad it was released.
Not as good as Mockingbird but loved it!
TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of my all time favorites and I was very curious about this book.  Knowing that this book was written first makes sense- you can really see how much Harper Lee's writing got better in the second book.  Even so, I enjoyed this book & think it is definitely worth reading. Having been a child in the South during the 1960's I could remember a lot of people who were like the characters in this book.
Harper Lee is an excellent writer.  Her stories have substance and make you think.  I enjoyed it.  I know that Atticus surprised some people but he was the "old south".  Thank God the "old south" will die off and younger thinking people will help to make needed changes.  Of course I liked To Kill a Mockingbird better, it was her second book and it was better, but I do not regret reading Go Set a Watchman.
Fictional characters are whom we want them to be, regardless of what their creator deems them to be. Atticus was always a creature of his culture but was able to do what wisdom demands, and that is the ability to hold to your beliefs and uphold the constitution that he swore to protect as an attorney. If Atticus is a racist, he is an enlightened one, which as dr finch stated..we need more of in the fifties...go scout,
Those who bemoan Atticus' change into a racist in this book simply haven't read it.<br/><br/>Is it as good as To Kill A Mockingbird? No, it isn't. But there is plenty of that Macomb magic to be had here, and the new narrative actually does pack some important points. It's worth reading, and not just as a literary exercise.<br/><br/>Now whether it should have been published at all is a question for another day...
I'm so glad I didn't listen to the reviews. I thought this book was great. This is a MUST read for anyone who loved TKMB.
This book offers Harper Lee's early observational descriptions and her deeply felt convictions of racism in the south. This seminal  book clearly captures a passionate young writer struggling certain southern aspects of life in a world she left behind when she left for New York.<br/>While not as polished as To Kill a Mockingbird it certainly lets us read her first work describing issues that still affect us today.
Jean Louise(Scout) is now 26 and living in New York, where attitudes towards Negros is very different to those of her hometown of Maycomb in Alabama. Scout is home for the  holidays and is shocked by what she sees as prejudice coming from her father, Atticus.  But is he really?<br/>Gaps between this book and "To Kill a Mockingbird" are filled in by flashbacks as Scout remembers her childhood in Maycomb..
Great sequel (or prequel, as the case may be) to a great book. Does not shy away from tough issues, and is well written.
I stopped reading this book becaus it was too disturbing... I decided I wanted keep my prior images of these characters.
As a South African I have been particularly interested and involved  in this book and the Southern U.S. attitude to 'race' and the development of the attitude towards black southern Americans which echoes the S African attitude at much the same time. I was particularly  interested in Uncle Jack's explanation.<br/>The characters  all rang true and I, personally, am delighted thT this book was finally published.
Whilst I disagree, I understand why some don't like Go Set a Watchman.  To Kill a Mockingbird was the truth told through a fairytale. People like fairytale truths. This sequel is too close to the inconvenient truths of southern American history. Nobody likes the truth, not the kind you find in Watchman. It is nonetheless the truth and there never can be enough of it. It's what separates us from the monsters.
I couldn't wait to read another book by Harper Lee and jumped at the chance to order "Go Set a Watchman". I read it straight through and thoroughly enjoyed trying to discover who/what was the watchman. The Biblical reference of the title sheds  a little light on the topic.  Is this book a journey of self discovery or another Harper Lee controversial classic?  You'll have to read it for yourself to find out!
I did not find the characterization of the elderly Atticus Finch objectionable, as some have. The time and place depicted in the novel must be considered before judging the characters. It was difficult for the South to deal with civil rights at that time, and anger seethed just below the surface. Scout's outrage showed just how her father had raised her, and spoke volumes. A good read with a lot of depth.
Well written.  I was brought up the way Scout's first impression of her father's attitude was toward race and respect.  However I was born and brought up in New England and then the New York tri-state area.  When I first went to the south on business and then lived there for 6 years I saw and heard things that I thought had long been changed in the south.  Not True.  I am glad I am back in the NY area.
Ms. Harper Lee can do no wrong. This is a fascinating account of her characters from the incomparable, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, decades after the incidents that took place in that first novel.  Languid and poetic, humorous and ponderous, it read smoothly and eloquently. Lee is a genius. Just wish her one time protégé, Capote, could have lived longer to have read this and maybe too have written more, too.
I loved meeting adult Scout.  It's not as polished of course, but so much more real and really what the summer of 2015 and the world needs.  Scout screams when she realizes who she is and where she came from is ordinary.  That her family was not perfect. They were ignorant in ways of their generation.  Unforgivable racist rhetoric we all wish prior generations had handled better, but do we?  Are we?
I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book . I had heard several bad reviews about it and they kept saying it was racist. But wasn't the first book about racism ? Scout comes home to visit and she's in her 20's.  This is a  story about overcoming her perceptions of her father . It doesn't have a very strong plot but it brings up what's scouts values and how she views the world and her fAmily .
Harper Lee is a fantastic writer...My only disappointment is that she is no longer with us to continue to write the fabulous characters that she develops. I felt blessed to be able to read another piece of her writing...The way Harper Lee brings her characters through their imagination and displays such rich images is a true art...If you loved To Kill A Mockingbird, this is a must read for you...
I really enjoyed reading this book. Makes me want to re read To Kill A Mockingbird. Highly recommend reading this.
Magnificent. I believe that too many people have misread Atticus. Any person from the South knows that there are different kinds of racists - non of whom are any more righteous than the other. Atticus would never had used the "n" word nor would knowingly have humiliated a person of color. This very sensual book will also appeal to people around the world. Ms. Lee is a national treasure!
Very good.  Like a step back in time.
The book starts out slow and gathers steam until you're flying down the tracks.  Just like the train on the cover.  It's written from the adult Scout's perspective as she come's for her annual visit to her father.  The story takes place in the deep South during 1950's desegregation and the beginning of the Civil Rights movement.  The era of Jim Crow.  it's a very interesting dynamic and, I believe, true to the social mores of the times.  Racism towards blacks was very prevalent at that period in time and this story reflects that view point.  This book deals with the NAACP, Reconstruction, and white supremacy in small town American.  It also represents the Southern view of the Civil War, why it was fought and the repercussions on Southern culture and society, which I found extremely interesting.<br/><br/>To Kill a Mockingbird was a story told from a child's perspective.  Go Set a Watchman is the adult version of Scout and how she grows and matures as an adult.  It is a fitting sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird.<br/><br/>Harper Lee is such a wonderful writer.  I wish that she has published more books. I think that she could have been one of the great Southern writers of her generation.
Disappointed
a great read
No thank you
Great book..
Disappointed
Disappointed
This book is actually an early draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, but any similarity with that romantic classic ends there. This tough, realistic story could have benefited from further refinement of characters, but it offers fascinating insights about a young woman and her complex life in a small Southern hometown and her dismay with the ironically small-minded Northern "elite."
Tried reading this novel as a freestanding work and not comparing it to "To Kill a Mockingbird".  There are some moments of gifted writing but overall I found it lacking in many areas.  Especially found the ending incredulous.  Difficult to believe someone could go from such red hot anger to acceptance/understanding so quickly.
Looking forward to reading this book
WOnderful story and so well written.
Love her writing! Thank you so much!
It was interesting to see how many things have not changed in the South, since this book was actually written.  I feel the story was based on actual history, however I was disappointed in Scout's father, as she was, after reading To Kill a Mockingbird years ago and picturing Gregory Peck from the movie as someone ahead of his time, guess I will have to rethink that notion.
An unusual original book.I  LOVE IT
no as good as To kill a Mockingbird
The book explains a very subtle Southern point of view that I was not aware of.  It not necessary to compare this to, To Kill a Mockingbird which was I thought one of the very best books about American life in the south during the depression era. Go Set a Watchman stands on its own.  It would be appreciated and respected even if To Kill a Mockingbird had not preceded it.
Great Book and worthwhile to read.
Interesting contrast with Mocking Bird but alternates with the present and the past (reviews some of the events in Mocking Bird); again struggles with race and prejudice; not sure how she came up with the title "Go Set A Watchman" it's mentioned in Isaiah 21:6 the Jewish prophets were watchmen for the coming of God's judgement if Israel did not repent!!
I had forgotten what a joy it was to read Harper Lee's words; she had a real gift for storytelling. The closer I got to the end of the book the more I wished it weren't going to end.  As far as all the naysayers and the controversy over Atticus' racism, all I can say is go back and read it again and maybe this time you'll realize what Harper Lee  actually said.
I thought the book painted a very good picture of the South I grew up in my youth. I think it left us with hope that things would change for the better and I think they definitely have since then. It shows the struggle that was going on all over the South with all people black and white. A good read and very emotional at the end. I would recommend this book.
Considering this was Harper Lee's first real effort at a novel, it is an incredibly well written book.  Had she dusted it off and polished it up a bit when she was still capable, it would have been another classic.  I think the book gets some bad publicity because Atticus Finch  comes across as less than a saint.  "To Kill a Mockingbird"  is such a part of our collective psyche.  Both the book and the movie make Atticus an icon, a beacon of hope for all that is good.  In Watchman he is much more human and pragmatic.  After reading "Go Set a Watchman" I immediately reread Mockingbird.  Atticus was pragmatic in Mockingbird as well.  He was an attorney, he had a job to do, and he did it to the best of his ability.  He was driven more by his belief in fairness under the law, than he was by his love for his fellow man.  Anyway, Watchman is a good book, and really is an important book.  Lee was writing about issues and problems that existed in the 1950s, and here we are in 2015 and the veneer of civility towards whoever doesn't look like us is still very, very thin.

Okay novel.
I truly enjoyed this book,  but not in the same way as Mockingbird!  I found it difficult to get into as the character of Scout was so different - as it should be when every child "grows up"; but I could not stop reading it!  Once the true plot, or reason, of the story became apparent, I was as crazy about the characters as when they were younger!
I was very confused & bored until I got halfway through the book that's when the story came alive. The way Jean Louise realized the real deal & owning her feelings I was so proud. Loved Uncle Jack's character & the way her dad took it from her priceless. I typically don't buy books but couldn't wait. I read it in 6 hours. Harper Lee you still got it girl!
It was okay. Not what I expected.
Better than To kill A Mockingbird
I agree with many reviewers who thought the ending left you hanging.  It seemed abrupt - one minute you are in the story, the next, it's over.  I, like most people whose first experience with Atticus is from To Kill a Mocking Bird, was shocked by his character in Watchman.  It took me a while to get to a point with the characters in the book that I could maybe see what Harper Lee might have been going for.<br/><br/>Between To Kill a Mocking Bird and Go Set a Watchman we have the full picture of Atticus the man.  The trick is to understand that neither book is actually about Atticus.  Both books are about Scout and her view of her father as a child seeing her father as a larger-than life hero, and the best dad in the whole wide world; and the reality of a grown daughter in Watchman, who sees her father for who he really is.<br/><br/>If you can read Go Set a Watchman through that lense, it is a rich story about seeing a parent for who they really are, and the disappointment of their not being who we thought they were; and yet still loving them anyway.
Harper Lee's descriptive powers and ability to pull you into her world are on full display. scout<br/><br/>The book needed to be published.  Harper Lee's gifted writing is on full display.  And Scout is still Scout and Atticus is still a good man limited by his time in history.  And the uncle is a special man out of his time.  I loved this book.
I loved this story!  Harper Lee is magnificent in character depictions and creating believable backgrounds.  My only slight criticism is that the manuscript needed more refining, but for a pre-quell to "To Kill a Mocking Bird" it explains a lot of how the second story came about.  I am reading again Mocking Bird and enjoying it once more.
Just ok.  A little hard for me to follow some of the text, but I did not think any less of Atticus
another great book by harper lee
Disappointed.  Not well written.
i was disappointed not very good
Given all the controversy, I expected I would not like this book.  However, Lee is a fine writer and her narratives are a joy to read.  She has painted a multi-dimensional picture with great clarity and depth.  Her characters are real people who grow, adapt and change.  She clearly understands society, culture, relationships and love.  Brava!
Having read the author's previous book, it was a thrill to see how life continued in the south. It is amazing that the author was able to know the future for this county and it's inhabitants. The characters have so many facets to their personalities. They are so complex and so simple at the same time. Really enjoyed this book by Harper Lee.
I don't know really what to think, did Harper Lee write it? To kill a Mockingbird so good, this one I could not really get into. Missed the brother, Boo and the neighbors. Think it should have stayed where they so called found it. Some day may found out who really wrote it. Sad to try and make money on a wonderful book. Don't buy it. Joella
I appreciated feeling the whole story finally  unfolding.  Attempting to read the 'first page' of Go Set a Watchman I only read half a page before closing my kindle in disgust.  Don't know why!!  Obviously I later started again and now both books are back up there.  Thank you Harper Lee, your books are particularly relevant today.  Jillian
What a marvelous read.  To see Scout grow, develop and come to the true understanding of her Father's involvement was amazing.  Once I finished reading it, I read it again.  The original "critics" of this book totally misled the world with their descriptions.  To Kill a Mockingbird and Go Set a Watchman should be required reading.
I thought it was pretty decent. The beginning is really good but as the book drags on it gets a bit boring. Atticus being a racist works because as the reader struggles to cope with it so does Scout. I do wish you learn more about Scout's life in NY, but that does not take too much away from the book. Overall think it is worth reading.
Having loved "To Kill a Mockingbird" for many, many years, this book was rather a shock.  I would never have expected Atticus Finch to hold so many very ugly opinions.  However, as a life-long southerner, I know all too well that these were, and too often still are, the way things go in the south.  This book was an eye-opener!
There is much to ponder in this book.  As a daughter who fought with her father over the same issues in different times, I'm still trying to understand the father who was such a good man with ingrained standards I couldn't accept.  Read it and read it again -- we all need to understand the problem so we can work to find the solutions.
Brilliant writing with memorable aphorisms, particularly the one about faith and prejudice. However, some diatribes reflective of civil rights issues were so ahead of their time that it's good the publisher insisted she write the prequel  I don't think this would have caught on like Mockingbird did. She was too far ahead of any of us.
What a waste of time and money.
I am so glad I read this again.
A very good news for literature
A very interesting view of life
Such a waste of time and money.
Good read.
i hated it
Easy read.
Good read.
Great book
It was OK.
Adult Scout learns the shocking lesson that the man whom she most admired & loved, her father, Atticus, was different than her childhood vision of  him. Harper Lee's writing is intense, passionate, and sensitive as she delineates her beloved characters. What a remarkable companion to<br/> "To Kill a Mocking Bird".
Great to have a first edition!
This book makes you think about snap judgments when one thinks differently.....very differently.  It challenges to look at the whole picture and history.  It also shows the hideous views of the south even when things should have been inching forward.  Her writing is marvelous.  I wonder why it was put aside for so long?
People are complex, the Old South is a way of thought, and morality is undeniable. Lee never takes the easy way out, instead of two dimensional super heroes, she brings us real people who contemplate life's biggest issues and behave morally evenwhen to do so is difficult. It's a revelatory and deeply satisfying novel.
I loved this book! It was so intriguing to get a glimpse of the authors more raw sentiments since this was the first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird.  I greatly appreciated her discussion on racism and feel that it is very applicable and helpful in considering present-day circumstances of race relations in our nation.
If "To Kill A Mockingbird" was so beloved, this book deserves this as well. It is raw, the feelings expressed are real. It deals with how people become who they are, and what is home when home has changed beyond recognition.  What race means. What living in the South means - all through Harper Lee's prescient vision.
I really enjoyed the book.  Different from TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD in that there were unexpected differences regarding the characters.  Most enjoyable thing to me was that Scout has still, as an adult, maintained that independence, boldness, and has still been portrayed as a "character!"  Writing was wonderful.
The woman at the library who checked this out to me actually whispered that she had been afraid to read it "because of what everyone is saying about it." Today, after carefully reading it twice, I returned it to her and said "Don't be afraid of this book; it is a masterpiece!" And that is what I say to any of you who are taking the time to read my review. Do not let the politically (in)correct thought police dissuade you from reading this book. There are some revelations in it that may surprise you, but they are not the point of the novel. The REAL point is revealed in the last two chapters, and it is a wise truth. I wish I had had this novel as a cushion when I had to grapple with this truth in my own life. Harper Lee once said that she had never written another novel after "Mockingbird" because she had said everything she had to say. She was wrong. She had one VERY important thing left to say, and she says it here.
I love to read books set in the south. I realize everything is not black and white and s did Jean Louise.  Thus book shows how kids idolize their fathers but then grow up and they fall off the pedestal<br/>I would recommend this book to any adult. What a fantastic use if the English language. Extremely well written
I liked the book, but not nearly as much as To Kill a Mockingbird.  The characters were not brought to life on each page in this book as much as they were in Mockingbird.  It was, however, a quick and easy read, and did give this Northern girl more of an idea of the mindset of Southerers back in that time period.
Well written and appropriate.
Now a must, with Mockingbird.
Not as good for all the hype.
A thoughtful read and insight into the human experience . Surely was not predictable - a journey with twists and turns.  Ms. Lee had set the bar so high , hard to top her first success . I feel fortunate to have a first edition . Will cherish this book and pass it on to future generations . Thank you very much .
good book
Excellent

This book, despite its long-awaited release, somehow manages to live up to the hype. The narrative is beautiful, and takes the reader back to the original story without feeling derivative. Seeing Scout all grown up and beginning to find her own way in the world was amazing, and a delight.
As a guy I unfortunately found this book boring.  There were parts that were so slow that I found my mind wandering & had to go back. I'm sorry to say there were no redeeming qualities to give this any more than one star. Sorry Harper.
Well, I have only read two chapters and I am thoroughly enjoying *Go Set a Watchman."  Why be afraid I won't like the old/new Atticus Finch? Great writing by a great writer is all I ask!
Very interesting book for YA or adults. Vocabulary and sentence structure from the 50s era makes it a challenge for younger readers. Interesting to see how views have changed in 60 years. I finished it last night but plan to read it again soon. Will reread To Kill a Mockingbird first.
A thoroughly enjoyable book, even considering the topic. It was well written, as usual. Jean Louise was still such a character that the story could not have been told through anyone else's eyes. I grew up in the South, in the 50's & 60's and can appreciate the dilemmas going on here.
So glad I ordered the book
it was better than I hoped
could not wait to read it.
I enjoyed this story and was so glad the book was finally published. The characters were well depicted and although not as developed as in "To Kill A Mockingbird" I could relate to them. The tomboy Scout was still there as well as the southern flavor of the first book.
I was very impressed with Harper Lee's style of writing.  I have seen the movie,"Mockingbird" many times, but never read the book, so this was a wonderful first experience for me.  Her style is captivating and makes the reader not want to stop, even at the chapter's end.  I found myself wanting to ask her questions about motivation and Scout's true feelings about the people in her small town.  I wondered at the end if she could possibly live there with a clear conscience and acceptance of the people who she felt had deceived her all the years before.<br/>It opened my mind to some of the strange thinking processes of people who live in small towns.  I've lived in both small towns and large cities, and I like both, but still keep that protective cloak around me.  I wish we could have more of Harper Lee.
Well written and a sequel well-told. I believe the story would have been better enjoyed if the book were released forty years ago.  Too much political correctness and harrumphing diminishes just being in the moment with the book and the Finches, who after all are only human.
Took awhile to get into it, but, comparable to Mockingbird...some very interesting insights in the Southern viewpoint at that time in history...found I could readily agree with the viewpoints presented...spoiler alert.....ATTICUS IS NOT A RACIST as purported in some reviews
An all-time anticipated book did not disappoint.  I can understand why publishers were reluctant to publish this when it was written.  The plot and many of the characters are racially inflammatory, not a good thing to stir up in the 1950s.  While Mockingbird also had its inflammatory characters, they were acting as expected.  Not so in Watchman. It is unfortunate that the literary world has not had both of Harper Lee's novels to debate and quarrel over for the  last half century.  However, the debate over the last two months has been entertaining.  The enigma surrounding Watchman will long outlast interest in the book itself, and that's a pity.  Watchman is a good read.  Taken with Mockingbird, Lee's coming of age for the southern region novels will be read and studied for years.  And justifiably so.
I read "To Kill A Mocking Bird" first because I had never read it.  I saw the movie when I was a teenager, when it first came out.  I loved both books. Excellent writing, but it was strange that she waited so long to print the other book.  I would love to know why.
Word had it that in this book, Atticus is portrayed as a bigot and a racist. Scout has grown up, or is in the process of growing up, and finding out things about her father that probably eluded her as a younger child. Very interesting book for anyone who ever had a father.
Especially timely during conflict over flying the Confederate flag. For the"other 95%", it means pride in the Southern culture, and a bit of rebellion against the Federal government. Not unlike their Northern counterparts who fear too large a federal presence in our lives.
Yes, amid all the controversy, I still had to pre-order. LOVE her sense of humor and it is fluent in this book. Yes, it's choppy and not what we'd expect after To Kill A Mockingbird; but, I don't care because her style and wit is there and that's what I love about Ms Lee.
As this is Harper Lee's first novel, I found the characters to be well developed and the plot to flow quite evenly, as it went back and forth between the past and the present. It's not the masterpiece that To Kill a Mockingbird has become, but it is well worth the read.
Mesmerizing - I only wish the story could have been longer.  I didn't want it to end. Through a story that is replete with love, affection, and delightful, southern humor, Harper Lee builds emotional tension that explodes like an Independence Day fireworks grand finale.
This beautifully written piece chronicles the thinking and realizations of Scout as a young adult. It is thought-provoking and challenging just as Mockingbird was, maybe even moreso. While I will never know if Nelle Harper Lee truly wanted it published, I treasure it.
I have to wonder if those who have voiced disappointment for this book actually read the entire book. Or, if they did, if they did not give as much thought to the later part of the book because they disagreed with or took issue with the earlier portion of the story.
I was enthralled with _TKaM_ back when it came out.I was 12 and full of youthful idealism. I had never encountered bigotry,and my Mom did her best to explain it without ruining my outlook on humanity. Needless to say,the book inspired many of my generation,and future generations,to be lawyers,social-workers,and teachers.Save the world kind of people.<br/>Then,I heard about this book.I have read so many negative reviews.Atticus is not the Atticus I knew and loved.<br/>So maybe I won't love Atticus this time around.Maybe he is a curmudgeon,a grumpy old man.A racist.But the book,no matter how awful he is,should be read. So far,I am not hating it,or disappointed with it. I'm grown up now,and know that people change as they go along in life.<br/>I will give it a chance.
A very compelling story of a conflicted young southern lady who had escaped to New York and has returned for a visit to her small home town in the South, where she is brought back to realities of life there.  The only criticism:  it ends too soon-- wanting more!
I really liked the book!
Just depressing somehow.
Lee does not disappoint.
This novel should be read as independent of  To Kill a Mockingbird. It is more realistic of the times. It is  enlightening and so human, with its sadness and it joys. The ever present need to make right decisions for the future and good of others.<br/>Vicki

Great!!!
To Kill a Mockingbird has always been one of my favorite novels, so I was extremely excited for the release of Go Set a Watchmen and I was not the least bit disappointed. Harper Lee's writing captivates the complexities of Jean Louise's realization that her father is not the God she believed him to be, a relatable truth that we all eventually realize as we transition to adulthood. This novel paints the picture of the difficulty of standing up for what you believe in despite the accepted opinion. The novel also amazed me with its topical relevance today, even though it was written over half a century ago. I would highly recommend this novel both for its beautiful writing and important context in relation to society, relationships, and justice.
This is not a sequel, but a first novel that was recrafted into the masterpiece.  It gets too preachy at times and weakens at the end, but it was brave and quite bold for its time.  The character and plot development in To Kill a Mockingbird is amazing.
I have been so disappointed to read such scathing reviews; especially regarding Atticus. I have fallen in love with the characters even more in the way that Harper Lee presents them this time. I feel there is more genuine honesty about them. Atticus was a man of a very different era and just feared as many did. It is a good way to analyse people's vulnerabilities and also how even though Atticus was still not quite ready, what he has managed to teach his child is something to be admired. Will need to read again when not feeling so overwhelmed and fragile from this incredible story.
As a liberal who was very fortunate to spend my early 20's in San Francisco during the 60's,  I simply wrote off most Southerners as mean-spirited, thoughtless bigots.  Having read this book, I no longer can nor want to hold that unsophisticated opinion.<br/><br/>Harper Lee's book has given me a lot to think about as I ponder the nuances of being a responsible Southerner.  Clearly these folks live a more complicated reality by necessity.<br/><br/>Further, the book has given me an insight regarding a question that often has occurred to me after reading the work of Southern writers in general. "Why are Southern authors so skillful in developing complex, multifaceted characters?"<br/><br/>I recommend this book wholeheartedly.
I enjoyed it very much.
Wasn't what I expected.
Fast delivery and great read.<br/><br/>Go Set A Watchman is extremely interesting to anyone who read and loved To Kill A Mockingbird, although, as expected, the first novel was far superior. With the context, it was a valuable and enjoyable sequel.
I felt that Harper had more to say but never got round to it. I enjoyed the read but was expecting so much more. It's like she cracked open a can of worms, got one whiff of the smell and decided not to go there. But maybe that was her plan all along.
I gave this book a five star because it cast a spell on me and made me a part of the Finch family, made me walk in Scouts footsteps, made me feel her pain and made me examine my beliefs about bigotry.  This book is a no stop read. Hope for a sequel.
Harper Lee does it again! Can't believe it took so long for this novel to come out! Great read! a MUST read! Purchased this one since I had to read "To Kill A Mockingbird" and I enjoyed the read. Will we get a movie for this one? I hope so!
It's interesting that a book written so many years ago could still be so incredibly relevant especially with recent events. I enjoyed the book tremendously and wished it didn't end. It definitely makes you think about how little times have changed.
I enjoyed Scouts steps out of childhood.  I managed to avoid Mockingbird for 54 years and was prompted to read both books sequentially.  Now I feel like it should be a trilogy.  I'd like to see Scout step into Atticus shoes and become infallible.
The author definitely paints pictures with her choice of words. I thought the ending was a bit rushed or perhaps not as developed as I would have preferred; I wanted more of the explanation for Atticus' choice but I so understood what was needed.
Both Scout and Atticus are disappointing to me yet far more realistic. The novel is sort of slow moving, has some moments of insight, and provides a much more nuanced and realistic version of the fictional Maycomb, MIssissippi fourteen years on.
Go set a watchman is set many years after to kill a mockingbird. Scout is a young lady of 26 who is home for two weeks from New York.<br/><br/>She is disappointed in her home town and in her Atticus stance on civil rights. This is quite a difference from the Atticus in TKAM.<br/><br/>I can only say this seems a half written book. I expected the trail of the maids grandson and the way Scout approaches this to be the next focus of the book. And to show how she rallies the town to her cause, or maybe not.<br/><br/>There is no mystery or allure in this book, no multi-level plot like in TKAM but there could of been had Harper Lee wanted to finish it and have it published. She obviously didn't on both counts.
There were many times that I laughed out loud and a few times it brought tears to my eyes.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read a good author and would like to get a better understanding of the race issues in the early 50's.
While Harper Lee's voice is ever present, it was not as enjoyable a read as the first person account of "To Kill A Mockingbird." The book was a bit too political and angry for me to find the pleasure reading "Go Set A Watchman."
This book is very much a sequel of "To Kill a Mockingbird."  I was very glad I read it again before reading "Go Set a Watchman."  Scott's reflections on her experiences in the first book are added to in the second which links the two books. Scout has retained her fiery nature, a quality that endeared me to her in "To Kill a Mocking Bird." Watching this play out, I cringed and cowered as she acted in a way that would have estranged my northern family in this "Coming-of-Age novel.<br/>The tensions that Harper Lee described in this small southern town during the civil unrest during the '60s, gave me insights into the difficulties that this stratified society faced at that time.
This is a good book although I know some people did not like it because of the connection to the Klan. What amazed me is that this was written before "To Kill a Mocking Bird" but it seems to follow it just like a sequel written later.
“the time your friends need you is when they’re wrong, Jean Louise. They don’t need you when they’re right—”<br/><br/>This book is not about Atticus being a racist. It's about Atticus being a man. And he's still a great man, in my opinion.
Superb. Simply superb.
I thought it was great
Loved the book but felt short changed , the ending came suddenly and felt like it had been written by someone else. Despite all that I did enjoy the book, the writing style is superb and the the characters true to character . Frances
It was interesting but I thought a bit thin. Not a lot of advance from "To Kill a Mocking Bird" as far as opinions and life style went. Even by the end Scout had not grown up much. And I thought it was mean to kill off Jem!
I read it as a stand-alone work of fiction.  It has been so long since I read "Mockingbird" that I don't remember a lot of the details anyway.  I liked this book and considered the time period in  which Harper Lee wrote it.
A big disappointment.
Couldn't put it down!
A MUST READ !!!!!!!!!
Absolutely beautiful.
If you compare it to "To Kill a Mockingbird" you may not like this book.  However, having read both I loved it.  I love how Scout came through  the idealistic life of childhood to adulthood.  Growing pains are always hard.
Forget all the negative hype.  Beautifully well-written book.
Although many who loved To Kill a Mockingbird didn't like this book, I thought it was great.  Having grown up & left Alabama for New York, on her return she sees her Southern family & friends in a different, more realistic light.
Disclaimer...I haven't finished yet and may not!  I love to read, but this is so slow...I keep falling asleep.  I haven't got to a plot yet....just ramblings.  I loved to kill a mockingbird....this is not the same.  I just don't think I can justify wasting any more of my time on his book.  Very disappointing!
Harper Lee's description of the Southern perspective and values at that point in time are beautifully developed. I have a keen appreciation for her creativity as a writer, and her insight into psychology. This was a great read.
As good a read as To Kill A Mockingbird. I thought Harper Lee captured perfectly the difficult times the South had during the civil rights movement, and I sympathized with both sides. Should be required reading in high schools.
To appreciate the story one has to read it to and through the last chapter the reviews is slanted to create an unfair picture of Atticus Finch. I enjoyed the book and felt that Scout was less disappointed as the story unfolded.
It was a great book and I'm glad it appeared as a sequel to Kill A Mockingbird.  I understand it was written before that book and was lost.  Needed to read To Kill A Mockingbird (again since it was a long time ago I read it).
A different approach to Atticus and Scout's story. The author gives amazing insight on humanity and how racism effects it. I suggest reading this novel in conjunction with Lee's other well-known novel, To KiIl a Mockingbird.
Love it
Boring.
Rip off
I listened to Reese Witherspoon's reading of "Go Set A Watchman".  She nailed it.  Characters' voices are authentic and nuanced. I think this is one of those books that is more appealing because of the fine reading.
Harper Lee has a very descriptive way of telling the story which has some surprising pages toward the end.  I was expecting a different outcome, but had been forewarned by the book reviews that had come out for its launch.
This was very disappointing. Hard to imagine Jean Louise (Scout) as an adult.<br/>She still seemed to speak lin the voice of young Scout. Difficult not to compare with To kill a Mockingbird (one of my all time favorites)
This is a challenging book for anyone who has read and loved To Kill a Mockingbird, to which this is the sequel. It is difficult to understand and accept. But I have given it 5 stars because it is beautifully written and takes on complex issues in the pre-intergation South. The characters deepen and confuse, but their struggles are real struggles. The progression of Scout's rebellion and then understanding is well depicted. I believe we come to love the characters even more. If you don't want your love for the characters in To kill a Mockingbird changed in any way, then I would skip this book. But I am glad I read it. Barbara Hughes
Reading "Go Set a Watchman" followed by a rereading of "To Kill a Mockingbird" increases your appreciation of both books and makes clear that they are well matched companions that should be read together.
Boring.  I was looking forward to a good read, but I was bored stiff.  Due to the price, even the Kindle price, I MADE myself finish it.......not worth the money for me.
nicely written piece
Big fan, great book!
I was only going to read this book to see what all the clamor was about.  Having read "To Kill a Mockingbird" I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was happy to find the answer to question was Atticus Finch a racist.
Same wonderful style as was To Kill a Mockingbird. Harper Lee addressed a difficult time in the South and gave the issue character and depth without sacrificing the principles that were reflected in her earlier work.
I really related to this trip back to Maycom.  And I love To Kill a Mockingbird as a true classic. She is a different but wonderful writer.  The return to Jean Louise's (Scout's) home was very healing for me and my own issues. Thankfully this book was published for all of us to enjoy. This book may deal more up front with racial issues that still are prominent even today in the South and elsewhere. Harper Lee had keen insight on these issues and was not afraid to speak up. The equalization of  Forgiveness is a long row to hoe, but hopefully this book will carry this  journey a little farther along that healing row,
A great read.  Good companion book to "To Kill a Mockingbird" beautifully written book about the earlier times of the South.  I did not find it racist and it did not offend me in any way.
Will become a great companion novel to Bird. I am so glad to read more of this writers voice, even if it is not as great in comparison. Jean Louise was a kind of Holden Caufield. I just love her.
Though the language is not as eloquent as to kill a mockingbird, its content strikes deep. I would see it less as a critique of Atticus, who is whom he always was as a father, but an honest look at what hap[pens to our heroes as we grow up and look at them with the eyes of an adult. Jean Louise comes into her own, she makes a stand in the only way our Scout of old could do and it is a heart-wrenchingly necessary and beautiful thing. In the end, though not as polished, for obvious reasons, it has its own eloquence and its own palce as an enduring work
The child character has grown up and life twists and turns.  A gripping story told where the reader is in a viewing seat seeing the story unfold. Glad to have read "Go Set A Watchman."
Book was able to grab my attention easily. Story was easy to follow till last 3 chapters. Made it hard to follow and understand what the author wanted to have us learn. Ending I feel confused.
I reread To Kill A Mockingbird before reading this 2nd book.  I loved the relationship between Scout and her father.  Especially as she grew up and realized he was not perfect, or infallible.
Thought it would another trial story but thought it was interesting to get the information regarding Scout and her father in the interim years.  A must read for anyone wanting a classy story.
This is an outstanding book. It allows you to feel Scout's emotion as a child and an adult. Harper touched on some controversial subjects that allows the reader to open their eyes with Scout.
Great!
GREAT!
SHERRY
Boring
Very interesting to be able to read Nother work by Harper Lee. I'm very good book that I was not able to put down. I would recommend reading this book and forming your own thoughts about it.
Interesting! Scout at eight yesr's old is now different at late 20's<br/>Everyone evolves and so might Scout!  That whole generation in 50's was scared of change.<br/>I liked the book.
I read To kill a mockingbird first and then this book, was surprised at the complete turn around of the characters in their<br/>thinking, both on the part of the blacks and the whites.
I was not only riveted throughout the book but I think I understand why Harper Lee wanted to publish this book. It is an extremely timely parable for our day and conversational climate.
I watched the movie as a child with my mother (she had to hold my hand in the scenes) and felt the same loss of innocence as Scout, until that time I was “color blind”.  I read the book years later as a teenager and fell in love with Atticus Finch.  So many years later I share dissolution with Jean Louise.  It was a bittersweet experience.  Still, I am glad this book was published.  I missed Boo Radley who was always my childhood hero.  Harper Lee, are you certain you have nothing else to say?  There is time enough still.
After reading the NYTimes review, I didn't think that I'd like it. I absolutely loved it! All I have to say is that Scout is some gal! You have to read it to find out for yourself. :-)
It is difficult to judge this novel since reading To Kill A Mockingbird many years before reading this.  This novel had a rather mushy ending, and it had the effect of slamming a door.
I enjoyed reading the book because of the historical significance. That's the way things were back then.  Also, I liked the movie "To Kill a Mockingbird".  I'm glad I read it!
Should have left it in the vault.
I have read only the first 80 pages so far, but I find it a rather ordinary portrayal of stock characters as done by a beginning writer who knows the rules but doesn't have the spirit.  Where is the sassy Scout of TKMB?  Her boy friend is dull and tiresome.  The aunt is a caricature.  The cousins are freakish and unreal.  I am sorry I bought the book but I will dutifully finish it, and I know that if a writer does not make the reader snap to attention in the first paragraph there is not much use in going on.  Remember how Margaret Mitchell set the stage for the entire book in that first paragraph of GWTW.  She rewrote it 50 times before she got it right.<br/>Harper Lee should have done the same.  This book is not awful. lt is just not very good.
An excellent book that perhaps couldn't be published in the '50s since it spoke of racism in that time. Maybe sad that could not happen but in the end we got two great novels.
Harper Lee's newly published book Go Set a Watchman has not been out a full 24 hours,. but already the length of the posted reviews appear to take as long to read as the book itself. I give Watchman three stars because it is obviously the first draft of Mockingbird and the editor rightly told Lee to go back and write about Scout's childhood  And thus we have the wonderful literary classic To Kill A Mocking Bird<br/>  . The manuscript for Watchman supposedly lay in a safe deposit  box where it was no doubt placed by Lee's older sister and adviser,  Alice who died several years ago. Now who do you suppose "found" that manuscript and brought it out for publication? Not Nelle, as she is called, who is a recluse as shy as Boo Radney.<br/>  Nevertheless, it is an interesting read, beautifully written as Nelle is a splendid writer with a good sense of humor. Writers and publishers will find the evolution of this new book an interesting study. Nelle herself has said she "had no where to go but down." probably true for she will no  longer e known as a "one book wonder". Its publication won't do her great harm, though the timing of Watchman's publishing in 2015 is not as crucial as the 1960 publication of Mocking Bird. A lot of water has gone under the bridge and a lot of words inked across pages since then. But by all means read Watchman. it's time well spend with a fine author.
Easy-to-read; a good beach book. I think that perhaps, after writing this book first, she later felt to need in "To Kill a Mockingbird" to give Atticus a softer edge.
Definitely a " keeper" though I didn't think so when I first began reading. Actually a book with very deep meaning, and definitely true to the time about  which it is written
I almost put it away,and then I couldn't put it down. I recently moved to SC from S. Florida andI found it thought provoking, interesting, and written way before its time.
This should be published in the same "book" as "mockingbird " as it's really the other side of the coin; the second, missing, half.<br/><br/>A must read!
I loved it!  I hadn't read  To Kill a Mockingbird for maybe 10 years and didn't notice the discrepancies with time.  I love Atticus.  His love for his daughter is amazing.
I had never read "To Kill A Mockingbird" so I read it first. Having lived during these racial times, I found the characters so genuine and the emotions compelling.
I really enjoyed the book. It told a story from the 50's which was pretty accurate and it was written in a lovely style. I liked it a lot even though it told a hard story.
To me the book started slowly but and sometimes lagged  but I enjoyed the book. To me it was a continuation of TKAM. I also love reading anything dealing with Harper Lee.
With carefully developed awareness of personal / racial / ethical / justice issues in the USA 1950s - 1970s.  Good historical background to "Kill a Mockingbird".
A bit too heavy and conflicts with To Kill a Mockingbird. Entertaining in it's own right but not to be confused or connected with the "Master Tale of Them All".
Clearly the most vivid and truthful story about the feelings and deep felt concerns of the generation of our southern fathers, mothers, and peers.  Benevolence was subjected to constant misrepresentation and misunderstanding.  Those who find this uncomfortable might be foolishly assuming that they are able to look into the hearts of men and judge the motivations of those men.  A "must read" and "must discuss".  Better than "To Kill A Mockingbird".
I persona;;y think this is a wonderful book.  The whole issue is not just black and white and I think this book deals with that.  Would be a wonderful discussion book.
Excellent book.
love the books.
Read this book!
Very good book.
not that great.
To understand all the wisdom, one needs to read it several times. Such good wisdom for our day, when tolerance is so badly needed. How badly we need an Attixus Finch
The novel starts to "disintegrate" towards the end, but the rest of the story is written superbly, and is very revealing about Southern, small-town culture.
Walk into the warm and fragrant Southern past.  Learn much about race relationships as seen through the eyes of those that lived in those days.  I loved this book!
An excellent life lesson. Just need to judge the book in its entirety. What I learned: bigot -- a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions.
It is a little different from what I expected. The first half was pretty good, but it seems like the author forgot what she was talking about during the 2nd half.
We need to read this now more than ever.  Harper Lee has done another masterful job at sharing the human condition .
This book has been hijacked by a shady, greedy lawyer who is probably guilty of elder abuse. DO NOT BUY IT. Do not read it. For more information, pleasE go here:<br/>[...]
EXCELLENTLY written.  Could just imagine each character and "see" this small town.  This story is pertinent today .......unfortunately!!<br/><br/>.
i don't want to give anything away. It's not so easy to love these characters, but in real life nobody is easy to love. You have to work towards understanding.
I am only sorry there are no other writings by Harper Lee!  I am SO glad this one was allowed to see the light of day.  Thank you, Ms. Lee, for both of them.
OK for reading
Disappointment
I think you must read To Kill a Mockingbird first.  In my humble opinion, Set a Watchman is a tremendous sequel to Mockingbird.  The pace of the writing, the word usage, the complicated communication btwn Atticus's brother and Scout is awesome.  Takes some real thinking and perhaps a re-read to bring it into focus.  If you did not have the background of Gem and others, Set a Watchman might be too far sighted to be really appreciated.
Sure glad she wrote "To Kill a Mockingbird". It is a much better book. Her attempts to justify white supremacy attitudes in this book left me cold.
A good depiction of 1950's Southern America and a young woman's struggle to reconcile her childish worship of her father with the reality of his clay feet.
Outstanding even better than 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  If anyone tries to understand the South and particularly the era, Ms Lee captures its very essense.
People who think Atticus suddenly turned into a bigot are mistaken. A bigot is unwilling to listen to the other side. Read the book and see for yourself!
Great follow-up to Mockingbird and Scout as an adult. Re-read Mockingbird for third time prior to starting the new book and that made it better. Loved it
She is genius. Loved Uncle Jack revealing to her that all her problems stemmed from her father-God complex.<br/>Great revelation for the young and old alike. A truth.<br/><br/>5-star rating because of the intelligence and gift of writing and truth. Actually, reveals that we have a NEED to worship the true God, Jehovah and not find an imperfect substitute, which will end in disappointment because of impossible expectations.
I liked the book.  I also ordered To Kill a Mocking bird years ago and I reread it and understood better this time.  I still have not figured the title.
Slow to get into the story. By the end, the ideas make the reader think. Although it was written decades ago, the topic of race is still very relevant.
It definitely helped that I had read To Kill a Mockingbird and saw the movie, even though it was not recent.<br/>This was a story that stuck with you.
It is so accurate in it's depiction of the time,<br/>and explaining how "good" people could have different opinions about right and wrong.  I wish Ms. Lee could write a sequel in which Scout  joins the freedom riders and the Selma to Montgomery March, and old Atticus slowly begins to see that his thinking, as intelligent and heartfelt as they are, were simply wrong. It was splendidly written and very thought provoking.
Sequel. Prequel. Rough in places, weaker writing, no heroes to embrace like Mockingbird. But a great read. Insightful. Realistically harsh. Some amazing rants. People to love. I wish she had finished it and perfected it after Mockingbird, but I also understand why she didn't. Have been pondering it all for days and I want to read it again after it all sinks in. Thank you, Harper Lee, for the soul searching. Once again!
Very compelling and absorbing look at the Civil Rights movement of the 60's from the perspective of a young white woman at odds with her own heritage.
Ms Lee wrote a perfect portrayal of a young lady that believes herself grown up and mature. Her visit home brings her a heartbreaking enlightenment while awakening her childhood joys and pains.  It seems to make her soul bleed from realizations.  It brought my own joys and pains to light that life brought which was in itself a memory because "To Kill a Mockingbird" was the first book that made me cry as a young girl.
Well written. Sound logic. Wonderful real characters. I highly recommend "Go Set A Watchman" to anyone wanting to discover how to be a good citizen.
Scout comes to grip with the complexities of the American South. Fascinating and thought provoking read especially when contrasted with Mockingbird.
Interesting take on politics of integrating the South.  Harper Lee is a great author, but Atticus does not come out looking as heroic in this novel!
It took awhile to read it and did not compare to her second book. However, it surely did characterize the time and still does in the south.
Excellent look at the common view of African Americans in the South in the 1950's, just as the civil rights revolution was getting started.
Not sure with our society today how people are going to respond to this book.  Good read but "To Kill A Mockingbird " still my fav.
It was all I had hoped that it would be and more, I had heard that it was racist, I did not find it like that, I would highly recommend it.
Far more on rails than the chronological predacessor. Has actual pace and doesn't drone on. Jean Louise is vivacious and full of laughter inducing thoughts. Very appropriate narrative for recent political atmosphere in the US. Worthy of reading for that purpose, though I just read for enjoyment. All the hype and detraction was a waste of energy for such a short, mildly pleasant book.
The book was good but I was surprised how incredibly short it was. I was just getting into the story when I turned the page and it stopped. This was my first electronic book so for a moment I thought I had erased it or something. Then I thought  I must have just purchased  a preview or something. Definitely not worth the price. Did not live up to all the hype. Feel very jipped/dupped
This book is terrible.  I'm so disappointed in Harper Lee, or whoever thought it was a good idea to publish.  I stopped reading because it has taken the shine off To Kill a Mockingbird, which is a literary classic.  How do I get my money back?  It was that bad.
Beautifully written as the first book was but maybe not quite as enjoyable. Scout was still very real but the story line was a bit flat.
I loved this book! I'm not sure what all the negative fuss is about.  If you are struggling with it, try remembering that it is FICTION!
Junping to conclusions causes Scout to misunderstand Atticus's true intentions.  In the end she may have learned some important lessons.
Excellent follow-up to ,To Kill A Mockingbird. Literally could not put the book down! I was very pleased with the insight this book gave on the characters, even though it takes place twenty years later. You really get to know their true selves. I was sorry the book ended. I would love to see one more book written to end and tie up the entire story and lives of the characters.
at first I was afraid I was going to feel bad by the time I got to the end of this book.  I felt , like Scout, that Atticus had betrayed me.  By the time I went through the emotional roller coaster of what Scout was learning, I felt like this was a book I would not have wanted to miss.  No more commests, as I do not want to "spoil" it for future readers.  Enjoy this.
Not nearly as good as TKAM, but glad I read it. The middle is a little dull and some parts are repetitive, but the overall idea is okay
Enyable read
A great read
Good for Harper Lee.  Her writing beautifully brings to light differing points of view that, one hopes, now are relegated to the past.
Powerful and timely. Thank you Harper Lee for sharing Atticus, Alexandra, Uncle Jack, Scout and Jem with the world. Go set a watchman.
Ashamed of all those here who have read this book as it does a disservice to the greatness of To Kill a Mockingbird. I for one would not subject myself to anything that would tarnish the memory of that masterpiece. I guess being a skilled reader of books puts me in a position outside of most readers here so I am likley more sensitive when reading sub-standard material.
Interesting novel about one look at the southern views and situation after the Civil War. The main character is not typical however.
I have no words for the way my favorite characters turned out. I know I will have to read the book again once I am over the shock!!!
Harper Lee cannot write a bad story!! Her characters were believable and likeable. I cannot wait for the next book in this series!!
Didn't know what to expect ... but blended nicely with To Kill a Mockingbird.  Thought provoking.  Atticus is an amazing character.
Like the authors style of writing.  Very factual of the time and struggle of life in the old south.  Would recommend it to others.
Introspective!  Most, if they look, can see themselves in at least one of the characters in this book. Enlightening and enjoyable.
I'm loving this book. I'm not done with it yet but I already know it's a keeper. I'll read it over and over just like Mockingbird.
I ordered this early this morning and I have not seen it on my Kindle yet. Please help. I've never had a problem before. Thank You
This beautifully written novel is insightful and relevant. I carefully did not read anything about its backstory - and I am glad.
Really opened my eyes as to what happened in the south during the 70s and how govt interference has led to many of the racial problems today. The slow, easy narrative of the author amid the bucolic setting is very restful, especially considering the volatile nature of the info imparted during her family visit "back home." I am so glad I read this.
While I was at first concerned about our beloved Atticus, I recognize his need to grow into this role in his time in that world.
i can see where people would call Aticus a racist...but I dont think that is the case. I think he is a product of his generation
good
Okay
A good read.  Not what i expected but surprising fact about Atticus that was not expected.  I do recommend reading the book.
The story is told through Scout's eyes.  The basis of the story is a discussion of civil rights in America during the 1950s.
I loved it!
Great read.
Great book!
In this review, I will attempt to refrain from discussing the peripheral, but very controversial circumstances surrounding the publication of this prequel/sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. I for one am grateful that, whatever the circumstances of the publication, another novel from Harper Lee is out there in the world. I will attempt to focus on the literary quality of the novel, although it will be virtually impossible to discuss it without referencing and comparing it with 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.<br/><br/>For those still not 'in the know' about exactly what 'Go Set a Watchman' is, it is a first novel submitted by a young, unknown author seeking professional advice for publication. She was told that the manuscript was promising but was advised to expand the childhood flashbacks and try another approach. Hence, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' appeared approximately two to three years after the first novel was submitted.  As we know, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was received to rapturous acclaim and the rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>It is also virtually impossible to read 'Go Set a Watchman' as anything but the rough draft of a book that, except for certain differences alluding to the previous story line, seems to us now to not be able to exist without the prior existence of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. However, first novel it is and, like the original editors, I feel that it is promising. However,  I wonder how the situation would differ if they had told her to polish it, revise it a bit more, tighten up the prose and flesh out a few gaps and if it had subsequently been published and received as a promising, bold first novel by a new author who showed promise of greater things to come.<br/><br/>The novel is a 'homecoming' story. There are a few stories of a character who grew up in a provincial town, left it to make her way in the big city, then returned to the small town to see how it had or had not changed with her newfound perspective gained from wider exposure to the larger world out there. The only one that comes to mind is the film 'Sweet Home Alabama' with Reese Witherspoon revisiting her small hometown in Alabama and reconnecting with one ex-boyfriend/husband (the details are sketchy) and the epiphanies that ensue from the new experience.<br/><br/>Scout (now Jean Louise) is an adult now, heading into the second half of her twenties, returning on her annual visit to Maycomb. Hank, a childhood friend/expected beau/eventual husband picks her up at the train station. We are also told that Jem dropped dead of a heart attack a few years earlier, inheriting the same condition that killed his mother. Atticus's arthritis is acting up and he wasn't quite up to the usual routine of picking her up at the station himself. It is roughly twenty years after the events of 'TKAM', which puts us right in the middle of the racial strife-ridden 1950's when the civil rights movement has gained momentum.<br/><br/>Atticus lives with his sister, Alexandra, who treats Jean Louise, the adult, almost the same as she did the child Scout.  Zandra, as Atticus calls her, is the stereotypical proper Southern lady, a veritable shrew imparting cautionary lessons in manners intended to persuade Jean Louise to conform to what is expected of a proper young Southern lady. Jean Louise, of course, is not noticeably different from the tomboy Scout of 'TKAM'. She has always been unconventional and felt like a square peg in a round hole the entire time she grew up in Maycomb, eventually resulting in her move to New York. Now that she is an independent adult she grows bolder about speaking her mind, voicing unpopular opinions and indulging in scandalous acts such as swimming in the river in her undergarments late at night with Hank (an incident observed by one of the watchful citizen spies/small town gossips) which by the time it is spread around town includes the fact that she was naked. When Zandra tells Atticus, he takes it with his usual calm, and jokes, "You didn't do the backstroke did you?"<br/><br/>Atticus seems like the same hero Scout had worshipped as a child, now an elderly man slowed down by the ravages of age. Being with him is reassuring and comforting until she straightens up his papers while he and Hank go to a Sunday afternoon meeting at the courthouse and she discovers a vile white supremacist pamphlet entitled, "The Black Plague". How could such a horrible thing be part of Atticus's reading matter? Jean Louise confronts Zandra, who confirms that Atticus and Hank are at a meeting of the Maycomb County Citizen's Council. Jean Louise is horrified but feels compelled to go to the courthouse to see for herself. She climbs the stairs to the same balcony from which she watched Atticus conduct his memorable case from 'TKAM' and sees Atticus and Hank sitting with some men she knows are ardent racists. Atticus's presence there seems to mark a stamp of approval to the proceedings. Feeling like she's just stepped into a nightmare, this image completely pulls her moral bearings out from under her and leaves her physically ill. She runs back down the stairs and wanders outside in the blinding heat, stops at an ice cream stand run by a Cunningham (perhaps the same person that she invited to dinner when they were children) and vomits up the ice cream and everything else she's eaten that day.<br/><br/>The ensuing struggle to reconfigure her world as one in which the great Atticus can associate with known racists takes up most of the rest of the novel. She indulges in many outbursts, finally having the situation explained to her by "Uncle Jack", Atticus's younger brother, a retired doctor who has in recent years indulged his passion for literature and is regarded as one of its eccentrics. Uncle Jack plays a more prominent role in this novel than he did in 'TKAM'. In his strange, eccentric way, he is just as wise as his brother. As Jean Louise reflects, "He was the only person she ever knew who could paraphrase three authors into one sentence and have them all make sense." He has been far more observant of Jean Louise than she realizes and he knows his brother better than almost anyone:<br/><br/>'…now you, Miss, born with your own conscience, somewhere along the line, fastened it like a barnacle onto your father's. As you grew up, when you were totally gown, totally unknown to yourself, you confused your father with God. You never saw him as a man with a man's heart, and a man's failings—I'll grant you it may have been hard to see, he makes so few mistakes, but he makes 'em like all of us. You were an emotional cripple, leaning on him, getting the answers from him, assuming that your answers would always be his answers.'<br/><br/>He also tells her, "Prejudice, a dirty word, and faith, a clean one, have something in common; they both begin where reason ends."<br/><br/>Subsequently, Jean Louise confronts Atticus. She rants and raves and he calmly refuses to take the bait of an argument. Ultimately, he does explain himself. He sincerely feels the encroachment of the federal government and the power of the NAACP will create more problems and dissent than it will purportedly solve. He is not a racist. He is a separatist, however. He is unfailingly kind to the black citizens of Maycomb and treats everyone with respect. By the novel's conclusion, despite the fact that he and Jean Louise feel differently about the tools for solving the injustices of the South, the way he handles his daughter with infinite patience proves he is the same great man she idolized since childhood. Jean Louise congratulates herself on her 'colorblindness' and yet she is still blind to certain harsh realities in her world. She understands that, until now, Atticus has never to her knowledge done anything that challenges or threatens the idealized view of him as a god. Now she has to accept that he is simply a man doing what he feels is right. By the last page of the novel, I was almost moved to tears as the abiding love between the father and daughter emerged unscathed.<br/><br/>There are brilliant passages in this novel such as the description of Jean Louise at a church service:<br/><br/>'There's nothing like a blood-curdling hymn to make you feel at home, thought Jean Louise. Any sense of isolation she may have had withered and died in the presence of some two hundred sinners earnestly requesting to be plunged beneath a red, redeeming flood. While offering to the Lord the results of Mrs. Cowper's hallucination, or declaring it was Love that lifted her, Jean Louise shared the warmness that prevails among diverse individuals who find themselves in the same boat for one hour each week'<br/><br/>Or when Jean Louise listens  to some of the proper young society women her aunt forces her to invite to a 'coffee social' and she listens to the prejudiced talk of one of the many women she has judged as shallow and her inner monologue begins:<br/><br/>'Conceived in mistrust, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created evil'<br/><br/>The novel also has portions that obviously have gaps and need to be fleshed out. For example, Jean Louise's encounter with her aged housekeeper/surrogate mother Calpurnia results in a breakdown of communication which contains a major breakdown in continuity. One feels there are definitely a few steps missing in the procession to the resolution of the scene..<br/><br/>There is much more historical background for Maycomb County than I recall seeing in 'TKAM', resembling to this reviewer some of Faulkner's very extensive history for his own fictional Yoknapatawpha County.<br/><br/>Finally, the famous trial of 'TKAM' is referenced, without naming names (they probably had not even been thought of yet) where Scout watched Atticus at his peak, defending a black man which he took as his duty as a member of the legal profession. In this abbreviated account, the defendant was acquitted.  Such a verdict seems less plausible to result in Atticus' subsequent more overt separatist views twenty years later than the guilty verdict rendered in 'TKAM' would have. One would think that the acquittal would have encouraged hope in Atticus for fair treatment of the Negro under the law rather than solidifying his separatist views. Perhaps I, like many prospective readers of 'GSAW' are making a mistaken assumption that fair treatment under the law should inevitably result in integration in Atticus' eyes. We are seeing Atticus through the lens of the 21st century at this point rather than a man of his time. The first half of the 20th century was very different in some ways from the 21st, although in others, as we have seen from unfortunate recent events, very much the same.<br/><br/>Atticus carries two watches, a wristwatch for actually telling the time, and a pocket watch out of habit. He can definitely be seen as one of the 'watchmen' alluded to in the title. However, what he watches for may not have ever taken place, at least in our retrospective view, as he feared it would.<br/><br/>'Go Set a Watchman', despite its at times clumsy and misshapen form, is a very courageous and audacious novel for a young woman to write in the middle of the 1950's. Tackling the issue of white privilege without pulling any punches might not have been received very favorably if it had been published closer to the time of its composition. So perhaps it's perfect timing for such a novel to arrive in the middle of our world at this particularly fraught time of unrest. Perhaps this sixty-year old literary relic has something vital to teach us as we wrestle with the same issues that Atticus did in the 1950's, setting our own watchman to be on the lookout for our worst fears.
With all the hype I thought I would be disappointed in this earlier work by Lee. At first it seemed nostalgia, but became complicated as personalities unfolded. Had this been published first it may have been unnoticed. But it's an important work as it deals with continuing issues with opinions about race and bigotry that we all deal with.
I was surprised at the ending I wanted the story to go on and thought I wish there was more. It was very thought provoking.
Go Set a Watchman was written skillfully and has quite a different from other novels. I was continually drawn to read more.
A great sequel to her first novel! Not quite the impact of her first work, but her interaction as an adult was insightful.
I know lots of people were disappointed and did not like to find out that Atticus was human but I found that gratifying. There were other aspects of Atticus' character that were revealed as well that made him more believable as an individual and ultimately I don't believe strayed too far from his core principles. I enjoyed this book.
I read To Kill a Mocking Bird, before I read Go set a Warchman, throughly enjoyed Harper Lee's second book, true yo life.
I normally don't mind a story ending with loose ends. I'm not so sure on this one. Very thought provoking on many levels.
Is it great?  Not so much, but Mockingbird is my favorite book so of course I had to read this.  It's clear that Harper Lee never intended for this to be published, that someone took advantage of her advanced age to garner consent to publish.  So, it's great that I got to read another Harper Lee book, although I wished I hadn't.
I heard about this book that was negative,  however,  I loved this story. It truly brought you into the mind of the time
Gosh, it sure is hard to grow up.  But it had to happen to Scout sooner or later.  Vintage Harper Lee - couldn't better.
I really liked this story, but it was a little rough. Definitely needed some more pre-publishing loving from an editor.
In my opinion this was a continuation of TKM, not a sequel.  Was a good  read.  Too bad it took so long to be released,
One of my favourite books of the year. Thank you Harper Lee for giving Scout a strong voice. Great piece of fiction...
Amazing, both terrible and beautiful at the same time. A very accurate portrait of the South I remember growing up in.
Because Harper Lee doesn't deify Atticus, this book receives criticism; however, it should be lauded for its honesty.
This is a wonderful book..a picture of the period and of an older, more conservative, human Atticus.  Don't  miss it.
First, I will say that there are surprises in this novel. The first is on page 13 and made me yell "Oh no" across the room. I very much liked this book. It's written in the third person but Jean Louise's (a.k.a. Scout) spirit and independence still come shining through. The book is shockingly and surprisingly still topical especially in light of current events in South Carolina and discussions of the fate of the Confederate flag around the south. Even if you don't agree with the stance of some of the characters, you will hear all sides of issues that have, by no means, been laid to rest 50 something years later.<br/><br/>Some of the writing is a bit scattered. However, I always felt the last novel's emphasis was the idealistic perceptions of a child including the mythological greatness of her parent. Sometimes myths are shattered. Some myths should be. It all depends on if you want to take the blue pill or the red pill. Hard to take but a lovelynovel none the less. We all grew up in families like this. Let Jean Louise's conscience be your guide.
A different view of Atticus from a more mature Scout. After all, both Scout and Atticus have changed over the years.
I though it was wonderful. I wanted to read it because it was written by Harper Lee of course. I would recommend it.
Written as wonderfully and filled with scenes from the lives of the people of Maycomb as was To Kill a Mockingbird but I am totally devastated by finding my hero has feet of clay.  I had heard rumours about the 'real' Atticus and almost cancelled my order.  When it arrived on my kindle last night I hesitated to open it.  Then I did and read about a third and thought.....'Well this is pleasant but I was right, there is no way it can compare'.  Now having finished it I do wish I had cancelled the order...not because it is not a great book...not because it was not vividly written.  I could see every page in my mind... but because I have lost a hero and there are so few of them.  Real or fictional heroes......since I was a pre-teen Atticus has been the father who died when I was ten and the man by whom I measured all others.  There is no way to replace him.
The more realistic portrayal of Atticus, was refreshing and less politically correct.  Honest and straight forward.
interesting look at the segregation issues from a very different point of view. food for thought--lots of thought.
Great book
Great book
Wonderful!
Good book.
Well done.
I read it for a book group. We all enjoyed it. Had some strange movement in the writing, but all in all enjoyable
We are all so smug in our hatred of racism but in Scouts eyes we are hypocrites. She convicts us of our weakness.
To Set a Watchman is a novel by Harper Lee.  It is a very good novel but it needs to be read slowly and savored to get the underlying meanings and to think about the situations Jean Louise finds herself in.<br/>Jean Louise has come home from New York City for a vacation.  She has avoided her hometown intentionally for long enough.  She begins to see the changes immediately when she arrives in town.  The town has changed and so has her father, Atticus.  How deep have those changes gone?  Should she marry Hank, even though her aunt objects?  Does she really love him or love the thought of marriage?  Would she be able to stay in this small town if she marries Hank?  Jean Louise has many things to think about and keep her busy; but she finds even more to think about when she begins really looking around.<br/>Will she find her answers?
Glad I read To Kill A Mockingbird first.  Otherwise, I might have been disinclined to purchase this superb book.
I liked the follow up to a novel I read many years ago. So much of what Scout believed in then is becoming reality in today's world. She focused on Hope as incentive to better oneself  As we finish a second term with Barack Obama I see that all things are possible despite the loud rantings of the bigots!
Definitely a great read. Not what I expected but was very enjoyable. Hard to believe she wrote this book first.
I heard reviews, I guess I can see why people have issues with this. However, I still think it's worth reading.
Just brilliant. Thank you, Harper Lee, for this great gift. Another classic, for the grown Mockingbird lovers.
Go Set a Watchman, A Novel by Harper Lee, is an amazing book.  I hated to put it down.  I highly recommend it.
An interesting read, considering it was written prior to "To Kill A Mockingbird"  Still, a good read.
Harper Lee did not write this novel!  Great sociological study_ opened my eyes to a lot of pre- formed ideas.
Love the book, great read!
Well  worth the wait all these years!  Harper Lee is a brilliant writer.  Anxiously awaiting the next novel.
As relevant then as it is now. Trump should read this book! Maybe he can learn why we need and not need him.
I loved it. Starts slow. But a perfect perceptive of America and race issues. We still have these problems.
I can tellby the first page if im goingto read it .Held my atttention, couldnt put it down. Very good book.
An excellent story of nuanced white southerners caught up in a tradition of racism they can only identify as a given and honorable economic and social way of life. An earlier defense of the "majesty of the law" ought not to be mistaken for the championing of universal human rights.
Harper Lee engages our individual smugness, whether it be liberal or conservative.  She invites us to consider another's point of view, to respect it while considering its weakness and strength.  Rather than condemning "Atticus" Harper Lee develops our respect for his lawyering integrity.
Great follow up to Kill a Mockingbird.  Comes to a quick end but is a good solid read with a good message.
I especially liked the ending  The interaction between Jean Louise, her father, and her uncle was intense.
This is a snap shot in time long ago - never to return.  Think Donald Trump townhall meeting, raw and real
an interesting analysis of southern society and a charming recollection of an unusually happy childhood .
Harper Lee does not write a bad sentance. This is a story about Scout and the prejudice that was common place in Macomb where she grew up. The story does not try to manipulate the reader but simply shows the way things were to a young girl we all know as Atticus Finchs daughter Scout.
Harper Lee has a wonderful writing style, but the story this time was not as exciting as her first book.
History stories are my favorite ( a bit of fiction and reality).  Can Harper Lee publish another novel?
Great! I enjoyed the turn of events and how the characters played out . Ready for the 3rd if any..
certainly not as good as to kill a mockingbird.worthy of the read because of her fame as a writer.
Wonderful  piece of literature, very thought provoking. Wished it could have gone on a bit longer
Harper Lee has done it again! I love this book as much as I loved To Kill A Mockingbird!  Brava!
I liked better than reviews indicated.  You had to live through those times to truly understand.
Yes, there are some sad, sad parts to this novel, but seriously, no one can write a sentence or set a mood like Harper Lee. This is the story of Scout becoming an adult in her own right and leaving childhood behind. I cried, I laughed, I gasped. GREAT read!
Read it slowly, let it simmer and enjoy the ending.  Well written and lots of food for thought.
Loved it.  First I reread To Kill a Mockingbird, then read Go Set a Watchman.  Excellent books!
I believe it is an interesting book, especially that you can see how she developed as a writer.
Watchman is a poor effort for someone that would win a Pulitzer on her next book.  I expect more.  Watchman arrived stillborn.  I quit reading the story about half way through.  Now it sits on my Kindle and Amazon is mocking me.  Amazon picked my pocket.
Powerful social commentary on the times! We all need to be watchers if justice is to prevail.
Didn't want to put it down.  Getting to know old friends again.  So glad this book was found.
I enjoyed it very much. Lots of memories of Mockingbird, and the things to transpire in it.
It is obvious that Harper Lee wrote this book.  Knowing that she wrote it prior to "To Kill a Mockingbird" and it was not rewritten prior to publishing as "To Kill a Mockingbird" was gives greater insight into Harper Lee's writing.
started out slow but built to a thought provoking ending. Makes you think on several levels.
I don't get the crazy pre-release flurry about the change in the characters.  Read it first!
Great read and a wonderful story line  preceeding the book  "To kill a Mockingbird "
Love Harper Lee! Just received it and will read very soon!
Perfect!
Love it!
loved it
LOVED IT
Loveeeee
Love it.  So wish Harper Lee had written more but as it is, we have two treasures from her.
Do not know much yet, just started it, yesterday, but Loved "To Kill a Mockingbird"
Reread To Kill A Mockingbird because of the references to the book.  Just a wonderful read.
Go Set A Watchman will be a classic in American Literature as its predecessor To Kill A Mockingbird.  Harper Lee was ahead of the times in which she was living, or at least, was observant during the most turbulent periods in American history of the 1950s.  And if one were to begin to read this novel without coupling it with Mockingbird, the conscience of a generation was Jean Louise “Scout” Finch.  She is the protagonist of the novel as she had been in the first book and race relations and those within the quagmire of understanding is the antagonist, and within that dichotomy is her hero Atticus Finch.  Jean Louise returns to Maycomb and must confront 20 years of coming to terms of what she was taught and learned from Atticus and those closest to her family and friends and the environment in which she lived before she moved to New York.<br/><br/>As one begins to read the novel, there will be no doubt that comparisons will arise to the previous story of a younger Jean Louise and the plot that became a symbol of the era of the path towards civil rights.  However, Scout is now 26 years old, brother Jem is no longer her cohort and she has to deal with questions that emerge after hearing and seeing events play out of a different Atticus.  Several examples throughout the novel may keep readers reverting back to Mockingbird and recalling the main characters part and how the plot thickened, but one major element will remind readers that this novel was written before the first; once one forgets about trying to compare and contrast and simply read the book, by the end of the novel, one will see that it is not at all a sequel. Watchman is in a way a study of how Jean Louise has progressed from a child to a woman but continues to be perplexed by the environment around her but takes the so-called bull by the horns in her beliefs and rhetoric. Take for instance, an example from one of the most powerful parts of the book where Jean Louise confronts the issue of race, “…they were poor, they were diseased and dirty, some were lazy and shiftless, but never in my life was I given the idea that I should despise one, should fear one, should be discourteous to one, or think that I could mistreat one and get away with it…I was taught never to take advantage of anybody who was less fortunate than myself, whether he be less fortunate in brains, wealth, or social position, it meant anybody, not just Negroes” (178).<br/><br/>In essence, Go Set the Watchman may definitely be another educational tool to be taught in literature and history courses and in general, in the community of discussion as its predecessor in terms of understanding intolerance and civil rights.  And who better to be the model of truth or at least a guide towards it but Jean Louise.
For the next decade or so there will be endless articles, books, PhD dissertations and essays of every type written about  GO SET A WATCHMAN.  Many a student will be burning the midnight oil writing a comparison between Watchman and Mockingbird while expending endless oceans of ink and killing forests of trees  in the printing of the fruits of their literary skills. So what we say here will probably not be long remembered. The vivisection of the novel is becoming a cottage industry as I write - one that will give other authors and critics hopes of  new found fame and fortune.<br/><br/>While I'm glad to say that I read the book, I can hardly say it was memorable - or perhaps memorable because of the hype. At its heart it is a book about change and accepting change and  reinforces the adage about the inability to go home again.  There will be those who will pour into the heart and soul of Jean Louise. She'll spend the rest of her life on a literary couch being analyzed and examined.  Was the loss of her mother at such an early age the determining factor? Critics and academics  will study the social structure of the American South in relation to the characters. Can she ever really love Hank? Is his social class so different that they are forever incompatible! Is Hank the the manifestation of the New South?  Is she in reality a surviving  vestige of the Old South?  Or is Jean Louise at heart the same as Hank and Atticus?  With a  touch of Osage County, Lee even manages to air  the dirty laundry of the Finches and the people of Maycomb, while still leaving the reader with shallow characters that are in much need of development.<br/><br/>Parts of the book are memorable and parts just seem to be vignettes that were thrown in  a hodgepodge of things written by an amateur on the way be becoming a pro.  To me, the meat of the story didn't kick in until page 100 or so, making the first section a sort of disjointed tale of the past.  But for my knowledge of the characters from Mockingbird, I think that I would have found them pretty hollow. And that's why this book was never published.<br/><br/>The book will give rise to endless hours of debate about the relation of Southern Blacks and Whites - but to what avail?  Should we sit around and debate the relationship of Scarlet and Mammy?  It is a novel set in a different time and the reader has to accept the characters  as  they were at that time and place in American history.  They were people who did not want their way of life to change - they only had since the Civil War to realize that blacks weren't slave anymore!  Are they believable?  At times yes and at times no.  The Atticus we met and loved in Mockingbird is long gone from this story.  The Atticus and Hank in Watchman not only have clay feet but they stick out for miles as both characters trip all over them.  I realize that there were White Southerners with good intentions who had to put up with some things that they didn't want to in order to survive,  but Atticus and Hank went beyond that. The KKK of the 1920's and forward may have seemed like the Mason's in Hank's mind, but these were bad people who harmed, maimed and killed people they didn't like - primarily because of their race.  They were a lot more than some neighbors who went around in hoods as Atticus and Hank would have you believe.  How far did those two  bury their heads in the sand?<br/><br/>What to me is more interesting than the book itself is the back story of how Harper Lee's "handlers" this late in her life took it upon themselves to publish this book.  That story alone will generate even more books and articles.  But to me the bottom line is  this work should have remained what it was - unpublished and lost. This whole thing seems like a grab for money - wonder how much they got for the movie rights.  I'm sure Lee's "handlers" achieved the dollars they desired  but  in the process they destroyed one of the most honorable and  stand up white guys of the American literature and severely tarnished the legacy of Harper Lee.
Harper Lee explains, in depth, how complex the issue of race and of growing into maturity can be.<br/>I think someone who has not lived in the South might have a hard time and be too judgemental  about Atticus Finch.<br/>It is a masterpiece.
I had a difficult time deciding whether to read this novel or not. First, I so loved the story and characters in To Kill a Mockingbird, that I had to be prepared to be disappointed. Secondly, the reports of Atticus being a racist in the story was disconcerting to say the least. Well, it was not as bad as I was lead to believe, not great either.  Finally, there seemed to be so much controversy about whether Lee even wanted the novel to be published.  Let me be clear, the writing is very good, you will want to finish the story in one sitting, as I did. No peeks into the plot. Give it a read. Interesting perception of a "time", in the deep south.
Though I enjoyed this work, it lacked the compelling pulse of Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
Extraordinary book with lots of shocks for the lovers of Mockingbird.  The South of the US in the 50s is brilliantly  described and it is written in the same whimsical  but at the sametime down to earth way which made Mockingbird so special.
I love this book too much controversy around a great read I take it is that a great read.
Not through it yet, but disappointed in it so far...<br/><br/>As if was a rough draft for TKAM.  Tom Robinson was NOT acquitted, he was found guilty and then subsequently shot when he tried to run.  He didn't lose an arm, his arm was mangled.  Viola Ewell wasn't 14, she was older than that, and it was never proven that she had had any consentual sex with Tom or anyone else, only that she kissed him and her father saw her do it.<br/><br/>And why kill off Jem, except to somehow introduce Hank?  Was that really necessary?<br/><br/>Very glad I read TKAM first - I'm frankly struggling with this one, but will read it to the end.
The voices of Scout and Atticus were clearly the same characters in To Kill a Mockingbird.  I felt the timeliness of this book's release in regards to the racial divide today is as important as To Kill a Mockingbird was in the 1960s.
It is wonderful! I loved "To Kill a Mockingbird", and this one is just as good.
This is a very compelling story and is as relevant today as it was when it was written.
excellent need to read To Kill A Mockingbird First it will make for a much better read
A nice complement to "To Kill a Mockingbird."
good read....not sure it was Harper Lee.  Characters not believable as in mockingbird
i would read and like anything written by Harper Lee.<br/>so i'm not very objective.
I'm reading it now and it's wonderful so far. I'm sure it's going to be a good book.
Makes you think again about the definition of racism. Harper Lee is a gifted author!
once again a special story, one may not judge it unless lived in that time and place
Amazing story and the topic is as relevant today as in 1950. Enjoyed the book a lot
Absolutely wonderful.  Harper Lee has lived up to her reputation of a great author.
JUST WHAT I EXPECTED FROM HARPER LEE! TAKING IT TO THE BEACH WITH ME TO FINISH IT!!
I enjoyed this book, it was an easy read and follow up for To Kill A Mocking Bird.
Her voice rang through during the complexity of the South oh so slow metamorphosis
Nell Harper Lee touches the places in the heart most of us would like to return to
I  couldn't put it down.  Better than Mockingbird.
Really enjoyed the book.  Took the kids into the next era and she did a great job
love it
Amazing
An okay read.  I wouldn't miss reading a Harper Lee novel and I do recommend it.
Made me think about fighting for my beliefs and speaking out to change things.
The book is slow to get going but the second half was well written with good characterization that mirrors the deep south in the 1950's. The conversation is poignant andthoughtprovoking. A recommended read.
This is a picture of the South in the 50's as I remember it--full of angst over the inevitable change that was coming, full of the contradictions inherent in two races living intimately together and apart.
I truly enjoyed the book from beginning to end and gladly recommend the book.
It's a good book that all North American's should read and realize that the problems we have in this area of the world are directly connected to the disregard for God and his plan in our everyday lives.
Excellent great sequel to kill a mocking bird. I taught for thirty years
Harper Lee has again touched on the complexity of the Southern mind-set.
A novel that could have been easily written to reflect the oresent day South, To Set A Watchman explores the nuance between idealism and reality in the 1950s rural Alabama.  A must read!
Harper Lee has opened a window once again. I wanted "to Kill a Mockingbird" which this is not. I wanted to love and live in those characters again as they were, Scout a precocious child, Atticus a single father doing his best Jem creating stories to entertain us , but Harper Lee again forces us to search our own consciousness of right and wrong. To recognize our own "bigotries" and to think...while the story lacks some character development overall it is not a book to be missed
Given the perspective (Scout as an adult) it was a very enjoyable read
I appreciated it very much. It's timeless.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Ellard
The jury is still out on this one. Very deep reading. Food for tought.
Boring
Great!
Disappointing. The writing is not on par with To Kill a Mocking Bird. Moreover, a reader would not understand the characters if they had not already read To Kill a Mocking Bird.
I found this to be an an excellent book.  Some of the detail might not ring true unless you are of a certain age, born and raised in a small southern town and a life long member of the Methodist Church.  I am all these things and the book is spot on in this respect.  I have also read To Kill A Mockingbird several times and the contradictions are not a problem.<br/><br/>This is a new story with familiar characters.  I recommend this book to readers of all ages.
"Go Set" will me appreciated more as a memoir  than a novel.
This is a very sad attempt to simply make money and I am a bit ashamed of Harper Collins in putting this out--simply to make good on the strong, consistent seller that is TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. Perhaps the best thing one could say is this is a good example of why this original story went to the re-write bin way back when..and for very good reason. It's not nearly the riveting and compelling story that the latter book achieved. Kudos to the original editor for rejecting this. All this is a publicity scam on a woman who is 90% deaf and dubiously of sound mind. Shame on that lawyer and the predatory tactics involved. Peruse it for what it is. Otherwise, there are so many remarkable reads out there.
Some professional reviewers had negative comments about this, so I began reading knowing I could be disappointed.  I guess they didn't really read the book. Very well written.
A quick and wonderful read.  Still very relavent to today's issues.
Developed the story slowly then became suspenseful and quick paced.
very small town, much like the one I grew up in. enjoyed very much.
Not as beautiful a novel as To Kill a Mockingbird, but a good read.
Interesting depiction of the mind set of the South for the period.
The character building is amazing.  Felt like I knew these people.
Great writing.  The protagonist is able to separate herself from her dependance on her father because of their 2 different view points.  Great discussion of Civil Rights.
I don't know why so many have mentioned that Atticus was such a racist in this book.  I don't think he was.  He was an older business man trying to live in 1950's Alabama.  I don't think any of us who haven't lived during such a time could understand how difficult those times may have been for people who weren't really racist, but just trying to live their life without total conflict all the time.<br/><br/>This was not a great book, it wasn't really even a good book, but I am glad I read it.  I so enjoyed revisiting the days of Scout, Jem and Dill when they were young.  Those were truly the most enjoyable part of the book.  The rest of it was just a lot of filler discussing politics, and events during that volatile time in our history.<br/><br/>Is it a must read...no.  But for those who love To Kill a Mockingbird as I do, don't let this book ruin that story for you.  It is worth reading, but take it for what it is...a first draft of a book that when first presented to publishers was not good enough to spend money on.  If not for this draft, I doubt that we would have had To Kill a Mockingbird and for that I am truly grateful.
Great book! Loved to see how it turned out with her all grown up!
I didn't like the whole concept of the book. She should have left well enough alone. But there is food for thought. I wouldn't particularly recommend reading it, though.
Great book.  Today it would not have been rejected by publisher.
Harper Lee takes a deep look into the human condition. Placing inciteful emphasis on racial interactions in the changing times of the the '60's in the American South.
Book was great
Marvelous book.  If I still taught high school English I would love to use this in an AP English class along with 'Mockingbird', "The Help' and current events
Well. Nothing could ever b bad about this!!!!!!!  Nice packing
One of my favorite books. Harper Lee is a master story teller.
Great read! Continued story of "To Kill a Mockingbird"
I preordered this book (translation, I got caught up in all the hype) and waited excitedly for the publication day to arrive. The $16 this short story is overpriced! And what is the story about anyway. Scout goes home for a two summer vacation and discovers her father is like every other white else in 1950s south...they don't want blacks to be able to vote. But then the story goes nowhere. Very disappointing.
An elusive narrative. You don't really know what the book is about until the end. Certainly one of the marks of a gifted writer.  A must read for young adults.
I tried to savour the reading over a week. That required great self control. Was surprised when I got to end and didn't realise it. Was so looking for more.
Ok
I'm good writing. Interesting shift of character's attitude.
I love her stile. From the first words read,I am captivated.
Anyone who read To Kill a Mockingbird should read this book.
Beautifully written. Helped me to understand the attitudes of my Southern parents during the Civil Rights Movement. I can see why the publisher might not have wanted to publish this book during the 60's, as controversial as the topic was at the time.<br/><br/>The best parts, though, were the flashbacks to Scout's childhood. What a gift to so vividly portray those wonderfully imaginative kids.
Reminds me of To Kill a Mockingbird with a different twist.
A GREAT READ.  SHE KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION ALL THE WAY THROUGH
An excellent read, make your mind work for this great read.
Thank you, Miss Lee for allowing this book to be published. It would truly be a great loss if it were never read. Your writing is absolutely excellent.
Go Set A Watchman is a mesmerizing read which does not disappoint readers of Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, stirring up the emotions of people familiar with her previously published work. The recognizable characters, even with a considerable passage of time, are still believable and ring true with the personalities set for them in To Kill A Mockingbird. The new characters did not disappoint either, allowing the readers to meet new people in Jean Louise's world. The plot of this book had no less meaning and importance then her past book, diving into not just the issue of race but also of family loyalty and the dangers of human idealization.<br/><br/>Some readers will discover that parts of the text are a direct copy from To Kill A Mockingbird. This is the case due to the fact that Go Set A Watchman was, in fact, the original novel written by Harper Lee. Publishers, however, were less sold on the concept of the adult Jean Louise revisiting her elderly father on her journey of personal discovery. Harper Lee rewrote this original text into what became the iconic novel To Kill A MockingBird. These passages do not detract from the reading of Go Set A Watchman but rather enhance the enjoyment of this new tome. Fans of To Kill A Mockingbird will recognize these stories and will reminisce along with Scout because they, too, remember her childhood fondly. Go Set A Watchman is a not to miss read for those who fully appreciate the brilliance of Harper Lee's originally published novel, To Kill A Mockingbird. For those who have yet to discover To Kill A Mockingbird--get thee to a library!<br/><br/>Once again, Harper Lee has given the world a book for the ages with sophisticated syntax and captivating characters which time will not wear away.
Like many others, I count To Kill a Mockingbird as one of my all-time favorite novels. I was hugely excited about the release of this prequel, but the early reviews and revelations tempered my enthusiasm, and I waited for months before deciding I was ready to give it a shot myself. Boy, am I glad I didn't pass this one by.<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is not the polished novel that preceded it. Nor is it a gripping page-turner. It is, however, a return to the town of Maycomb, Alabama, and to some of those beloved characters we know from the past. Jean Louise, whom we know more affectionately as Scout, is our narrator. We are taken back and forth, from Scout's childhood and her teen years (including some comic and heartwarming moments at a prom dance), to her adult return from New York City to her birthplace. She no longer has her brother to lean on, and instead her focus is diverted by a boyfriend. Does her love for him make him a desirable husband? That is one of the early questions, but the much starker questions turn to the brewing racial tensions among the townsfolk. Most disturbing, for Jean Louise, is evidence that her father has some racist views of his own. She turns to her uncle for answers, then, in disgust, decides she is done with this town and its backward ways. Only then, does she face her own bigotry on a different level.<br/><br/>Harper Lee gives us a challenging story here, one that is an easy read full of beautiful little moments, but also full of unsettling aspects of the racial divide. What seems to be a story set in the past is one that is as apropos today as ever. We are not given easy answers. We are given tough questions, varied viewpoints, and abstract truths grounded in rock-solid principles. We may never see Atticus quite the same again, but we are given a more honest, three-dimensional view of him and his generation from the South. This is a more adult novel in some ways than its predecessor, expecting us to come to our own conclusions instead of wrapping everything up in tidy bows.<br/><br/>And that is exactly what Jean Louise is faced with in her hometown return: a chance to come to her own conclusions, to stand on her own two feet, to love her enemies even when she doesn't agree with them. It may not compare to Mockingbird for storytelling genius and sophistication, but it comes at us with the same passion and same strength of characterization. If only Harper Lee could give us a third book to round out the Maycomb story.
Great
I felt compelled to read this release, as TKAM is one of my favorite novels. I had no issue with this story, as it is one of entirely different people than those characters called by the same name who are near sacred in my literary heart. Things of note in this book:<br/><br/>Harper Lee is an excellent wordsmith. Though I didn't care for the preachy soliloquies, she has a way of crafting language in a compelling way that tugs at the reader's heart.<br/><br/>I am thrilled that she reworked this story to become TKAM. Although the primary plot of TKAM isn't here (mentioned only briefly is the rape trial which Atticus covered many years ago), the lessons Lee wants us to learn are overtly present. They are written out and given to us through speeches and conversations. In TKAM, we are masterfully set upon a journey following young and innocent Scout, and we learn our own lessons by observation and reflection. Here, they are set before us and nearly force-fed, whether or not we are ready to receive them.<br/><br/>Therefore, this development of our wise and beloved Atticus - here split between the father of the same name, Uncle Jack, and other bits of conversation from this or that character - is crucial to the future release of TKAM. Lee creatively tells that tale from the viewpoint of young Scout, who by virtue of her age will not understand all that wise Atticus shares with her. This gives us a window to the lessons Lee wants to impart. That which we are ready to partake of in full is easily digested. That which we may understand at some future date, we can simply place on the shelf, as young ones do, to revisit when we are ready to face that part of ourselves and the world around us. That is the beauty of TKAM, and it is not present in Watchman.<br/><br/>I did not love this book. I will not re-read it, more than likely. I do not love the characters here. However, the insight it gives toward what became the masterpiece of TKAM is invaluably interesting and made this book worth the read for die-hard TKAM fans.
Thank you Harper Lee for letting this great manuscript be published!!  "Go Set a Watchman" could not have come to American readers at a more appropriate time, considering the turmoil in the South of late and also the newfound political situation that surrounds our nation.  There are complete passages of this lovely, well-constructed novel that should be carved in stone to remind all Southerners from whence our roots have matured and to where we never wish them to return.<br/>All of the "this was a rough draft/needed editing/not 'To Kill A Mockingbird'" cries are unfounded, to say the very least!!  "..Watchman" is a great piece of literary fiction and had there been no "Mockingbird", this great thin volume would have served as Lee's classic.  The introduction of refreshing new characters in this pre-sequel are well placed and the wonderful portraits of an aging Atticus Finch, "Scout" and her aunt and uncle are refreshing and breathe life into the now-grown Jean Louise.  Our "Scout" has become a woman and her small, sleepy, Southern hometown has changed...while she has changed and grown in NYC.  However, we must, layer by layer, trust our souls as we come to the conclusion as to whether those young "Scout" loved and revered so high have become lesser people.  I am of the thought that "Watchman" is a lesson on the idolization of the young and the adult discovery of the "real people behind our childhood heroes"..most especially the men who mold a young girl's life.<br/>Atticus Finch, as always, is one unforgettable literary figure.  The comparison of the Atticus of "Mockingbird" and "Watchman", in the end, is minimal and well described with words that shall linger in my mind forever when I think of realizing my beloved father was simply a man and never the "god" as I had built him into as a young girl.  If I have one complaint about "Watchman" which is ever so simple:  I do wish Lee had given us a more thorough conclusion to this book, tying up all ends of relationship fragments and giving us even stronger hints or explanations of the future for Jean Louise and her counterparts.  When "Watchman" suddenly ended, I lay in bed, looking at my I-Pad screen, saying loudly, "No, Harper, tell me more?  What happened next?  I need to know!!".  Except for this one flaw in the ending, I am watching my I-Pad charge to actually copy passages of this book to pass on as "little proverbs of life" to my daughter and granddaughter...Yes, that is how much the beautiful phrasing of the lessons in this novel touched me!!<br/>Thank you, Harper Lee!!  Please also let us see a movie....to add a companion piece to the great 1960's film of this wonderful novel would make three generations of "Mockingbird" lovers over the moon!!  I give this long-anticipated new American classic 5 big stars and it is added to my "must be read yearly" collection!!  I cannot say enough about this book!!  What a find for readers everywhere.  Cliff Notes...get ready...you need to get your work done as this novel will join "Mockingbird" on the "Must Read" literary list!!
"Every man's island, Jean Louise, every man's watchman, is his conscience." I just finished reading this wonderful book, and I absolutely recommend it. I initially approached it with a great deal of apprehension and lowered expectations. I love Mockingbird, and I knew that it would be difficult to follow that work with similar profoundness or success. I also knew of the controversy surrounding the publication itself, as Ms. Lee refused to allow said publication until her death. That all said, this book is exceptional. It more than lives up to the enduring relevance, simple profundity, and insight of Mockingbird. Twenty-six year old Jean Louise (Scout) Finch is a woman who was raised in the South but amidst the increasingly tense backdrop of the civil rights movement, she finds herself as a women in limbo. She doesn't feel at home in NY, nor can she reconcile the Maycomb she called home (nor the people she thought she knew there) to the Maycomb of the sixties. She was simply born "colorblind," and the racial tensions that surround her (from both sides) threaten all she thought was right and true. It's a story of becoming your own person, accepting all of your components (even those that seem directly juxtaposed to each other,) acknowledging that it's alright not to "fit the mold" of what others think it means to be a southern conservative, realizing there are more people who feel the same way you do than you realize, and most importantly standing up for your convictions, even when it means standing against those you love most. The divisions and prejudices described in this work certainly still exist today, and as such the important themes of this novel remain painfully significant. READ IT!!!
She tells it as I remember it. A true telling of the story
I have not read it yet. My husband says it is a sloe read.
Love her writing style. Content had an interesting  slant.
This book covered a conversation I have heard all my life
So glad to read Harper's book. She us such a good writer.
It's been so long since I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" that when I think back upon that book Gregory Peck comes to mind. I read "Go Set a Watchman" more or less as an independent, free standing piece, and I loved it. This book brings the reader back to the deep south of the 1950s. We get a peek at the attitudes of the locals there and then and the reader may well be awed by how many of their fears about the development of race relations in America were prophetic given what problems race relations present today, in the year 2015, throughout the United States. In GSAW, Atticus predicts that the then course of the development of black/white relations will lead to the downfall of the strong society Americans built while "Scout" feels the answer is for white people to "help" black people get up to speed. Aren't they really saying the same thing? Did anyone help the Chinese immigrants who were so mistreated in their early days in America? (Go ahead. Those who can't handle the truth can start giving this review the thumbs down now)<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the story, I enjoyed the setting, and I was perfectly content with the quality of the writing and its style. Was Scout's reaction to her discovery that Atticus' was a good but typical Southern man somewhat "over the top"? Yeah, it was for me. But this may be the reaction others would expect. I would say to one reviewer above who loathed the book and bragged that he/she read it in three hours to slow down while reading. Reading is not a race. Reading is for pleasure. Perhaps that person would enjoy reading more if he/she realized this. You wouldn't watch a movie on fast forward, would you?
once I get started it goes more quickly. I can tell by the first chapter that Watchman will be a good book.. Ok let me read & ill let you all know
Haven't finished reading it yet.  I do not want to finish it in one day.  I waited all those years I am savoring each passage and I am loving it.
I like the way she explores the psyche of her character.
Strong start with a weaker finish.  Still worth reading.
From the first page to the last I was hooked. At times I wanted to shake Jean Louise and at other times I wanted to hug her. Fantastic read.
I have to say the book drew me in.  I looked forward to reading it in the late evening hours.  She did a masterful job of telling her story.  There were parts that might have become a little more polished with an editor's support, but overall it spoke to me.  I would have liked to have read it as a younger woman.<br/><br/>I did not read reviews before reading it and so did not know the source of the title.  All I knew is that many were disappointed in the book and that they thought Scout's father was a racist. From my reading however I did not take away that Atticus was a racist.  I took away that he was a human, and not perfect.  The book has him as a man of his time - subject to everything he was exposed to growing up and through his life. In the time period of the book people in small towns did not have the same access to information that we do now. Atticus was a lawyer and was inspired by the same thinking that drove Thomas Jefferson - that once people were exposed to knowledge they would make decisions in a rational manner - because that was how they though. Only the learned should have a say in government, because they will make thoughtful decisions.  Today we know much more about the thought processes involved in human decision making and how they form their positions on controversial issues.  The point however was not about Atticus, but rather Scout, and her journey.  I won't spoil it for those who have not read the book yet, but this is a book I would have liked to have read in my late teens or early 20s.<br/><br/>It is a short book, but it tells the story that I think Harper Lee wanted to tell.
Must read for all. In depth story of Scout and family.
I think this book should have have been written first.
Controversial? Yes. Heartrending? Somewhat. It is hard to realize that heroes in a particular moment are simply humans with human faults and failings when that moment is over.<br/>As a lover of TKAM since I was a pre-teen, I knew I was going to read Watchman, but when the controversy began about boycotting because Atticus was depicted as a racist, I immediately thought "No way..." then realized that if I learned nothing from the original story but one thing, it was that I had to think for myself, and do what was right, regardless of how difficult it might be.<br/>In this book, we see Scout grow to adulthood emotionally, although she had done so physically several years prior. We remember her idolization of her father, and all he stood for, and we see an event, that is not exactly what it appears, through her eyes. How do you see the person who has totally molded your sense of honor and compassion for everyone, without the golden veil that makes his every breath god-like to you? You come to a crossroads  of what he instilled in you and inspired you to imitate in every situation, and a new road- one where you evaluate and decide based on who YOU are, not who he was. It's known as growing up, and it is never easy. Some never manage it at all.<br/>Could those be the same ones who refuse to read the book because they are so attached to what Atticus taught them years ago that they are afraid of where Watchman may lead them?<br/>I am so very glad for the chance to see Scout grow up, and learn the most important lesson she might ever learn. I just hope I have learned something, as well.
Often times, when we are young, we have pure beliefs: things are not only true and false, black or white, but only either good or evil.  Harper Lee clearly presents this viewpoint in the 26 year old Jean Louise Finch (a/k/a Scout) daughter of her father and idol, Atticus Finch.  Jean Louise firmly believes that Atticus, the super-honest, pure liberal non-racist attorney, of _To Kill A Mockingbird_, is nothing short of the second coming of Christ.<br/>It is a work full of humor, wisdom, and common sense.<br/><br/>Jean Louise very reluctantly learns that nothing in life is perfect, that people and communities unfortunately have complex feelings and beliefs about political and social issues (in this case, black and white relations and racism).  Jean Louise considers moving back to New York because she cannot stand living in as bigoted and hateful society as Macon, Alabama.<br/><br/>The star character in _Watchman_ is Jean Louise's uncle, Dr. John (Jack) Finch who is both colorful and wise.  While Jean Louise and I  do not agree with everything he tells her, I do agree with the necessity of being able to try to compromise one's pure beliefs of childhood and adolescence and that true progress in obtaining equal rights for everybody may take quite some time.  Sometimes societies are slow in accepting positive change and may resent (at least at first) governmental rules imposed on them.  It does not make that society completely evil.  Jean Louise finally, but reluctantly, learns that sometimes the ability to compromise all this is an important part of achieving adulthood.
This is amazing writing, story line etc.  I loved it.
VERY GOOD, BUT NO COMPARISON TO TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD
gave an interesting look at the South on segregation.
Good points ,made you think about things!  Glad they published the book! Read the book and judge your self.  You won't be disappointed.
No long comments.... Just please read the book.  It is way better than five stars.  You'll gain a different perspective.  Enough said!
My wife and I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" at least once a year.  This book really filled in a lot of questions.
Good
Enjoyed this novel.  Harper Lee is exceptional!
Disjointed, rambling. Very disappointed, don't waste your money.
The characters from To Kill a Mockingbird are so ingrained in my mind that I found the older Atticus uncharacteristic.
Watchman expounds further on the joys and truths of mockingbird and then sucker punches you in the gut.  A great work.
Liked Mockingbird better, but was a good read.
re-read "to Kill a Mockingbird" first.
Harper Lee has a way of looking into the soul.
I have just found the time to start reading it
not as good as "To Kill a Mockingbird"
The plot was given away in the pre-print hype
Will be a classic,like To Kill A Mockingbird.
Quite thought provoking.
Harper Lee's rediscovered novel is a sequel to her beloved classic, "To Kill a Mockingbird," although it was supposedly written earlier. It takes many of the familiar characters from Mockingbird and tells you what happens in their future. SPOILER ALERT HERE, but one of the most controversial things in the novel is that the character of Atticus Finch turns out to be a segregationist. This is probably one of the most troubling aspects of the book, because Atticus was such a towering and revered figure in Mockingbird, practically the epitome of integrity. But it also becomes one of the most fascinating aspects of Watchman because we see how his daughter Scout, aka Jean Louise, processes and deals with this information. I found the book very moving. While the book is not the masterpiece that Mockingbird is, it's ultimately a wonderful follow-up, especially for those who have been such fans of Harper Lee.  I just recently read Mockingbird for the first time before beginning this book, and it's easy to see that Harper Lee's editor  gave her the best advice in encouraging her to tell Scout's story as a child. That's what led Harper Lee to write her real masterpiece. But Watchman provides a fitting coda to that book and projects the characters stories into the future, with some heartbreak along the way.
Quite a thought provoking book and very timely. Her prose is magnificent and the story flows without confusing.
I was hooked on To Kill a Mockingbird as a child. I first saw the movie and then I had to read the book. It has been a favorite of my family... including my children. Go Set a Watchman has spurred negative reviews from people that clearly did not read the book in its entirety or did not understand it. The book was perfectly written for its setting. Harper Lee used the characters and her words to educate us more about the Civil Rights movement. ..and even the Civil War. History is like the Bible...some people like to take things out of context and say it is the truth..And the whole truth. Kudos to Lee for trying to set us straight.  My wish now is that I wish there was yet another sequel.
Portrayal of aticus was very disappointing.
Boring!!!
He's not a bigot. This is a great first rendition of the Finches. It may even be better than Mockingbird.
I found it difficult to enjoy because of my love for her first published book; 'To Kill a Mocking Bird.'.
disappointing and confusing, see why this was a rough draft, still its Harper Lee, and I will treasure it
IF you loved "To Kill A Mockingbird" you will probably hate this book.  I found Scout to be arrogant, distasteful, obnoxious, loathing of all around her and worse.  I can't say enough bad things about this book.  I was surprised to read others good eviews because no one I have talked to that has read it has liked it. she should have NEVER  published it. It is being sold strictly on her reputation.All around waste of money and time.
Great follow up to to kill a mocking bird
<br/>
Brand new, but the book wasn't that good.
This was a good book I enough reading it.
excellent - would recommend  to anyone!!!
I loved reading this book.  It was painful, but will read it and To Kill A Mockingbird over and over.
I wanted to know what happened to Scout.
Book was not for me but for my mother...
So many people I know have refused to even read this book because they love To Kill A Mockingbird so much and cannot bear the idea of Atticus Finch being anything less that the perfect hero. Other's have hated it after reading it because Atticus Finch, in their opinion, is a racist. Anyone who thinks that does not understand the context of the era or the environment of the times in which it is written and takes place. It is as though they only read the scene Scout witnessed in the Courthouse. The complexities of the history of racial tensions and those who navigated those waters is brilliantly illustrated in this novel. The less than positive role Christianity played in this history is exposed in such a way that I believe it is the reason Harper Lee's Go Set a Watchman could not get published at that time. She herself was a remarkable woman as she was born in a time and place where one with her sensibilities was a rarity. As she shares these attributes through her characters of Scout and Attitcus, one learns so much about the not so black and white issues of community, family, race, culture and misunderstandings, forgivingness and love.
Just as good as Mockingbird.  I felt as though I was standing next to Jean Louise as an observer.
Can't wait to read it. Perfect timing!
Gritty, poetic, mirthful, provocative.
Not as good as To Kill A Mocking Bird!
The novel by itself seemed unfinished.
Kind of a letdown that ended abruptly.
Just loaded with racist images! Fragmented story telling. Great insight into the characters.
So far, so good. The book itself is nicely constructed and the story is starting off nicely.
I loved it. Couldn't put it down.
As good a read as the first book.
Great Book a long time in coming.
Lyrical, enjoyable, worth reading
Should have left it undiscovered.
You need to read this remembering it's set in the middle of the 20th Century and in the South that was still dealing with the aftermath of slavery and reconstruction and not judge it or the characters by today's standards.  It's a coming of age for Scout who had idolized her father, finding he has clay feet just like everyone else.  But was he really racist by the standards of his day, or was he trying to help  the African-Americans of the South in his slower way, even though the NAACP was pushing for immediate changes in politics, jobs, housing, etc.  Hard questions to be sure.  Great book for book clubs where this can be discussed.  That said, it does read more like a first book offering by an author.  I liked it because Scout now goes forward understanding herself and her family better without  betraying her values, but also more understanding of the world as a place of shades of gray rather than the black & white of childhood.
Pay attention!  Very good story.
A must read for Harper Lee fans!
It was terrific.  All I expected
Just started reading "Go Set A Watchman" and so far I am very pleased.
I enjoyed the book very much, but I really like To KIll a Mockingbird better.
Interesting look into the past.
Story line was developed well.
I was torn about reading this book....I love TKAM.  I am glad I read it.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It just makes me wish that Harper Lee had published more over the years, I also hope that the rumours of a third manuscript are true and that it some day gets published.
not as good as previous book.
Good price and fast delivery.
Shipped quickly, great story!
Harper Lee is incredible. A better book could not have been written as a companion for To Kill a Mockingbird. This is not a book for the reader with a sentimental or sappy nostalgia for the residents of Maycomb. This is a book for the reader who wants to know the residents in all of their full blown humanity and wants to love them anyway.<br/><br/>No one could do that better than Harper Lee, and she has.
Given the publisher’s tale that this was a long buried draft for the high school classic, “To Kill a Mockingbird,” I have to say that Harper Lee’s “latest” novel works better as a sequel. With already established characters and an iconic setting in the South undergoing another in a series of radical changes, the tale of an adult Scout returning from New York on an annual vacation to find differences in her relationships with acquaintances is a universal theme especially when internal growth is the actual transformation over the twenty years since the trial.<br/><br/>The author expertly weaves the tale with flashbacks that do not require more than familiarity with the original work.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the fiction is in the publisher’s tale which some could skeptically envision as hype? Well, the judgment is yours.
After all the hype, was very disappointed in the overall production.
I loved this book! I understand why people didn't enjoy it, but I did and here's why. As children I do believe there is a natural process we journey with our parents from adoration, understanding and then hopefully friendship. We, as readers, get to hear about Scout's journey with her and as readers who adore Atticus Finch, we get to go through the same with him. It was amazing! These beloved characters became more layered and more human. I understood Jean Louis' heartache and I shared in it with her. Go Set a Watchman contextualized Atticus; it made him human. It was also a great reminder that while we may be countercultural for our present time, there is always a generation behind us who will push, challenge and pull us to do better. Well worth the time. I am STILL very happy to have named my son Atticus.
I enjoyed reading this book.
Haven't finished reading it.
I just started, but love it.
In the headlines now, thought provoking, sad that I read it so fast.  Will start my reread tomorrow.  This book could have been written yesterday or 40 years ago.
I haven't completed the book yet, but so far it has been excellent!
Like many others Mockingbird was one of those books I'll never forget reading, so I was very excited to get Go Set A Watchmen. However, in all honesty the book was a bit difficult for me to get through. I went into it with the full understanding of when it was written, but I just don't feel those particular racist perspectives need to be written or read about any longer. I was very disappointed in the Atticus we saw in this book, but I can understand it. I very much can relate to Scout, being a girl that grew up in the south and didn't quite fit in the same ways she didn't. I liked how the story rounded itself out, so it is something I'm glad to have read. I just don't think I'll be picking it up for a second go. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
I think it was a good read.
Very relevant to our times.
I wrestled for several days over whether I felt reading this book would be an insult to the author who so carefully guarded her literary genius.  I felt if she had gone this long without publishing another that maybe there was never intended to be a follow-up.<br/><br/>While I disagreed with some of the character developments, this work is testament to the fact that Harper Lee was a gift to literature.  Her original work was no fluke, as this book too is rich in meticulously crafted prose, biting dialogue, and an innate understanding of the political climate in our Southern states.<br/><br/>If you're on the fence, choose to read it.  Be ready for some unkind revelations, but enjoy the work itself for what it is....another Harper Lee masterpiece.
not as good as Mockingbird
I veryichogsn enjoyed it!!
Wonderful book. I didn't know what to expect from a sequel to a classic, but Ms. Lee delivered. This may be another American classic in the making.
Go Set a Watchman set the world afire when it was announced. After years of rumors that Harper Lee had written another book and questions about if it would be published, the book’s final discovery continues to be followed by controversy surrounding whether or not Lee had been taken advantage of by her publisher. Regardless, the book is out and with society in upheaval again, it just may be the perfect book at the perfect time. In the story, Jean Louise (Scout) is home visiting from New York and what follows are vignettes on a theme. Each vignette builds to a crescendo as Jean Louise breaks the shackles of childhood to become her own person.<br/><br/>Breaking the Icons<br/><br/>Thomas Wolfe famously wrote that you can’t go home again and for Jean Louise the statement  is true. When she arrives she finds a world in chaos. As the South reels from the recent Supreme Court decision, presumably Brown v. Board of Education,  the battle lines have been drawn and Scout finds that her father and boyfriend might be on the opposite side as she is.<br/><br/>Atticus allows his daughter to tear him down verbally as she works out her own beliefs about the world. He gives her the opportunity to stop using him as a crutch and instead stand firm in what she thinks, moving through the process of metamorphosis from child to adult. Scout is able to crush the idol she has made of her father and see him as simply human. It’s a beautiful picture of fatherly love as Atticus helps his daughter to make her own way.<br/><br/>There is little that is as painful in this world as having a hero in your life suddenly become nothing more than human. Yet it is one of life’s most important lessons, finding that the thing you’ve placed on a pedestal is not worthy of such admiration. What we put our faith and hope in must be able to sustain the weight of such things,and the weight of such glory is heavy indeed. False idols must be brought down if true clarity is ever to be found.<br/><br/>Stranger in a Strange Land<br/><br/>Scout finds herself irrevocably changed by the end of the story and her question becomes how to live in a place where she does not agree with those around her. The answer her uncle offers is poignant, “…the time your friends need you is when they are wrong, Jean Louise. They don’t need you when they’re right -.”<br/><br/>Standing up for what you believe is the most difficult when the world and worldview of those around you is diametrically opposed to your own. Our response should not be to run and isolate ourselves with likeminded people. It is at those times that we must stand up and lovingly engage. Edmond Burke said, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.” Scout’s uncle continues with the good advice about how to engage such a culture when he says,<br/><br/>  “I mean it takes a certain kind of maturity to live in the South these days. You don’t have it yet, but you have a shadow of the beginnings of it. you haven’t the humbleness of mind-”<br/><br/>“I thought the fear of the Lord was the beginning of wisdom.”<br/><br/>“It’s the same thing. Humility”<br/><br/>To influence and impact the people and the world around us any action we take must be done with humility and love. If we want to change the world around us it must be through honest and open interaction. We must stand for something and not be afraid to share those convictions with others. We cannot do nothing. Jesus clearly reminds of us this in Matthew 5,<br/><br/>"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Go Set a Watchman is a visionary book about the past yet it is just as relevant today. It’s an important read and well worth your time. I encourage everyone to wrestle with the themes because you just might find yourself changed in the end.
My 9th Grade English teacher, Mrs. Ausel, gave us "To Kill a Mockingbird" as one of several reading assignments. It didn't me long to figure out what was going on, with classroom discussion, and even without reading much of it, I still passed the tests. That didn't make me any brighter for not reading it, but it did make me lucky! I should've flunked those tests, and never did. But 24 years later, I saw that there was a sequel coming out, and I STILL had yet to read "To Kill a Mockingbird!" In March of 2015, I finally sulked to my local library, checked it out, and finally realized the beauty and genius of what I was truly missing. And hey, not that you're actually MISSING something today, especially if you aren't into books. But you'll easily find that "Mockingbird" will always stick with you, and the sequel, "Go Set a Watchman," will burn in your brain as well.<br/><br/>Jean Louise Finch, who we know as "Scout," returns to the South in Maycomb County, Alabama to visit from New York City. Atticus is on her mind, and she wants to visit her Daddy! She's also quite taken with Atticus's associate, Henry Clinton, a gentleman who grew up treated like trash, but has made something of himself. As for Aunty Alexandra, who lives with Atticus, well, Jean Louise (I think we can call her Scout from this point on!) will put up with her, tolerate her, while never failing to go at it with her in heated debates, only to make up for it over coffee.<br/><br/>But Scout's return is quite unprepared for, and she sees change, and those changes actually have included her beloved Henry, and her own Atticus! Scout doesn't like it, and she doesn't like it one bit!! Come to find out her Daddy actually joined the KKK, and you might just hear more than one voice of opinion.<br/><br/>All I heard about, when "Go Set a Watchman" came out was people screaming about how controversial this was supposed to be. Maybe some of these people actually read it, or they didn't. If they find it to be controversial because they've read it and formed an opinion, that's fine. But if you've actually gone out of your busy-body way to make some noise about this, when you haven't even read it? That makes you rather ignorant, and it definitely shows a lack of education on your part. If you choose not to read it, then so be it. But don't try and sign up to be the Professor in a Harper Lee class without even reading her. Once again, Harper Lee's voice rings out loud and clear, and her message is getting across, just like it did back in 1960, with the classic that won her the Pulitzer!
Just finished this, and enjoyed it with some reservations. I  did find what I expected to be in that it is interesting in a literary way, to read the prequel/sequel to TKAM.<br/><br/>I think Scout was a little simplistic not to understand her father, but then even in TKAM she wasn't the brightest light.  I suspect even at the end of the story, she doesn't really understand what her father and uncle were trying to tell her, or perhaps their arguments, as put forth by Harper Lee, were dumbed down a bit by her limitations, either as a philosopher or as a writer.  This book might be better titled "Go set a Strawman" because the argument is largely a straw man one.<br/><br/>I was expecting there to be more flashbacks to her childhood with Jem and Dill. Interesting that the Hank character never appeared in TKAM even though he was there in their school years, apart from the summers, according to this. I suppose he had no function in that book.<br/><br/>It is true that there really isn't much if any of a plot in this story, and most of what little there is, is unresolved.  But the characters are all there or mentioned, except for Jem of course, and the Radleys.  And the Uncle is very similar to what he was in TKAM, even if Atticus and Cal are slightly different.<br/><br/>I'm going to reread it, because I will say I skimmed it a bit - I got impatient with Scout being quite so clueless as to what was going on in that meeting and her quick rush to judgment.  She ought to have known Atticus keeps his council on things.  As a lawyer, he naturally has a history of listening to contending sides without showing expression or prejudice - required in a court. Of course, she has always been a hot head, so that she reacts first (Unlike Atticus) and thinks later, is nothing new.  Come the end, when things are explained somewhat to her, I think she was a little full of her wisdom.  Her Uncle laid his praise on to her a little thick, but that was either author hubris or him as a character letting Scout down easily until she grows up a bit more. Perhaps that's in part why the original editor, who must have seen this too, encouraged her to write from a child's perspective.  Very interesting in that regard.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought it was worth purchasing.  It's not going to supplant TKAM by any stretch(and no one suspected that it might), and to some extent is a vanity piece for the author. But as a counterpoint/side novel, it is interesting.  And interesting from a literary analysis viewpoint too.  And I really liked seeing Maccomb and its characters again.
As a professor of Gender Women's Studies and Queer Studies,  I like that this book GO SET A WATCHMAN (GSAW) shows us where Harper Lee's original voice was coming from prior to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD (TKAM). I also think that Harper, as a non-traditionally gendered person, as she portrayed Scout, as an unmarried Southern woman, and as close friends with the acknowledged gay Truman Capote, in a time where being queer/different/ "Boo Radley"-ish would have caused her serious harm-- chose to be in seclusion-- perhaps. Perhaps she lived/lives a life totally different life from what we the public see-- most famous folks do. In any case, she had her reasons for not publishing this book--after being turned down the first time. I think it would have been a crime for it not to be eventually published, however. It is her voice. It is not plagiarized. Most authors when they get a famous "first" novel bring forth other books and those books get published/noticed in way differently than they would have before the fame. Harper did not do choose to do that-- to have GSAW share in the fame and spotlight of TKAM. Why? I think she didn't want the public scrutiny that she saw coming her way after TKAM. I don't think her life as she was living it was able to be under the spotlight in the way it was after TKAM-- and she chose to keep living that life, rather than give it to the public. She chose to go "into seclusion"--or rather live a life out of the public eye, and that may have included for her not publishing again.  But, she clearly kept writing. She was a writer. A writer's writer-- as evidenced by her relationship with Capote. I wouldn't be surprised if we see another Harper Lee novel before she bids us goodbye.
fast shipping. very happy
Definitely worth reading.
I preordered this book and received it the day it was released. Most people I have talked to said they didn't like this book for the sole reason that it didn't read the same way as TKAM. It wasn't supposed to. Harper Lee wanted this book to be written differently in order to portray the characters differently. The same characters mentioned in TKAM are completely different in this novel and I thoroughly enjoyed that. This novel takes place 20 years later so there's bound to be differences. I personally thought the entire story was so well written and further emphasizes the "real life" aura Harper Lee manages to write so amazingly well. This story isn't meant to be cheesy and that's why I really enjoyed it.
very limited violence - a very tough time in the US history
Disappointed that Ms Lee didn't even try to edit the story.
I didn't agree with the critics, that must make me a bigot.
I really liked this book even though I had been told that it contradicted "Mockingbird".  It really shows the evolution  of Atticus.
Very well written novel.
I enjoyed it thoroughly!
I really liked the book!
uncle hit nail on head, don't put people on a pedestal!
I know a lot of people are disappointed in this book because of the way Atticus Finch is portrayed.  To me it's irrelevant that the character is different between the two books.  I judged to book on its literary merits and how much I enjoyed reading it.  I think it was an excellent portrayal of a cultural disconnect between father and daughter, the latter having left the rural South to live in New York City and is returning to her home town some years later.  It was altogether believable. And, I thought Harper Lee's writing was excellent, although perhaps not quite as good as To Kill a Mockingbird, for which she apparently had a lot of editorial support.
Excellent and provoking
Have no read yet.......
Interesting POV shifts!
Enjoyed especially having lived in this Era portrayed.
Interesting..good read
Fantastic sequel for " To Kill a Mockingbird".  For those who wrote a bad review,  you don't know the South!'
This book is<br/>A fitting summary of a life long lived as a true Southerner. That is what Atticus is after all and has been his whole life. He is not a racist and those<br/>Who publicized and criticized this book on that slant obviously did not read it in its entirety! Attics believed in the law and nurtured that belief in his children. How they interpreted that was up to them and had Jem lived we don't know what his take would have been on the race issue. Scout left the south and that leave helped her form her own take on justice as it pertained to race.<br/>This is a wonderful end to the story.
Alls good with Amazon
I found the story to be uncomfortable and saddening. It takes away hope and faith and the ability to have Hero for a life time. It was not only the the story line itself but the book was poorly written as well. Perhaps there was good reason for this book to not have been published previously.
I had my middle school son read To Kill a Mockingbird.  At 13 he is able to enjoy the story, and absorb the lessons.  This book?  So much more difficult to read and recommend.  Definitely I am encouraging my son to wait a few years on this one.  Yet the characters are deeper, and lessons more profoundly true than TKAM.  In some ways, the book is a mirror to the reader.  What do you tolerate?  How do you love?  And how do decide to whom you will extend grace?<br/><br/>Simply put, the book is even better, though far more divisively difficult, than her original masterpiece, TKAM.
I felt she captured the culture of the time
It was a disturbing book to read as I feared it would shattered my positive memories of "To Kill A Mockingbird."  But even with my uncomfortable feelings, there were some lessons to be learned from Harper Lee's new books.  Change does not just come in a vaccum; history and culture need to be considered if change is to be effective.  Some of us who classify ourselves as progressive or liberal must be sure that we do not become as intolerant as we often accuse the conservatives of being.  It is a book worth reading.
Not To Kill a Mockingbird but a good read.
I loved this book.
Very disappointed.
Hatefilled racist poorly-written trash.
Good read not done yet but good so far.
Provides a good picture of what the beloved characters from "To Kill a Mockingbird" became years later. Very throught-provoking especially in the present day context. My favorite take-way from the book, "paraphrased" is "Prejudice & Faith both begin where reason ends". To me this is even very applicable to the haters that won't read this book because of what they've heard becomes of Atticus. To them I say: open your minds & use your brains to THINK!
This is really not a novel.  It's a manuscript.  It's hard to believe  she wrote this before  To Kill a Mockingbird.  I'm glad  I read it, but it cannot be  compared  to To Kill a Mockingbird.  And, I don't think it makes a lot of sense without knowledge of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird.  I doubt Harper Lee would want this published without some serious editing.  However the "Holy Ghost" scene  is hysterical, reminiscent of  Mark Twain.
A masterpiece at many levels.  The internal & external conflicts between Jean Louise & all of her family, friends, & Southern culture are consumed by the reader.  Nuances & allusions, like jigsaw puzzle pieces pull the entire picture together when one least expects it.  Having read TKAM (& seen the play) previously makes GSAM the icing on the cake.  Being a Southerner, a writer, & a Literature teacher totally magnified my reading to exponential heights.
Love this! Very thought provoking.
I found the book unfocused and hard to be interested in. In my opinion it did not live up to the hype. There really wasn't much of a plot to pull me in and hold my attention.
Wow! Just finished " Go set a Watchman" Well I don't know what I think about it. I guess to sum it up racism will be here on planet earth long after I've taken my last breath. I find it fascinating that this book was written so long ago we're still dealing  with these issues,it's just meant to be. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm  totally fascinated with a Haper Lee,she was so ahead of her time.
Typical young writer and  nieve.l
https://threefoldliving.wordpress.com/2015/07/23/the-mockingbirds-encore/
I ordered Netflix's To Kill a Mockingbird to bring me up to speed before reading the Watchman. It had been many years. I knew the story but I wanted to get the feel of the time. Watchman carried right on. The characters and their realizations and their heated debates were explored from several angles. Important here is that you must transport yourself first to that earlier time before the civil rights era and then, read with your third ear in our contemporary context. Some reviewers in the media were not happy with the book or the context. I believe they are wrong when they look through the politically correct lens of today. Daughter Scout, now grown up discovers the father and herself. Thoughtful and meaningful way for this Yankee to understand a little better the societal forces that remain in the South. We want to say that "back then," those were simpler times. Maybe so. Maybe not.
I lived in the South during this time period. Like Scout I was color blind, and didn't understand why my black friend could not sit with me at the movies and they wouldn't let me go up to the balcony to sit with her. Troubling times then, still boiling over these days in some areas. Descriptions of attire at the high school dance and the paper mache decorated gym brought back vivid memories.
Wonderful book
Smooth Reading
Excellent book
A realistic view of racism and how even the most honorable men and woman could not overcome their opinions against racism.  To have lived in these years when the after effects of slavery were still so devastating and overwhelming to try to fix in an equitable manner. Thank goodness for the naacp and the courage it took to undertake the problem.  [...]<br/>[...]<br/>[...]<br/>[...]<br/>[...]<br/>[...]
Good book and very interesting.
Great reading. Would buy again.
I think it's brilliant. I got chills when I read Jean Louise's monologue condemning Atticus for his racism. She was certainly on the right side of things. How brave to make the previously heroic Atticus a racist. I admire Ms. Lee's courage and her tremendous writing talent. Her speech to Atticus is right up there with "I  Had a Dream". It is like an anti-racist aria. Bravo!
Well, as reported (before it was published) the hero of to "Kill A Mockingbird" (Atticus Finch) turns out to be someone other than what we thought.  It is hard not to be disappointed for people (like me) who grew up with Mockingbird as one of their favorite books, and Atticus Finch as a hero, but it was a really good book nonetheless and certainly worth reading!
Worth reading if you enjoyed "To Kill A Mockingbird" ......
Fascinating to read this book knowing it was written before she wrote To Kill A Mockingbird.  Obviously not as good as the first book, but she wanted it published just as it was, without the benefit of editors etc. It shows a more mature view of the relationship between Scout and her family as well as a very poignant picture of the times during which it was written.
Love the book
Great product
Not much new.
A good read and flowed like To Kill a Mockingbird.  There were some holes that disappoint and a point that was not carried through.  But, the parts that are well written, especially those with Uncle Jack, explain the hyper racial issues that many initial reviewers played up.  I am glad to have read it and it made me go back to Mockingbird for a re-read.
At the first day of my holiday I found an old copy of ”To Kill a Mockingbird” as I had not read it before, but had heard about I began reading the book. I found it fantastic, so when the “Go set a Watchman” was published I immediately had a copy.<br/>It was a great help for me to have read the first book as I had the whole personal gallery. To my big astonishment I read some critics found the “Go set a Watchman” racistic?<br/>I found the essence of the message send by Harper Lee from the discussion Uncle Jack  (Dr. Finch) had with Jean Louise (Scout)  “That's one thing about here, the South, you've missed. You'd be amazed if you know how many people are on your side, if side's the right word. You’re no special case. The woods are full of people like you, but we need some more of you.
This is the closest modern society will ever be to watching a Greek tragedy, and truly feeling as though we watching a larger-than-life hero topple in front of our eyes. Lee has the amazing ability to build characters worth admiring, while still making them human, and fallible. That doesn't mean that this book didn't absolutely ruin me emotionally.
An important book; Scout's a worthy heroine, good and strong, and despite her foibles, has risen beyond her circumstances better than has tired old Atticus. Atticus' brother can justify Atticus in the Klan in decades past to keep an eye on bad guys hiding themselves from justice, but Atticus' conscience fails himself in his association with anti-civil rights locals fighting NAACP efforts. So Scout's (and our) former idol has feet of clay, but Harper Lee and Scout remain worthy of idolatry; such feminist writing and dialogue really was something to pen in the 1950s.<br/><br/>This complex book with the strongest possible feminist lead contains a potential trial matter which could, if developed and made more prominent as occurred with the trial in the Mockingbird movie, carry a movie; the trial concept could succeed or could disappoint as a plot device only because Atticus disappoints in his 'Watchman' strategy to take the case in order to plead the defendant guilty and avoid the intercession of the NAACP.<br/>You can squint your eyes a bit and make this seem a true sequel or prequel. One  can still admire a great trial lawyer doing his best for a client; 'Watchman' has Scout remembering Atticus winning the case related in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', and Atticus has changed mightily in Scouts's now grownup arrival from New York, the place to which Atticus wisely encouraged her to move.<br/><br/> 'Watchman' is more relevant, and more thought provoking, than 'Mockingbird' in these troubled  times, where Oklahoma greets the President of the United States with Confederate battle flags post Charleston events;  women's rights take back seats;  Supreme Court Justices (far removed from Brown v Board of Education) embrace the concept that we no longer need Voting Rights Act protection in southern states with poor records; and a vocal minority of the Supreme Court bitterly disagree that gays deserve civil rights, with a disrespectful Supreme Court dissent cited by State officials as they disregard Supreme Court declaration of the rights of gays as "lawless.
This book while hilariously funny in places still has many lessons in it. As a Southerner I was impressed with the authenticity of it.
A great read
Well written
Well written
Excellent!!!
Great  Book.
I am so glad I read this, despite many of my friends' warning me not to do so. It was such a treat to spend more time with Scout and Atticus.  Watchman was probably a much more realistic view of the times and of people. My first love will always be Mockingbird, but Watchman intrigued me more although not so neatly spun as Mockinbird.
I went in to this read with a bit of trepidation, because after all Harper Lee wrote my most favorite book. Well she didn't let me down with this.  This book can be read without knowing anything about To Kill a Mockingbird.  She wrote this book at the time these monumental civil rights issues and debates were actually going on.  She was living this.  It was a snapshot into the lives of real Southerners.  The language was real.  It wasn't made up to favor one side or the other, that is the way people conversed.  It is a bit shocking at first but it just adds to the authenticity of the story she is telling.  She is a master of storytelling.  She has a way of putting you in the front seat and taking you for a ride.
Great read.  Love the angle and the character development
It's hard for me to understand how this was written before TKAM. The thing that makes that a classic is the character development. The story line is gripping but the way the characters react to it is the real story. I was expecting a lot of the descriptive passages that made the other one come alive. The characters in this one are flat, one dimensional cliches and it just lacks the warmth and humanity of  Mockingbird. Parts of it are written in very pretentious prose and parts are, frankly, downright boring. It is worth reading but be prepared for some really preachy dialogue and a lot of political commentary that really doesn't advance the plot. I won't be holding my breath waiting for a movie!
Scout comes home from NYC to a different world in the South & in the 50s.  The reader must remember the time & setting to not get offended.  It is very realistic even though her language is hard to take at times.  Atticus continues to show dignity & compassion to all as times begin to change & desegregation begins.
Although many have denounced Atticus in this novel as a racist, one must realize that the story is being told by an adult<br/>Scout.  The hero of her youth hasn't changed, Scout has grown up.  She must find an adult-to-adult relationship rather than the child-to-adult relationship of her youth.  You can't go home.
No
Eh
It was so nice to read this novel from the adult perspective.  The adult  perspective of Harper Lee is just as honest as her childhood perspective, but in this rendition, Harper Lee  is now able to evaluate the many erronious concepts and fallacies that had been taught and passed down for generations.  Excellent!
I am amazed that this book has received such publicity. I have just finished it and I was asking myself towards the end of it - why am I reading this children's book. It is like something I would have read when I was in primary school.  It should be advertised as a child's book as should To Kill a Mocking Bird.
Better than Mockinbird.
I'm not sure what all the hoopla was about. The book is fantastic! So Atticus got old a little more eccentric in his old age. Don't we all? It was really more Jean Louise's story about her relationship with her father and those around her. Get over it everybody! It's a great book!
Nice book.
wonderful!
Good. Read
It was ok.
I love it!
Harper Lee has a great touch for writing about the South of years gone by.  Her memory and her phrasing evoke so many of the conflicting emotions  that natives of that region associate with it.  This story is, I think, more nuanced in its narration than "Mockingbird."
If there is one thing this book teaches us, its that some things never change. Whether its racial discrimination, gay rights, or any other social injustice, people can always come up with a good reason to do the wrong thing.
I did not care for it
Little taken aback by some of the dialouge but then remembered it was the fifties..thing were a lot different then.especially in the south.I grew up in the fifties..so could relate and understand Scout.Really enjoyed this book..got you thinking.
I'm not convinced that Harper Lee was really even the author.  The writing style is very different than that of To Kill a Mockingbird.  There are deviations from TKAM that really read like they were written AFTER TKAM was completed.  My impression of the overall work is that the author is making a (weak) attempt at being an apologist for being a white supremacist.<br/><br/>I find it odd that in GSAW, the original house has been replaced by an ice cream stand (which is true to life), but the ice cream stand came into being after TKAM was published.  This leads me to believe that GSAW was written after TKAM was.<br/><br/>Anyway, not a good book by any means.  Save your money and your romantic beliefs from To Kill a Mockingbird.
It is very well written. Harper Lee is definitely a masterful story teller with a highly insightful eye and ear. It was apparently written contemporaneously with Mockingbird, or shortly thereafter, but I can see why it was not released until now. It was a bit before its time and is in many respects shocking, but probably a true account albeit an unusual interpretation of modern Southern thought. It is a completely finished and polished novel. Probably deserves a Pulitzer or even Nobel, for the body of work.
The vivid details captured by Harper Lee so long ago are so very relevant today. Scout, now in her 20s and living in New York, comes home to Maycomb to understand what it means to truly be her own woman.<br/><br/>A must read.
I was really disappointed with this book in the beginning but stuck with it and was glad I did. "To Kill a Mocking Bird" would certainly be hard to compete with and one must remember that this was her first book.
Amazing!
loved it
Terrific
So great
An excellent book!  Reviews calling this a first draft, in my opinion, are unfounded.  It's a great insight into an author's ideas and how they grew.  Most writers wish they could produce a first draft of this quality.
This is a great book so far! Lee does it again, successfully writing a true piece of art after To Kill A Mocking Bird so many years ago. I definitely recommend this book to readers who have and have not read TKAMB!
One that requires reading again and again. I didn't know what to expect and  am still trying to assimilate all that is in it. I won't wait to start it again, though - it's back to the beginning I go.
I thoroughly enjoyed the realistic portrayal of the conflict engendered between generations and regions during the Civil Rights era. Both Scout and Atticus set their own watchmen. Well done!!
Just ok
the fact that I give this three stars instead of the five I would give Mockingbird should illustrate my feelings without going on for pages. but it MUST be pointed out that when Jean Louise is thinking about the acquittal her Daddy won a black man, Harper Lee seems to have forgotten her own writings. the man was found guilty in spite of the evidence!  how can a mistake like this happen?
Great to have.
Excellent read
This was the best book I have read this year...but I adore Harper Lee's writing style.  I am actually thinking of teaching this book second semester in my Junior English III class.
This book pivoted on the definition of bigotry. Two people I know refuse to read it because it doesn't fit their narrative.  They are both Scout. Time for me to have a chat or two.
Fantastic book. "To Kill a Mockingbird" has always been a go to read for me. I was over the moon to hear there was a sequel! It was every bit as good as it's predecessor.
interesting
To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite film of all time. So I was not sure I would like this book. I am reading it now and so far enjoying it.
Thoroughly enjoyed it!
I was not sure what to expect after reading reviews.  However it is a god story about people, not race or bigotry.  Highly recommend it.
GREAT
So so
I liked the honesty (which no politically correct person can even approach) by someone qualified to debate all sides of the issues.
The book is well written, explained the culture of the time. I liked it better than her first novel. It think it ended wonderfully.
If you love the Finch family, warts and all, you must read this novel. Lee allows us to eavesdrop on the beloved family we knew could not be perfect; which makes Mockingbird even that much better. "Go Set..." is from the perspective of our beloved adult Scout, and "Mockingbird" was the same family from a child's point ov view. Isn't that real life? How we percieve things as a child are so different from our adult understandings.<br/>I only wish there were a third and I hope to heaven there will be a movie of this wonderful story.
great read
Interesting.  Not sure it stands alone as anything I'd  recommend.  Nice read after To Kill A Mockingbird.  They go well together.
Keeping the style the author makes our head spins with thoughts and discussion about different worlds settled in the same place.
To start with, I will only be reviewing this book, not the BS controversy surrounding its release.  Lee delves into the Finch family dynamics and even those of Maycomb County.  Its a treat to experience Scout's life at various stages and how she struggles with her "world" changing.  Lee's Scout is a great character and this book only adds to her mystique.  While the book is connected to To Kill A Mockingbird, it does fine on its own as well.  Overall, a delightful book that I can honestly say I will read again!
This was an extraordinary read, not quite as impressive as To Kill a Mockingbird but still very good and highly recommended.
a real performance and finer attitudes regards to police courtesy!  noticed the Queen also; regards NATO Supreme Commander
Love the book, it is very representative of the time and people in rural south.  The negative press is from the PC police.
somewaht of a disappointment due to all the hype. If it came out back when Mockingbird did it would have fit into the era.
Grabbed my soul, put it out in the hot sun to warm.  Ouch and ahhh<br/><br/>More words required so here they are.<br/>F
Very fascinating story about dogs giving Cates ice creams it is funny but also seriously when the fog drops the ice cream
I really liked it...despite what I heard in the media, the story was a wonderful continuation of To Kill a Mockingbird
To Kill a Mockingbird is an all-time favorite of mine and I loved having the chance to reconnect with the characters.
As a black women in America in 2015 I cannot help but compare when this book was written today. Amazing insight from a white women back then. I'm floored by her once more and wish I could know Ms. Harpe Lee personally. So much wisdom.
That's right. Do not read this book. It will challenge your notions of right and wrong. It will smash the idols that you have made. It will challenge your presumptions that people are inherently good or evil. This book is down right offensive. If you are a decent human being who thinks that the world is black and white, and that characters should not be nuanced then this book is not for you.<br/>Did you hate growing up? Do you hate having to answer ethical dilemmas for yourself? Do you despise change? Are you a Paragon of all that is right in the world? Then DO NOT read this book.<br/>This book will cut you.<br/>This book will push you.<br/>This book will, dare I say it, encourage you to take responsibility for your life and your actions.<br/>You will have to be an individual, you will have to believe that other people are individuals.<br/>You will have to understand that there are no good or bad people, just people.<br/>What a piece of garbage.
This was an excellent book!  I loved To Kill a Mockingbird....  and this was a great book, too.  Very provocative!
Its not the greates book, but its a good one. Check out the website http://cheapkidsstuff.com for some good items.
Scout has grown up and is dealing with adult issues, but how she copes is with lessons learned from her childhood
Not a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, but a precursor. Very interesting from a literary history viewpoint.
good
FIVE
Holy cow. Lee proved TKAM was not a fluke. Watchman met and exceeded all my expectations. It was riveting!
Superbly written and takes nothing away from To Kill A Mockingbird. I loved it and plan to read it again.
This is a must read.  I think it  shows Adicus Finch as  a very good man but with flaws.  He is a southern man, a man of his times.  It also tells the tale of a little girl who is maturing and becoming her own person separate from her father whom she had always regarded as a god.  She now sees him as a separate entity from herself.  Now they can be not only father and daughter but friends  I enjoyed this book very..
I think this novel was true to the times in which it was written.  Not understood by younger readers.
It's a Christmas gift. So, I'm unable to describe anything or give it a rating above a 3 for neutral!
This item shipped quickly, but I seems like it was really large print. Are all the books like that?
I knew that this an early version of TKAM, but I am so disappointed in it. The writing doesn't flow easily, and the characters are poorly developed. It didn't take me long to read (a point in its favor), but it just isn't a good book. I found myself wondering how much of TKAM Lee actually wrote, and how much was written or rewritten by her editor. Not recommended.
Why I loved TKAM:<br/>1) the story telling<br/>2) the narrative structure<br/>3) the language<br/>4) the poignancy and insight<br/><br/>Why I love Go Set a Watchman- all of the above.
Reese Witherspoon was outstanding! More authors should use her! The boom was short and sweet.
I can not bring myself to read it. Want to send back.
Harper Lee has the gift to bring a story to life.  Character development is outstanding
A great book!
Eloquent. Harper Lee is so vivid a writer you are there with the characters. Loved It!
I just started the book - but what I;ve read so far, the author is a fantastic writer.
Harper Lee is a uniquely gifted writer. This book is worthy of her formidable legacy.
Deals with a sensitive subject in a very adult, and insightful way.  Loved the book.
It is all the reviews have said. Lots of conversation and disappointment in Aticcus
I would like to thank the literary brain trust at Harper Collins for publishing Harper Lee's discarded first draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, thus giving millions of gullible readers the opportunity to ruin their cherished memories of a book they treasured in eighth grade. Hopefully, the profits Harper Collins reaps by plundering Ms. Lee's wastebasket will encourage the unearthing of other unseen first drafts, like Charles Dickens' A Tale of One City and F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Bad Gatsby.
ho-hum
It was good but as always sequels are never as good as the first and a classic.
Wow
Curious style, but a strong voice. An excellent example of the troubled south.
Interesting book. Can see why she didn't try to publish at the time written.
enjoyed reading some more about the character from To Kill a Mocking Bird.
Lee's a good writer.  Deep understanding of the feelings of her chachters
I don't like what she did to Scout.  She turned her into Sandra Bullock.
I did not care for this book.  I understand this is a draft and not the final published book.  I would not recommend this draft to any one.
I had just read To Kill a Mockingbird so this was a natural book to read. I don't know if it was written by Ms. Lee but it is well written.
After all these years we learn that Atticus is human like the rest of us.  Tearing him down would be kind of like killing a mocking bird.
This book is full of racist filth, even on the part of the protagonist. Great swaths of the book are the ugliest kind racist diatribe imaginable, with slurs comparable to those of Mein Kampf. They make Jean Louise physically ill, but she never comes up with a cogent argument with her sainted father, except to assert weakly that we are all human. She admittedly holds all of the anti-integration, anti-NAACP, anti-Supreme Court, anti-centralized government views of her townspeople; she just doesn't like foul language.<br/><br/>I was curious, but am sorry it was published–very likely as a money-making venture for a beleaguered publisher. I certainly understand why Lee's editor made her completely rewrite it as Mockingbird. At more than a half century old, this book is out of joint with our times. Had it been published when it was written, it would have died the natural death of all bad writing. Now it's a sensation. We don't need this kind of book–although anyone has the right to publish it.
Great Book
i have not had the time to read this thoroughly yet but the reviews I'm seeing are greatly polarizing. I have no idea what to feel about this, but based on what I have been reading, this is a different novel, and not to be compared with To Kill a Mockingbird
3.5 stars, but I round down. I enjoyed this far more than I had anticipated. The central crisis of the book is quite week, and would not make any sense without having read Ms. Lee's heretofore only novel.<br/><br/>This is the story of 26 year old Jean Louise Finch's return to Maycomb, Alabama and the moment her father stopped being the epitome of her ideal human being. Jem died a few years earlier, Calpurnia no longer works for the family and her Aunt Alexandra now tends the house for her father. The book in no way measures up to "To Kill a Mockingbird," but it doesn't hurt or diminish it in anyway. Without a doubt, the strength of this novel is when Jean Louis goes back in time and brings forth a variety of childhood memories from different ages. Those stories are wonderful...one can see why here editor encouraged her to set her work entirely in childhood.<br/><br/>I think this book requires us to reflect on TKAM, but it is a good idea to consider this to not be part of the canon of the tale (sort of like how superhero movies aren't actually part of the comic book lore - for some of you, this will be 2nd nature).<br/><br/>Ms. Lee's writing is clear and evocative. Her style is excellent. A few highlights:<br/>(1) Her Aunt Alexander "was a disapprover." When her husband refused to come home one day, choosing instead to live out his days at a fishing camp, "after she made sure no other female was involved, she could not have cared less."<br/>(2) Very interesting that a book written in the 1950's discussed the "cockiness of youth" and the "refusal to take seriously the gravest questions of their lives."<br/>(3) At lunch with other women of Maycomb, Jean Louis struggles with the engaged set and their talk of wedding, the new baby set and their chatter and the older set and their discussion of material acquisitions and gossip. Some things don't ever change.<br/>(4) Dr. Finch, Atticus's younger brother, is a wonderful new character and the most interesting of the book.
As someone who grew up during the Civil Rights Movement, and one who now lives in a business-as-usual Montgomery, AL, I think I understand this book better than many of the critics whose comments I've seen. This is an exceedingly complex coming-of-age novel, and I have been in a situation similar to Scout's--someone I loved deeply and looked up to held a position diametrically opposed to mine on an important issue at the time. I, like Scout, had to struggle with the conflict between love and conscience, and I kept asking (not aloud) how we could so disagree about something so crucial.<br/><br/>While the book does not end with the knight-in-shining-armor Atticus most of us know from _To Kill a Mockingbird_, it does not, as too many claim, reveal Atticus to be bigoted. By today's standard's, yes, his attitude toward and beliefs about blacks reeks of condescension, he is not a bad man. He is not a hateful man. Rather, he is a real, complex man, trying to live by his principles of justice and rightness in a very difficult time. What Scout really comes to see is that her father is human and not infallible--but she can continue to love him.<br/><br/>This is not an easy read. Things do not go the way I personally wish they would. But it is also a very believable story, both its ups and its downs. I still dislike Aunt Alexandra, but she has mellowed slightly. I do not envy Scout her choices--and I greatly miss Jem's calming presence--but I believe that Lee is dead on target in the situations she presents.<br/><br/>I suspect that a great many readers will hate this book. They, unlike Scout, do not want to grow up and face the complexities of life in the American Deep South. For my part, I consider this a great novel that will endure. It makes _TKM_ richer because of the knowledge it adds. One can't always gloss over what needs to be exposed. And some problems still haven't gone away.<br/><br/>Atticus may no longer be a candidate for sainthood, but he is still a good man. Lee is an incredible writer.
As soon as I heard a "new" novel by Harper Lee was coming out I instantly pre-ordered it. This is unusual for me as I tend to wait until closer to publication to order books by favorite authors or even wait until well after publication for those I know I will eventually want to read, but being that To Kill A Mockingbird is in the top five of my favorite novels of all time I knew I wanted it in my hands as soon as possible. After ordering it I began to read all the negative hype and backlash towards the book (I'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about) and saw many fellow readers declaring they would not buy or read this novel that turned one of the iconic perfect fathers in literature into a racist. While I can completely understand their hurt and anger (I also grew up feeling Atticus was a shining example of what a man should be) I have never been one to shy away from reading something just because the subject matter might be hard to read or others seem against it. Without reading it I wouldn't be able to form my own opinion on its content or really know how it would affect my appreciation for To Kill A Mockingbird. So I dug in and devoured it at every free moment I had. Am I happy I read it? 100%. This is a wonderful companion to Harper Lee's classic work of art and, as the synopsis states, adds depth to those characters we all grew up loving.<br/><br/>When the novel opens, Jean Louise Finch is returning home to Maycomb, Alabama for her yearly two week visit. She's grown used to the big city and, while she has fond memories of the small town she grew up in and grudging respect for this place that never seems to change, from the get-go she seems almost ready for the visit to be over. There are things that pull on her to come home and stay - her father, her beau - but she's not sure if that's the life she wants. Then she discovers that none of the people, including the father that she's always kept on a pedestal of righteousness, are who she thought they were. I really don't want to give away too much about the actual plot, but suffice it to say that what she discovers regarding the opinions and beliefs of those she has cherished are not what she thought they were and she goes on the warpath to let her great indignation and disgust be known before she plans to leave for good. This isn't the end of the story and I won't give away how it ends but this is the main focus.<br/><br/>What I loved most about Go Set A Watchman was the way that everything Jean Louis was experiencing, every burst of shock, anger and disbelief, so well mirrored what I was feeling. How could these people not be who they had always been? Why had they changed? What has happened to bring about this great shift in reality? The answer, simply, is that nothing has actually changed other than the rose-tinted glasses of youth (which was what To Kill A Mockingbird was viewed through) have been removed and in the light of maturity and understanding this is the actual reality it has been all along. Jean Louise, and we readers, are faced with the fact that no one is perfect and everyone is human and therefore flawed. This might be hard to swallow but it is true. The real test of maturity, and what Jean Louise comes to realize, is that we are each responsible for our own beliefs, opinions and actions and, while we can do everything we can to influence other people and try to show them the "correct" way to be, each individual is responsible for themselves and must face the choices and consequences that brings. The overall theme I was left with after turning the last page is what is written in the Serenity Prayer: you must have the serenity to accept the things you cannot change (other people's beliefs), the courage to change the things you can (change the laws governing our society and punish those that break those laws) and the wisdom to know the difference. We shouldn't change our beliefs for anyone else and we shouldn't expect the reverse either. The key is to try to present information and reasonable arguments to influence those around us and, by doing so, illicit the changes that are needed. Burying your head in the sand or screaming your disgust and running away from a problem is never going to give you the results you want, but by rationally presenting your opinions and valid solutions to the issues you at least stand a chance at making a difference. Easier said that done, I know, especially when faced with views and opinions many of us find disgusting and heinous, but there you have it.<br/><br/>Do I think Go Set A Watchman is as good as To Kill A Mockingbird? No, not at all but I don't think that is necessarily a fair comparison either, especially given the fact that the latter novel is such a treasure to me. However, I did enjoy seeing so many of these beloved characters again, even if I wasn't happy with all of them, and there were many lines I read over and over because they were beautifully written. This is an accurate depiction of many small Southern towns during the Civil Rights movement and presents a realistic view of the good and the bad that you would have found there. Harper Lee is a remarkable writer and I can only hope that she did intend for this novel to be published (another one of those rumors floating around). I'll be thinking about this one for a while to come.
There is no modern American author who has the flair of Harper Lee.
Finishes what To Killl a Mockingbird started.Brings it full circle.
Go Set a Watchman has set a lot of controversy about Atticus Finch.  To be honest, he's a racist; he may not be the racist we normally associate with the word, but a racist none the less.  His huge generalization, resistance to rapid change, and fear of the irresponsible is what qualifies him as such.  You are going to need to read the book to know exactly what I'm talking about.<br/>The book is not on the level of Lee's previous masterpiece, but it's a lot better than most books now.  However, this doesn't change the fact that the book had flaws.  The dialogue seemed at times more like a speech than an actual conversation.  The book itself was not tied together as well.  You could split the book into two parts.  With one being Scout adjusting to Maycomb and the other being her finding out about Atticus and the growing change.  In fact, the last few chapters is the main bulk of the story making some parts feel rushed. The book also has less going on, but to me that's a positive.  We get to see a new side of Scout's aunt and see that her uncle is as wise as her father.<br/>In the end, though Harper Lee made a daring move that was absolutely brilliant.  She made the hero that Atticus was in To Kill a Mockingbird into a flawed man showing us that during that time,  heroes like Atticus in the first book were rare.  It helps us appreciate Scout for filling that spot Atticus left behind in Lee's previous novel and it helps us appreciate the heroes that actually existed during this time.  We also respect Atticus for coming so close.  If you can get over the new change and see that in no way does Go Set a Watchman contradict To Kill a Mockingbird, you will enjoy this simple yet enjoyable read.
Really intriguing to meet Scout as a young woman. I started reading To Kill a Mockingbird to my daughter in 1998, today she is a 22 year old and I see so much of Jean Louise Finch in her. Harpur Lee's writing rubs off on people.
Fantastic book, Ms. Lee has done it again, yes I know this was written before Mockingbird. It rings true to this day.
After rereading To Kill A Mockingbird and then this book I was surprised of the changes made. I did enjoy the book.
Darkness from Atticus' past comes to the forefront - but don't be (too) offended, he is what he is!
Excellent, enjoyed reading it
It had been years since I read "To Kill a Mockingbird" and I was excited about this lost novel from Harper Lee.  I saw many comments ion TV about how this ruined the character of Atticus Finch and made him a racist.  As someone has said, it just made him more real and complex to me.  It is probably more akin to the truth of how someone like Atticus had to deal with racial issues at that time regardless of how liberal-minded one might have been.  It did not diminish what Atticus did, the stance he took, in the earlier "To Kill a Mockingbird".<br/><br/>The book, like its predecssor, was well written and captivating.  It made me go back and re-read "To Kill a Mockingbird"!
I thought it was excellent.
Better then her first book
She has definitely got it!
My surmise from trying to read this pitiful book is that Harpet Lee had one heck of an editor for To Kill A Mockingbird.  I read it first in 1960 as a 15 year old after it won the Pulitzer.  There is no question that it was both a great book and a huge influence on generations of Americans. And there is no way I would have made it more than a little way into this "first draft" even at 15.  It's awful.  The story line is like some kind of tiresome teenaged romance. The writing lacks elegance relying on cuteness and just clunks along.  It could have been written by a somewhat gifted fourteen year old.  Someone really trained the rose up the trellis in the Pulitzer winning To Kill A Mockingbird. And whoever it was should have gotten the Pulitzer for that editing. Don't be duped.  I feel a fool for buying this book!
I did love the book.  I read once through, and only analyzed while I read it.  I've not gone back to read again and contemplate, nor have I picked up my copy of Mockingbird to compare.  My initial interpretation is that Ms. Lee is describing the marginalization of women with this book. Later I may have time to go back and support my gut feeling with passages and analysis, but for now I found it well worth reading.  I'd suggest that the prose could use some edits, but the message has little to do with the bottle that contains it.  My only suggestion to someone who is considering buying and reading this book is that they should.
I love this book. It has become a favorite
Delightful book so far.
book was damaged a bit.
Although many people do not want to read this book, because it will change their opinion of the fictional character, Atticus Finch, I felt it was important to read. Yes, he is a bigot in this story, however, IT IS FICTION and is written well. The fact that it was the author's prior book to Mockingbird makes it all the more reason to want to know why she wrote it. It see obvious to me that because the South was the way it was then ( and parts of it is like that still! ) her publisher probably told her to rewrite it and turn Atticus into the amazing person he was.
Hope there is another book in the works!
I found Watchman so interesting in its subtleties and complexities.  Jean Louise is searching for footholds as the world and the people in it shift around her.  Mockingbird places us in awe of a hero that gives us faith.  Watchman puts the onus on each of us to decide where we stand and to hopefully make a difference.  Mockingbird was the book we needed then.  Watchman is the book we need right now.  Harper Lee was ahead of her time.  Having now read Watchman I suspect she felt the time had finally come to release it.  I am so glad that she did.
I was so nervous after reading some of the reviews, i wasnt sure I was going to like it. Oh I was so silly to be nervous. Excellent book, same great writing, and love the way the characters have developed over the years. oh please, are you going to tell you you havent changed your views on things in your whole life?? you must be 20 if you think that way. we change our views many many times over the years. Life sometimes forces us to do that. You just have to read the book to find out what happens, you will not be disappointed, its fantastic.
very moving and timely
Thoroughly good read!
Well worth the read !
As a student of black history and the memory of the south, this book was a fascinating look into the period. Similar to UNCLE TOM'S CABIN or JUBILEE, the story has a fictionalization that is notices--regardless paints a wonderful image of people and times.<br/><br/>No, it does not ruin TKM nor Atticus (who is not part of the KKK, just a different racist organization).<br/><br/>Highly reccomended to see a awe inspiring view of a time blotted by many historians with apologetics or footnotes.
anxious to read this
This book has been reviewed as "disappointing" because it gives the reader a different view of the Finch Family and Maycomb.  I believe it to be a book of Truth, although unfortunate Truth about living in a small town, going away, and never being able to fully return to the days of your youth.  Everyone has to grow up, and Scout is not exception.  A must read for any one who loves the book To Kill a Mockingbird.
This book's power stems from the deep familiarity of the characters from "To kill a mockingbird". Every word in this book is held and examined with Harper Lee's book.<br/><br/>I felt the book had the same spirit and exists in the same universe as TKAM.  But the book details about the characters  and Harper's writing sharpness only comes through at the climax of the book.<br/><br/>In fact, the only reason think I liked the adult Scout in GSAW was because of my memory of the kid Scout in TKAM.<br/><br/>I do question the publishing of this book since it really is a writing artifact step towards the final TKAM and probably NOT meant to really be read as a"sequel".
Interesting Read
Not even a book.  bracelets
Horrible! just horrible!  This is a draft and not a book.  How can the publishers call it a sequel when it was written first and i am sure rejected by every publisher on the earth.  Hopefully, this book, (draft) won't make it into high school required american literature reading.  Just simply horrible!  The cover is the best part of the book.  The only thing worst than the writing of this book is the people who are trying to con uninformed buyers about the embossed title on the cover as a special edition from her Alabama home town bookstore only.  Just horrible!  Everyone is trying to make money off of this not ready for prime time work!
After reading this book I sincerely don't believe the same person who wrote to kill a mockingbird wrote this very bland book. It's terrible. .I literally started crying it was so bad. I think they hired some desperate English major who was deeply in debt to ghostwrite it so they could make some serious moolah. Her beautiful prose and great characters are missing  or have been killed off and have been replaced with Atticus's annoying pill of a  sister. The person who wrote this didn't seem like they even read to kill a mockingbird. Too many continuity errors. The Atticus becoming a racist thing for no apparent reason  felt so fake. It would be like the coyote deciding not to chase roadrunner anymore.  Also there are  page after page of longwinded descriptions of how the road got paved and other pointless  ramblings that go nowhere. I feel bad for harper lee , would love to know if she really wanted this published? I think she got the shaft and so did I.
Great reading!
'To Kill a Mockingbird' is surely on the list of most people's list of favourite novels.  'Go Set a Watchman' is certainly a sequel to it, set 20 years later, despite having been written earlier, and the publisher declining it.<br/><br/>It certainly doesn't reach the standards of the earlier novel.  It's no more than 'OK' in my opinion.  It does explain what happened in the intervening years, and there were parts that had me laughing out loud (such as the errant falsies at the school seniors' prom').<br/><br/>But alas - it's mainly just talk.  Nothing really dramatic happens.  There's a possible trial introduced in which a black African American is accused of killing a white pedestrian, while driving home drunk (the grandson of Atticus Finch's ex-housekeeper, no less).  Atticus Finch accepts to undertake his defence, but it comes to nothing, at least in this novel, that is.<br/><br/>Actually, a little disappointing.
My friends say that Atticus has been criticized as having changed his view, perception, and mind about racism in this book. Why is that a surprise? Since the original story, things have changed and with the country on a downslope from welfare corruption and racism...seems fitting to me. I liked the book and the story.
Very pleased.
I liked the fact that This was a coming of age story for Scout. She was encouraged to leave the nest to find who she was out of the shadow of he father<br/>Should be required reading for all us who turned Atticus into a demigod.
Good book
I love it
An excellent read. The fact that Harper Lee wrote it before To Kill A Mockingbird was not an issue. In fact I'm glad I read this second. Very insightful into the mind of many southerners at this point in history.
This book is one that must be read more than once in order to capture each and every level- it is that deep. Lee takes the reader on a wild roller coaster ride that ends in the most reasonable way, making us understand society as it was in the 1950s but also what makes us all tick at the most basic level. She also shows us the better angels of our human nature in her beloved characters when dealing with the south's ingrained attitudes regarding racism. another classic set 20 years after To Kill a Mockingbird.
I don't know what the big fuss was about over this book, Atticus was still the same, just as Scout aka Jean Louise was the same but grown up. Definitely a couple of surprises and a damn good read!
BEST YET
Love it!
Probably only those who live in the south can really tell, but, it seems there has been little progress. This story rings true, today and yesterday. Atticus is the true southern gentleman.
This is an interesting time capsule from a time and place I am too young and too northern to have known... But like Mockingbird, it draws you in.  I'll surely miss young Atticus, though.
I am on chapter 14. It has been a great read. I have a hard time putting the book down. Very well written. You should read To Killing Mockinbird first  so you remember who the people are in this book.
Exiting the brick and mortar bookstore today with my purchases in hand, I couldn't help but realize I was one of a few who did not have GO SET A WATCHMAN in my stack of newly acquired texts. Having gone through the back and forth of "should I" or "shouldn't I" read the follow up to my beloved classic, I decided weeks ago to order my copy and have it shipped directly upon release just in case I couldn't squeeze in errands on July 14th.<br/>The only qualm I have about this purchase is if its publication does indeed align with Harper Lee's intentions as an author. It does not sit well with me to have some piece of her that she did not want to give as she already gave so much to her readers. For some, she offered the only book we read cover-to-cover in our high school English classes. To others she gave a reflection of one of our country's most divisive eras.<br/><br/>Despite the recent criticism of the first chapter and the novel as a whole, it really does not matter whether Harper Lee's newest text is deemed "good enough" or not. Plot holes and character inconsistencies will not bother readers who simply want to be transported to the world of Maycomb County. We want to get back to the roots of Scout and Jem. We want to recall our friendships much like what the Finch children shared with young Dill. Readers long for the myth or memories of when a village (or town) raised a child. We want to hear the -isms of Miss Maudie while recalling the legacies of our own town's Boo Radley. Above all, we want to believe in the goodness of others as exemplified by our literary superhero, Atticus Finch.<br/><br/>Even if this text taints the memories we have of To Kill a Mockingbird, if it neglects to live up to what we expect of these characters, readers and fans of Lee are sure to appreciate this novel at its foundation - a return to a place we cherished.
I was seriously disappointed and would like a refund. I haven't bought any books in a long time and when I found out this book was coming out I thought I had to have it after reading to kill a mockingbird. I regret spending my money on this book and reading it. what a let down.
Reading
just plain silly
good read!
Disappointed!!!
The prose is simple and elegant.  Reading this book is like meditating.  Calming and beautiful.
Great read from beginning to end. Hits a cord for the time in which we are living. I wish read it again and bought hard copy for my daughter.
This novel is a masterpiece. I am currently up to part 5 (on it) and will finish the rest soon. That being said, I only read To Kill A Mockingbird about 2 years ago, and this novel pairs well with what I read 2 years ago. The reason people are complaining is because they have read her first book a million times and can't imagine the characters behaving differently years later. When taken in context however, it's understandable how the characters, at least up to Part 5, are behaving in the way they are. I hope in the future we get a short story or novella of what happened in between the two, as originally planned. Time will tell.<br/><br/>Edit: Finished listening to the whole book and enjoyed it very much. Book is a solid great novel.
Interesting read after reading  To Kill A Mocking Bird first and knowing the history that this book was written first.  Well written.
I'm in the first chapter and ignoring all the blah blah blah from CNN etal on the characters until I read the entire thing. I will say it flows and reads like "Mockingbird" in true Harper Lee style and that makes it exciting to go forward without the pre-release media hype. You know who wrote it at the first paragraph
Interesting reading experience since I have read "Mockingbird" multiple times. Good to meet characters again.
liked the grown up view of the book  wouldn't have worked if jem had lived
Haven't read this yet but hear it is very controversial and a great read.
If you read the previous, then<br/>I just felt to read it. A classic
Absolutely Harper Lee's best work...just wish it had been longer!
I must remind myself this was written before "To Kill."
Go Set A Watchman<br/>By Harper Lee<br/>  When I heard that Harper Lee was going to revise her character Scout from To Kill a Mockingbird I was ecstatic. I can remember reading it in school as a child and was drawn to the characters of the book. In fact it was one of my favorite novels of all time, I know there are many others out there who had similar experiences with this novel. To be Frank, it was special.<br/>  That being said, I must admit I was pretty shocked when I heard some of the initial reviews given for her new book. Some were very negative as readers became upset with the journey Mrs. Lee took her character Scout & Atticus along with several others. I have to admit I was initially disturbed by the negative press; this caused me to delay reading it for several weeks. I even debated if I wanted to see this new world she had created.<br/>  Now I will let you know that there are some spoilers in this review so read on at your own risk. A necessary evil in order to help readers understand why this journey is perhaps just as special in Scouts life as the first one was.<br/>  The reality is, as a writer I wasn’t sure just where she would take our Scout. It seemed as if there was no place else she could go, but I was mistaken. We catch up with Jean Louise Finch (AKA Scout) as a young woman in her twenties who now lives in New York. It is on a return visit that her story unfolds. The slow southern pace of Lee’s writing is soothing to say the least. She bravely touches on some hot issues that plagued the south in the early 60’s concerning racial conflict and bigotry after the Supreme Court in Brown vs. Board of Education decision. It also gets into some of the conflicts with the NAACP.<br/>  Underneath the conflict that initially puts daughter against father, there is so much more going on and that, I think is the true beauty of the story. For most of us there comes a time when we are forced to put aside the rose-colored glasses we see our parents through. Usually one or the other of our parents gets that honor. As children, we tend to put them up on a pedestal, not unlike a god. We are afforded the opportunity to see Scouts world no longer through the eyes of a child but the eyes of a woman coming to terms with the imperfection of her parent.<br/><br/> Atticus Finch isn’t a racist monster as some have claimed, he is not unlike others in that his goal was to do damage control in his hometown during a time that tore the south apart. That she was able to show us this with compassion and grace, I felt didn’t diminish either character but brought them both into a less distant past. I didn’t walk away hating Atticus Finch for being a product of his values, nor could I fault Jean Louise for her dogged conviction. As a parent, I’ve seen that same doggedness in my children when they grasp an idea or view.<br/>At the end of the day is this book worth the read? Yes, most definitely. There are views that for their time in history, I felt were real and relatable. People found themselves in a position with the world changing before them. I had never seen the other side of the coin in regards to the racial integration, and the era of the civil rights. Although I do consider myself a staunch support of human rights I could understand the attempts to make the transition from where they had been to where they needed to go as painless as possible.<br/>Go Set a Watchman touches on some sensitive subjects but if you take the time to listen it is very clear that the layers to this story are as beautiful woven together as her prior book. It may not be the “Politically Correct” moral compass for some but I think for many it truly is a lesson about growth and acceptance, but most of all love. After all, we each do have to Go Set a Watchman in our own lives.
A great story and so beautifully written. This novel could not be better!
I made a mistake in buying this book the minute it became available on Kindle! I blame Harper Lee for this problem. She has crafted a story so flawless that you can't help but to be angry that it took so long for this book to be released. But, you will thank God that it was from the very first page. I was already reading another great book called When God Stopped Keeping Score from Author R.A. Clark and I found myself unable to put that book down. But, then, midnight struck and for the last three hours, I have found myself caught up in Scout's, excuse me, Jean Louise's journey from the little girl that we first met her as in To Kill A Mockingbird to the woman she should be considered as. I just wasn't prepared for the fact that this book is better than the first. My only warning for anybody that will buy this book is to give yourself time to read it and actually savor it.  I found out what had become of the much loved Atticus and Jem and then was given the opportunity to meet Henry! I know now that I should be in bed! I know that I should be asleep but this book haunts me with every page that I turn! What happens to Atticus, even I wasn't ready for. Why Atticus? Why? How Jean Louise even learns his secret is no less than amazing. Who also knew that this book would be released now and everything that is discussed would be so relevant!  I highly recommend this book and if you get a chance to buy When God Stopped Keeping Score from Author R.A. Clark, do it! It will change how you look at God and the power of forgiveness and might help you deal with this book and with Atticus. Great job!
Outstanding! I stayed up all night long reading it! this sequel to the American Classic "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a successful return to Maycomb, AL and into the life of Scout.
This absolute dreck could not  have bee written by Harper Lee .This is a literary scam of the highest order.Probably the literary scam of this century.What hurts more is how much we love "To kill a mockingbird"
I tried a bit of the audio preview, but was so put off by the narrator's fried vocal cords that I will have to actually read it.
Another tome of garbage from this hack author.
Have not read it yet
Question above are silly. Harper Lee does not need this kind of disclaimers. A writer has no such conctract with readers.
Many of the negative reviews of this book have expressed the fans frustration at what has been done to these beloved characters. I'm really angry at the damage that Harper Lee has done to the Harper-verse. Its time for her to move on. She was never a good writer and never really fit to guide the future of this franchise. Go Set A Watchman makes it clear that she doesn't understand the characters, rules or structure of the Harper-verse. She really needs to move on and new talent needs to be brought in to save these characters from the damage she has done.<br/><br/>Really, at this point, their only choice is a reboot. If the Mockingbird family of characters is to have a future as a media property, they need to re-make it for a modern audience. Honestly, reading To Kill a Mockingbird is like watching black & white television. People will only do it if they are forced to. Just as Batman stories from the 1940s or Spiderman stories from the 1960s can provide inspiration for *readable* *modern* media, so too is Mockingbird V1.<br/><br/>This book isn't of interest to anyone except maybe lit geeks at some school. Its just garbage. Harper Lee may have been something back in the day, but today she would be laughed out of any real publisher and her stuff thrown in the circular file cabinet. Its quite obvious that she didn't know how to write at all and that Mockingbird is really the product of a brilliant editor who took the broken pieces Harper Lee brought in the door and constructed the Mockingbird Franchise. Creators need editors. Writers perform the mundane task of assembling the words, but its the vision of the editor that creates the book. Everyone who knows anything about books knows that. Harper Lee brings in her unpublishable trash. The editor guides her into how to turn the trash into something with real $$$ value.<br/><br/>You can see it in what was dropped from the draft. Nobody wants to listen to politics. Politics are boring. What people want is a real courtroom potboiler. Give it a racial context, throw in a backward lawless place like the south and you have a real winner. Scout also talked too much in the rough draft. Her story is too ordinary to be interesting. She is just some women who lived in a town. The audience of Mad Men or Modern Family are never going to care about someone so vanilla.<br/><br/>The racist nonsense in the book also had to go. Just like a confederate flag, the racist stuff is something that nobody wants to see anymore. Its also not believable. Atticus is the hero of the book. He is the only character who matters. Making him a racist villian makes no sense. He is the most important character in the franchise. He is the superman or spider-man of the Harper-verse. If they needed someone to turn bad, Scout or Dill would have been better choices. The kid sidekick going bad is a very acceptable sort of story. It would only strengthen the value of the franchise. It would also open the door to a whole series of books which would explain how they went bad.<br/><br/>Uncle Jack is just stupid. You can see why they nearly wrote him out of Mockingbird. No real person can even understand what he is saying. He is like the Professor character in back to the future. He should be there for comic relief, but he can't carry the story on his own. The dialogue between Jack and Jean Louise might as well have been in Japanese or something.<br/><br/>The plot and story fail because there is no dramatic tension. There is no trial. Nobody's life is at stake. There is no ACTION. Its all alot of yacking about politics and things nobody cares about anymore. We don't need to listen to a racist explain racism. Fans want to see the racist taken down and dealt with. All the political YAK-YAK is boring too. Laws this. Constitution that. Nobody wants that except maybe 90 year old white southerners. The only reason this book even gets any five-star reviews is because of who Harper Lee WAS. Nobody wants to attack a living legend even if its 40 years past time for that legend to ride off into the sunset.<br/><br/>The book doesn't develop important characters like Zeebo and his son. All it does is focus on the selfishness of Jean Louise. Again, nobody cares about her. But Zeebo could expand the franchise into a whole new series of books.<br/><br/>The publisher also gets a zero for this atrocity. The book is cheaply printed with rough pages. It wasn't even edited enough to correct the obvious mistakes in continuity. Its clear that the publisher only released this to make money and didn't spend one dime on fixing the obvious wrong things about it. Pure exploitation. The Harper-verse deserves better than these shoddy in-it-for-the-money sorts of books.<br/><br/>I'm really ashamed that I read this book. I was anticipating a book that could revive the franchise, but instead what I got was something that will probably bury it. I was in tears when I realized how much damage this book could do to the Mockingbird Franchise, its merchandising, its ability to generate revenue and the ill will created with the hardcore fans. These characters are just too important for someone like Harper Lee to ruin.<br/><br/>They need to bring in some big-name writers and reboot the Harper-verse as soon as they possibly can. They should also bring in a visionary creator to do the overall management of the Mockingbird Universe. This horrible book has proved that no single writer can be trusted with something this important. Either a reboot of Mockingbird or perhaps a new book on the childhood of Atticus. Write Watchman one off as a hoax, a dream, an imaginary story or a parallel universe. The future financial profits and long-term viability of the media  property are at stake.
For starters i havent it yet but what i wanted to review was the quality of the book i recived the pages were cut poorly leaving the edges sticking out and the pages having rough ends<br/>Will update atfer i read the book
i don't know. i didn't order these books & have no intention of reading. i can get from library FREE & my taxes support it. i thought  U offered 1 free page read so that what i thought i was getting! kindle is new 2 me & still very much learning experience. i'm too old 2 put up with UR fake offers. i already have 2 my people trying 2 tell me i'm getting something 4 free when all they want 2 do is get into my pocketbook. NO THANX!
Anything Belle writes is perfect!!
Excellent book
I do not believe Ms. Harper wanted this publshed. I think she would have many years ago if that was her wish. She probably would have written many more novels. I will read this when the price drops,with the scathing reviews , should be fairly soon.  I will read this without comparing it to Â«To Kill a Mockinbird Â»  nothing will compare ,and i do believe this will be an alright read.
Just got book on Kindle, started reading today .
Good stuff!
The gullible American public will buy anything that is heavily advertised. People want to be first to own this "important" novel. Face it, TKAM was not that well written, especially not worthy of the Pulitzer prize.
Haven't read this book yet so am unable to give a true rating.  I have heard a lot of negative remarks but I am willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.
