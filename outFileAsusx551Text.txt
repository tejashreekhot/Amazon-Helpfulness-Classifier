Ours is a 3 person, 2 laptop household.<br/>I wanted to purchase an additional laptop for our home school lessons.<br/>Lightweight, speedy, and worth every penny.<br/>I didn't realize before purchasing though, that there is no drive for cds/dvds.<br/>In the future, I won't take searching the product description for this feature.  Oops!
Pros: Great value, This pc has no noticeable lag when performing everyday tasks. It has a large clear display and is fairly lightweight.<br/><br/>Cons: Only 2 USB ports, both on the lower left side. The touchpad is also very large, and easy to hit when typing(although it can be easily toggled off with a fn key) It is also just a little too large, but I am really nitpicking there.<br/><br/>Summary: This cheap, well made laptop, I would recommend it. I would also recommend installing Windows 7 over 8.1, Asus actually provides the Windows 7 drivers on their support page. However, I do wonder if the Acer es1-512 might be slightly better.
As a laptop, the styling is nice, its light weight, it feels sturdy, and the Windows 8.1 OS is fun to use. I love some of the apps, like the Health & Fitness one. Unfortunately this laptop has been a royal pain in the butt in the short (less than a) week I've had it. When it tried to run updates, it got stuck at 100% and wouldn't finish booting up. I eventually had to do a refresh on it, which removes all 3rd party programs and basically starts you over but preserves your files. After that it took overnight to download the updates again but they installed smoothly. Its been laggy and freezing up for no reason since the updates have been installed. The price was right but you get what you pay for I guess. I'm not overly impressed with this laptop's performance at all.<br/><br/>UPDATE: I've had this for a little while now and while successive updates have gone smoothly, I'm still not that impressed. The touch pad for the mouse is awful. I do graphic design work part time and this mouse pad makes that impossible. It either doesn't recognize my touch or it jumps all over. The left and right buttons are actually part of the pad, so if you have moved the cursor where you want it, then tap a button, expect the cursor to move dramatically and probably not do what you wanted at all.<br/><br/>All in all, "okay" for price but invest in a separate mouse if you expect not to be frustrated by normal usage. I'll be updating to Windows 10 in a few days with hopes things just work better. It can't really get worse.
UPDATED- SEE BELOW<br/>The laptop itself is decent. It has a full size keyboard and I didn't have any trouble removing unwanted programs or adding new ones. The speed is decent and it was easy enough to connect to our home wifi network and printer. It feels sturdy, not premium which should be expected for the price. The problem, and the reason I am returning this laptop is that the mandatory Windows updates freeze the computer and don't allow it to restart. I've had to do a computer refresh/reset twice already and I've had this computer less than 2 weeks. At a minimum, it's inconvenient and if I hadn't set up all of my files to back up to my local network, it could have been worse. Maybe I got a bad egg. I'm going to try the same model again and I'll update the review with any changes.<br/>**********UPDATED****<br/> After getting a new model and meticulously installing each update separately as suggested by customer service I thought I was in the clear. After less than a month's use, the touch pad has become extremely finicky and doesn't work beyond the start-up screen, if that. I borrowed a wireless mouse from another computer to copy my files but I'm over this computer. It's possible I just had a streak of bad luck, but I've never had a laptop with this many issues so early on. This time I'll be switching brands and models.
This is literally the fourth time I am ordering this laptop. Ordered the first for myself as a backup for work. It ended up turning into my main. Then ordered one for my mother. Then my girlfriend. Now a friend asked me a basic laptop and I ordered another for him.<br/><br/>If all you do is email, web browsing, and using word and excel. This gets the job done.
This notebook is packed with the performance for every dollar it is priced. Great deal with it's 4GB RAM on ATOM processor. Most of application these days consume more RAM than the processor juice. Great size screen with numeric keyboard. compare to the same products out there at $249, you can't even get a desktop with a screen that benchmark to the specs of this notebooks. Great deal.
There seems to be a lot of problems  with the  touch pad and the  laptop  freezing up and screen flickering
This Asus laptop is perfect for students or as a take along computer. At under $300.00 some reviews posted here expect everything that $750.00+ have. That is way to much to expect for the price. However it accomplishes all the tasks I want from a portable laptop. I have no need for an optical drive. The only negative for this laptop is the touchpad. Not what I am use too. I am more comfortable using a mouse so a wireless works well. Only one each of usb 2.0 and 3.0. I have a portable cooler which has extra usb 2.0 ports so it is not an issue for me. As stated in many other reviews this laptop is designed for affordable portability/student use. If you want a laptop with multi usb's, high quality optical drive, outsanding gaming ability then look to pay for it. After all if you have a home system built for serious gaming and computing power costing thousands...why would you even expect a laptop costing a few hundred to evan come close? My total investment for laptop, cooling pad/stand, wireless mouse, portable back up drive, and carrying case is under $400.00. Should it get lost, stolen, or beat up I'm not out much money. If the touchpad is a prime concern there are plenty more laptops on the market. Do your research and do not buy one because it looks good. Excellent product Asus!
No CD drive as stated.  Touch pad stopped working a week or two after purchase.  No help from customer service when we called them.  They told us to just keep restarting the computer.  Needless to say that doesn't help.
Feels flimsy, touch pad already sits crooked after only limited use. Battery time sucks for sure.  Probably sending it back.<br/><br/>****Decided to send it back tomorrow***** 4/23/2015
Sent this back even before I got a recommendation for another brand.  For me, Windows 8 is a nightmare, a nightmare I could have lived with, however, the unit was slower than expected, the battery life short, the number of ports, fighting with it to have it pickup my in home WIFI all had it back in the box waiting for pickup (thank goodness for Amazon returns).<br/><br/>One reviewer mentioned the impracticality of the AC plug being attached to the  transformer.  Agreed.  On a typical power strip it takes up 3 sockets worth of space.<br/><br/>The 2nd star is simply for benefit of the doubt, as I do not believe my experience matches the dissatisfaction level of the other 1 star reviews, neither did I have the unit long enough to have experienced many of the issues there.<br/><br/>See my review on the Dell (yes, I said Dell)I got after consulting someone I should have consulted in the first place.
I like this computer. It works well. Laptop is cold most of the time. Very quiet. Very light.<br/>This is good laptop for Linux.<br/>But the most important is the sound. It is amazing! It is the best sound I have ever heard from a laptop, from internal speakers, and also from headphones.
Laptop has amazing graphics, starts up instantaneously, and overall just smooth. I couldn't be happier with it seeing it's my fastest laptop yet! Audio is loud too for a laptop!
Bought this machine for what it is, an economy machine I can afford to loose or give away if needed. It has a super bright quality 15 inch display and does a satisfactory job, it has an older traditional 5400 rpm drive and that can make it slower.  No Bluetooth, no DVD and only one of the three USB ports is 3.0. But it has HDMI out and a card reader. It is heavy and the case is cheap plastic. But for the price this is a great starter machine for school or a great gift. The price out weighs all the negatives.
You will need to make a Microsoft account in order to set this laptop up (in case you don't already have one). Once you get past that, it's super easy to set up and register.<br/><br/>I love that it is super light weight even though it looks like it could be heavy. The colors and pixels are so vibrant, I was really impressed. So far I have not had any issues with this laptop. I loaded about 16 GB's of music and it has not slowed it down in any way. I haven't used it for work just ye, that's next!
Impressive machine given that this is a low end computer.  The only quirk I've found is that wireless won't connect when the machine is next to the router (but it works fine from 30 feet away)  It may have to do with the direction the internal antenna is facing.  I work around it with a wired connection.  Note that there is no optical drive and as near as I can tell no bluetoooth.  However, this is an inexpensive machine.  For the price I highly recommend it.
OKAY PEOPLE! Do not listen to computer illiterate people on amazon. I have had this computer for about a month now and have had no problems with it. Yes, occasionally I will hit the hot key and disable the touch pad mouse. OMG all you have to do is activate it again by pressing control F9. But seriously I have overclocked this laptop and just use it for work diagnosing big rigs and checking email. Amazingly fast for the specs for the crappy ram output and hard drive rpms. I would buy another if I run this one over. well worth the few pennies to dollars spent rather than a thousand dollar laptop for the same thing. OOOH and no CD driver FYI but what can't you download offline or just use a usb memory stick and omg transferred files. Too simple these days to get everything without a CD drive no big deal to me. It is flimsy and made of hard plastic so don't think you can rough house this computer like a tough book.<br/><br/>I AM RATING THIS A ONE STAR BC COME ON PEOPLE WHO READS 5 STAR RATINGS. I KNOW I DONT. I WANT TO FIND OUT THE FLAWS IN THIS COMPUTER NO THE PROS.
Computers are one of those items that can come with a lot of bells and whistles, but all that is pretty meaningless if you don't need them. Bells and whistles don't come along with this PC, but if you're looking for a budget model, this one is pretty decent and should meet your basic needs. It is worth noting, though, that it doesn't come with office, so if you're looking for a laptop for writing papers, plan on investing in a word processing program.<br/><br/>Construction-wise, this laptop is very light, which is both to its advantage and disadvantage. It feels pretty flimsy and plastic-y, and I'm not very confident about how well it would hold up if you were to drop it. On the plus side, though, it's not likely to break your arm when you're carrying it around.<br/><br/>The screen is rather nice. The display is pretty crisp and clear, so Windows, websites, etc. all look good on it. The display panel itself is as insubstantial as the rest of the PC, though, so it probably needs some TLC.<br/><br/>The keyboard is okay, but it doesn't have a good, responsive feel to it--no backlit keys and soft clicks here. Again, this has a lot to do with the light construction of it. There are no LEDs to indicate if caps lock and num lock are on, which is kind of annoying. The mousepad is all one piece, so if you need to click on something you depress the bottom left or right portion of the pad. Not having buttons isn't a big deal, and the mousepad works pretty well, but having buttons is nicer. The mousepad can be shut off if you want to connect a regular mouse.<br/><br/>As far as ports go, there is an ethernet port, a VGA port, an HDMI port, one USB 2 port, and one USB 3 port, so you'll want to plan accordingly if you'd like to use the laptop with peripherals.<br/><br/>The hard drive is split into two partitions: 186 GB for the operating system and 256 GB of free space. Windows 8 comes pre-installed, and the nice part is that it isn't too bogged down with random add-ons.<br/><br/>Since it is inexpensive, this might be the perfect laptop for the kids to use. It doesn't have the hardware to run any intense games, but it should do nicely for playing online games, doing research on the internet, and writing papers (once you add a word processing program to it, that is.) For adults, it would do well for things like word processing, some bookkeeping, and Internet usage.
Up date - The software on this computer is from 2013 and lacks a Windows 10 Update App, and I cannot get the Windows 10 upgrade.  I am working to resolve these problems, but I should not have to.  So far I have been able to manually upgrade Windows, but still cannot reserve Windows 10.  This is either because the "store" on this computer is an ASUS store, which does not have the Windows 10 upgrade App (and it will not allow me to change to the Windows Store), or the version of Windows 8.1 that is on this machine is not "official" and hence cannot be upgraded.  Either way, I would not recommend this machine to someone who hates Windows 8 (as I do), as it may not be upgradable to Widows 10.  I notice that now the computer is advertised as upgradeable to Windows 10, but I do not believe that this is the case for the machine that I received  so I can only give it 3*'s at best.  If it were upgradable I would have given it 4*'s for the reasons discussed below.<br/><br/>I found this to be a very good, basic laptop computer.  This is a budget priced machine that I think gives good value for the money, but lacks some of the features found on more expensive machines, which is discussed below.  I recommend this machine for light use.  It would be great to take to class, as it is relatively light for a large screen laptop, and being relatively inexpensive less of a trauma were it lost or stolen than if it cost three times as much.  I rate this machine 5 stars based on the fact that I had no problems with it and thus feel that it gives good value for its price.<br/><br/>Contrary to some of the reviewers that have had problems with their machines, I have so far (after several weeks of use) had no problems.<br/>- Setup was easy, and everything functioned as advertised, however, the machine does not come with any real instructions.  It comes with a small booklet that identifies the components on two small pages and the only real instruction is the admonition that you should charge the battery for 24 hours prior to battery usage.  Most of the booklet is taken up with the same information printed in numerous languages.<br/>- The screen is sharp and clear, with no lost pixels.<br/>- I have had no problems with the touch pad, although I prefer a mouse and have installed a USB wireless mouse, which I use most of the time, but I also use the touch pad when I do not have the space for the mouse.<br/>- I have had no problems with the keyboard and find that it is similar to that on a much more expensive laptop that I also use.<br/>- The wireless connection hooked up to my wireless router with no problems and after inputting my password hooks up automatically on startup.<br/>- The machine is made of plastic, which makes it relatively light.  The plastic appears to be relatively robust.<br/>- The machine ran for about 6 hours on a charge, based on light usage, internet surfing, checking e-mail, etc.<br/>- I had no problem with the speed of the machine, but then again it is only being used for Internet surfing and reading e-mails, so my speed requirements are not very high.<br/><br/>What is not on the machine –<br/>- There is NO optical drive (DVD or CD).  I found this to be a bit annoying as it prevented me from putting my copy of Microsoft Office on the machine, (I still have two legal installs left).  It also means that there is no installation disk or rescue disk.  However, you can buy portable USB DVD drive for about $25, so the fact that a drive does not come on the machine is not a real problem.  In fact, it is somewhat of an advantage as you do not have to carry one around all the time, or pay to have an internal drive, instead of purchasing a less expensive USB drive.  You can also work entirely with the cloud, so that a drive is not even necessary for many users.<br/>- The machine runs Windows 8.1.  This is my first 8.1 machine, and while I am not partial to this system, I did not find it to be completely useless.  See the update note at the beginning of this revies for my problems with trying to upgrade to Windows 10.
I bought this a few months ago, and it's still going strong. A great computer for Skype calls, watching netflix or youtube, and light gaming.
Pros:<br/>+Runs a surprising number of games, though it struggles. (Tested with Skyrim, Guild Wars 2, Life is Strange, BioShock Infinite, and Fallout: New Vegas)<br/>+Decent screen: 1366*768<br/>+HDMI and 15-pin connectors<br/>+Great for dual booting Linux<br/>+1 USB 3.0 port<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>-No discrete graphics card. The integrated GPU is terrible, with no upgradeability<br/>-Only 4GB of shared RAM<br/>-touchpad is terrible. Buy a USB mouse.<br/>-my unit's keyboard is warped.<br/><br/>I recommend this computer for school, work, and light gaming.
I have purchased many Asus products and have never been dissatisfied. The quality is always very good. For the price, I couldn't be happier. Setup was very easy. I was running newly installed applications and browsing the Internet almost immediately after taking it out of the box. The speed and processing power is completely adequate for a notebook PC. Plenty of power to process even Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. I am very happy with my purchase and will continue to buy Asus through Amazon.
I can't say enough about this laptop. I was looking for something simple for writing and connecting to the internet and didn't want to spend too much. I'd already gone the tablet once and wasn't happy with that. I needed an actual computer for my work then I cam across this. I figured if it didn't work for me I could return it or even resell it to someone that would like it but you'll have to pry it from my dead, cold hands.
I've used this laptop for about 3 months. It does most things well. However, it struggles to play HD video on youtube. That's been my biggest issue with it. The videos lag and stutter a lot. The computer can be a little slow at time but it's not much of an issue. Other than that it's a great laptop for most simple uses. It will get the job done for basic internet use.
I bought this laptop six months ago for about $230, and in terms of value this is prob the best deal you can find. The stock hard drive is quick, but for $60 i bought a Ssd and this laptop is blazing fast. The intel dual core processors work at their full potential with the ssd, it runs like an i7 with hard drive. Also the placement of the intake/exhaust fan vents are perfect for using on the bed. In total i spent about $300. Snappy, modern looking, and bang for your duck.
Send very fast price right everything is alright tankyou
Great item,good for surfing the net.
I read all the reviews before ordering this laptop. The negative ones are bs. This was so easy to set up. Turned on immediately. Lightweight. I can watch YouTube, manage my social media. I absolutely love it.
This is well worth the money. I am not a gamer, all I wanted was a laptop to surf the net, do messenger on and access/answer emails. This gets the job done. I also found it is good for watching movies on Amazon Prime and Netflix, with no lagg.
Loved the price!  I just needed something basic to connect to my online classes and this suits me fine.  Only drawback is the absence of a cd rom drive, but i can live without it
In reviewing the ASUS 15.6-Inch Notebook, I found it necessary to keep in mind its price/spec ratio. It has all the basics, plus a comparatively large screen and a reasonable amount of RAM and storage. It also has some extras that are not always found in a laptop in this price range, such as the HDMI port (which enables using a TV as a computer monitor) and an extended keyboard which includes a numeric keypad. Some compromises are evident in that the ASUS is not the fastest computer, but for things such as email, watching videos, etc. it is more than sufficient. I would not necessarily recommend playing processor-intensive games or using apps that require extended computational power, but that is certainly not the intended market for this device. For general home or school use, it will work fine. If you are used to a more expensive laptop, you will recognize that ASUS has cut corners on the physical design to keep the price this low: somewhat flimsy-feeling monitor hinges, a trackpad that requires an almost heroic effort to click (can be set to respond to taps instead, of course). The screen is of decent quality, and the speakers, although rather tinny, are loud enough to get the job done. There is no CD/DVD drive on the model I received.  Considering its all-plastic case, I wouldn't expect many years' use out of the ASUS, but not subjecting it to too much transport would certainly help.
I am typing this review on the very machine I am reviewing.  For a lower priced machine I am very happy with it. I would recommend it for a good everyday machine.
It was a very good product . Nice quality and easy to use . However , only issue I had was the fact that there was no disk player . Overall it was worth it .
I will preface that our family has a lot of ASUS products, this just being the most recent. This computer is not quite what we expected, it functions though it is quite slow, and it lacks the ability to install any upgrades without risking damage to the case. This computer appears to be designed as a use and when it breaks throw the whole thing away type machine. The battery, hard drive, optical drive, and memory are all NOT made accessible. So when any of those components fail the only means to replace them will be to disassemble the entire machine, which is likely to result in at least one broken cable and probably a case the will never fit back together correctly.<br/><br/>So this computer which was originally intended to be a business fallback computer has ended up being the kids youtube player and homework machine. It works, but I wouldn't​ buy another like it.
I got all 4 of my kids one and they love the gaming quality. Is certainly been the best laptop I've ever purchased! Highly recommend!
For the money, not a bad laptop. Not a big Windows 8 fan, but that's not a knock on the laptop. It runs well, is lightweight, and the screen is bright and clear. The keyboard is adequate but the touch pad buttons suck. I've never been a fan of touch pads but the way the buttons work on this one don't allow you to keep your finger rested on it and move the pointer with your other finger. It also is easily confused with right vs left clicks. Easy solution is to get an external mouse. I also cannot get it to recognize my iPhone as a storage device and cannot download pictures from it. The USB 3 port constantly resets the connection when connecting my iPhone as well, it never completes loading the device driver for it. I haven't looked into this any further though. More USB ports would be nice maybe 2 more on the other side. But not a bad unit for the price.
Let's get one thing straight. This thing is cheap. Both in price and in what you get. If your some power gamer who needs the latest tech, this ain't it bub. What this is, for me anyway, is the convenient "guest" computer you stick in the living room for the kids or people who drop by and want to check email. It's there when you need it, but I would not make this my main machine. I would not stake my life on it.<br/><br/>Some comments. First of all, they brag about the sound. The sound sucks. Second, it feels cheap/hollow/breaky. I would not want to drop this thing. Third, no instructions or manuals at all. If you've never used Windows 8, go online and watch some tutorials or you're going to be very very confused.<br/><br/>All that said, for the price, this is a good machine that will let you surf the web, check your email, run some programs, and hopefully last a few years before something fizzles out. Don't take it in the bathtub with you. Don't take it sky diving. It is what it is, but for the price I like it.
Nice upgrade from my previous good-for-nothing Toshiba Satellite C55. It's decently priced, and is pretty much everything the previous laptop should have been. It handles multi-tasking acceptably, has decent speakers, charges pretty quickly (and has a well-designed charger), and stays cool. If it were a little faster and the battery lasted a little longer, it would have gotten 5 stars. It lacks some "creature comforts" - could use another USB port, a better design for the charge port, a touchpad with more defined click buttons, and some indicator lights for Num Lock and Caps Lock. The keyboard is good for typing, but the laptop surfaces will take fingerprints. An interesting feature of this laptop is that it will go to sleep at a greater screen angle than others I've used (screen goes black sooner when you start closing the laptop).
Coming out of the box it was an easy set up. After it did an "updating files" for about 30 minutes it seemed to be lagging quite a bit. I'm not sure if that was because I was using IE (internet explorer) or what but after I downloaded Chrome everything seemed to move along quite nicely. I would have liked for Microsoft Office to have been already installed and ready for me to do a free trial rather than having to download that into the computer but c'est le vie.<br/><br/>All in all I believe the computer will serve it's purpose well as a first computer for a freshman in high school. It's definitely a serious upgrade from his junky lap top he had!! So far so good, Asus!
Fast shipping got laptop for my daughter she loves it, good quality. It's a good laptop for the price.
This product works fine if all you need it for is basic school work. It cannot play Netflix or Youtube without lagging, and that's if it doesn't refuse to play them at all. Don't expect to be able to play any kind of MMO or even basic flash games without feeling like your using dial up. Yes it is a very cheap laptop, and yes I read the specs and the reviews. I fully expected it to be a low end laptop, but from all the other reviews I expected to be able to be somewhat useful. If you want to know if it will met the minimum requirements for games such as Minecraft or LOL then yes, it does. But don't expect them to be playable.
I had high hopes for this product because I had heard good things about it before, but after setting everything up, I was disappointed to discover that the antenna inside this computer is absolutely horrible. I can't walk 10 steps away from the router without losing my internet connection. At first, I thought that maybe it was my internet or router that was the problem, but after asking my 4 other family members (who were all on their personal computers), I realized that it was a problem with only my laptop. I really hope that this problem can be solved but in the meantime, I don't recommend this product.
Purchased this laptop for internet and light computer work for the kitchen. I updated the hard drive to a $60 Samsung solid state drive and this unit boots much faster and performance has also increased greatly. The unit does not have a cd/dvd drive. I did not see the need with most files available to download. USB drive is always an option. WiFi is very good and no signal drops. Screen resolution is super for the money. The upgrade to Windows 10 went with no issues. I did not care for the track pad so a wireless Logitech mouse was added. This is now a very good machine. I highly recommend this machine.
This was a starter laptop for my son. My first impression with the device is its astoundingly cheap materials. The plastic is flimsy and I'm assuming easily broken.<br/><br/>Other reviews said that this laptop could play a number of games, including WOW and Marvel Heroes, it was unable to play either. Slow loading of most windows in explorer and it struggled through many websites.<br/><br/>After having the product for 6 months it has broke. It fails to power on and there is no clear place for battery replacement.<br/><br/>The only thing good about this device was its price point.
I bought this for my folks when there 8 year old desktop finally croaked on them.<br/>It's not too expensive and does everything they need. My mother can do her bills, word documents, pictures, etc., and my step-father can play his online video games and browse Facebook.<br/>It took about an hour for complete setup (including removal of things they didn't need and downloading things they did).<br/>It's not a touchscreen (just f.y.i).<br/>For basic use, this does the trick! My folks are loving it already, especially my mother who hated all the wires that came with the desktop. Ha!
Great laptop for the money, I was thoroughly surprised and ordered a second right away!
I can't say enough about this laptop.  I was looking for something simple for writing and connecting to the internet and didn't want to spend too much. I'd already gone the tablet route and wasn't happy with that, I needed an actual computer for my work. then I came across this - and right at my birthday. I figured if it didn't work for me I could return it or even resell it to someone that would like it, but you'll have to pry it from my dead, cold hands.  It's perfect. I have plenty of storage for my writing, and after installing MS Office, there's nothing it can't do.
extreamly slow...a lot of hesitations not near as snappy as my older computer ...
I have had this laptop for about 2 weeks now and I can say that you get what you pay for. This laptop gets the job done for its price. This laptop is in no way good for gaming, it lags. Also a back lit keyboard would come in handy while late night web browsing. I dislike the touch pad, but maybe that's just me. I prefer a mouse and have bought one for this laptop. All in all, this laptop is good for what it was made for; LIGHT usage, school work, and web browsing. Oh yea, and the camera is horribly blurry and low definition.
I have a month with the laptop and I love it everyday. I was a little bit scared about if the trackpad stop working because many people said that but till today I haven't had that problem.<br/>It's a shame don't have a optical driver and just one usb 2.0 port. But it has a perfect price and in general fits good with my lifestyle like medicine student.<br/>Just a objection: the display has a extremely small dot like an imperfection in the led lights. I don't know what it is but it appeared since the first time I turned on.
I have an older Asus, same size but different, which I am preferring over this.  Fixed the older laptop running Windows 7 and thinking of returning this one.  The keys are noisier and doesn't feel as solid or smooth as my first.  The whole unit feels hollow, however, on the flip side - I do like the weight of this since it has no disk drive and feels much lighter.  I like Windows 8 fine, but cannot wait to upgrade to 10, hoping it will be friendlier.  Overall, this laptop is physically not as solid as I would prefer.
Excellent portable starting the operating system is very easy to configure, has Windows 8.1 with Bing, the storage capacity is 500 GB HD and 4GB of RAM as it says in the description, it comes with all components preinstalled, the keyboard is very comfortable the system can be optimized for better performance, has a camera, comes with charger and instructions, WiFi connectivity and many more, this laptop is made for office work and surfing the web, you can install some computer games, but this is not for games !
I am very happy with this purchase. I was buying a similar laptop from Rent-a-Center for $1100 but when I saw this on Amazon for $258 I took the one I was making payments on back to Rent-a-Center and bought this one instead. I love this laptop. It is fast and it doesn't take long to set up at all. It doesn't have an optical drive but if I need one in the future I know I can buy one on Amazon for $20. I highly recommend this laptop.
It is perfect for the price point and intended usage: school and web browsing. Only downside is in trying to update system drivers as ASUS has apparently decided you can only go through them for drivers.  This wouldn't be too much of an issue if ASUS actually made some effort in keeping drivers up to date.  Having graphics drivers and system bus drivers 8 revisions and a year old does not make for a secure computing environment.
Got it for my wife. She loves it. She's quite. I'm happy.
This is a great laptop. But keep in mind it is focused in school and office work, although it has a very decent hardware configuration. It boots in four seconds and has a fairly fast responde to commands and softwares. It can play lighter games, such as Hearthstone and League of Legends, for example, great to kill time when possible. And the price was a HUGE plus
05/13/2015: The computer arrived yesterday and today is seeing problem with the mouse pad not being 100% reponsive and the batter life is not lasting as much as said in the information (on full charge it last about 1h30mins-2hrs on power saver). Its not having anymore problems apart from that it runs all the programs smoothly no lag between transitions.
This pc is very mediocre.  It is one of those throwaway pcs.  It was $263 with tax and for 80 dollars more I was able to get a quad core and add an ssd drive and 4 more gb of RAM.  It made a world of difference. If you are a college student looking for something decently quick,  dependable,  and good at multitasking,  move along to a different pc.
my laptop has stopped working after one month and 20 days of purchasing it. It seems to be out of the return policy at about 20 days behind. There seems to be nothing i can do to return my product and this to me is unfair. Its hard to pay for a product and you can't seem to get it to work after such a short life span. Anyone has any ideas????
For the price, you can't beat this laptop. Big, fast, and easy to use. While it doesnt have all the features of the $500 + laptops, it runs just as fast and ships without all the junk and added software that comes witht them.<br/><br/>While it doesnt have a webcam, it does have a mic, which in todays age is way more useful.
Exactly what we expected which was an extra system around the house - fast enough, not too much bloatware to remove, solid construction. Loses one star for the keyboard by my wife likes it so it's really a choice thing. Received it quickly and it was packed securely.<br/><br/>Would recommend it.
I love my new computer. It is honestly rthe best and not too expensive. It is the perfect computer, but the only downfall is the weight. This laptop is a bit heavy, but the only bad thing was that. Must be able to navigate on windows 8, but overall its a great computer, I truly recommend it!'
This is a great laptop for the price. I bought it for a combination of gaming, business work, It does all of that very well. Plays games on very good settings too. A friend of mine has a desktop computer he paid $800 for and this laptop runs games on better settings than his computer.
The Asus X551MAis clearly an entry-level or rather a beginner’s laptop that offers minimal specifications on the board. If you’re looking for a laptop for basic home usage, this this might suffice. Do be clear that the machine won’t be able to handle multi-tasking situations.
Pros: Light, well built, runs very, very cool. Upgraded to Windows 10 with zero issues. Works well for light gaming and school/work.<br/><br/>Cons: not as sturdy as my older ASUS UL50VT, one of the keys sticks, no dedicated graphics, but at this price, you aren't going to find that on any laptop.
Its begining to get on my nerves, the windows 10 update sucks,it started updating and whe it was finished it came out "we couldn't complete the updates, undoing changes, dont turn off your computer" and its been like that since 4 hours! What should i do return it?
Love the convenience of having a computer this size - also love the keyboard. It's a little trickier not having a numeral keyboard, but no huge deal. However, you can navigate anywhere on the Internet that you wish to roam! For the price, this is a BEST DEAL BUY!! :o)
I researched different laptops and this one does everything I need it to.<br/>It is very light weight, fast, has a good screen size and runs a long time on the battery alone.<br/>I mainly use it to check my emails and play some games and it works great.
Upfront, align your expectations, this is a budget system, not some uber-gamer system. It is assembled from basic components to provide a functional product at a low cost. Keeping that in mind let's take a look at the specifics:<br/>- Weight: surprisingly light, given the 15.6" screen, I at first thought they might have left the battery out of the system<br/>- Size: 15.6" screen again, but in wide screen format, ~10"x15" case, seems a little on the bulky side if you plan on carrying it around to classes, should fit into most normal sized knapsacks though<br/>- Display: 1366*768 pixels in wide screen, not 1080p but acceptable and delivers a good image<br/>- Processor: 2.16 GHz Celeron N2840 (dual core), remember basic system, you won't be doing heavy duty graphics rendering or speedy compiles on this system, but to stream some videos or music, play some basic games, or word process, the chip is capable, just don't expect anything miraculous (it can run games like World of Tanks, in minimum resolution reasonably well)<br/>- Network: I was a bit disappointed that the system would only connect at 2.4GHz, but remember, basic system, this will limit your streaming or online gaming, though it seems to work fine here in my house with top of the line multi-channel routers<br/>- Memory: 4 Gb, basic for Windows<br/>- Storage: 500 Gb @ 5400 rpm, basic again, expect to use either cloud storage add a passport drive<br/>- Connections: the usual network and VGA ports, 1 USB-2 and 1 USB-3 port (expect to need a USB portal or splitter, I use one port for the mouse - sure the case comes with a finger pad but you can't get real work done with one of those, and if you want to plug in a set of USB speakers you are done) I was surprised to see an HDMI port for connecting to a larger screen or TV (nice)<br/>- Software: preloaded with Windows 8 (yes, the abomination, the horror, and no touch screen, <soapbox> seriously, IMO, Windows 8 is a barrier to getting anything useful done, especially without a touch screen </soapbox>), and the plethora of trials and advertised crap (I spent my first couple of hours with the system going through the configuration of Windows that requires you to setup or provide an email account, and removing all of the preloaded trials, then installing Open Source protection software and the Chrome browser among other favored software)<br/><br/>So those are the basics and my impression. Overall, the system is usable, though it seems 'cheap' to me, especially the keyboard (it just sounds and feels flimsy. Also, given the limited amount of 'guts' inside the box, you would have though ASUS could have used a thinner case. So, usable, functional, a great selection for that teen that might need to take it to class or for anyone on a tight budget that has a need or desire for a computer. P-)
My cousin and I ordered this laptop on the same day. His broke a week later (completely stopped working, would not turn on) and my trackpad stops working within 10-15 minutes within turning it on. I would not recommend this product.
So far performance is good not great but good, everything about it the keyboard is intact doesn't feel sloppy or loose. This is a great laptop for those who are looking for a good school or day to day laptop. Which is what I do.
It worths the prize. I love it.
The quality is poor the pad does not feel synergize well and the keypad is too spaced out and the second day a key popped off<br/><br/>Good note is it looks good, screen is clear and colors look good, lite weight
This laptop is great value for someone who needs one for basic needs.....e-mails, social networks, music, photos etc. I was disappointed that it didn't have a CD/DVD tray......I didn't notice that in the specs.
For the price, you get a laptop that will get you connected to the internet.  It comes with Windows 8, which basically makes it the worst computer out there to deal with.  If you buy this, immediately upgrade to Windows 10.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Not expensive, good sized HD, big screen, does basic comp work.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>To work, you must set up a microsoft account for basic functions.  Don't expect Word on here...only a trial of the cloud based OFFICE, which once again, you have to make a microsoft account for.  Want to search online? Too bad, the Explorer web browser is horrible.  Get anything else downloaded asap.  Next is the keyboard.  If you type well, or quickly, you will find yourself yelling at this laptop. It cannot keep up with your typing speed, and many times, the key does not register the letter you are typing.  You will find yourself having to backspace a ton.  Lastly, it's so slow.  I can't figure out how a brand new computer can already be as slow as a computer that is bogged down with years of saved crap.  Opening up programs (which are already on the computer new) or files from a flash drive (since you DONT GET a cd drive) takes a crazy long time.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if you are on a budget, or if you need a burner laptop for general use, I guess you can get this.  But if you need a laptop for actual work, or school, I would NOT buy this.  I almost feel like this is something you would find at Toys R Us.
Works great but no DVD or CD
Bought to take online tests with for my summer college classes. Works well for that, but runs slowly most of the time. Just fine for light work, but I wouldn't recommend for anything major.
Just out of box, really nice and fast running for Windows, not much junk to uninstall either. Great price for simple machine to email, surf web, and manage photos. Will see how it lasts.
No ports on the right side
Its a great starter computer for my 10 year old. He needed for school activities so its perfect to look up stuff for that. The price was perfect for a starter! Gets what he needs done!
This is a fairly slim and light 15.6 inch entry level laptop with specs and features that are more than sufficient for daily computing needs. It’s a computer to consider if you’re on a budget and want the most for the limited amount of money you’ll spend. It comes with a 1 year limited parts and labor warranty by Asus, which is one of the top computer manufacturers that is well known for quality products- Asus is definitely a good brand! Sure this model has its flaws being such a low-cost machine but you really need to spend at least 2-300 dollars more to just move up to the next level PCs. For how much you pay, it’s a good buy overall. There’s no need for an optical drive, the 500GB HDD with a speed of 5400RPM that offers enough space for storing all files, downloads, music, videos and software. You have the 2014 model Celeron processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD, a comfy keyboard with 10-key numpad, longer than normal battery life, a USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port and all the other basic but useful connectivity options. There’re complaints about it not having Bluetooth, but Bluetooth USB dongle costs about 2 dollars or less so I don’t think it’s a problem.
For the use that I give to the computer is a very good one and at a very good price. Email, Internet, Facebook, Word, Excel. I do not play or watch movies on the laptop.
Ok laptop.if you want cheap this it it but cheap it is. A little slow when you perform the Windows 10 upgrade for free. Ok for surfing the web and writing documents.
Yes I really enjoy my new laptop! My friend highly recommended it and what a good choice!! I switched to Windows 10 and find it much more user friendly! Thank you!!!
Too much bloatware.  Otherwise a great laptop.  I formatted and reinstalled Windows because I couldn't remove all that crap.  It's a great deal for a second PC.
It took me a while to decided on a lap top but for the price this is worth it. Now its not super amazing speed wise, its fairly average I'd say. When I got the package it literally came with 2 manuals and the cord. No CD on start up and all that extra crap. The keyboards are fairly smooth and they are spaced out enough where its easy to type. They aren't mashed together like some laptops. Also to I paid $285 for this because of all the tax, just thought I'd mention the actual price. The battery last for about 4 hours.<br/><br/>THIS DOES NOT HAVE A CD ROM. The picture lied to you. This laptop has 1 sound speaker, 2 USB ports and 1 HDMI port. That's it. This laptop is extremely simple, which I like a lot.<br/><br/>*ANOTHER IMPORTANT DETAIL: IF you're planning to install a whole bunch of advance programs like After Affects or Photoshop or Illustrator only install like 2 or them. The computer doesn't have THAT much space for big programs. I have MangaStudio 5 and it runs fines. It also takes drawing wacom or Intuos tablets as well.<br/><br/>So far, so good. Really enjoying this lappy.
I went into this knowing that a $200 laptop was not going to be as good as a $600+ laptop, so keep in mind I had no high expectations.<br/>This is also my first new laptop since 2011, so you can imagine anything would be an improvement.<br/><br/>But honestly I am loving it so far!<br/>It runs fast and smooth, and has no issues maintaining strong internet connection. It's incredibly light, and very sturdy.<br/><br/>It runs guild wars 2, minecraft, and various steam games like a breeze. I easily get 30+ fps when playing, and that is with skype and a browser open at the same time.<br/>Sound quality is decent, about what you expect from a laptop. I thought I would dislike the left and right mouse buttons built into the touchpad but I was used to that within the first five minutes.<br/><br/>This is honestly an excellent laptop for the money, take it from a broke twenty something year old. ASUS never fails to be quality.<br/>If I run into any issues I will update this review.
It showed up and when you move it there are things that shake in it the Wifi goes in and out of it There are just many issues with this computer.
good quality product, shipped in a timely manner and packaged well-hubby loves having his own laptop - our 2nd asus so we dont have to share
needs more memory
Celeron is just too much slower than the i3 and not worth the saving.<br/>Gave 2 stars for the nostalgic effect it had on me. :)<br/><br/>Boot time and basic internet browsing is super slow. Feels like a product from past.<br/>I thought this being the next gen celeron this would be better performance than the old 2000 era celeron - But I was wrong.<br/><br/>Build quality of this product is also poor.<br/>The keyboard feels cheap and the click on the touchpad was broken in my case.<br/>Returned this for refund.<br/><br/>Put 100 dollars more and get a basic laptop with i3 processor.
A great product and the price was good too! Perfect for the job I bought it for!
Cheap, toy-like construction makes it hard to love this otherwise OK machine.
Moderately priced and compact.  Had additional programs and memory added on.
Received a defective laptop as soon as i opened it. Returned it right away.
I really only use the computer for internet browsing, Office programs, and fairly basic software- no gaming and no video streaming.  For my uses it is very good, as fast as I could possibly need it to be, and definitely a good value.  The battery life is about 6 hours, which is much better than my old laptop (about 3.5 hours).  Only cons (and I knew this when I purchased the laptop) are the lack of optical drive and the fact that the battery is internal, so I will probably decide to pay someone to replace it if it ever becomes an issue.
Wotked fpr twp weeks thn started flickering/blinking.flipping.
They are cheaply made though as described in every other way. They have a full keyboard so they are a bit wide though I can't complain about the weight. Good for the basics though, which is all I needed for the introductory classes I teach at a non-profit that couldn't afford better.  No problems so far but it's only been a month.<br/>The 3 star rating is because of all the Asus crap that comes on it, the cheap plastic body(and the lack of USB Ports . But because the specs said there only two, I can't penalize for that).
I purchased this item in August as I had an immediate need for a laptop. I since gave it to my son to use for his schoolwork at home. All seemed fine until one day it just stopped working. It won't power on, nothing. I have tried to figure out how to access ASUS support by going to their website but that seems impossible. I guess I bought a crappy notebook. It was too good to be true but I expected it would last at least a year or two and not just four months. Based on my experience this item is not worth it.
Should have read the details a little closer. IT is mostly a shell of a machine, but I bought it for a single purpose, and it is filling that role nicely.  Have to admit, I am old school. Not so fond of the Windows 8.+ interface, but mostly that is because I am unfamiliar with it. Perhaps in time I will like it more, once I learn it. Also for us older users, I have to admit, I am not into the App world, and cloud existence.  Prefer to own my software, and still like the feel of a real book and magazine. LOL
Excellent laptop, very good performance, lightweight, I really like.
Its light wieght so when going on trips it will be the one I take.
Compared to other laptops in this category, this one is actually pretty nice. If you're using it to use Facebook or watch movies then this is the laptop for you. However, the speakers are not very good but I didn't expect them to be great in the first place. I also didn't expect them to be this bad. It's something I can live with though as this laptop is just one I use to take back and forth to school.. Overall I'm very pleased with this laptop and would recommend it to others.
love the computer, but had a horrible time trying to register it
If you want to multi task and do more than one thing at a time you can forget about this one. Another thing that bothered me with this unit is that it does not come with a standard size ten key pad. It's smaller than the standard size. The spacing in between them is way off. The speakers are surprisingly good. The onboard mouse pad isn't bad either as it functions a lot like a smart phones' screen. You can zoom, scroll, etc by pitching,  swiping.
I'm writing this review AFTER this machine went belly up.  I purchased it not quite a year ago, and I came home 2 days ago to find it had flat lined.  It won't even attempt to power on.  I checked out several things, but nothing seems to revive this system.  I guess for the money I shouldn't expect much... but I don't think it unreasonable to expect it to last a year.
I purchased this laptop not quite a month ago - it was delivered on 30 June. I got home yesterday, turned it on and two hours later it just froze. The cursor moved but I couldn't access anything. Now it won't even turn on. I can't afford to buy one of these every month. By the way, this is the second Asus laptop I've bought this year. I'm a bit slow but I do eventually catch on. I will never buy another Asus product for as long as I live.
Computer seems to work fine, but Windows 8.1 useless for my purposes. Usually I can slide out of 8.1 to the more conventional windows format beneath it, but this doesn't always work easily. I have to learn how to successfully exit Windows 8.1. Also, Amazon specifications say computer has CD/DVD reader/recorder; which it does not. Internal speakers are awful.<br/><br/>But in all a powerful machine for the price. Display is very nice.
Great for the price. Feels cheaply made and the mouse pad is really bad, but it does everything as advertised just fine. Added a USB mouse and so far it's been solid for online classes. Just FYI, when I bought this laptop it came without office or office 365 (but that was clearly stated in the description). If you need a budget machine and are not running demanding software this fits the bill.  I paid under $250 shipped.
It was very cheap feeling and looking. I realize it was incredibly inexpensive but I would worry about this laptop breaking quickly. It also did not seem to load very fast at anything. I ended up shelling out the extra cash for a better laptop, but even if you are only able to spend this much, I would seriously consider not getting this laptop.
I purchased this item a year ago, and it was great. I purchased 2 more, thinking they would be fine as well. Wrong!  Both of them did not come with a CD - ROM drive and both internal hard drives crashed for no reason. I would spend the money for the better computers in the future.
I'm using this computer since May and it works perfectly, the update to Win10 was completed without problem and I dont have anything wrong to say, except that the CD/DVD unit is not included, however, I knew this fact before purchased and for the price still having a nice performance.<br/>Recommended to whoever that dont want to spend a lot money and have a very good product considering its limits.<br/>I use it everyday.
Work Excellent for the application I am using them for.
You get what you pay for.  This laptop feels cheap, frame is slightly peeling from around the lcd.<br/>It runs ok for basic web browsing, running netflix etc, but it is all the little things that get to be annoying, like no numlock light.<br/>No one has mentioned it yet, but the webcam is horrible.<br/>I assumed at $250 it would be cheaply built, but I think even that is overpriced, I will be returning this.<br/><br/>EDIT: On top of this.  After i returned this, I did not get a refund on my credit card (which Amazon has since charged from)  and was told I had to wait TEN DAYS to be able to talk to billing.  Once I talked to billing, they told me I could either have a gift card or they would mail a check, which would take 2 TO 4 WEEKS! While they could still charge my card, apparently they won't try and refund on it.  Ridiculous, but a great time to cancel my prime membership!!  Bette shows on Hulu anyways.
The ASUS computer works well, although a more tactile feel for the touchpad Left & Right keys would help.  Windows 8.1 is a joke perpetrated by computer geeks at Microsoft upon the computer buyng public.  It's not an IPAD, or an android phone, but that what it simulates.  AS a retired programmer, Systems Analyst, and corporate Product Development Manager, I can only say "Microsoft, What were you thinking?!
I am not sure if I like it or hate it. It crashed twice already when setting up, regular internet browsing froze up the chrome several times. It looks nice, feels great and shows its potential yet it threw up surprises. I have never had any problems with any cheap to mid-range tech stuff off amazon. I think this might be the first. Mixed reviews so I'm guessing its a hit or miss product. Purchase with caution.
Purchased this for my nephew in high school as his first laptop.  Very affordable and easy to use.  Great large screen.  This is our 2nd ASUS for budget friendly teens.  He is very happy with it.  MY son also has an older model of this and is YouTube hooked.  It is the one thing that is always on working at playing videos!  Very lightweight and does not heat up.  Will definitely purchase ASUS in the future
Every time I turn the computer on, I have to reset my modem so that it will get wifi. None of my other devices have this problem. It freezes constantly. Even with the latest version of Adobe, there are things that it just won't show me, but my 3 year old laptop has no problem showing them. I will never purchase another Asus product.
The one thing that I wish I'd have known ahead of time: the battery must be replaced by professionals. It's buried inside and requires detaching several googaws in order to remove it, and purchasing replacements isn't straightforward. If that concern of mine isn't a concern of yours, then you'll enjoy the Asus as is.
It's slow but works for me.  Surfing internet and using Microsoft Word/Excel as what it's used for.  Some games run slow.  Great for the price.<br/>I will say my hubby tried to write an email and he would type things out and wait a little bit for the words to show.  He was annoyed! Oh and setup took forever.  It had a million updates.  Took like 2 days to actually use it.  Good luck 😃
Very good for the price. I want to buy another one
Great laptop for the price. I have always relied on Asus as my go to laptops because they have always been reliable for me. I bought my first one the beginning of college and it has lasted 5 years so far. My family has been so impressed with it, they have also converted to Asus laptops. I bought this one for my father who wanted an affordable laptop with a large screen.
Slow to respond.  Takes forever for pages to come up and I have high speed internet. The other computers in my home are all much faster. I guess I can't compare this with my last computer which was a Sony VAIO. I am going to end up getting another laptop so I consider this as having wasted money.
very satisfied. ordering  and shipping went well
I give 0 stars if ihad the box id send it back it is slow not able to watch viseos even with high speed internet. Not compatable with many games as it claimed. And the battery ia not strong.if there is a way i can return or exchange it please that would be a blessing. Windows 10 doesn't install like it says its 8.1 and need to b touch screen in order to do 10.
4 excellent weeks with my new laptop, Now since Wednesday the laptop does not turn on. It does nothing, is dead. It was upgraded to Windows 10 without any problems. I was so happy but now does nothing. I loved my asus laptop, now I don't know what to do?  😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I finally upgraded from my black Friday emachine I bought many years ago. This is really taking some time to get used to and I'm not sure if I ever will. I don't like the whole look of this or the app concept thingy on it. It's hard trying to find out where everything is. It may be great for lots of other people but I would rather have my windows 7 emachine.
Decent enough for everyday home use and can run some basic software development tools etc .But all in all no match for my DELL Latitude E-6510.<br/>My wife got this as a gift and it serves her well .<br/>Pros :<br/>Has VGA  and HDMI  ports for external displays , with Intel integrated graphics.<br/>Has an USB 3.0 PORT (1) and USB 2.0 (1), + RJ 45 ethernet port + Onboard Wi-Fi<br/>I can enable DLNA to my SAMSUNG smart TV to play media from this laptop over the wireless LAN streaming<br/>Has audio jack ( line in line out combo) and SD Card slot ( front left side) and barely visible Webcam<br/>Has a DVD+/- RW,CD+/-RW drive<br/>Easy to carry around, no overheating, rugged exterior build.<br/>Good Hard Drive capacity, the unit i got had a decent 440 GB, enabling me to run a dual boot machine with Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04<br/><br/>Cons :<br/>Difficult on-board 'mouse' buttons and track-pad - slow or unresponsive and not easy to use, have to click at the extreme edges for them to click<br/>Low resolution screen(1366x768) for a 15.6" display, even at 8pt Segoe UI light, fonts appear too large, I wish it could have offered full HD option (1920 *1080 or at least 1680*1050)<br/>No CAPS LOCK,SCROLL LOCK, NUM LOCK LED indicator lights! This is a BIG Drawback for obvious reasons.<br/>No Bluetooth! - again this is 2015, even my geriatric 2004 DELL Latitude D-800 offered onboard bluetooth as an 'option' :( !<br/>No Keyboard LED back-lighting for nocturnal use ( Again, this makes it pretty primitive )<br/>Tiny LED indicators for disk activity and power on front left are barely visible<br/>a large laptop this size should offer some more USB Ports, and all USB ports are on the left side, none on the right or rear.<br/>The rear side of the laptop could be redesigned to support the display ports and additional USB ports, but the rear display hinge occupies all space<br/>Also see slower boot up and internet download time in Windows, but not with Ubuntu , so maybe this is just a Microsoft 'exclusive' :) and not an intrinsic laptop problem.<br/>No Docking capability, although an external USB 3.0 dock can be put to use with the single USB 3 port.
I have owned two other Asus laptop computers in the past and was pleased with their longevity and performance, but this Asus laptop was a complete disappointment! On the positive side, the laptop was easy to set up with a Microsoft account and it walks you through the process step by step, which is great considering you don't receive any instruction manuals with this. I liked that it had McAfee antivirus software preinstalled. The built in camera worked great with clear images and I was happy with the sound quality of the internal speakers because the sound was crisp and clear.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 2 stars for several reasons despite some of the features that I did like. Granted that the laptop is only $250 in value, so you can't expect top of the line quality, but I certainly expected better quality than what the reality was. The main reason that I'm giving this laptop such a low rating is that the hard drive, after 2 weeks of periodic use, completely crashed and died! When I turned it on, it wouldn't let me get past the BIOS menu (basic input output system), kept locking up, and wouldn't recognize or detect the hard drive, so I couldn't do anything on it. I removed the hard drive and attached it to a sata converter with a USB cable and tested it on my other laptop and it wouldn't start up or recognize its hard drive even on that computer, meaning it was dead and not fixable. Completely useless..<br/><br/>Additionally, the 500GB hard drive is small in size so you can't install too many programs and games and also can't store many photos because the hard drive gets used up extremely fast. You also will not even receive trial versions of software - this is so basic that it has nothing but the operating system and the antivirus software. Another issue I had was that it ran incredibly SLOW and I barely had any programs installed on it with plenty of hard drive space left. Even when I would type a document, it couldn't catch up to my typing speed and it would take at least 30 seconds or more for the words I had just typed to appear on the screen, which is quite frustrating when you are trying to get work done. After a week of use, the track pad completely stopped working! Granted that I was able to use a separate mouse, but that just speaks to the shoddy craftsmanship of this laptop.<br/><br/>Steer clear of this cheap quality laptop and invest in one that has a bigger hard drive and is of higher quality because this is pure junk!
Sept 4, 2015: I absolutely HATE this computer. This has been the biggest waste of money. The first computer would not load correctly and was extremely slow so I sent it back for a return. The new computer is just as slow. Its so incredibly slow I would rather carve my research papers in stone then have to deal with this computer. Of course it's too late to return it and there is no support for it. Now it won't even load past the BIOS utility screen. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER. I can't even express to you how much I hate it.<br/><br/>May 7, 2015 (3 days later): Amazon has sent me a replacement and I've been using it for about 3 days now. I don't know if the first one was just a bust but I gotta say this one is MUCH smoother. It's still on the slow slide, but nothing like the glitchyness of the first one. Programs run smoother, websites load faster, documents open easier. I've upped it to 3 stars for now and will update again in a few months (or sooner if I have more problems).<br/><br/>I HATE this computer. If Amazon had a decent return policy I would return it in a heartbeat. Stupid thing is soooooo slow. Issue I'm having now is Windows is trying to update but it's just stuck on the update screen. Can't even use the computer now! If you think you want to buy this computer save yourself the headache and just flush $249 down the toilet instead. I'm seriously surprised at the lack of quality from Asus. I should have listened to the other reviews. This computer can't even serve as a basic, browsing the Internet, reading email, computer. And forget anything that moves. Gifs? Absolutely not. Unless you have 10 minutes for it to load. YouTube videos? You're kidding right? Ads that move on the page? Prepare to not be able to use that page. If you are not getting on the Internet with this thing then it might be OK but otherwise BUYERS BEWARE!
Just after receiving this product for 3 months, the motherboard went and this laptop won't function anymore. I live in Jamaica so I just absorbed the cost and buy a Mac instead. I was going to recommend my brother to buy one bu after this experience, I don't think so. P.S. only getting one star because I can't rate it at 0 !
Bought it new on 15/07/15 (despised win8), all is fine except when I plug headphones in - audio continues to play from speakers (other Asus reviews online seem to have the same problem), I am supposed to have a free win10 update in a week so, will wait hoping that will solve the problem as it is most likely the driver.
I've had this laptop for not quite 2 years. If you enjoy having to restart your computer numerous times a day because it crashes, this is the laptop for you. If you prefer a stable functional computer I'd look elsewhere. First and last Asus computer.
This machine sucks.  It has a lag to it, any time I try to navigate, or type, or do ANYTHING.  The lag also affects anything I try to type while online. The Window's OS is a NIGHTMARE.  It is a cheap, useless computer, and an absolute waste of money.
the laptop itself is alright but its kind of annoying that it doesn't have a disk drive. I bought it based on the size and based on the picture showing what looks to be a disk drive. Overall it's an average computer definitely wouldn't buy it again
I  purchased this and am loving it i love how windows 10 ready out of box i would like to clarify that in specs it says dbd tray but mine did not have one i did some reasearch and found i can purchase it separately and plan on doing do i used for a 12 hours stretch and little to no heat out put under heavy usage
it does not work at all, I have return it
I got this computer for my elementary-school-aged daughter who does things like visit reading game websites and plays Minecraft. This computer does both of those things acceptably well, and at a bargain price!<br/><br/>We installed Minecraft on the machine as a test, and it's playable, but it starts to feel a bit choppy when turning quickly or entering a heavily forested area. This isn't a surprise really, as this is positioned as an inexpensive laptop, rather than a powerhouse and uses integrated graphics versus a separate GPU. You'll also notice the lack of performance in the boot times which take several minutes, but the wait time is nothing too excruciating.<br/><br/>Performance drawbacks notwithstanding, what this computer includes for the price is actually fairly impressive; you get a decent-sized screen, built-in web cam, HDMI out, USB 3.0, 500 GB hard drive, 801.11n wireless and a multi-touch trackpad! The speakers were also nice and sufficiently loud, but ASUS' marketing oversells the "SonicMaster" feature as something more extraordinary-sounding than it is.<br/><br/>I've paid this much money for a smaller, less functional netbook, so I was completely satisfied with what ASUS offered in this laptop.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a computer that can handle office apps, web browsing, (very) light gaming and one that comes with a good array of features at a price that won't deplete your kids' college fund, then look no further.
I like how it's really light so I don't have to feel like I'm carrying an infant with me during school, and I like most everything else about it, but almost all of the very top row of keys don't work, and it makes me upset. I'd like to be able to do simple actions without having to make it complex.
Computer froze up and died literally minutes after I removed from packaging...I like Asus for some things but the plastic felt incredibly flimsy and almost looked like it was 3D printed. I thought the outer plastic would break...but the actual computer stopped working way before the plastic did!
Hard drive failed after having the laptop less than four months.  Current a claim in with ASUS we will see how they respond.  This is a no frills laptop but I expect it to actually last more than 4 months.  We will see how ASUS customer service responds to this, but I am not impressed so far.
Absolutely Horrible, I'm not sure whether Its Windows 8 that I don't like, or the actual computer.  Hard to say right now.  For the price I guess its a usable laptop, depends on your needs.  I don't like the touch pad very much.
Excellent for the Price.  Good to Have
I should have paid better attention to the reviews.  This computer is simple and full of all kinds of software that tries to get you to sign up for a trial.  And they don't want to go away.  Pop ups are constant on the Explorer.  Monzilla and Chrome are no better.  I wish I could return it.
Received my computer, started it up, and as I was using it realized it was definitely infected with Malware. If you don't know what this is, it is a hacker trying to get my information. RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!!!! Be careful buying these computers, check for malware when you receive it!!!!
USB ports aren't working, no DVD drive, could of done better if I would of shopped around. Found better laptops for the same price or just a few dollars more, disappointed with this machine. This is the first bad review I've ever wrote 99.99% I'm satisfied with shopping on amazon.
This computer just completely died on me while I was in class. It will not revive. I bought this computer less than one month ago. Not extremely happy as I have just lost all of my assignments I have done for class.  I have only used it for about two weeks since class started.
Very good laptop, super fast power on, light weight and quiet fan that's efficient.This unit dose not heats up like other laptop.<br/>Overall, its just as the description says.<br/>And with the windows 10 update, its even more fun and simple for anyone who likes windows 7.
Was sceptical at the beginning, I've always been an hp user however I needed something inexpensive that would help me complete my school work. I've had it for a couple of months and no complaints was so ever. Affordable for a single working mom in college. Highly recommend!
I am sorry to say this is by far the worst laptop I have ever purchased. I have bought used ones off Ebay that were years old that worked better than this. The touch pad is next to impossible to use. Also, the computer runs so slowly it can't even make use of the webcam and audio functions it supposedly came with. Even doing basic word processing or Internet surfing on this is a nightmare. I am returning this because it is defective in more ways than one. Save your money for a good one, or buy a cheaper used one. DO NOT BUY THIS - YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!
Hard drive crashed in a little more than 4 months. Was fairly good for the price up until the major hardware failure. This is basically a throw away machine. You get what you pay for folks. That said, at least I can attempt trying to get it repaired under warranty.
Pretty great value overall for $250 bucks.  It isn't loaded down with bloatware, and can be updated to windows 10 for free.<br/>It's not an i5, but it's not slow.  Sort of in the middle.  Put it this way, it's just fast enough to do most things without being slow.
i bought 2 of them 1 works great no problems but the other one is freezing and keeps saying high cpu usage. these were given as gifts and was just told the one messing up has been doing this since he recieved it. i am not happy that it is not functioning properly
This was a disappointment i got this as a  gift for my mom and within a day we were having issues with it.its slow,it freezes and it shuts off on its own
Seems the more I use it the better it performed, (Maybe after updates) running very well on windows 10.<br/>One choice I made was to not have a disk drive that was a bad choice on my part.<br/>One downside is not enough USB ports but a expander will correct.
It will not turn on, it just flashes. Returned to Asus for repairs and comes back doing the same thing. Sent it out the second time and it came back in the same condition.. They should give me a refund.  I will never buy a Asus product again.  Mary-Lou Kenyon
It is a notebook laptop and the highest amount of GB you get is 186.  It's good for Microsoft Office use and school related things but it is not good for gaming at all.  It is ok for a temporary laptop but I'm definitely getting a better one in the future.
Pulled it out of the box, plugged it in and the battery light turned green. Pushed the power on and the lightbulb sensor light turned green but nothing else happens. No noise at all and the screen doesn't turn on...I'm very disappointed. Will be returning!
ok here it is. you have to understand this is a great laptop and I wanted to keep it but I had to have a cd drive that why I had to send it back. but if you can live without having one then this is the right laptop. it works very well. not slow at all.
I love this item  it works fast, and is great to watch videos/movies because of its large screen.<br/>PROS:<br/>lightweight<br/>large screen<br/>fast<br/>large amount of space<br/>and GREAT battery life (hasn't died on me once and charges fast.)
I bought it to do home work on and it is great for it.  I doesn't come with Microsoft office, but runs it just fine after I bought it.  The biggest complaint I have is the mouse pad.  I would recommend getting a wireless mouse along with the laptop.
Love it. The quality is awesome.
For the money this computer is a good buy. I did not like the action on the keyboard, it feels a little soft. I was able to correct this buy buying a wireless keyboard. The processor works a little slower than I like, but it does get the job done.
This is a great buy for the money. I wish that it had an optical drive, but no big deal. I've had it for a few months, and still going great! Speakers are better than expected. I paid much more for my last laptop, and it couldn't touch this one.
I returned this product for a full refund.  Flimsy, extremely slow, hanging up constantly.  Our office IT professional couldn't get it booted up long enough to clear the hard drive.  Very disappointed.  But good for Amazon for taking it back!
Cheap exterior, cheap keyboard, cheap performance, but they are allowed by the cheap price. But card reader is really useless. If you insert your SD card, then you cannot eject it because this laptop does not have any eject popup mechanism.
I had to return this laptop because it ran at 50 to 75 cpu just on startup. Any program would freeze the computer due to lack of cpu power. Never buying another celery processor
I actually ordered this laptop on walmart app. I received it today, it's a simple laptop easy to set up. So far I have no problems with it. You can buy this laptop on the walmart app for $229.00 and I got it within 3 business days. Just a update I just found out by the Asus customer service that you have to download a software to be able to watch dvds. I was having a hard time trying to get the dvd movies to run as it wouldnt and they told me with this version laptop you have a download a software called VLC Media Player in order to watch dvd movies. Other then that, this is a great fast running laptop.
At first I was dealing with a lot of lag with my internet speeds. After turning off McAfee's Net Guard feature, things are working wonderfully. It's not the most super powered laptop in the world, but it definitely suits my needs.
A decent quality laptop for the price, but there are some obvious and frustrating drawbacks. The track pad appears to be low quality, and the right and left clickers often do not register clicks, which can be rather troublesome.
Not what I expected.  It was taking over 6hours to upgrade to Windows 10, so I finally just shut it off.  No instruction book - very frustrated with this computer.  Cheap is what you pay for I guess.  GOD I HATE THIS COMUTER!!!!
purchased for my 13 doing homework managing music files .. just fine if you are trying to run a business or heavy duty gamer .. stop being cheap and spend the extra 400.00 to get something to handle .. basic user ... just fine.
Great computer for the money.
Good, except the the stupid mouse pad has been disabled ever since I plugged in an external wireless mouse, and no matter what I do or fix the settings, the pad will not work anymore. So I'm forces to use the wireless mouse.
This laptop lasted 4 months and died. It very well could have been a battery issue. Unfortunately, the battery is integrated so you would probably void your warranty by removing and replacing the battery. The celeron processor seemed slower than the pentium in our 4-year-old laptop with similar specs. The touch pad was a nightmare. Don't get me started on trying to play a dvd, editing photos, or playing casual games. It couldn't even keep up with my typing speed. fugettaboutit. After returning it, we replaced it with a slightly more expensive refurbed L series toshiba with an i5 processor and a touchscreen. I am extremely pleased with its replacement! Chances are very poor that we will purchase Asus in the future.
ehhh terrible...
I have had absolutely no trouble with this ASUS laptop like I've had in previous laptops bought from regular computer stores.I would recommend it to any family or friends.Thanks for supplying such a variety of laptops.
Excelente, 100% recomendado.
Great pc, fast and sturdy.<br/><br/>I knew it didnt come with a DVD drive but i would like it better if it came with a bezel so that you can add a dvd drive later if you want, other that that great basic computer.
Seems to be a great laptop.
Constantly crashes while performing simple tasks ,no cd drive. Good for everyday tasks but if your looking for a laptop for gaming , this is not it. It has trouble running anything , graphics are a huge issue.
Great display and works alright. Not for the high functional computer user - tends to run a little slow in booting up and installing updates. Has been good for just checking email and updating social media...
The laptop has refused to come on since I took it out of the box. Charged the battery overnight and everything. When I press the power button, the light comes on but the screen stays black. Returning ASAP.
Amazon this laptop cannot work properly since the battery cannot charge.  From the time I put it on, the battery says 0% plugged in but not charging.<br/><br/>I need a refund of my money onto my card.
a few days having it the usb slots stopped working. 2 weeks in I was watching a movie and left the computer there for 5 minutes came back laptop froze so I let it die. It now doesn't charge or turn on.
Combing Windows 8 and this hardware is not only foolish, but bordering on criminal.<br/><br/>Ran so terribly out of the gate that I knew it would need to go back upon the second time I picked it up.
I bought this laptop for my son who was a freshman in college. He needed a basic computer for online classes. This computer is sufficient and he is very happy with the performance. Good price too...
I bought this for my teenage daughter to do her school work, the quality is inferior. The volume buttons do not work and the system is having problems connecting to the internet. I am not impressed. In the advertisement, mention was made of a free upgrade to windows 10..so far I have not seen this option.
I've been using the product for a long time and it runs great.<br/>I run WoW and use it for everyday web browsing. I love this laptop! The speakers are also nice and I love that it has a webcam!
I prefer the Mac but got this PC for our Auxiliary since I am treasurer and would like to have the information needed in an easy to move place.  for a PC and what I use it for, it is good enough
For the price it is ok but it can not do anything fast at all. Having 2 windows open in chrome or IE is hard for this computer to handle no matter what your looking at in those windows.
This computer worked less than a week. We called ASUS support and learned we were sold a defective computer, so returned it immediately. We purchased another one from another source.
Exactly what we wanted.
Just what I needed for email and internet.  Don't use MS office (free 30 day trial to Office 365 included).  Not a heavy duty machine (plastic cover) - but works nicely for me!
Was working great for about 2 weeks and now the charger crapped the bed. Laggy and a waste of money don't buy this computer
Tooooo... slow<br/>I brought it as just a Web browser, but I never expected this kind of speed.<br/>My G4 phone makes this thing seem like an LED watch from the 70's.
It is made very cheap. It only lasted two months before it stopped working. Black screen on startup and nothing else. :(<br/>Edit: I really liked this laptop. I decided to give it another try. The second order was dead on arrival.
Perfect for my needs.
Ordered this laptop for college and I haven't had many problems. Seems durable so far and is a decent very cheap computer.<br/>Pros:<br/>Durable. I feel like I could throw it around a little bit and it would last.<br/>Cheap. I bout this for about 250 and it's definitely well worth the money. This is very comparable to an HP that is way over the 250 mark.<br/>Size. This is the perfect size for me. Not too big to carry, but also is perfect for movie watching.<br/>Weight. Very lightweight for this decent sized computer.<br/>Cons:<br/>Speakers aren't that great. Not loud at all, but easily fixed with some plug in 20 dollar speakers.<br/>Not touch screen. This is a pro for many, and I don't mind it too much. I'm so used to everything being touch screen, and sometimes start clicking the screen.<br/>Windows 8. Free upgrade so this isn't a huge problem<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great product for a great price.
What I really like about this computer is how portable and lightweight it feels, you see I'm a college student and I don't need something heavy or bogus, so this is the perfect match, and I also like the touch screen features and it even makes a good typing too(the keyboard). I would suggest not to type with the touchscreen, because you're gonna have fingerprints all over the screen and the screen isn't that small like a tablet for your to type with your fingers, it will feel uncomfortable anyways. Also what I don't like about this is it has a slow rate of downloading things, low battery capacity, very vulnerable with viruses even with a malware software or antivirus program, so won't suggest this to you if you're the type that likes downloading stuff off the internet. But I would definitely recommend this to anyone College student or writer, journalist.... Because it makes a could writing tool that's for sure.
You show touch screen in the description, and is not , at the end I received this equipment and it was not touch screen,  is fake and does not work, I feel cheated.
For the price, there isn't a better laptop on the market. Rarely use an optical drive so I don't really need one. Could have used three USB ports instead of only 2.
I was expecting worse, but this laptop works fine for internet and video. The soundcard quality is my only complaint.
basic but gets the job done. webcam sucks. decently fast though. the keys don't have a backlight so in the dark, if you don't know your keyboard it's hard to type.
Delivered within 10 days.  Works perfect for my needs.  I did purchase a wireless tracker ball mouse to use with this laptop, soooo much better than the mouse pad.
Update: I changed this from a three star, to a one star. Because of the poor qualities of the laptop, and the fact that I got my SP3 running again, I decided to return this computer. Attempting to watch anything on this computer resulted in a terrible sound and choppy performance. As a college student, I don't need the best device in the world, but I definitely need something that can handle daily tasks, and this computer cannot. It's worth spending an extra hundred on a different device.<br/><br/>This laptop is ok, at best. I bought this as a speedy replacement for my surface pro 3, that was having some difficulties. For its size, the weight is very light, and accommodating. The screen is a great size, and the full sized keyboard is a bonus as well.<br/><br/>That's where the positives end. The sound on this model is crummy, often sounding scratchy and fuzzy. The RAM memory is very low, therefore making the computer slow and sometimes inefficient. Running antivirus and Edge at the same time put a lot of strain on the computer. This model does not come with an optical drive. That isn't a killer for me, since I use cloud-based technology now, but for others, it is a problem.<br/><br/>The verdict on this is that it would be great for someone that doesn't need it to watch videos, or use this for heavy entertainment. It would make a great writing device, with the full keyboard and large screen.
Not so great, lacks many simple functions, and not powerful for simple projects. I would say it's ok for a child, or beginner, but not worth what I paid at all!<br/>UPDATE:  COMPUTER BROKE DOWN A MONTH AFTER PURCHASE. JUNK!!!
Not very powerful, but good for taking notes, watching videos, or browsing the web. Just don't expect to be able to do too much at once without some problems.
Garbage. Just garbage. Cheap components. Feels like a plastic toy. Screen started having problems almost immediately. 90 days later it is completely unusable.
Nice simple computer
Great item and price
better than expected
A nice, lightweight, capable computer for the price. The case is not the sturdiest and the touch pad buttons are a bit clunky, but overall it's a good value.
Working with simple applications like chrome browser seemed to give a hard time to the processor. However, for the price that I got it for is still worth it.
its ok was a great buy, not to keen on windows 8 so its all new to me, and if i would have know it did not support a dvd/cd port i would not have bought it
Have had no problems. Easy to use. Does not come with much instruction for us laptop dummies but use it to lookup instructions online and you will be ok.
It can't get any better with this price. Ended up paying $129 on black friday and i have to say, i doesn't look cheap as you'd expect. Amazing computer!
I didn't expect it to be so light weight. Love it brought this to use for school since all my classes are online. Easy to use. Great battery life..
It is a very good notebook for the price.  I feels frail and the speakers aren't very good.<br/>Overall I am pleased for what I got for the money.
Not the best in the world but it serves it's purpose as a basic use laptop especially for the price. I only use it for school and surfing the web.
I have this laptop. It is good but after a month there is something wrong with the power. I cannot turn on the laptop although it is charged fully
I bought this laptop for my mom and she is loving it ... its relatively light and the screen so beautiful .. thank you amazon for a great product
I bought this laptop to study, a month of use the battery is damaged and does not load . not find a replacement battery , I need help with that.
Good for the price
Upgrading to windows 10 can break the wireless card, as the company who created the wireless card has yet to produce a working set of drivers.
I took advantage of the Free Windows 10 up grade. Just taking some getting used to  ASUS. It's light, I love the screen size, so far so good!
Terrible! the instructions had no flaws anthem -there were no instructions. In fumbling about trying to get it working it froze up, Called the # for help and and got one of those so called english speaking representatives. He was apparently allotted a set amt of time per customer [most of which was spent on "what did you say"] . Once the timer said the allotted time was up they wanted me to have some expert contact me and clear up the problem. For $200. I returned it to Amazon and convinced myself to never ever deal with ASUS again.
Good, Fast enough for my school work ( college student).  The camera isn't good but I'm not really using it for much video making purposes.
works fine so far
I love it because i got it cheap. Is nice it gets the work done. is not like the best computer out there but fore me it work just fine.
It has everything I was expecting. A little heavy to carry around, but it's a good computer, and it has everything I need for college.
I am able to do all of my required assignments on this laptop.  In addition, I use this for my small business needs and entertainment.
thought it came with optical drive ,but it did not ,like it tho
I am very happy with my new Asus! It works very well for my specific needs! I'm happy to have found it at such a great price too!!
This notebook is full of s***. When i bought this notebook, I tried to upgade windows 8 to windows 10 but when i tried to upgrade , it always stop the upgarding automatically and loose the Wi-Fi connection.  I checked wi-fi connection by another laptop. Connection was good. Actually, i wanted to buy a laptop. But when i saw this notebook saying free upgradable to windows 10. Then i bought this. I bougt this notebook to send it to bangladesh. When i had saw this problem I wanted to return it but i had only two days left because my elder brother will go bangladesh after two days. I fixed the loosing wifi connection problem and refreshed it. Now it doesn't show me any way to upgrade windows 8  to windows 10
This computer is so slow. I bought this for my family member after buying an Acer for myself. This is not worth the money at all.
does exactly what I expect. Easy to follow directions for setup , easy to remove unwanted software. A good computer for the money
Great laptop for price. This laptop ran pretty smooth with me after uninstalling unwanted apps. Touchpad isn't that great though
Great laptop that I use primarily for school. Yet to have any issues and I would buy it again over any of my previous comouters.
very very nice!!
Great product, but when I upgraded to Windows 10 the system became really slow.  I think a memory upgrade is required
Great price for a great little computer. Got for my kids. They can play minecraft on it and hasn't had any issues.
excellent service and met all desires and expectations for product as advertised. Would buy again from this dealer
I got this for a college student where price was an issue, a little slow but it does everything it is supposed to
Everything Ok!
Very Well Made
Had problems right away with WIFI, since the ASUS driver is a different (newer) version from my older hub and wouldn't connect. After using Mac's I find windows a clumsy and non-intuitive platform. I don't think their bells and whistles add anything to the ease and overall experience - just window dressing to make it seem modern. I dislike their file management system and the computer is slow. It is also tied to all the Microsoft products and collaborating software and they constantly annoy with pop-ups trying to sell stuff and get your personal information. (This is Windows98 trying to be a hipster!)
This notebook did not work properly, (or really at all), from the second I opened it and began to set up my Microsoft account etc. I had issues with consistent "freezing", I kept receiving an error message for the "free upgrade" to Office 10, and customer service at ASUS was an exercise in futility and frustration. I packed it up and mailed it back. I am not a fan of this product, I do not recommend it, and the bottom line is that you get what you pay for, and this is a $200.00 notebook. It was very naive to believe that quality comes at this price and I will quickly go back to a MAC!
Dithered for several days before deciding on this lap top for my daughter. Works perfectly, no problems at all.
Not a bad laptop, especially for the price. Windows 8 made me want to throw it across the room on the first day, but I've since gotten used to it. Now, after a week of owning it, I went to install some software, and I was shocked to find that there's no disc drive. When shopping, I looked for screen size, RAM and ROM. Didn't think to make sure there was a drive because that seems like a really basic aspect of ALL computers these days. I'm hoping I'll be able to get a downloadable version of the software I need. If I can't, I'll be spending the money I saved on this laptop on an external drive.
Great buy. Works fine right out of the box. Immediate Internet connection to my N router. Windows 8 is smooth.
The laptop I received wasn't exactly what was described. I ordered a new one and got a used laptop instead. Once I charged it and turned it on expecting some start up tutorial to appear, instead it already has a set background of someones kid and a user login picture of who I can assume is the mom of the kid. There was also a password which I do not have, AND the mouse pad didn't work at all. I even tried hitting [fn] [f9] to see it the pad was just turned off but it still didn't work. I was extremely upset by this since I need a new laptop and my old one is nearing the end of its life.
Does this computer suports games, and does the computer gets slower wen there is more than two programs open
Worth while purchase, I love it and so does my girlfriend whom I got it for. Also love the fast delivery!
very nice and really good for gaming but come one. you have to dissemble the laptop to get to the battery
Poor OS, slow and herky jerky.  I do NOT recommend.  Get a ChromeBook.
Great computer.. just take in consideration it doesn't have the CD-Room but besides that it's great.
Is a good hardware into a very cheap box, but if you take a look at the price is a great solution!
Slow, terribly slow out of the box. Not sure if it's the OS or the laptop. Same os works ok on other brands.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/>THIS IS THE WORST COMPUTER EVER MADE.<br/>15 minutes startup time, about 3-5 minutes for a reaction after any click.<br/>Nothing has been done to this machine other than turning it on out of the box.<br/>WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP.<br/>NEVER ASUS AGAIN.<br/>I will be giving this machine to a recycle center so they can dispose of it, as that's the only thing that this machine deserves.<br/>WASTE OF TIME, MONEY, RESOURCES.......
Less than 3 months and it went off and does not come back on. No lights or anything. This sucks!
It can run cs go and speed runners. It's a good laptop for te price and it has good sound to it.
hi is possible to exchange for something the same but smaller thank you I wait for your anwser
The laptop came with windows 8.1 for home<br/><br/>The did not meet the needs of our network
Product arrived as stated. Very pleased with this laptop. Lightweight. Extremely easy set up.
Works fine for the money. It is a little slow to boot up, but other than that it is worth it.
Second laptop in a 6 month period. Both turned off and on their own and never started again.
Great product for the price I needed it in a pinch and it is everything it said it would be.
I purchased this computer back in march & I've never spent at least 30 minutes on it now I load it up && it won't come on then I called customer service & they tells me to pay to get it fixed as if I was the one who messed it up here it is June & this computer won't come on & I only used this thing 8 times since then I feel as though I wasted every hard working dime I have because its one sorry computer I'm telling don't wasted your money at all please don't fall a victim as I did ..
the lap top is ok but monitor does not work. had to use an extra monitor to config the PC.
Great screen, colorful, and pretty fast, can handle most of my games on my steam account.
Very disappointed... Purchased item as a birthday present for my son and its not working.
Had to call tech support after just a week.  Tech support was great but wouldn't have expected to have to call them so soon after receiving it.  The laptop is connected to a router by a Ethernet cable and I am having a problem with it connecting.  Sometimes it works great and immediately connects when I start the computer.  Sometimes connects and then cuts off.  So far I can unplug the cable and then plug it back into the laptop once or twice and it finally connects.
i love my laptop, its beautiful and works great. came in good condition and quickly too.
This computer runs smoothly even on slow WiFi. Its great. I use it for school and home.
this is a very cheaply made, flimsy laptop. the touch pad is crummy. not smooth, just has an awful feel. i opened the box, booted up the ASUS and it was a total nightmare from the minute it started up. the screen feels like it's going to fall off when you open it. the key board feels like a fisher-price toy.  i got it today at 4pm and it's 9pm and ready to be returned first thing tomorrow morning.<br/>you get what you pay for. save you money on this one.
Great for my daily typing usage. Very comfortable keyboard and screen size is prefect.
Excellent price-quiality relation.<br/>A fast and powerfull laptop for everyday use.
I bought 2 of these for my sons to play games on. Neither will run six months later.
Was not exactly what I was looking for. But, it easily became a laptop for my wife.
I needed a CPU for VPN purposes, and this is just what I needed for a great price.
The laptop came without a charger... What am I suppose to do with it!!! Pissed off
A little slow for the internet but definitely functional and well worth the price.
great laptop, does what I need it to do and so far it has been reliable and fast.
Gift for my daughter. She likes it. I think it's a great computer for this price.
It's a great laptop the only thing I would like for it to have had is a cd driver
Worked less than 6 months before I had to send it in for repair. Still waiting.
My laptop is great for online school. It works very well.It was easy to set up.
I just needed a simple computer for internet and other things. This is perfect.
This in my opinion is a very nice computer.  It has all the bang for the buck.
Very fast, though, it would be better if it came with free antivirus software.
This in my opinion is a very nice computer. It has all the bang for the buck.
Very user friendly. Use for bills emails and internet. Exactly what I wanted.
My Fiance has this laptop and it runs very well and has never had any issues.
Sometimes, Touch goes little wrong.<br/>But, item works fine on good price.
Had the computer less than a month and had to send it into ASUS for repair.
Great for surfing the internet and some light processing.  Love the price!
I can't find my product key to activate my laptop.... so I am a big upset.
Excelente
Good buy.

good computer just takes for ever to do updates... quite the bit of time
Works fantastic. Have had no issue with it so far. I absolutely love it.
Laptop is OK.  I'm finding that the keyboard is too large for my hands.
Too slow and it constantly freezes up I should of just bought an acer.
great buy at a great price.  grandson is loving it playing minecraft.
Works great for school work so far, ease of use, fast delivery A++++
Bought this in September of this year, does not work anymore! JUNK!
Fairly east setup. Pretty user friendly. I am very pleased with it.
This is an adequate low cost machine, but some better design and component choices might have significantly improved it.<br/><br/>First, it comes with Windows. I don't know why people still do this since Linux just works and is a better system. I haven't yet upgraded it to Linux because I haven't had the time and I've read that a few of the components don't yet have proper drivers. I know there are workarounds that will be sufficient, and eventually I'll get around to doing that. But for now Windows is minimally adequate.<br/><br/>And some severely retarded person must have been in charge of the trackpad. There aren't separate buttons for the mouse so I'm constantly right clicking when I mean to left click, pinch-n-zooming when I mean to move the mouse and then left click, and did I mention gestures? I damn sure don't want gestures - that's a pretty ridiculous idea that overrides your intent with those of someone who clearly has never used a trackpad before. And the trackpad isn't in the center. It needs to be in the center, which would make it easier to find the buttons properly.<br/><br/>The keyboard could use some refinement as well. For one thing, can we please get keys large enough for a grown man? Like 120% of the "standard" size. My hands aren't huge for an adult male, but they are large enough that I'm constantly having to edit mistypes. And of course the Ctrl key sticks sometimes, which is always surprising me like when I'm trying to scroll and it won't because the ctrl is down. I use the Ctrl key a lot, so this is annoying. And the arrow keys NEED to be physically separated from the other keys so you can feel them properly. I'm often hitting the left arrow when I want the up or down arrow, which wouldn't be a problem if I could feel which was which. Also, the keys could have more depth and better "feel" - they should have a clicking feel when you press them - that makes it easier to move your fingers over them to find the right key without accidentally pressing them. I actually chose this machine in part because most of the other keyboards in this class looked even worse (half-height arrow keys? WTF?).<br/><br/>The screen could be a higher resolution, but then this is a low end machine so asking for more isn't really fair. Same with processor power. Both are good enough for the price.<br/><br/>The power button is also not as good as it should be. Its hard to find in the dark and a little too close to the Esc key.
Excelent
Great student computer, it does the basis stuff for a great price.
very satisfied with the laptop. excellent price and meets my needs
Worked a month. Then stopped connecting to the internet. Don't get
It's a good laptop, it was cheap, what can I say, I'm satisfied.
Working well for us.  So far so good.  Great value for the money
Very nice computer for daily emails, Facebook, and web browsing.
Not even worth 1 star. Super slow and laggy. Very disappointed!
felt very cheap and flimsy.  Track pad was absolutely horrible.
Horrible lump of plastic and really slow, even browsing is a pain. Im amazed they still make computers like this.  I almost threw this in the trash when it arrived. Very plasticy feel. Horrible keyboard.  Browsing stalls even if you are copying a file in the background.  I dont know how this got positive reviews.
Works great for what I use it for, not good for gaming though
This is a budget laptop, so don't expect a whole lot from it.
love it, it's lightweight  and just what i needed for my son
excellent for home use! works quickly and I would buy again.
Love it
I think is good, it have all the childrens need for school
The audio is a bit echoey, but other than that it's good
I love it iam please I a customer for live thanks Amazon
Bought two of these for school. One loaded right up and was ready in minutes. The other was still thinkin about starting up over 30 minutes later. Not very happy that two identical computers both new, and one already had issues connecting to Internet and running ridiculously slow
would be perfect if it had a cd/dvd  drive.works great.
Love my laptop. It does all I need and would buy again.
Nothing fancy here, but for its price is a good laptop.
Everything fine, Windows 8.1 not very friendly but fine
After finishing set up immediately had freezing issues. No other programs open and laptop would freeze when I tried to open My Documents. Thought maybe just a fluke. After two days made sure everything all set up, no background programs running and still same issue. Returning.
Too slow for my needs. Good entry-level laptop though.
Very slow. Seems to lag just by loading a web browser.
cant wait to do the final review
Had to return my laptop. Started out fine at first but later discovered it wasn't brand new. The ports weren't working. Each time I plugged in any device, the laptop wouldn't pick it up. Also, when I updated the software to Windows 10, the track pad stopped working.
Nice performance, beauty design and excellent price.
It has no disc drive but every thing ales is perfect
Came quickly works great. Same as picture runs fast.
Fast shipping. Bought for my mom and she loves it.
Screen keeps going black and I don't know why. . .
Laptop excellent and economical for the size next.
This is my first PC laptop and I like it so far. One issue I have is that when I try to open it, I have to hold down the bottom part to keep from flipping up the whole unit. If I don't remember, I could easily flip the whole thing off my lap desk.
Had it for about a month, so far it's pretty good
It's my Windows 10 machine.  Love ASUS products.
Yes, it was for my son and it suits his purpose
perfect little computer for basic internet play
I didn't listen to the reviews I read.<br/><br/>Stay away from this model. I doubt this reflects upon the ASUS brand. This item was slow and within 36 hours it didn't work anymore.<br/><br/>Started a return process for a refund.
Computer works well.  Cant wait for Windows 10
It works very well for what i wanted it for.
Great product -a bit slow, but works fine...
since my laptop came preconfigured by other person, I can't acces anything on the damn thing. is unusable, hence 1 star. another problem: the power suply provided don't work. look like someone tampered my order.
I bought it for my son.  He says it's fine.
My son is very pleased with his new laptop.
works as advertised and arrived on schedule
I have this and mind does have dvd and hdmi
It's working great from what I understand.
True garbage. I know it's cheap (just an auxiliary to my phone and tablet) but apps and sites constantly crash. Not so on my iPad with the same internet connection. Cheap is good. But this isn't marketable.
Dont think that youre getting the best deal ever, because you arent. its a good laptop for the low dent in the wallet, but it lacks crucial features.<br/>Firstly, if youre buying this with the plans of upgrading it, the dont.  the motherboard is only compatible with the 4gb of ram that it comes with, and forget changing the processor... if you are a skyper, dont go for this one... it has a partially drilled hole, giving the appearance of a webcam, but sadly, there isnt one. CASUAL GAMERS BEWARE! even minecraft lags a bit on some of the lowest graphic settings...and current gen games... forget it. However... I will give it props... it costs little in reference to other laptops and is fast on the internet, though that also has to do with your connection speed... perfect for an emergency of your main laptop quits on you, and great for an entry level computer... comes with a one year accident warranty as well, meaning if you drop it or spill water on it, it can be replaced...
I got this for my wife and she loves it..
I had to return this computer twice. the first computer i received didn't have a working keyboard. The keyboard just didn't work. The second computer  kept freezing and it wouldn't pick up my router.
I love this laptop. The design is solid.
Great lap top. And an exceptional value.
It is good i need to get use to the apps
I was so excited when my laptop came in the mail, I couldn't wait to use it and I was surprised  to see that it was not working at first. I thought it just had to be charged but after 8 hours of charging, the laptop still would not work. So I called their support and they determined that the screen was defective. I am extremely disappointed and now I have to ship my computer back to the company and wait an unknown amount of time until its fixed, all before I even got to use it once. I will not be recommending this company to anyone I know.
Works great for the office work we need
Great computer my daughter loves it!!!
I received this team and I 've noticed that on the screen on the inside has a spot like dirt , I can do about it, it is supposed to pay for a brand new computer without details .
Exactly why did your responce to someone's question state that this unit have bluetooth when it DOES NOT have bluetooth? I'm taking two stars off just for the false information.
Pretty disappointed so far. Spent an hour or two removing the rubbish, which went fine with an attached mouse but CPU usage kept hitting 100% and still can't seem to remove a McAfee product (some sort of browser scanner). I turned of Bing search as well.<br/>So far I don't like the slow response and the difficulty of using the trackpad with the integrated buttons.<br/>The screen is nice and crisp though. Haven't done much yet. Maybe we'll need to up the stars.<br/>Turned it over to my daughter who has a habit of breaking electronics and whose 2008 MacBook Pro just died.<br/><br/>The trackpad issue seems better thanks to the touch features that make pushing the thing down almost unnecessary. The thing is still very lightweight in the sense that the keyboard etc. don't have the feel of something solid. My daughter likes it though, so at the price it works well.
Excellent relation price performance
I liked but no thin at not dvd unit.
Perfect for my high school grandson!
The speed of asus is not satisfying.
Husband is very pleased with laptop.
Well, it's certainly a computer and works as such. No real trouble with software or anything, but it's unwieldy.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>-It works just fine.<br/>-It has everything i expected it to have.<br/>-A nice price for the quality of components.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>-Its processor is bleh, but anyone with a little insight on computers would know that already.<br/>-The touch pad is garbage. The buttons tend to stick regardless of how clean under the touch pad is.<br/>-The touch pad has no separate buttons. This means that when you're clicking, there is a good chance that the mouse will move while you're finger is on the mouse button. Mucho no bueno.<br/>-Made of really cheap plastic.<br/>-You cant easily remove the battery. This is A HUGE PROBLEM. Come on, techies, what are you supposed to do when you get liquids on your device? YOU REMOVE THE BATTERY IMMEDIATELY. With the way this laptop is set up, that's impossible to do before water can do its damage.<br/>-[edited in] I forgot to mention that the touch pad sometimes registers the opposite mouse button click. Sometimes I would try and left click an item and the computer would register it as a right click. I've already ruled out the possible driver problem. The problem is in the design of the touch pad.<br/><br/>All in all, I would NEVER buy this thing again. If you want a computer and you're hard pressed for money, simply choose a different computer of similar monetary value or save up a little more so you don't waste your money on this crap.
Arrived on time.  My son loves it!!
Loads fast. Internet is fast. Great
At first this laptop seemed okay...cheap feel to it for sure...I read many reviews about the questionable quality of this laptop. Despite the many negative reviews there were enough positive ones I thought I'd give it a go. Well, you get what you pay for. After only 45 days the keyboard stopped working. I never even moved the laptop or even used it much. ASUS gave me an RMA number to return it for repair, but I am not confident in this extremely cheap laptop. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SYSTEM. YOU DO NOT WANT THE HASSLE. ASUS SHOULD NOT MARKET ANY COMPUTER THAT HAS SUCH A HIGH CHANCE OF FAILURE. BAD ON YOU ASUS. I had bought an ASUS  T-100 tablet earlier this year which had a bad screen. Luckily for me that failed in the first days of ownership and I was able to return it. AGAIN, BAD ON YOU ASUS.
Great computer for everyday tasks
Gift for my daughter she loves it
Great Computer for a great price!
Harder to operate than had hoped
Returned notebook not a computer
Arrived on time and works great.
Well worth the $249.  Do it !!!!
This laptop is exactly what it says.  It is a low end machine and you get exactly what you pay for.  It runs Netflix fine as well as Hulu.  Internet browsing is fine.  Office works well with no issues.  This is a very low end basic machine that performs light duties as it should.  Dont be expecting to play high end games and you will be fine.  This I am guessing is supposed to compete with the Chromebook and it does it well.<br/><br/>A few weeks in and my son has played Roblox on it for a while.  It performs well and he has no issues with it so it will play basic games.  He has played minecraft on it as well and it works fine.<br/><br/>It has performed light duties like a champ and hasnt given me any issues yet.  It does feel kind of cheap but I am not going to be using it as a soccer ball.<br/><br/>It takes windows 10 really easily.  It is almost like it was made for it.  So far my son has taken it through its paces and it is working like a champ.
This is a basic computer for browsing the web and checking your email. if you plan to do anything else you will need a computer with a faster processor.
Setup only took about 20 minutes. Not bad. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was positive about this. I tried to go with the Windows 10 upgrade. After 3 hours, the download part had only progressed about 25%. I stopped the download, and went ahead with my regular light web browsing. Visiting different websites for homework was mediocre at best, and I had good Wireless strength.<br/>A couple of days later, I got back on it for more browsing, and even simple websites such as Google loaded at the speed of dial-up. Not to mention that the computer and its programs had went unresponsive several times.<br/>This evening, I started it back up. Boottime was excellent. I put in my password to my Microsoft account, and I sat watching the spinning dot-wheel thing, and all that I saw was "Welcome" for several minutes. It never booted into the start menu. I packed it up and have asked Amazon for a refund after only one week. A total waste of $300, but at least I'm getting it back.<br/>My tip to anyone who considers buying this is, don't be cheap. Spend a couple hundred extra, and you probably won't be disappointed. In this case, I definitely got what I paid for, and that is the most expensive paperweight.
It came with no power cord WTF
We purchased this for my mom. Brand new. After a month, the hard drive failed.
Best laptop I've ever bought!
i love this laptop  very good
this is an excellent laptop.
so far so good.. no problems
Nice Computer for the money.
Pure junk, all plastic and impossible to upgrade, very slow out of box.
<br/> I find it very clever the way the package came in the box, simple and easy with no much plastic on. In regards to what matters (the computer) I find it not much related to what the price and the product itself is. Most of the time I use AMAZON since is a secure page to buy articles and by the response to any matter. I do not leave bad feedbacks to any product unless they are not what I expect, such this case. I live overseas and for me is very difficult to obtain anything after purchase, but the risk is on me. Guys, there are plenty of brands and computers that offer much more capability but I guess I stepped into the famous brand that ASUS is supose to. Honestly, not very happy with this. The keyboard is hard as a coconut, to upload the operating system with "4GB RAM" it last more than 30 seconds (not normal), the videocam pixels a bit on skype (but thats not very relevant for me). I dont know if there's any kind of compensation regarding this but man, what a disappointment.
Very happy with my purchase
great comps for the money!!
Typing on this thing is like playing with a child's tinkling piano -- clunky, feels like it's going to break inside, and you never quite get the feeling that anything is accomplished.  The lack of solidity makes me fear carrying it out of my apartment -- or even from my bedroom into the living room.
Terrible laptop, not at all worth your time. I received not one but TWO defective laptops. The first wouldn't power on even after being charged the recommended 8 hours. The replacement turned on, however the keyboard didn't work no matter what I did. What a buzzkill after the initial power up! When I contacted customer service about the fact that I was sent two defective laptops, they basically just said to send both laptops back and better luck next time. Really Amazon? Thanks for nothing. This laptop is like the plague, avoid at all costs!!!
I purchased this item for my niece who is attending college, she loves it, now she doesn't have to go to the library.
Nice laptop for the money
Good bang for your buck.
Great buy for students !
7/17/15 no problems yet.
Perfect for the price. .
Best lap top everrrrr!!!
Great computer thanks!!!
Exactly what I expected from Asus.  The battery life is good and doesn't deplete too much during hibernate.
good deal for the price
Keyboard a little slow.
Fulfilled expectations.
nice inexpensive laptop
Cheaply made and I thought it would have touch screen...I was wrong. Microsoft Apps will not download.
I have had nothing but problems with this computer, it keeps trying to update and has taken hours for only 2 updates
Bad Laptop for everything. Asus is a bad brand brand period. I would suggest getting hp, acer or mac
Does not have a CD room I did not realize it did not have it otherwise I would have never bought it
Impecable, gracias!!!
Good,came really fast
I ordered this one and followed all instructions. It never once powered on. Very disappointing.
Since the beginning I had problems running the computer. The first and second time I turned it on (setting it up and making the registry) it completely freezed, which happened after repeatedly. I tried to reset it from zero, rebooted from manufacturer set up and as I expected it worked out better. I started using it and I was happy with it and thought it was a simple and solved complication. After a month, while I was watching a movie in it, it blacked out and never turned on again.<br/>Doesn't even show the charging light on when it's plugged to electricity. It's a piece of garbage and the warranty they offer it's very limited. I deeply regret that I spent almost 300 bucks buying this... Because I am not able to know when will I have them again. DO NOT BUY. Now I have no computer, no warranty, and no money.
Excellent notebook !
Excellent and cheap!
This computer worked well for the price. The hardware and software included would have been just what I needed in a computer. Battery life, weight, screen size, and 10-key were all great.<br/>My biggest complaint is the materials used for the casing. The plastic is very flimsy around the screen and base, right were I rest my palms for typing. With young children in the house and transforming to and from school, I need a computer that could hold up to the physical demands on life. Coming from an a aluminum MacBook my standards may have been set too high, but I don't want my computer to break from a single drop.<br/>Aside from the casing, I would recommend this computer to others if they wouldn't transport it to many times and had older children.
very good product!
Excellent notebook
Geat for the price
I've now had my Asus for about 3 weeks. It's large, bright, powerful, and lightweight. I've gone through my share of laptops ranging from Lenovo to Macbook Pro. For the price, the Asus was an amazing deal. Now, it is no gaming unit but it can hold it's own against all the outrageously expensive brands. Kudos to Asus for such quality work for an affordable price.
This laptop comes with the worst operating system ever. It forces users to sync their computer in order to use most functions of the computer (The freeking calendar, PRE-EXISTING Skype accounts, you name it) and it will not let you change your default search engine. Save your money. Buy a model that doesn't come with this worthless trash operating system.
Dead on Arrival - Keyboard was completely inoperative out of the box. Tried updating drivers. No luck. Returned. On a side note, even if it did work, I was not impressed by the quality of construction. Cheap plastic and cheap weak feeling hinges. This thing is a recipe for disaster. Not to mention out of the box the hdd speed was super slow. Usually takes a while for windows to start up fresh, but this was almost 30 minutes of startup on first use. Screen is waaay to glossy, and the touchpad response is aweful. I've owned literally dozens of laptops and can say with absolute certainty that you get what you pay for with laptops. This was a fun hour of my life but stick with HP or Lenovo.
Excelente laptop.
I only had this  laptop for 3 months and it quit working, I'm very upset!!!
I was so disappointed about the laptop ! The CD driver is even not working!
Bought this for my wife for her birthday, she is extremely happy with it.
i have been a hp guy but for once i wanted to give it a try with something different. so, i saw this laptop. it called my attention. i read the description and everything. it seemed that i was a good one, so i decided to buy it. at first it gave me some trouble. so i decide to give another try and well. its just a big disappointment. the lack of proccesing, the poor performance. the wifi no working properly. i have to say its late to complain but at least i leave my review. so people dont make the same mistake. there are better laptops out there. what a waste of money just to keep trying because i believed it was going to get better.
Worked great for 2 WEEKS! I was on vacation, and getting married and the computer quit working after 2 weeks of use, (and that was very light browsing on the web for things to do and see while on vacation). Computer now only shows BIOS screen and will not go any farther. Amazon tells me that I cant return it because I returned from vacation/honeymoon 1 day after I could apparently exchange it. ASUS now wants me to pay to ship it to them so they can fix the P.O.S. Awesome, I pay to ship it to you so you can put another P.O.S hard drive in it so that It can happen again. I wish I could give this thing no stars. What a pile of crap!
worth the price.
It is very slow.
No CD player. :(
Great for school
Excelent product
Excellent product.  Fast shipping, great packaging.  All good!  Thanks.
This computer sucks...It is SO SLOW! I review products very fairly, and I rarely leave bad reviews, but this is a joke...It freezes up on me just trying to play Youtube videos...I can BARELY shop on amazon...it takes forever to open any application, I cant even imagine what would happen if I tried to run Photoshop...really disappointed...my advice is spend the extra $400 and get the i7 model with the 1Tb HD and 8GB of RAM...don't waste your money on this thing...I literally bought this just to do online shopping, surf the web, and type a few essays for school...it can't even do that...
It work perfect
To be honest this is one of the worst product I have ever purchased via Amazon. I could not return as my return deadline date passed, as I did not use is much and could not know how was it actually performing in first 30 days. But later on realized that it boots up very slow, windows asks to update before every shut-down. Takes forever to install updates. Internet browser freezes time and again, and responds very slow. All in all - " I hate to use this laptop". But I got no choice. If there was option for less than 1 star, I would have given that. Buy at your own risk.
its been a week since i got the computer - here is what i think of it - the keyboard sucks - my fingers pain every night from trying to reach the far flung keys. Plus the keys are very obscurely placed - like for example the delete key is a small button tucked away somewhere. The mouse pad is quirky - and does things you did not want it to. The laptop is too big - you wont know how cumbersome it is till you try to use it. For such a big laptop its light though. The laptop is very slow when running java script or some such in a webpage. Overall something to avoid.
All of the reviews should say "this is a great laptop FOR THE PRICE".  The price is great, but come on guys- this is NOT a great laptop.  I am writing this review from a different laptop because I get so sick of using the Asus.  It is slow as hell and really quirky- hit mouse pad all the time without meaning to, keys stick, drops wifi, etc.  For the price, it is fine, but if you are looking for something more than casual web-browsing, this is not the computer for you.  I prefer my iPad and my 2007 HP brick laptop over this new computer.
So far so good
it was perfect
so far so good
yeah, I did it
Very satisfied
work very good
Good I like it
Extremely slow computer. For a bare-bones price, I was not expecting anything spectacular, but the thing should at least function smoothly. I can barely surf the internet, can barely even watch Youtube videos. It's just really disappointing my time is being wasted, cause I don't have time to return this piece of junk. I guess i'll keep it because I NEED it now (not 2-3 weeks from now), not because I want it.<br/><br/>The only reason I can make due with this worthless computer is because I use it to edit text documents and open basic files.
This laptop is ok. Last year I bought a Macbook Air and loved it. Got this computer just to learn some programming and wanted something I could use for things like that. However I now really see the difference between Mac and PC.<br/><br/>First time using Windows 8 and do not like it. I always use desktop view. It's good for what I use it for, but if you want a fast computer that will be able to handle many things at once this is not the computer for you. For the price it's a good computer. Maybe Windows 10 will help something
Ummm...I bought this Laptop by going through the specifications and the huge list of people who bought. I got the mixed review and when I checked that my self I was so sorry about the product...With in 2 seconds I was so sure that its of no use and will not keep it with me... Some how still I went ahead and checked the performance of the system but I am sorry this is good for your 5 year old kid to play cartoon movies not for a home usage. If you are good and fine with acheap plastic laptop...please go ahead for it.
Fits my needs
This computer is so ridiculously slow it's almost impossible to use. It literally takes minutes just to do a file search. Connecting to the internet is even worse. Out-of-the-box it was a total joke. I've had it for a few months and haven't been able to use it for anything. It takes like 20 minutes just to turn on and if there are software updates it'll take an hour or more. I might wait and see if Windows 10 runs any better on it, but most likely I will return it. Total POS. ASUS should be ashamed.
Great laptop
nice machine
Works great!
This is cheap and feels cheap.  The keyboard is choppy and unresponsive, the plastic seems flimsy and the left/right click of the touchpad have no separation so always hitting the right side when I want the left.  I wish I would have returned it, but didn't so will put up with it and hope it becomes more comfortable and serves its purpose for a while.  Should have spent more and gotten the one of the brands I have had previously and been happy with.
Happy, good
Low quality
I really regret my purchase. I want to return this, but I think it's too late. I already set it up for myself and have been using it thinking I just needed to get used to it. I knew this laptop would be cheap, but I had no idea it would be THIS bad. It's frustrating trying to use this. The touch pad is AWFUL. The buttons on it are SO hard to push. If you use the left/right buttons a lot this is not the laptop for you. Your hands/fingers will be in a world of pain. I hate tap to click, but I have to use it now just so I don't need to use the horrible left/right buttons as often. I can't even edit photos anymore because it's too difficult with this. This laptop should never have been made or sold. Even if you are dirt poor ... seriously do not buy this.
Great Job!
works good
good price
I like it.
Perfect!!!
Good value

the device stopped working within two days
Had this for about 4 months when it shut off and doesn't turn back on. Trying to find a way to get this fixed but not really finding an option for that easily. When it was running it was ok for a $250 laptop, a little slow but did what I needed it to do. Could just be a bad component but even so just trying to figure out who is going to fix this for me has been really annoying.

this new version has wifi problem. I have both older vesion and this new version (I thought the new version has dvd drive. Obviously, I am wrong). The wifi in this laptop has big issue.  It drops its connection every hour or so, sometimes staying connected for a few hours and other times dropping the connection every 1/2 hour. I have 8 devices connected to the router that have no issues and have tried everything. The older version has no any issue.
This computer is highly exceptional. I love the fact that it had everything set up for me. To illustrste, the windows 8.1 pre-installment and the free upgrade to the windows ten. These things were very helpful for me because I've never owned a labtop before. Thanks again Amazon!
This laptop is cheap and low-end. The price is also cheap and low-end, so you definitely get what you pay for. I bought it for my daughter and after 4 months regret that purchase. I may keep it myself for the younger kids to play games on and replace hers with a better version.
No good

I don't know if it's the hardware or the way it's programed. I'm a little spoiled by having Macs for the last 10 years and I've grown accustom to a certain level of performance. I don't recall Microsoft being this counter-intuitive to run or if its the hardware.
The laptop power on when it feels like. Laptop seems good. So upset bouth this for my aunt to do basic stuff sent it to her all to hear for days it refuses to turn on i was so disapointed and i cant return it because it passed 30 days
Good product but they dont tell you in the fine print it does not come with a CD/DVD drive. I had to buy mine separately which was only $15 but still it would have been nice to have it included. Overall great product for the price
Good !
I suggest you do not buy this computer. This is the first day I am using it and already it is laggy and slow. I have great internet connection, and yet the computer just doesn't cooperate. Spend your money on something better
The system of this laptop is unstable. The older version is much better.
Computer is very light.<br/>However the ASUS X551MA had a few glitches.<br/>Wasn't really impressed with the product.<br/>However, the pricing on this computer was really good but regret buying it.
I have to concur with many of the other reviewers.  I've been using the laptop for about five hours, removing much of the unnecessary software that comes with all computers, and installing my favorite programs.  The problem is that it is suprisingly slow for a brand-new laptop, even in executing normal, low-demand tasks and operations.  And computers only get slower as you install more applications, fill up the hard drive, etc.  And perhaps I have not given the trackpad sufficient time to get used to it, but it *does* seem terribly clumsy.  I find myself clicking the right button instead of the left (since the whole trackpad is offset so far to the left) and it feels like some of my clicks are not even being registered.  I would not purchase this laptop if I had the choice again.
I like this PC. A few things I would want better: trackpad doesn't respond well, not enough USB ports to support wireless mouse and extra storage USB + peripherals, slowly boots but not too long.
Very good product. Came in seal package brand new. I brought it from Amazon LLC. Nice computer and it is working well. Windows 8.1 is great. It is easier to do things than previous windows.
slow,
Great

This laptop is the worst.  It was slow from the start, but is almost inoperable now, just a month later.  We bought it for school and use it only for the Internet, really.  Useless.
I bought this lap top for windows 10 only for it to tell me the windows code it came with has been blocked theres no contacg seller feature i am really pisssed
pretty slow did not meet expectations prior to the hard drive and the processor. I think Windows 8 has always will be one of the s***tiest operating system
This computer is terrible.  It is extremely slow.  The more I put on it the slower it processes.  I would never buy it again or recommend it to anyone.
I have had the computer for three months and it keeps locking up.  I have to power down and up to reset.  Currently it's inoperable.  Not a good buy.

the description says it has a dvd drive/ cd drive, does not have it, for the price point you get what you paid for, the keyboard is really bad,
It runs a little slow. the false advertisement on the optical disk not being installed when your display picture shows a CD Rom drive.
I absolutely regret the decision to buy this piece of garbage. It is slower than the old computer I bought it to replace. It has a mind of its own when it comes to resizing the screen, reverting to the desktop and crashing, and it generally is just terribly frustrating to do, or attempt to do, anything at al with. $249 of wasted money. (Would have returned it but I cannot find the sales slip from the store where I bought it).<br/>Just pure junk.
Not what I expected poor performance alot of crashes on the first day. Sent it back immediately to amazon for refund.
Brutally slow. Can't even browse the internet. In process of sending it back.<br/><br/>so bad!
Great Job
Very good
I love it
Excellent so far. No bad issues with it. Bought an extended warranty, just in case.
This was an awesome gift for our Grandson's birthday... he was thrilled with it.
Excelent
Bought this laptop this week and returning it.  Will not play DVD's from Redbox. Ripping cd's is 50/50, ripped 4 then stopped working. The keypad/built in mouse is all over the place and keeps zooming in on the screen at just a touch and is too difficult to use.  Save your money!
VERY NICE LEARNING ABOUT THE COMPUTER AND ENJOYING THE TIME ON THE LAPTOP
ok
(:
ok
Alright
Amazing
This is exactly what I needed. I only wish it had a cd drive.
Hard drive crashed. I had to buy a replacement after a week.
LOVE!!
It's a great laptop if I had to do it again I would buy it
If you're looking for a cheap computer for not much more than to take web-cam and browse the web, this is a great simple option. The construction is not durable by any means and it feels like it is empty. It's just a simple laptop at a really good price but something that is worth comparing to the market and taking a look at something like this Toshiba Laptop: http://amzn.to/1GIhAeZ<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Cheap, Very good display, Light weight. Numbers pad, 15.6" display.<br/><br/>Cons: Cheaply built. No dvd, No windows I.D. Tag. Battery can be removed. Keyboard is very loud to type on. Touch pad not very good at getting where you wish to go and such. CPU is slower then I thought it should be
i really like it, it runs really and its beautiful
Very cheap. Rattles on the inside. No DVD/cd drive
Great
Windows software was crippled after one week of use.  Returned it right away.  I am very careful not to download viruses and I do not go to questionable websites either.
Guud
Love it, very easy to use, using it now.
I have been using this computer for about six months. It is very reasonably priced, (cheap), and works very reliably. The screen is good, and videos play quite well on them. The keyboard sucks. But then, I am used to my IBM Model M buckling spring keyboards, the best keyboards ever manufactured.  The feel of these keys, as I type this, is deplorable. But since people use Apple products, they are used to crap keyboards. What is good? Well, the hard drive is sizeable, although it comes pre formatted as a C and D drive, which I hate. No Windows disk is included for reinstalling my own preference of partitions. (None). The worst thing about this computer is that it comes with, yes, you know it, you hate it, Windows 8.  How on earth this piece of junk OS ever made it past the doors of Microsoft is beyond me. It is horrible. If, however, you know nothing about computers, you will never notice.  If you do, forget all about navigating around your system. It is not possible.<br/>That's why I just bought a refurbished HP laptop from Woot. It comes with Windows 7, the best operating system on the planet, in my opinion.<br/>I will be migrating to that laptop when it arrives.  This one? Good for checking email, watching video, (NO DVD however!) I thought I would use an external one, and am, but that solution sucks big time. Takes up space and a USB slot.  Also, have to use a mouse, since the touch pad is notoriously lousy on this computer. I don't like touchpads anyway. That's about it. It is worth $250 but no more, And this keyboard! By the time I finished typing all this, I hate it even more.
This computer is very difficult to use.
Can't get to work..! To  difficult use
Its for my 8 year old Granddaughter.
Just what I had hoped to receive!
Very  easy and self explanatory.
can i connect a printer to this
everything worked out very well
Delivered as was advertised.
Windows 8.1 Is Unusable!<br/>Microsoft Engineers defend the Windows 8.1 Operating system by saying that is faster and has more features.  This a "Copout" and shows that Microsoft has no clue about how bad windows 8.1 is. (Microsoft - You need to fire your programmers, engineers, and managers who think that windows 8.1 is good)!<br/>Windows 8.1 is really unusable and a joke! None of the "Features" that Microsoft claims has made Windows 8.1 "Easier and Faster"!. If you<br/>just go and try to use Microsoft Windows 8.1 you will see that it is almost impossible to use and very user unfriendly! The Windows 8.1 Operating System is a joke! It is unfortunate that most of the new laptops and notebooks come with windows 8.1 installed and it is difficult if not impossible to remove windows 8.1 and revert back to Windows 7. I have returned a few notebooks because they came with windows 8.1 are basically unusable. hollidayp1 150504<br/> Update 7/31/2015<br/>This A SUS 15.6'  Notebook with Windows 8  is still Unusable as of 7/31/2025<br/>I need add that as of Jul 19, 2015, that after trying to use this Computer (Notebook) for more than 6 months that It is still not usable! No matter what you try to do, you are always confronted with some sort of sign-on screen hat asks you for a usename and password! Even after you enter the username and password you may be confronted with a another screen to enter some characters that are not visible! Give me a break! I bought this computer to use it so let me use it and stop forcing me to give you usernames and passwords every time I go to a new page!! hollidayp1 150731 1907pm++
Go price delivered quickly
Good product for the money
This laptop brings to dvd?
NO!  Disc drive for games
great computer good price
It preety good to have
Really, really slow.
Not working properly
I would buy a high end ASUS product any day of the week. But, this computer is a joke. The software license, which now pretty much forces you to get a Microsoft account, is a bit much. Then, it would not connect to my wi-fi. I finally got it to agree that every other component on the network was using the same security key, so it should cooperate. When it did connect it told me the connection was limited. When it lifted the limited restriction it finally loaded a page after more than 1 full minute. Then it told me that the page could not be loaded.<br/><br/>It's not worth the trouble for me to troubleshoot, try upgraded drivers, etc. It's going back after only 1 day.
The title of this product needs to be changed. The computer does not have a Dual-Core processor. The description below seems accurate, but the title was misleading. We only purchased the product because the seller claimed it was Dual-Core, so we were pretty disappointed when we realized this was inaccurate. However, the computer is still a great value for the price. What would really make it better is a disc drive, but fortunately external optical drives aren't too expensive. Overall, a good product.
work perfectly
Simple pefect
Workss great!
The screen when  black after 4 months...
Works great!
Good product
I bought this laptop due to recent financial struggles but if you can afford a different one I highly recommend you do that. This laptop has been nothing but headaches for me since getting it. Constant freezing, terrible cpu makes getting even normally easy tasks done problematic.  Do yourself a favor and get something else. I am considering boycotting Asus products in general.
Excellent..
Very slow  Computer do not buy it
China made picture quality is very bad Dvd door won't open now returning and buying HP only 👎🙏.
Very slow.  I'm not using this laptop for anything but light internet use.  It is painfully slow at times.  Youtube videos often take 30 seconds to respond to a pause command.  Using Google maps is often a problem.<br/><br/>This was supposed to replace a 5 year-old el cheapo laptop, but the old one is probably better at this point.
This is unquestionably the worst laptop I have ever owned. There are simply no redeeming qualities about this latop. The hard drive is slow. The processor is not only dual core but also painfully slow, the graphics chipset can barely handle Windows 8 let alone any Linux distribution, the ram is dreadfully slow. I replaced the stock hard drive with an SSD and the computer was still incredibly slow.<br/><br/>I could see this laptop being decent back in 2003 with Windows XP, maybe. But for 2015? Don't even bother with this one.
Very good
Bought this for my father and he hates it. Says its very slow for a new computer and doesn't have a disc drive! I never would have bought this if I realized there was no damn disc drive. What is the point? Regret this all the way. He says he is going to buy a different computer now.
I brought this laptop and the description giving online was not enough. It didn't mention that it has a built in battery neither does it state it has no CD drawer. This product description online needs to be updated correctly.
exelente
not good
This i s what I would call a disposable computer. The cursor jumps all over the place and the computer will go to other sites on its own, etc. But it does get the job dome, although with a lot of frustration. For about $260.00, you get what you paid for.
This product is horrible. You would think that at least with the basic specs that it has it would run ok but it is incredible slow for some reason. 4 gigs of RAM must not mean anything. Don't recommend purchasing.
This seemed very cool and easy to use at first. Day 4 using it, and it's glitching, wouldn't turn on properly and doesn't load pages correctly. Very dissapointed.
Ive had plenty of laptops. Worst slow machine ever. Maybe not the worst. Just terrible, even for the price. Processor slow, wireless card slow. Asus is supposed to be a very good brand, but this dud I've gotten is my biggest regret this year so far. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra $150 if you have to
Over priced for what it did... between shipping and the product way to much i should have only payed 200. But i nearly payed 300? why not worth.
I like the laptop. I HATE windows 8.1 that it comes with. I liked Windows 7 on my old laptop. Windows 8.1 is too hard to find anything!!
Very Nice Laptop. But SERIOUSLY NO CDROM DRIVE! WHAT LAPTOP THAT DOESN'T COME WITH A CD-ROM Drive!
This computer is very cheaply made it has no CD drive and very complicated to operate.
In the description it states can read & write cds. This laptop came with no cd drive.
This is a slow. Computer its slower than ever you can't do anything on it
Can u play cds and DVDs on this
Didn't have Bluetooth, and DVD drive couldn't play games I want.
Had to return it as it didn't have a CD/DVD slot.
Why would anyone want a laptop that does not have a DVD drive built in? This one does not. Bought this for my grandson and sadly did not notice that it did not have a DVD until we had set it up and using it, so did not return. Would definitely have returned if I had noticed to start with. Also in calling ASUS one cannot be added internally. So had to go with external which is ridiculous to have to carry another piece around. Wipes out the good price as a laptop with a disk drive is stupid and should not be sold. Still wish I could return.
too f..... slower
This laptop does not come with a CD player, I call ASUS customer service and they ask me $49.00 additional to remotely install an program to get the CD player to open????????<br/>This is news to me!
S***ty.
I hit purchase by mistake. this thing is hardly usable. It will hardly gather dust! I called ASUS to find if somehow I could get windows 7 instead of this awful (and I do mean FULL OF AWE) windows 8. I do not like it Sam-I-Am. So far I have purchased an exterior cd/dvd drive, it will not load my older programs, it is however colorful and somewhat pretty. My wife wears it as a necklace.
laptop sucks ass I hate it don't even waste ya money stupid cheep laptop it's slow af and the Web  cam is s*** everything sucks on here I'm returning it..... -_-
Im happy with the product but it took them way too long to send my order!
Save your money and buy a good computer. You get what you pay for.
pathetic; supposedly you get a 500 MB hard drive, but half of it is in use by the operating system. Get a tablet. This thing does nothing.
didnt know that it had no cd player
It is impossible I am returning it.
The computer came damaged, there's no physical damage but the laptop won't turn on, the fan and battery & lightbulb led appears to be working but shows no image, not even BIOS. Don't buy from ASUS, they said the warranty is global which is a lie, I contact them and said «its international but doesn't apply outside US. WT...
Does it have hdmi port
Very good.
I ENJOY THE MUSIC AND THE SELECTIONS OF MOVIES AND TV SHOWS.
